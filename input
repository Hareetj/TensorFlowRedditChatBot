For anyone who is in Florida and was considering donating blood or plasma, come back on Tuesday to your local blood drives since they have already reached the need volume for today. So come back on Tuesday when the next round is needed.
I think the team at Orlando Regional Medical Center deserve some recognition here. My hat goes off to anyone working there during the time this tragic event was occurring, especially the nurses and surgeons. It takes a lot of gut to be able to keep cool and perform your duties on people so frightened, while under the stress of knowing that people have already died as a result of the event. Stay strong everyone.
As someone who witnessed the 26/11 shootings in India, I know what shooting at a crowd in a cramped space feels like. This is the saddest thing I've read today, I stand with with you from Mumbai, lots of love.
Still unable to locate my friend. I've called the hotline set up and had a friend drive to the hamptons inn where family center is set up and they are still not releasing any information at this time. I've called Orlando regional and other hospitals and I get nothing. 
So I imagine that Obama will give a televised speech about this shooting some time today? It would make sense since this shooting is now (unfortunately) historic in its death toll. 
Should we random acts of pizza the blood donation centers?
The shooting at PULSE is devastating. Two of my friend's family members were there and thankfully got out (one of them was shot, but will be ok). If you are in the Orlando area, PLEASE consider donating blood. They are in desperate need of O positive, O negative, and AB plasma blood donors.
My brother was club hopping and was on his way there but stopped to get some food with friends, he was five minutes away before it happened but decided to go home instead. It's so fucking crazy how close some things are to being completely different, i'm so grateful.
My best friend lives right around the corner from Pulse and spent the night hiding in her closet because she was hearing gunfire but didn't know where it was coming from or what was going on. I can't even imagine how terrifying it must have been for everyone there. 
Worst mass shooting in US history
I wonder what the police tactics were on this one? I hear the gunman took hostages and started executing. I'll be so pissed if it's a repeat of Columbine where the police waited outside for hours while those kids were getting executed. 
I live 500 meters from the concert hall called "bataclan" in Paris. So I kind of been there. Lost friends, got friends badly hurt. I have nothing smart to say. This is absolute horror. I stand with you from Paris as you guys were with us when we got hurt. Fuck those murderers. Love will prevail. Damn this is so sad. Sorry for not making sense. 
homophobic shooter?
This story hits so many buttons.Domestic terrorism.Radical Islamic terrorism.Muslim immigrants.Religious attacks on gays.Guns probably legally purchased.Assault rifles.Latino population.Florida gun laws.Another mass shooting.Media spin.Its like every hot button issue of the day rolled into one horrible tragedy.
Did [edited to remove name], that dumb fucking son of a bitch, not understand that this is going to make people at large *more* sympathetic to homosexuals and *less* sympathetic to Muslims? It's not even the horrific, utterly senseless loss of life, it's that even from his perspective, his actions will have the complete opposite effect of what he set out to do in the longer run. He wasn't just an evil fucking idiot, he was an *incompetent* evil fucking idiot. My sympathies go out to everyone affected by such a horrible tragedy. Love yourself and each other.
**LETS STOP TALKING ABOUT r/news, AND START TALKING ABOUT INFORMATION AND THE 50 PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES THIS MORNING.**
It breaks my heart that pride month will always have this bleak reminder of how much more we have to fight for. This was a vile homophobic act by a maniac. My heart goes out to the families and friends of those who were murdered, and everyone involved. I hope they find peace amongst the pain. 
Obama sounded tired, defeated and almost numb to this type of situation. 
This is incredibly sad.  This is the deadliest US mass shooting since Virginia Tech.
If 9/11 happened today, would it be censored by Reddit?
I live about 45 minutes from Orlando and have sooooo many friends who frequent this nightclub.I am praying right now. Not sure if any of them were there during this, but such a horrible moment... 
Hello there r/news
Fuck the mods at /r/news
Not only blood, but these centers need water bottles and snacks as well for the large influx of people donating blood. If you can't donate blood, think about donating food and drinks. 
These medical personnel are definitely deserving of recognition. I just found out my cousin was a victim of the shooting. He's currently in critical condition and has massive abdominal injuries. It's a small comfort to know he's in the care of people who are doing all they can to help. 
When explaining the events of today to my 11 year old I made a point of emphasizing the ratio of good people to the one evil. That many good people; people who care are working very hard to help and care for those hurt.  
this is something I had never even considered and it gives me chills to think about it
I remember reading a similar description after the Paris attacks, I think. It's inevitable in this age of communication ease & social media and it's so sad how many of those calls and messages will never get an answer.
Correct, I believe he will speak at 1:30 eastern time. 
Yes! Not only blood, but these centers need water bottles and snacks as well for the large influx of people donating blood. Random acts of pizza is an amazing thing to do right now if you can't donate blood. 
California Pizza Kitchen was handing out stacks of personal pizzas to people waiting in line at Waterford Lakes when I was waiting to donate.
Donation centers are at capacity for the day, but they're asking everyone to donate as the week goes on. 
sikhs are bro tier
I live right down the street from the club myself, absolutely crazy, I'm glad your friend is safe.
I literally live 300 feet from the club. Went out of town for the weekend to visit my family and woke up to this madness. It's insane.
Holy shit. That's so incredibly fucked up of them. 
I would say he wasn't thinking of the other people.He wanted to keep the shooter away from him.
I feel bad for all the nice people who get tangled up in this shit.
That's so sad...
Please make sure your friend knows that there are *many, many* Americans -- including in places where he might least expect to find them -- who understand that not all Muslims subscribe to the ISIS interpretation of Islam in the same way there are many Christians who do not subscribe to the beliefs of those so-called Christians who would discriminate against the LGBTQ community.  
It's now officially the worst shooting in US history. :(
And I'm hearing about in on /r/AskReddit . Reddit is pathetic now. I used hear about breaking news as soon as it happened. Now my wife is beating me to the punch with her Facebook feed. FUCKING FACEBOOK.  I don't know what the problem is but the admins need to get their shit together, or I'm going to have to find another site to get my news from. 
Fuck terrorism. 
And completely censored on Reddit...
An off-duty officer was working in the club, exchanged gunfire with the suspect when he began shooting on the main floor at approx 2 AM. Two additional officers responded, initiating the hostage-taking and subsequent standoff. 
Unfortunately, it's looks like SWAT waited outside for over 3 hours while he executed everyone inside.  They said it was a hostage situation while people inside were sending out texts that he was rounding up and killing everyone.
News said a police officer opened fire on him as he was going into the club at around 3am, they didn't go in after him until 5am because he had hostages.  Meanwhile accounts are coming out from inside saying during this time he was lining people up killing them anyways.  2 hours wasted while people still being killed.
God that is awful. I'm glad you and your friend are okay. What happened today was terrible, I hope we can one day live in a world where these kinds of tragedies don't occur. I definitely can't relate the kind of fear the victims and their loved ones must have felt, but I hope they can get through this. 
As an American who is appalled by this type of violence, thank you. I am terrible sorry for your lose and about what happened in Paris. 
These are kind words. Heartwarming in times like these. > Damn this is so sad. Sorry for no making sense. It's okay, you're French, so whatever. 
This comment brought tears to my eyes. I'm sorry you had to experience such horrific terror in your lifetime. 
The shooter's father has apparently said that he had become angry after seeing two guys kiss in Miami.  So yeah, seems like he hates gays and this was a hate killing.  
While it's too early to tell, I'd lean towards that was part of their MO last night. 
When I see something I don't like i don't get "murdery".
He was a U.S born citizen wasn't he?
> Decapitation: Leave alone. Do not pick up. That's... morbid. 
These  images are confusing as hell.
These are very hard to read through, I get lost halfway through each page and the graphics are confusing.
Thanks. Fwiw we do have "newsworthy" megathreads here time to time, hence the specific flair and purple coloring in the header. Robin Williams passing was our first "Breaking News" megathread, with Muhammad Ali passing being the most recent. There's also a link in the sidebar allowing you to filter only breaking news stories (along with our other flairs like "Serious" and "Modposts"). 
Hijacking, unsubscribe from r/news
Seriously, I first saw this on Facebook after being on reddit for 30 minutes. That's never happened before.
No joke, that subreddit is a warzone right now...
Yeah, that was nuts.
Yep, nice job on the mods.  
Probably is. How many times has he had to make the same speech during his presidency? Gotta get disheartening 
On r/news? Mos def.
I got banned for mentioning that the shooter is Muslim.
That is a *great* recommendation that I never would have thought of. 
Also thank you to the amazing transfusion service laboratory technologists! 
Always look for the helpers.  - Mr Rogers
Do not forget to unsubscribe.
After what happened this morning, that's not even shocking.
18th time he will have done this during his presidency. Shame. 
Cookies come to mind. And if you're in the area, you can make those! My thoughts go out to everyone impacted by this.
Target donated liked 500 cases of water, and the publix in South Downtown did the same. 
For real. I was talking to a Sikh guy in my area once, and he told me that Sikhs wear turbans and keep small knives (kirpans) as an indicator to those around them that the Sikhs are there to help those in need.
I'm glad you're safe.  Something like this, happening in my own neighborhood... I couldn't even imagine.
Well that was officially the most reluctant upvote I've ever given.
I feel like there really is no "right" thing to do in that situation, especially given the fact that you would be in save my ass mode. I don't how i feel about it, but i can Definately see rationale.
People will say "you can't blame them." But I am totally blaming them. 
It really, really sucks.As someone who has personally lost friends (both muslim and non-muslim) to extremists, to see so many people blame our entire population hurts a lot.
For some reason, that I can't even explain, when I heard that the Orlando Mayor declared a State of Emergency it really sunk in. It's terrible, but you have to give all of the rescue works/police extreme credit. From the things I read the shooter had no plans on letting anyone in the club live. It's something that just makes you feel numb and sad. Thoughts are with all the people affected by this tragedy. 
The mods censored it. This is the first time Ive seen both liberals AND conservatives so pissed about something. Both the liberal subs AND Donald Trumps subs both have the censorship as their top post right now. Not the shooting itself, but how the mods of /r/news censored it. First time Ive ever seen both sides this pissed about the same thing. 
I wouldn't be surprised if r/news loses default status over this. They are censoring discussion of a serious tragedy because of their political views. Though it doesn't matter *why* they're doing it, the fact is that THE default news subreddit is not allowing discussion of the absolutely most newsworthy event right now. I suspect the admins will do something in response.
Bizarre that it can found here in an askreddit thread - unbelievable 
Sadly, we know too well what you're going through. 
I heard that since incidences like Columbine, the strategy is to rush the shooter(s) with SWAT asap rather than playing it out.  
To be fair hindsight is 20-20 and the police might not have had all the info on what was happening on the inside, I'm sure it was very chaotic and they didn't want to charge in and make a mistake
Thanks for your kindness.  we need to stick together. 
Angry about two guys kissing in Miami? You may as well get angry about the sun shining in Miami. What a fucking stupid crazy evil sonofabitch. 
possible my ass
His parents weren't. Media likes controversy, don't forget. Next week is going to be really shitty for me -.-
i love how the character in the graphic is standing there awkwardly like 'so....yeah'
/r/news is currently losing 250 subscribers a minute
 Hijacking endorsed, UNSUB FROM /r/NEWS
My girlfriends parents (Seniors) heard about this before I saw it on Reddit. 
What happened?
Reddit says its the front page of the internet. The fact we have to get info from non news subs makes me question that. This is how you piss off users, both acounted and casusal readers. Makes me think ill go somewhere else for the next big news story. 
CAN SOMEONE GET MOS DEF ON THE PHONE? I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HE MAKES OF ALL THIS
What the fuck is wrong with /r/news and is there anything we can do about that mod on a power trip
Can you recommend any good alternatives? 
Out of the loop and /r/news mods. Mind giving a summary? 
I lived in a commuter town in New Jersey for most of my life.After the 9/11 attacks, there were several cars that stayed in the parking lots at the local train station. Their tires would get more chalk marks every day as the parking attendants noted their time not moving. Tickets would accumulate in the windows. And eventually it became clear that the people who owned those cars weren't ever coming home again. They'd get towed, or claimed by family members or next of kin.Eventually, they'd all gone.And I'm not sure which was worse, seeing them there, or seeing the empty lots after.
It seems as though every time this event comes up on Reddit, I learn of a new thing to bring me to tears, but somehow this did me in worse than anything ever has. The thought of being a firefighter, and knowing what that sound is, standing there and hearing so many of them, and you're totally helpless. I just cannot imagine what that must have felt like. 
As someone who has participated in the planning and tactical side of things, they have to have a plan.  Rushing a building full of civilians and getting in a call of duty style gun battle would make things infinitely  worse. People won't just stay down, you'd have gun fire, people running for cover, running right through the line of fire, the gunman just starts blindly firing, things really go south.  3 hours seems forever, when you armchair qb it, but from initial call, to resolution is an acceptable span of time in my mind. 
On Facebook someone posted a video of a health care worker reading the patients they received through out all of Orlando. Unfortunately my friend Frank is not on that list. My heart is heavy. Thank you Reddit for your kind words. 
It's visible how much he has aged mentally and physically throughout his presidency.
We could always order stuff from Amazon Prime Now for them. Get them what they need.
I dunno how their badass hats are gonna help but the thought is appreciated. 
I'm not even trying to be insensitive. As a gay man, this is terrifying to me. It's going to make me think twice about being open about my orientation to anyone who isn't a very close friend.
According to the edit, the alleyway was already filled with people piling on top of each other to get out a hole in the fence. I'm choosing to believe that guy barricaded the door to save the lives of the people he was witnessing, clamoring to get out of a fence.
Because the guy had gay hysteria?  Holy crap
Unsubbed /r/news . May I request everyone to please do the same and teach those biased mods a lesson. Throw their subreddit into the garbage.
Was reading about this about 2 hours ago, went to do other things, my friend told me the death toll is up to 50 now, went back on reddit to read about it and had to keep scrolling down and down and down...
Russia got a lot of shit for the (likely) carfentanil / remifentanil gas used in the moscow theater hostage crisis of ~~2012~~ 2002. The gas itself was probably responsible for the deaths of many hostages, but a coordinated response team with naltrexone / medics with bag masks, especially in a young, relatively healthy population (not the food / water deprived hostages in the moscow theater), could become a viable strategy, especially if the assumption is going to be that hostages will die anyway.  
FBI seems to be indicating there were ties to terrorism as well, so it may have been a planned attack
"Hey man, I know this looks bad but you'll be fine. You just gotta keep your head up."
Mods started nuking everything once FBI confirmed he was Muslim.
WHERE IS JA?!?
UNSUBSCRIBE FROM /r/news !!
Every other sub. r/askreddit at this point. Why subscribe to something that isn't gonna do its job anyway?
I assume the families didn't have to pay the tickets right?
Can you imagine him being woken up at 4 o'clock this morning and what must have been going through his head. I mean when I get woken up in the middle of the night and it's bad news there's a limited amount of things that I think it might be. But as president of the United States oh my God could be anything.
Amazon should engineer a disaster relief button on their app where organizations like Red Cross and Blood Donation centers can create a wish list for anyone to buy and send to them. 
The turban is worn to show that the person wearing it is a Sikh. So that everyone who see can see that said person is a Skih. 
I'm not sure it was the shooter's intent, but that's literally the definition of terrorism.
They weren't at first. The story was on the front page when it started to come out but as soon as they found out who the shooter was they started censoring the hell out of everything.
they've been doing it for a while with anything to do with radical Islamic terrorism and right side politics in general.  IIRC there is a major conflict of interest with some of the mods.  They might just be trying to reduce the chance of a witch hunt but it sure as hell looks like censorship to me.  
I will unsub from /r/news but are there any better news subs? 
I can see they're actively removing threads for it...
The gas was a good idea but the execution of the whole event was awful. They didn't have enough medication to treat everyone affected by the gas and they let people choke to death unconscious. 
I strongly suspect this is an ISIS-fan terrorism attack. He probably had no actual ties to ISIS, just wanted to do "his part" to ... uhh what is it they want to do? Well killing gay people probably looked like a good way to help the global effort to this guy. 
Well that is a good idea or you would have to rename it r/partiallycensorednews
Actually though, shout out to the /r/askreddit mods because this was a better thread than the ones at /r/news.
Shit, I learned about this shooting from /r/smashbrosWhen the Super Smash Bros subreddit is breaking news before /r/news, something is *seriously* wrong.
We need a new news sub
I'm sure you have to become somewhat desensitized. You see a lot of shit in 8 years as Prez, at this point it's probably a sigh and an audible "fuck"
Well I feel like out of all of the presidents Lincoln had more reason than any to look that way.
I think that Lincoln comparison is more to do with camera quality than his own aging. I mean, he did age but the overexposure and poor focus are clearly doing him some favors in the first image and are nonexistent in the second.
That is actually a genius idea. You should submit it to them. No joke.The only thing about amazon is that it takes a while for delivery. But I'm sure something could be worked out for situations like this. 
If you didn't, I sent off a couple emails to amazon linking your comment with the urging that they at least research the possibility of implementing this. I hope you have as well, I feel we aren't the only people who would help. 
So like a homing beacon of badassitude and honor.For real, whenever shit hits the fan, standing near brown people with cool hats always seems to be the wise choice.
I'm sad to say the death toll in this one is probably not finished. The trauma surgeon at ORMC said he expects to see that number climb throughout the day; many of the victims transported to the hospital were in very critical condition. 
Throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Gays, guns, Muslims, terror, we have pretty much everything contentious topic in this country in one event, of course it's going to be a shit storm. 
I agree 100% r/news is now dead. Worst censorship scandal ever. 
I've seen /r/QualityNews and /r/TrueNews advertised a good bit today, in light of the /r/news *failure*.
He honestly seems really upset every time there is an attack like this. It's something I really admire about him. Especially when he spoke about Sandy Hook, I felt like he was speaking as a father, not just as a president.  
"Honestly, if I were two-faced, would I be showing you this one?"- Abraham Lincoln in response to an accusation by Stephen Douglas 
Yea I can agree with that, the most striking issues though are his hairline being insane and the forehead creases.
I think i will. Prime Now can deliver in 2 hours. Even if some sort of disaster extends that delivery window to much longer, it can still be pretty valuable. Amazon has massive wearhouses full of emergency essentials. This can also help to thwart misuse of funds a little if we are sending the necessary items directly.
Disney World sort of is. They've got an entire land mass bought out, which holds all four parks, security, transportation, emergency response (police/fire/medical), and even water/power facilities. 
I don't understand. Why are the mods censoring? Like, what are they gaining from it? Thanks 
I'm sure Amazon could kick in the accelerated delivery charge if people are buying disaster relief goods from their site... this is a really good idea
apparently he pledged to ISIS just before this. Also, Ramadan just started, and ISIL leaders are proclaiming mega-rewards to anyone who does acts like these during this time. 
My guess is that they delete any comment mentioning Islam. Only a guess, though. Can't imagine any other reason they'd delete so many comments.
How do you claim your ISIS mega-reward when you're dead?

That which is dead for millenia tends to stay dead; only by unholy machinations of a macabre nature could something be resurrected beyond its time.  It was in this way that John Hammond, entrepreneur, dabbler in necromancy, and generally respected man in society sought to play with life and death for personal gain.But that which sleeps beneath the earth yearns only to be surrounded by death.
Nature finds a way, but we are beyond nature.

His ride crashes and they try to help him, but at that point, he's so fragile, he just dissipates in the wind.Also, not technically god, just the first being known to exist.But again, it's been a while, so I might be mis-remembering.

Saruman's point of view is featured in a couple of chapters and you actually kind of agree with him.

Just read Salem's Lot and imagine the vampires want to cuddle
>but it decided to focus on a love triangle instead of the interesting stuff.To be fair, vampire mythology has been done to death in many other series. The idea that a teenage girl would care more about her love life in the midst of a great inter-species conflict is a fun idea, I just think it was executed in the most shallow and boring way possible.
Pratchett taking a go at Le Carre' or Flemming would be interesting.
I've always thought of *Equal Rites* as a kind of gender flipped Harry Potter. The books are more dissimilar than they are similar but the similarities are still there.

As a non-native speaker of the English language who's reading Lovecraft for the first time, in English, I must say that this here reads exactly like his work. I must confess that many times  my brain hurts when I'm reading his tales because of how he uses some words and phrasings that are not very used nowadays.

It kind of is?I mean there's anthologies of authors who will write Sherlock Holmes stories (I'm sure there's other examples I can't think of), and there's the stuff like Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.There's also the stuff where they do re-tellings or base stories/movies on classic literature. So Clueless was loosely based off of Emma, Easy A was The Scarlett Letter, O was Othello.It exists in fan fiction too, but then you need to be able to weed through the shit to find the good stuff.Though, really someone said Stephen King and Twilight, and that would be fucking amazing.

Some people are calling them the Greatest Expectations in history
Nah. They'd be forced to wander the desert to search for something they can't find, and once they find it, they can go home to the promised land. Only to find that what they were searching for is a mystic form of death itself. In doing so, making them quasi immortal because it takes so long to find it and they can't die until they do.
The first third is like that but it gets easier to read further in.

Just so you know, Brian Jaques wrote those food scenes so detailed so that blind kids who were reading the books (through braille or audio book) could get the same amount out of it as non disabled kids, because it focused on tastes and smells and so on.  So the main reason for Jaques and his food obsession is that he loved to help the most vulnerable in society and he was a great man, but now we just make fun of him and he's a meme Brian Jaques is one of if not the best thing out of Liverpool since the Beatles 
Roald Dahl regularly had articles published in Playboy. Few people know because the magazine is better known for its photo journalism.
Stick to the stuff he actually wrote. After a while he got famous enough that he began "collaborating" with other authors. They write the books, using his characters and world building, and Clancy puts his name in big letters on the front of the book. The quality suffered immensely. Try Red Storm Rising to start. It's a stand alone work about war between NATO and the USSR set mostly in the north Atlantic and Europe.

Honestly, the same way as a normal person.I hear the voices of guys and it just sounds attractive to me.Even though i can't "see" them physically mentally i can picture how they look.I wasn't blind until i was age 14, but i realized i was gay when i was 18.( my boyfriend is blind, i just typed this out for him :] )

You ever just smell a food from afar and think to yourself "that must be delicious"?It's like that. Except it's dicks.
I've been blind since birth and extremely gay. You know when you see someone and are attracted to them? It's kind of like that but I can't see.
Wonder how many blind people use reddit.....Wonder how many gay blind people use reddit...
This issue is extremely relevant to me now.
People are attracted to voices, personality, pheromones and physical touch. What kind of bodies do you want to feel? Etc. Sexuality is not strictly visual. But I'm a woman so maybe the male experience is much different
I am typing this for my gay blind friend. He said and I quote **"My cock is so fun to play with, I assume different ones would be too!"**

I'd imagine it's the same way blind straight people know they are straight, or how straight blind people know they are blind.
How do blind people know if they are straight? 
Serious tag would've helped
how are they going to read this
This may be one of the best questions I have ever seen on here OP. Now everyone be weary of the next question that will come from this one. " Deaf gay people of reddit, how did you know you were a man bear pig?" or something like that.
Not blind, but I imagine I would know I was gay because I would find a man's voice sexier than a woman's.  Growing up if I was roughhousing with another boy, it would give me a different feeling than casually touching a girl.  I would imagine I would get to know other guys and have crushes on them , since you don't need to see someone to get to know them through conversation and eventually find their personality attractive.  
Interesting how overwhelmingly responders are focussed only on male homosexuals and not females. Just saying. 
The age old question
I've corresponded with him over email for the past few years. He's a fascinating guy. Very sad story.
> I somehow knew that this was not the way it should be, and never mentioned it to anyone.This ends so abruptly and on such a sad note. Did he learn that there is nothing wrong with being gay? Was he ashamed? I feel like he's saying "so I stayed in the closet and try to act normal". I hope everything worked out. Such a difficult hand to be dealt. 
>My friend was born blind and she is a lesbian.>She is white and is highly attracted to black girls, especially >Beyonce and used to have pictures of her on her wall.Blind people love pictures.
>When I was a senior, some students who I had heard were gay decided to start a discussion group. I wanted to go, but was afraid to ask for directions to where the discussion was taking place, because I did not want others on campus to realize I was gay.Poor fella. I don't know why but that hit me hard.
That's really cool and interesting... and annoying. My brain doesn't know what to do with this information. Whether we're gay or straight seems completely arbitrary and random, very strange.
Now that you mention it, I think a more interesting question is how blind people know they're straight. In the top comment right now there's a quote from a blind man who didn't even know the difference between boys and girls at the age of 15. The only thing you could notice that was different would be their voices! Now days blind kids probably read a lot online, but I imagine it's a difficult way to absorb that information.
I also suggest crossposting to r/blindandgay.
Wow, what's it like finding out he's gay just now?
Love this movie! It was incredibly moving. I watched it the other day and was curious about the experiences of others and if they were able to relate. I probably should have worded the question differently... 
Is there a scene where he touches his classmate's face and realises he's really cute?
Ahh, that takes me back to the golden afternoons of my youth, where, as a just-blossoming maiden, I was enchanted by the smell of dicks floating intoxicatingly on summer breezes.
i'm a boy who likes pussy but when i smell it from afar "that must be delicious" is not what I'm thinking.
You can smell dicks from afar?
Best answer in this thread and nobody will ever see it.
>It's kind of like that but I can't see. Holy shit this guy is fucking blowing my mind.

Are you dating a blind man?
I'm pretty sure it's a cultural trope that most people (men and women, gay and straight) prefer to close their eyes while kissing and turn the lights down (or even off) during sex. We might think we're all about visuals, but actually when it comes down to it, there's a lot more going on that we often don't think about.

No it would have hurt it.  Here's why.  The sample size this pertains to it ridiculously small,  Gay, Blind, and on Reddit I think 5 of them would be a high estimate.  So a serious tag gets a lot less comments and a lot less attention if its this specialized so with a bunch of pricks goofing around you're liable to head toward the front page, where it might be found by one of the five.

Is that how it works? They blow each other's minds?
I mean, I get how they post stuff, but imagine having to start reading a post, not knowing at that point if it's going to be a shitpost.

this makes me think that there is some scofflaw somewhere who is illegally blind.

That's really depressing.  I'm going to make a point to share his story with the "being gay is a choice " crowd. This guy's case is yet another example of where "choosing" to be gay has literally no benefits and leads to a sadder life. No way he "chose" to be gay. Thanks for the response. 
I am sighted, but I met my current boyfriend online through video games. Before I had ever seen a picture of him even, I was very attracted to his voice.

My response will get buried, but I absolutely love hearing about significant others, gay or straight.  I'm a straight male, but love to gossip and chat like a beauty shop girl.

In that, other men, even gay men, seem to make sense and act in understandable ways (albeit very stupid sometimes) - and women don't make a shit of sense.One of the reasons a straight man eventually 'connects' with a woman is because sometimes the ultra-machismo male bullshit of society prevents certain talk with your best male friends. Emotional 'pussy' stuff so to speak. Vulnerability.It's easy to do that with a person who's already seen your dick and bare ass and you nutted on and still likes you. How much lower can you go, ya know.
M'assault. *tips fedora*
That entire string of comments was wonderful.
was thinking the same way when i was reading that......now i imagine a blind person sitting there having a post read to them from a text to speech software and then it gets near the end of a long speech, then in 1998 ......
Fucking /u/_vargas_
In theory there should be an aria-label attribute on the save button for comments. 
Maybe. He also happened to be very stoned, so that may have weighed in.
The gayest of them are the loudest. 
If you've ever played with a pussy, that's fun too. 
I can see perfectly well and I needed this translation, thank you.
Funny story. I was at work a year or so ago and someone made a crack about gay for pay. One of my coworkers made the point that we would all be gay for the right amount of money. I think he posited that a million dollars would do anyone in, and that it sure as hell would work for him.So we started haggling him. Would you have gay sex for 900,000? Of course he said he would. Long story short we found out that he would enthusiastically suck a dick for like 2500.  
i used myself for sex. it was horrible and i think i need counseling. 
Ok, moving on then 
Well I think I know why they are sweaty... 
And who's sweat is on them since ferrets can't sweat.
/r/selffuck.NSFL
RIP your inbox....
No, that can't be it. It must be something in the water.
Nah I just sucked the dick wrong.
And some straight people like dick-shaped objects in their ass too!
What a relief!
goddammit you made me clear my history
The conspiracy theory is Stevie wonder has been playing us for all these years. 
r/redditwritesseinfeld
> He seemed rather surprised when I told him "dude, if you're telling me you're gay, I've known for a long time"I once did this but I got it wrong. Ohhhhh the cringe.
I knew my brother was gay long before he came out to the family.He asked me to get something from his room once, but forgot that he left all his gay porn mags on his bed.  Later he tried to claim that it was for a college class in Human Sexuality, but that was a total lie - they don't make you buy 30+ gay porn mags; if available at all, they'd be viewable in the reading room at no charge.Anyway, it was a shocker to walk in on that, but it certainly explained a lot of things about my brother to teenage me, like why he never had a girlfriend but had plenty of 'guy' friends.
My family had taken bets with each other (of 5 bucks) whether I would come out as Gay or Bi from when I was 5/6. My mum won big when I was bi.
I am a straight male but I get along WAY better with women and gay guys.  My two best friends are gay guys (both of whom I've known since childhood.) Why?  It seems like most of the straight guys I know are always trying to make fun of each other or out-wit each other, crack jokes, or talk about sports.--I don't like small talk, and I'm not into sports very much.  I like deeper, conversation-type questions and...conversations.  I hope that makes sense.  So, unfortunately, it's really, really hard for me to make new friends.
It's honestly the same stuff as what happens in straight relationships but with different pronouns, I've noticed. It's harder to deal with my poly friends, if only because trying to keep all their love interests straight gets a bit confusing after a while. 
You aren't. You're just you.
I tried to stifle a laugh while pooping and hurt my butthole.
You're wonderful! 
Did the blind gay person even know about Undertaker throwing Makind from Hell in a Cell in the first place?
Thank you to leading me to this glorious person. This is like reading poetry written by a particularly raunchy poet.
Do you smell like doritos?
WHY DO YOU SAY THIS!!!
Now I wonder why I'm not into bestiality.
I thought it was a guy sucking a dick. I mean it was what the thread was about, so we were already there.
Reread it, it's actually dark as fuck.
you have reading, comprehension problems 
Weather's nice
Dude. I got you.For people who don't want to click, this is a sub about putting your dick in your own ass. They say it's the best thing ever but it looks really uncomfortable.Apparently the goal is to put your balls in there too, what a world!Also I am triggered and literally shaking because of these shitlords who have big enough dicks that they can *fuck themselves*. Mine doesn't even reach past the gentleman vegetables. 
I think you mean RIP her guy's outbox.
Nah, just sucked the wrong dick.
This joke was so bad you need to frieze all further efforts at humor
use Reddit Is Fun next time lol, it lets you see the link before you go on the website :)
One of my favourite subs
This seems like it would be easy to play off as a joke though. I'm guessing you didn't think of that in the moment though.
I think you missed your target with that quoted word.
Sounds like we *ALL* won... ;)
Thanks man!  I know.  But sometimes I think being torn between two genders is a damn curse when everyone around you is so sure about themselves.
That's pretty interesting and I didn't expect it that fast, but I certainly skim through articles faster than that. Plus skipping to the end to check it it's a shitpost still works better. Also, I can't imagine how horrible continuous spelling errors must sound.
It's not a story a Jedi would tell you. 
I've been duped by Vargas a number of times. Never disappoints.
More like chipotle.
#STOP SAYING THAT!
Can't help you there, ask a Welshman. 
You should probably go play with a few more cocks to be sure. For science. 
Woah.....   omg.....  I'm also too high for this.... but I think I just witnessed an amazing joke....a super mega dark joke
No you have reading. 
I have no interest in clicking, but I'm curious about the logistics. I assuming these guy are tucking their dicks under and between their legs to insert into their butthole. Impressive lengths aside, surely this can't be done when the dick is hard? But if it's soft, how could they possibly get it in? So many questions, so little desire to be scarred for life!
Jesus dude. You start small, you don't bring out the Giant Black Horse Banger the first time you peg a guy. 
Ok I sucked a different dick. The good news is I got my job back. The bad news is now I have a reputation to uphold.
It was a bust.
Depends on if you're normally a dick like that though. I know I am so I could easily do it, but if you never joke?
You're not being torn dawg. You just get to enjoy the best of both worlds 
Now I'm just wondering how many times Microsoft Sam has spoken these words.
It's treason then.
We sure solved that one. This must be what Scooby and the Gang feel like when they rip the monster mask off the villain guy. 
WHAT? I CANT HEAR YOU ABOVE THE SOUND OF ALL THIS SHOUTING.
I feel this is a rare chance to respond to a comment simply because I'm Welsh on Reddit. But in doing so would imply I'm into beastiality....Argh well, I'm replying anyway.I'm here for any questions
Instructions unclear, dick stuck in sheep.
Yeah because even with the small sample size he's technically gay unless he plays with some more dicks. 
That's not all you have to uphold, eh eh?(I'm talking about balls)
Its a marble you could come up with that joke.
I'm in a successful straight relationship of 6 years.  She was the first person I really opened up to about it.  The bonus is, I guess you could say the relationship is "open" and I get to explore who "me" is.I think if I was expected to be either gay or straight and didn't have an understanding partner, I'd go nuts.
Because of how stoned Shaggy always was?
It's said the welsh invented the condom, thousands of years ago, from the intestines of a sheep. Later, an Englishman realized you could remove them from the sheep first!
What's the inside of a sheep feel like? Do they follow you around when you finish? Are they wondering if you'll call?
Well, he's enjoyed 72.72% (repeating oc) of the genetalia he's played with. 12.5% of those he enjoyed were dicks.
Key question: how is the rice going to be prepared? Steamed? Fried? Any seasonings added to it?
Jelly beans.
Beer. Even when that beer is Coconut Curry Hefeweizen and it seems like it would taste good over rice. It definitely does not. ...not that I would know or anything. 
No fucking ice cream over rice...
pumpkin pie
Your typo in the word disgusting is how my four year old son says that word. It makes me laugh.
Can you imagine the people working in the grocery store are thinking with some kid coming in every 15 or so minutes buying more rice and various other items?*There he is again, what the hell?*
Ice.Rice is amazing with almost anything else.
Orange juice.
Did you mean distrusting or disgusting? I need to know to answer the question properly. 
Mac and cheese with rice?
Skittles. 
This is so strange. What made you decide to do this? I really love Reddit at times like these.
Hot dogs and hamburgers (I have a theory that this is actually delicious but never tried it)
Rice crispy
Honey or Maple syrup.
Marshmallows 
Chocolate-covered bacon.
Coca cola 
I read this thread entirely too long
ITT people forgetting the word 'tasty' as well as the word 'food' on occasion 
Damn OP, if you really are eating all this shit you have a lot of cardio to do tomorrow. 
OP: you should take a picture of your "experiments"!
Parmesan cheese, can confirm from experience 
Wait? You can make rice bad?
Tang, or Kool aid powder. 
Can we start a subreddit devoted to this?
Chewing gum.
This is the best thread
Soggy bread
Nothing. Rice is fucking bomb yo.
Sweet bread fried in sheep blood
MRE Do it now.
I do feel like rice goes with nearly everything... umm, maybe strawberry jam?OP, be careful that you don't get sick!
Nothing, rice goes with everything. 
Are you actually trying these?
This thread is hilarious! I just wanted to be part of the Magic by commenting at the end. Thank you, OP. You're delightful! 
Holy shit, this entire thread is amazing.10/10, OP. You get gold.
So are we all in agreement that /u/DO_U_EVN_SPAGHETTI is definitely, completely, absolutely, (un)officially the Best OP Ever? Can we get like a really shitty internet plaque for him or something?
Ice cream, only because as a kid I was often lectured on not being able to have two good things together as in "You wouldn't eat ice cream with rice. That's why you can't have X with Y"
TIL that OP *does* deliver.
Toenails. If not, refried beans
Vanilla Extract.
Are you a dog, OP?
Do Altoids count? 
I have upvoted every single comment in this thread by hand
This is probably the best thread I have seen on reddit in a *long* time. Thank you so much OP for making me laugh my ass off like a psychopath.
I'm so sad I missed this ):This is the shit I love seeing on Reddit. More meta community stuff!

Are all these ratings theoretical? Or are you trying each response yourself?
i didn't realize everybody was teleporting the food to you. 
Pass, rice milk is not my favorite 
How old is the average Redditor, anyway?
Are you claiming to actually be eating these combinations? I don't see how that's possible since most of your comments are only a minute or two apart.
Username delivers
Someone get this man a science.
I've been on Reddit since I was 13 (5 years ago), and to date - you are my favorite OP yet.10/10 A+++++ would upvote again -IGN
dude your freaking hilarious how are you only 14?!?
I love this thread so much!!
*goes to find Nutella and Rice*
You delightful weirdo
I could imagine sticky rice wrapped around a hot dog and lightly fried until the rice is crispy would be quite tasty
Implying that there is a right cereal to be rice-d.
You should make a site doing nothing but this.I know I'd go to it.
> Week old pizza hut leftovers: 9/10If you mark that 9/10, your 5/10 ratings must really taste like shit.
I like you, OP.
Didn't even thank for the suggestion
Is mayonnaise an instrument?Edit; glad to go meta!
Fair enough, genuinely wasn't expecting that.
My favorite machine at the gym is the snack machine
just take a picture with your phone... ??
Thank you for your suggestion.
You could burn the rice considerably. That would make it pretty bad.
I am weird, I used to eat the powdered drinks unmixed. It was a more of a love for the citric acid than anything else. I once got chemical burns on my tongue from eating pure citric acid. 
So like you when you were delivered by UPS! ^^^That's ^^^where ^^^babies ^^^come ^^^from ^^^right?

If it makes any difference Ghost Peppers aren't even the spiciest thing known to man anymore.

I like this one. Definitely the most begrudging "thank you." In your whole post.
Depends on what kind of sauce is in it.
You can't tell me Popeye gets buff from just spinach. That fucker must be on something. 
Consider moving then.
Seems like rice would be a vast improvement.
Then age 4 years, God. The youth today are such slackers!
I can't believe you're 14. You're the coolest 14 year old I've ever seen period. Question: how much money did you spend doing this thread?Also: make a youtube channel for this stuff. Would be amazing.
I love you. 
You're Asian aren't you
No, fuck you. You're getting gold and you're going to fucking like it. 
I try a bit of all of the suggestions I am able to do.
Does that mean I'm not an accident anymore?
Ask the magical fedora.
I'm making and eating all of these over a time span, and then posting about them at the same time.
I always deliver!
Because I was born 14 years ago!
I love you so much.
*Proceeds to eat Nutella before adding rice. No regrets.*
I went to the store so many times so here's pretty much their reactions:First time, oh hey you're buying stuff.Third, oh look its you buying stuff again...Fifth, okay I can tell something is wrong with you.And every time after that they just look at me and I stare them in the eye and say nothing.
What kinda coke are we talking about here?
I like you too (:
He wasn't thankful for it.
But aren't crackel candy bars made with rice?
shhhh, he's trying to b.s. us!!!
You're welcome.Wait.
Of all your responses in this thread, this is my favorite. Thank you for doing this cross-over between an AskReddit and an AMA. Next time, you should do "spaghetti + [blank]". 
>not edibleYou aren't trying enough, OP:   5/10
Lava isn't the hottest thing known to man, but are you going near lava? Didn't think so. 
Four whole months of gold.
You are exactly what many should aspire to be: dedicated, creative, not afraid to get his hands dirty, kind. I'm really glad you exist.
It's kind of a sad and angry way of saying thanks for your useless crap.

I'm coming to your house ASAP.

Jesus christ thank you so much!
Gold over rice.
We want photo evidence OP 
No you're still an accident, but you're our accident :)
I think that means you're no longer an unwanted accident. 
The hilarious thing is that no one even cares if he's lying, the rice has spoken.

Yes, how could he not take pics?Samsung phones even have a camera mode for food pics.
Well, he did add the "smores" bit, so one can assume that smores ice cream is the only flavor he had on hand.
Sure but you can't finish on me, you have to finishover rice

In a weird way, I miss the days when "I don't have a digital camera" and "I don't have a webcam" were excuses that anyone would buy. It made the internet more mysterious.

Seriously, Jesus Christ even if he's not actually doing all these his responses are making me laugh so hard I peed a little. 
RIP.OP.
No sir, you're OP.
Now I really want to know what You said.
You can't tell me what to do!
Are you kidding me? That's almost an instant reply while you are on the frontpage getting flooded.I'm not sure I have ever seen so much potential in a person of your age.By the way, would you know a quick and easy way to count the number replies OP made in his thread? I'm suddenly very curious.
Banned for personal information.
It's been 95 minutes, should I call 911?
Just read through the last of the thread and I've decided that I love you. You are genuinely one of the funniest redditors I have ever had the pleasure to stumble upon. Thank you for making my day good again!!!

My neighbor who is 94 called me last week and said she is terminal and has about 4-8 weeks to live. Super nice lady I have always enjoyed talking to. She asked me to mow her front yard until she dies. I'm happy to help as long as it's one less thing she has to worry about. 
I work at a company that sells snacks. If anyone would like some, just PM me and I can put together something for you. I know its hardly anyones "BUCKET LIST" but hey, maybe someone out there just wants a cookie before they go. 
I have a very rare autoimmune disease called dermatomyositis. It's very similar to Lupus. I'm not terminally ill, but I'll probably have a shorter life than most. I'm not asking for anything but if anyone who has or knowns someone with a similar disease and wants to talk please PM me. :) 
 He doesn't need anything but I wanted to tell you all my dad has liver cancer  and it has metastisized. He still feels good but at his last  Dr appointment they wanted to get him started on paliative care so it's not looking good at all.  He wants to go fishing with his only grandson... but I only had him 3 weeks ago so he's not going to be up for fishing this year. 
Cirrhosis, 28, Apparently have had two versions of Hep C for a very long time, Day to day and I've accepted and don't let it bother me.
Reading all the comments here, wouldn't it be a great if we have a Make-A-Wish Reddit edition for people who are suffering and/or terminally ill?
I have inoperable grade IV  lymphoma and i have been relatively lucky with everything so far. The one thing i would change would have been for my wife to want to stay for the end, that would have been good. It's really hard to explain your situation to someone that doesn't have cancer. I am 32.
What I want more than anything in the world is to get better and live happily ever after with my husband, my kitten, and hopefully children someday. There is a chance I may get better if I find the right specialist and treatment. However, each day of pain I feel the life sucked out of me. I'm hoping to go cage diving with great whites. In October is my 10th anniversary so I'm hoping husband is up for that. I love sharks. I need to go to a few Red Sox baseball games too. 
I could die tomorrow, any one of us could. So how can we help each other today?
Just putting this out there... I am a professional tattoo artist in Scotland. My clients quite often tell me of their "bucket list", and getting the tattoo is definitely on it. If anyone is from Scotland here, and in such a situation, I'd be more than happy to help you out with it. Just drop me a pm or something. 
Made an account just to share this. I have been diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer and have been given 6 months to live. My doctor is pushing chemotherapy but I really don't want to die that way. I haven't told my family yet. My wife wouldn't understand and my father is getting married in a month. I'm going to wait to tell them until I feel the time is right. In the meantime, I have no one to talk to about this. If someone has the time, I'd love someone that I can talk to about this. Getting the stuff off my chest would be absolutely fantastic. 
I'd also love to help but am jaded by scam artists. All I imagine are people conjuring up well crafted fake stories to get free stuff.
Actually, I'm going to go ahead and chime in here, if there's really someone who reads this, please PM me, and I will do whatever is within my power to get you what you need.  I'm in a rough spot and feel the need to give back.  :)  So this thread will be my outlet. 
Also, is it too late to make this a [serious] post?
Is it good that there's no terminally ill people posting here?
My cat has a little under a month to live, and although I don't know exactly what she wants, I've been giving her non stop attention, any food she wants, and a Christmas tree to sit under since that was her favorite.
One thing I've seen people do when it comes to their children is to record messages for them at different stages of their lives. Graduations, driving, maybe a marriage. I've also seen people write out cards and noted for every bday that they will miss. It might be heart breaking, but I know that your kids would love and cherish those cards/videos for their entire lives. Might be something to think about. Maybe even recording a video of a hike, and guiding/showing them the world through your eyes. Something that will stick with them no matter what happens to you. Hope this helps.
I'm gonna keep you in mind!
This is seriously so awesome of you. My dad has cancer and my mom has trouble taking care of him and our big yard. Our neighbors who we rarely talk to have started mowing our yard when they mow theirs. It means so much to just have someone help. Way to go! 
If your dad wants to go on a ride on a coast guard boat. Let me know. I can give you a tour of the harbor if I am not on leave when you show up. 
I honestly and sincerely hope that your father looks nothing like Hemingway and just wants to have one good trolling before he goes.
This is awesome. Stop in at Captain Tony's on Greene St if your dad wants to hang in the actual bar that Papa frequented. It was Sloppy Joes then, but they later moved.
Key West is wonderful. Skip the Irish bar (my wife was the most Irish thing in there) and eat at Blue Heaven instead. But do go to the Hemingway house and pet a 6 toed cat.
where can we send cards to? 
Pm me a name and an address and I'll get something sent from Manchester UK :) 
She may or may not be into this, but I believe there's a /r/randomactsofcards or something like that. People send kind postcards/letters/greeting cards at someone's request. 
I have 2 1972 VW Buses sitting in a warehouse outside Cleveland, OH. One is a green and yellow tin top the other is a yellow Westfalia. They both run, not split widows but still fun enough for a good road trip. Let me know if you are interested.  You can certainly borrow them.
My dad's in the other room, dying of Stage 4 pancreatic cancer right now. You probably already have heard this a billion times, and most likely are already doing it, but please please ***please*** take the time to openly speak to him. Tell him you forgive him for anything you might have ever felt wronged for, tell him you love him for everything he's given you or done for you. Because without it all, good and bad, you wouldn't be where you are today. I love you stranger and hope you can cherish every single second of being with him.
u/unsuitablewoodchuck , this comment needs more upvotes and comments.  Surely we could crowdsource this. u/itsamamaluigi what part of the country/world should everyone look in?
In all seriousness, if you drive through Utah to see the salt lake or salt flats, message me. Family time is important, but expensive. I'd be happy to host you guys for a night or two to save on hotel costs. Those places add up. 
Let me know if you hit the DC area on your road trip.  I have tons of hook ups in the city and can definitely get you some interesting sites to see ;) 
Are you doing anything for you kids to remember you by? Like writing them letters for the future, or making videos of yourself?
I'm not dying, that I know of, and only have had one health issue that's popped up a few times (spontaneous pneumothorax).What you said is spot on though. People go through life like their jobs, possessions, and money are everything.It's what it gets you that matters. Financial security is important, but beyond that, I don't care about my job. Living your life is what matters, however you want to do it.
Hey man, I really needed to hear this today. First thing I'm gonna do tommorow morning is call my mom and tell her how much I love her. Thank you so much for writing out this beautiful message. 
It's 14 that's the MMO. There's a new expansion pack that comes out on the 20th (16th for early access for those that pre-ordered) of this month called Stormblood. There's a bunch of stuff on the cash shop that you can buy for him, too, like emotes, costumes, housing items, etc.Check your PMs for a little something to send your dad.
I could send him an original soundtrack CD I got signed by the game director a few years ago if you think that could make him happy. PM me. 
I just got back into FF14 myself. My headcanon now includes the fact that one of my Bard's Songs is about a Southern Rogue who fought for the people of Eorzea with such ferocity and compassion that Death himself was reluctant to go after him. And if Death did, it was only grudgingly, knowing there'd be one HELL of a battle to do his job. :)
I would love that, but I'm just chronically depressed and anxious. Don't want you to be taken advantage of. 
My sister has this.  She's doing a lot better than when she was first diagnosed but it was rough the first couple of years.  That is very nice of you to offer your support for those struggling with similar diseases. 
Take him anyway, even if the kid is in a carrier.  Let your Dad talk to him and tell him about fishing and show him things.  Record it with your phone and save a copy to your computer and keep it for when the kid gets older. Learning those things from a Grandfather is just absolutely awesome, even if it is years after that time it actually happens.  Also, watching your Dad talk to your kid will be something special for you as well.
I see in your AMA that you might someone to write a musical about you and your stuggle. I'm a composer (not professional). I don't know if I'll be able to write a whole musical, but I could write something maybe.
I really wish I could donate but - I'm gay, so I'm not allowed to. Wish things were different.
Oddly, buried beneath a bunch of "look how huggy we are!" posts.  Does it affect your quality of life?
I assume you've talked with your doctors about the new drugs for Hepatitis C, Harvoni and Sovaldi from Gilead Sciences.  I had to bring it up because, if they haven't discussed it with you, you should ask about it.
I've got a chest freezer and questionable morals, maybe even some dry ice (and a LOT of weed)?  It's not quite what you're looking for, but I'm sure we could rig something up if you can make it here.
Gotta be honest, this post made me realize how uncomfortable I actually feel about my own mortality. I'm right around your age, and to feel the expectation that I won't life longer than another year gives me pause. I could be in your situation at our age. I admire your ability to function with that cloud, because honestly, you might live til 2050, and I might have an aneurysm next week. Peace, blessings and full life to you. 
Your family members aren't liable for your debt once you pass. So stop stressing about it, and make sure they know that so creditors can't pressure them into paying!
My dad died from the same cancer. He had the same conclusion about his bucket list. Just quality time. I flew down to see him once a month in his last 6 months because that's what we both wanted. Nothing fancy, just spending time together. People who knew him knew that about him and funded a big portion of my plane tickets. I'll be grateful forever for that. 
I'm so sorry, let me know if he does need anything and I'll try to help! I'm pretty good at macaroni art and glitter covered cards, so that could be neat.All jokes aside, I'm willing to help if I can :)
The good news is, with early enough detection the survival rate is somewhere around 70% I think for cervical cancer, and the treatments are so much better than they used to be. I am so sorry you are going through this, let me know if there's anything I can do to help.  I've actually been through this before (my didn't spread, but the uncertainty while I waited to find out) so I'm always a PM away.
PM me and I will do you one better. I will introduce you to someone at Disney, working in the Imagineering department. Because dreams are worth pursuing.
This is a great idea! I'll look into the the 501(c)(3) requirements to create one. Anyone know what the best way to be visibility on this is?
I'm right there with you bud. I have permanent back pain. I used to play hockey, rock climb, wakeboard, snowboard...etc... but now I can't do anything anymore. I'm 23 and getting married next month. All I hope for at this moment is that I can bare the pain through the dance with my wife and mom...
> At a certain point that whole "stay positive, you can do it" attitude can really fuck right off.Yeah, I feel you there.  But you got to keep trudging through it because that's life.  Have you looked into more experimental treatments?  The "bleeding edge" of technology?  I am so sorry you are going through this.  I had a friend who had a similar problem and lyrica helped, but now she's addicted to it and can't live without it.  :(  Hugs to you, and let me know if you ever need to talk or vent <3 
You're a fantastic human.  Wishing you all the luck and hope.
I'm a mod at /r/redsox, I'll keep you in mind as sometimes last minute tickets show up on the sub. Do you live close to Fenway for short notice games or would you require some more advanced notice? Weekday vs. weekend games?
That's why you should always dress nicely. You never know when you'll die unexpectedly and be stuck with that as your ghost outfit forever.
This world isn't easy -  It's hard on your own -  We're richer united,  and poorer alone.It's fine to ignore it -  For better or ill -  To scorn it before it  collapses your will.But if you can *fight* it -  Or choose to be *strong* -   Perhaps you can right it,  repairing a wrong.It's plainly apparent -  It's simple to see -  Together,  we'll weather  whatever will be.&nbsp;^^^:) 
+1  This is the way I try and live my life.
Am ill. Send moni. Brother
Don't think that's needed mate, from the comments here I can safely say Reddit isn't that bad.
No, that means we're too late!
Thanks. I've been journalling the past months for each of them and just basically rambling and telling stories. I've thought about the birthday cards idea as well, but haven't done it yet. Great thoughts about the video hike! I'll definitely add that things to do for them!
This was touching, my grandmother is very far gone with dementia right now and I'm glad your neighbour was focusing on a happy memory you gave to her, even if it did get elaborated over time in her mind, you obviously made quite the impact! my grandma is 8+ hours away from me and with a lot of my moms side (who are all wonderful) but I have guilt for not being there as much as I want to due to work that's hard to get away from and life and finances ...I hope she's thinking happy thoughts about me, even if they are made up ! 
Again you go unnoticed.
Totally unrelated to this thread, but I love your username! I'm a huge fan of Dashboard Confessional! Also, that's really sweet of you. My dad passed recently, and he was Coast Guard for years. We want to scatter his ashes from a Coast Guard boat, if that's possible. We think he would have loved that. Thank you for being awesome! 
This is why I love Reddit. 
I'm working on getting that information together. Thank you so much!
Wow, great to see someone from Manchester reaching out considering what you guys have just been through.Props to you my friend! 
We're in Twin Cities area.Thanks for responding! Maybe there's someone near us who'd be willing to share their bus for a few hours. I'm just not sure how to even look for something like that.
So much this. I'm in the same boat, my friend.
"It's ok to die" would be a good epitaph. I could imagine something along "It's ok to die, don't let that prevent you from living" for mine if I decided to be buried (which I wouldn't)
If you drive through Arizona, I'm in Tucson and would also be happy to host. I have one cat. 
Me too. could we set up a crowd funding page for you, if you don't have one already or if anyone else has done so?
Omg. I dont know you or the OP but your offer just made me cry. That is so incredibly kind of you.
> and only have had one health issue that's popped up a few times (spontaneous pneumothorax).Imma guess you're a tall thin male?
You are an awesome person. Thank you. I already bought that expansion for him as a Father's Day gift, but thank you for the suggestion!
No, please keep it! He won't be able to keep it for long, so it's better kept by you. THANK YOU for the offer, though 
wow it sounds like she's really living with a lot. Your happiness is just as important as hers so if you two are happy today I wouldn't stress so much about the distant future. Like you said, who knows what could happen?! And adoption is always an option if you want a family. Who knows, there could be a medical breakthrough/ better treatments in the future. Stay strong!
Totally agree...i missed an opportunity for my son to meet his great grandmother before she died. Even if he never remembers it, having a picture or video of that fishing trip would be priceless.
I was in 3d animation and design for a long time. Wanna do a video together? I'll handle the visual aspect.
Nope, nothing really, just letting it happen, listed as an organ donar so hopefully something good comes out of it.
I hate to sound stupid, but what gets transplanted for this? I've never heard of it.
Nah, just the whole if i wanna end on my terms or not and how in the back of the head.
My mom had hep c for most of her life and was getting bad cirrhosis. She got approved after trying for a long time to get Harvoni, she went through it and is since completely clear of hep c and her liver is going back to normal. If you can get your insurance to approve it, it really does work.
Work as a pharm tech. Filled Harvoni once.... $33,000 a bottle of I think 28 tablets.
Depending on the country, that may or may not be true. 
My Uncle died of the same cancer as well. My mother was in denial so my wife and I pushed her hard to go out there as much as possible. He lived five months from diagnosis and she ended up being there when he passed. All things considered that was a good last five months where they focused on being together as a family.
Most good doctors look at the risks vs reward. If it's a 99% chance that the patient will be in a wheelchair peeing in a bag to leek an extra 3 years out of their life then you would much rather take the next 1 year and get lucky. Also make sure that it is the patients decision to go along with the surgery and it is not the pressure of the family or the family overruns the patients decision. So live with what you have but extra days does not always equal/ determine more enjoyment/ happiness. 
> He was originally randomized into the placebo group of a trial for treatment. She tells me the treatment worked so well, they had to switch everbody over from the placebo group to the treatment group.That is amazing.We hear about the cure for AIDS every month on the front page, but has this made the front page yet?
I know where to get a 2,000 lbs crate of dry macaroni. (Seriously, they're huge) 
Thank you, I appreciate it! I'm more scared for my kids if anything, you know? I don't want them to be scared or worried. They are all under 6, so I obviously haven't told them. I left work for the pregnancy, and now this. Times are tough.If you don't mind me asking, what did you have done to get rid of it? 
Fucking Reddit. I like this place.
Great idea, but I can't seem to find a valid file there, without installing extra extensions and add-ons that I don't care to install. Thanks for the idea though!
How'd you end up with the permanent pain?
Appreciate it :).I tried lyrica, along with pretty much everything else. Sadly I get the same effect: nothing. I don't know why but drugs in general don't seem to work on me, I always feel the same as before.This unfortunately extends to painkillers as well. I have oxy and stuff (prescribed) but even that doesn't really worK well enough to bother and simply increasing the dosage won't ever end well.
I've never been so early to a sprog comment. But, fuck man, that was beautiful. You're seriously talented.
 "'And what would humans be without love?' RARE, said Death."
Not this time. We are talking about it via PM. It should happen when they come down. I'll keep you posted. 
Once you have it send me a pm as well.  Also if they have any particular interests.
You forgot to pay the tax of one picture of your cat.
Interested as well. Japan is a great place.
That's very sweet, but don't shed a tear on my behalf. Ive spent a lot of time and money on vapid, selfish arrogance and complete disregard for the feelings of others.Im just trying to put a dent in my innumerable sins.
Not OP, but also had a spontaneous pneumothorax and yep! Tall thin male.
I don't remember where I first heard/saw this, but I never saw a gravestone that read "John Smith, A beloved, hard working employee"...
I'm an FFXIV player too. I'd be willing to get him a little something for in-game. Do you know his character's name and server?
My paternal grandfather was dying in the same hospital I was born in, and my mom told me when I was younger, that my dad grabbed teeny-brand-new me, ignored all the nurses, and brought me to see his father for one visit before he passed on. My dad's a whacko, but I'm glad he did that.
We definitely could
As a 15+ gallon whole blood donor, I heartily endorse all your advice!
Wouldn't having hep make you nonviable as a donor?
Liver, I believe.
I have had hep c and b since I was 18. I'm over 60 now.  Main thing is avoid alcohol.  Also avoid rough sports where you could get struck where your liver is.  Don't dwell on it and try to lead a normal life. The doctors told me I would die of cirhossis or liver cancer. Jokes on them,  I'm dying from lung cancer. Just take it one day at a time and remember,  everybody dies,  and doctors are not always right.  Good luck. .
I finished a 3 month course of Harvoni recently, my stepfather is Egyptian and managed to source it for me from Egypt. It was $600 total. It breaks my heart and saddens me that such an amazing cure is so inaccessible here when it's so cheap everywhere else. 
This is what I am terrified of.  There is no happily ever after with this tumor.  The outcome scares me to death and I don't want to think of a life without him, but know that is reality.  I am so sorry for everyone's losses.  Cancer sucks, but Glioblastoma is a horrific asshole that never goes away (sort of like my ex-husband).
My wife and I work in a hospital, I wish more people understood this simple logic. Don't prolong someone's life for your own selfish desires. 
...Where is this pasta heaven and do they have take out
I have no cervix now.  They cut it all out because it didn't spread, and then I took some pill form of chemo just to make sure.  It was super easy, but like I said, the waiting for the results was the WORST.  :(  Also, I don't have kids, so between that and my missing ovary due to another medical issue, I'll probably never have them, so that sucks too.And yes - telling the kids definitely requires something more definitive. :)  
> Fucking Reddit. I ~~like~~ *love* this place.FTFY
Thanks for the info. You have some knowledge in this area? Right now I am brainstorming ways how the non-profit would work generally (ex. funding, making sure the story is true, logistics of making a wish happen, visibility, how to build a sustainable foundation, etc)
Hi! I'm from Delaware!
Took a bad fall while snowboarding. Apparently my joints in my back are permanently inflamed.
Serious, have you tried weed? (At least for temporary relief). I know someone who has fibromyalgia and they get relief from it.
I'm pretty sure he's never written a comment in non-poem form. Hold on I'll ask him. OH great almighty Mr. /u/Poem_for_your_sprogHave you ever written a comment in non poem form all along?
Take your upvote!
I'm in the SF Bay Area. I have a 1969 VW Bus. It has a new engine, but it is just a shell, no interior other than a driver & passenger seat. How can I help?
at this point the thread, I am suspending disbelief
I'll ask him. It's SouthernRogue, I'm pretty sure, but I will double check!
Very good. PM me, we'll trade details. Let's talk to him and see what he has in mind. Shouldn't be too hard.
You too friend, how bad are the lungs?
Holy crap that's an insane difference. Unless there's an under-supply, they really do just want to juice out the money. 
Never though of it like that. I guess that's why euthanasia is such a difficult subject when we put our own feelings and beliefs over the person who needs help. Thanks for this comment, puts things into perspective. 
It depends, can you carry a ton of macaroni?  
I'm sorry about that :( there is always adoption, or other options, if you decide having a child is right for you and your future :)How was the process and recovery of them cutting it out?
Yup - I have tons of knowledge in this area. :)  If you want you can PM me and we can talk about it.  I probably don't have time to handle the day to day but I can definitely help with paperwork, process, and technology side :)  Almost like a board member :-P
dela where?
I think it's crazy that opiates/oxy has no effect, on him. Like, if you upped the dosage enough, it'll numb it all but possibly get you so high you wouldn't like it. If those don't work, would weed really be strong enough?
The one time upboat makes sense and we blew it.
I always love to see older gentlemen/woman enjoying Video games!I'll login tonight and see about sending him something.
SUPER easy.  I mean, it's not the most pleasant when it's occurring, but I was walking the next day like nothing had happened.  You have to wear pads though, and no tampons or anything for a while.   :)  Overall I'd say it's one of the easiest (but grossest because of the whole pad thing) medical procedures available.  
Goddamn it. 
You are too awesome!! I'll confirm his name! 
I'm a member on bethematch.org and curious how they notified you?
That makes me feel a lot better. So they kept you awake through it? I'm a wuss when it comes to pain and procedures. 
again, it went unnoticed.
Oh you can't miss it lol, I got multiple emails, texts, letters, and phone calls, even other members of my family got phone calls asking to get in touch with me. If they manage to match you they'll make sure they find you one way or another.  
Not this time.
I honestly can't believe it, how is it possible that virtually every model was so wrong? 2016 has been quite a year
I feel like I'm living in a future GCSE history exam question.  'In 2016, the UK voted to leave the EU,and Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. Discuss.'
I like to believe that the silver lining in this is that both parties will see how broken they are and make some changes, leading to future candidates that are actually likeable, trustworthy, and honest people. A girl can dream, right?
My favorite part about watching this victory speech is watching Trump JR try to stay awake
It feels like I'm watching a South Park episode unfold before my very eyes
Somewhere John Oliver is choking on a Jaffa Cake
So this is the outcome of the Berenstain timeline.
God dammit cubs, last time you won you brought the Ottoman empire down, now you go and do this. 
Dormammu I've come to bargain 
Man, I'm still pretty shocked.2016 will be a memorable year.
Man, 2016 has been a weird year. I don't think anyone would have guessed that Donald Trump of all people would be the US president.
This will ruin so many Thanksgiving dinners.
"Donald Trump Beats Woman to Take Black Man's Job."
Can you imagine if someone had been in a coma for like 6 months and woke up to find out that the Cubs have won the World Series and Donald Trump is the new President-Elect of the United States?
No. Way.It actually happened. 
Fingers crossed Trump is just the biggest troll in America and ends up becoming the greatest president we've ever had. *please* 
I don't ever want to be told I need experience for a job ever again. 
Must be the one of the most embarrassing defeats in political history for Clinton.
The Simpsons joke came true...
YouTube comments represent this country more accurately than I thought.
I have only seen one or two Trump supporters on my facebook feed until today. Now just about every post is thanking God Trump won. It is shocking how many supporters were in hiding.
More afraid that both the Senate and House are majority Republican along with the president than just Trump being elected president. 
2016 does seem to be the year, right or wrong, that people said 'no' to the establishment. An uncertain and risky future maybe. Well, Americans wanted to know what Brexit felt like.
Trump caused the GOP establishment to implode and for whatever reason the establishment Democrats thought it was a good idea to double down on business as usual instead of taking the progressive agenda seriously. No presidency, no Senate, no House. Good fucking job.
Can we go to JaRule to get his thoughts on the election? 
Chapter 34: How America Meme'd a Man Into office 
As a Canadian in Mexico right now, I'm frightened. I have to get back over 2 walls.
Breaking news : jokes about Trump being president not funny anymore
Are we in a Black Mirror episode about how being presumptuous with major decisions can backfire horribly if not taken seriously?
Imagine when interdimensional travel become possible..."Hey what dimension are you from?""F-402, Where Trump wins presidency in 2016"And the whole room goes silent. 
11,000 people voted for a dead fucking gorilla.
HOLY SHIT. DOES THIS MEAN THE 2020 ELECTION....WILL BE **Donald Trump VS Kanye West**?!What....the actual fuck.....Battle of the memes.
Celebrities, Reddit and other social media were so vocal about their support for Hillary that I actually thought she was going to win.Looks like conservatives are just quiet.We got M. Night Shamalangadingdonged.
We have Hoverboards, The Cubs won the World Series and now Biff Tannen is going to run the country.  Back to the Future ll was a goddamn documentary!
People are talking about Trump and I'm just here worried about Vice President MIKE PENCE. He's the real threat in my opinion..
Brexit 2: American Boogaloo
Trump won as the anti-establishment candidate. If only the Dems could have nominated an anti-establishment candidate... Oh wait.
What ever happened to that Bernie Sanders guy?
Kanye 2020 seems entirely possible now
Biff tannen just became president.
BARRY, YOU HAVE TO SAVE THE TIMELINE. GO BACK. PLEASE, BARRY. 
Random tip: go out and buy some newspapers today. Your grandchildren will be able to sell these headlines for a nice amount of money if you preserve them well.
I like how all of a sudden, /r/conspiracy acts like they never said the system was rigged. Fucking lol.
Did we just Brexit? 
I'm really worried about the environment....
First 9/11 and now 11/9.. These numbers aren't good for America. 
Just posting here coz noone will notice but I'm gay and I had to tell someone eventually
I have a very low opinion of the man and very little belief that this his winning will be good for the country but I'd love to be surprised.
>Grandpa, what was 2016 like?A fucking dumpster fire of a year kid.
Canadian female here. Anyone want a free green card?
"Brexit totally can't happen!"*One election later..***Brexit happens.**"No way will the people of USA elect Trump as POTUS!"*One election later..***Trump is POTUS.**I think it's our collective moral responsibility to now use the power of 2016 to get GRRM release his next book.Let's all think: "GRRM totally will not finish his books before the end of the year!"And by law of 2016, we'll get The Winds of Winter by the year's end.Then let's do it for another season of Firefly.
what about cubs?
There are already a bunch of articles about this exact topic. From what I gather from a few of them, pollsters were thrown off by the voters who didn't want to admit they supported Trump (being called "Shy Trump" voters), and by the rural white folks who tend not to respond to pollsters' calls but turned out in huge numbers in this election. I'm sure that this election will bring about a change in the pollster profession. Most of them got schooled yesterday. 
'Well there was this cartoon frog on the Internet...'
Well most presidents never get to follow through with most of the things they promised. Let's hope this is also the case.Oh fuck, I forgot republicans got the Senate and house. 
I'm surprised no one else really commented on this. He was really struggling at the end. I got the impression he really needed to go to the toilet too. 
I thought so too. But then I remembered that it was nearly 3am. Gotta give a kid that young some slack. He probably wanted nothing more than to just go to bed.
He's gonna have to drink so much Bud Light Lime...
Don't forget Colbert as well
Can't wait for the next episode of LWT
Let's hope the Berenstein one did better...
I'm still remembering Berenstein.
Cubs are evil, we must burn them. 
What scares me the most is his opinion on climate change. That's something that really affect every single one of us. He can fuck up his own country as much as he likes, in my opinion. They voted for him, after all. But he could do critical damage to the progress we've already made and throw us back years, even decades.
Dormammu I've come to bargain
2016 is the Florida of years. 
If you told someone this would happen back in 2012, they would have thought you're insane.
>Cavaliers win NBA Finals>Cubs win World Series>A twitter meme wins the Presidency>Pope Francis and Patriach Kirill come together for the first time in a millennia>Controversial Rio OlympicsWhat a year. I'm sure I missed some. 
At least weed is legal in CA now...
Back to the future called it.  Also the World Series winning Chicago Cubs.
Back to coma
Moral: No lead is safe.- Warriors blow 3-1 lead to lose NBA championship- Indians blow 3-1 lead to lose MLB World Series- Hillary blows 4 point lead in polls to lose Presidential ElectionAlthough, one of these is not like the others...
I know right? I can't fucking believe it.Trump actually won. Trump will be our president. President Trump.This is the most... interesting? News I've ever read while taking a dump.The next few South Park episodes should be pretty interesting.
Given he's flipped flopped on TONS of social and political topics in the last few years, it's entirely possible. 
And that he doesn't die. Pence is worse than him. 
"I'm sorry, but you need ten years experience for this job starting out at minimum pay."Fuck you, Trump is president despite never holding office in any other sense of the word. I can sit at this computer for eight hours just fine.
I've never seen a more resounding "We don't like you". 
Oh she's done. for good. You cant come back from this kind of loss, ever. Kerry was the laughingstock of the democratic party, and he only lost George W.
The Simpsons are always right
It's not shocking at all to me.  As a bartender, there have been many a group discussion on politics while CNN played on the TVs.  Everyone would murmur how "both candidates suck" and how we're screwed.However, once the crowds cleared and there was nothing left but one-on-one conversation with the guests and I, their pro-Trump colors would show.
Ja? Ja?? Where is Ja!?!
You need a wife? I'm Spanish/Mexican and I can make some bomb tacos!
20+ years, hundreds of millions of dollars, all her political favors and influence, all leading up to a campaign where she was predicted to win easily, just to get annihilated?  I would image it will take her a while to regain enough composure to hide her anger and disappointment long enough to make a public appearance.
Yeap. She conceded over the phone. 
probably fleeing the country
It's actually funnier now for the rest of the world. 
Is this true? Source? 
I would like to reset the time line please....
That's the scary part to me too. Even if something were to happen and Trump were to step down, we would have *Pence,* who supports gay conversion therapy, very not pro choice, pro religion in government, etc. Trump is dangerous, but he seems to mostly want the title and the power to me, while Pence knows what he wants to do.
What I could only ever see as a joke has now become a reality. I feel like I'm being trolled by the entire American population. 
Hopefully that becomes a trend that continues. I didn't vote for him but I hope he does a good job.
I know right.  Maybe hes actually some kind of super intelligent savant who was just playing the fool all these years
Clinton campaign made the party stonewall him out of the nomination
Trump vs Kanye in 2020Like seriously what the actual fuck
Please, stop now before it becomes real. This started as a joke too.
And the best part is that it's 9/11 for most of the world.
Day before inauguration is 1/19...
I do, but I'm also female. Is that okay?
Lol you wild Wyd?
We joke, but the Internet had a huge impact on this campaign. It gave Trump a platform by which he turned from a laughing stock to a legitimate contender. "Discuss the influence of Internet memes in the politics of 2016" could definitely be a history question in a few decades. 
And he gets to break the tie in the supreme court in his favor.  There are effectively zero checks on his power at this point.
I don't think I heard anything Trump said. It was just hilarious watching his head bob up and down and him snap back awake lol
Yeah I realized that as well but it was still funny to see lol. He did well because we all know at his age he was also bored to death.
An East coast state got recreational weed, a southern state got full medical, AND WE GET THR MULTI MILLION DOLLAR ONLY ONE COPY EVER WUTANG ALBUM?this is not a half bad consolation prize
Has he done it for the primary bet?
Don't forget literally the whole entertainment industry

Trump said he was going to end all federal green energy initiatives. What kind of example is that?America just fucked the world.

Buckle-up buckaroos.
This whole fucking *year* has been Poe's Law incarnate.
What's Poe's Law?
Pence is insurance against assassination.
Thats what should be taken away from this. This was the democrats election to lose, all they had to do was put up fucking anyone else. Just some bland everyman or woman. But nope. They wanted a Clinton. 
Kerry became Secretary of State after his loss. Not bad. 
Because people don't want to be made fun of for supporting something 
I'm taking applications, in other words let's see about those tacos!
Texting Snowden about that spare room 
I like how Florida voted for trump and weed it's like they know they are gonna need some serious help relaxing in the coming years
It was on twitter, they said about 11,000 people wrote Harambe in, sounds like a lot but America does have 300 million people. I'm sure there are a lot of other goofy write ins
This episode of Black Mirror is a little too weird for me. 
Exactly, I didn't vote for him either, but his tone and the content of his message make me hopeful. He mentioned he wanted to bring all Americans together and hopefully he will actually work toward that and not disappoint us. 
Stage 3: Bargaining
Yeah, and it also happens to be 9/11/16.
19+1+1+1+1=23!
The Dems can filibuster everything for four years. That's really their only gambit.The alternative is to let them run the country undivided and see what happens. The downside for them is that 2018, which would ordinarily be a great year for them, does not have a favorable electoral map since they have to defend a lot of purple seats Obama won in 2012.
Hahaha, I was looking at this the whole time too! Feel really bad for Baron and Melania, being a political family took them by surprise.There was one point where he scrunched his whole face up because he was holding in a yawn!
Also got self-assisted suicide in CO, don't forget about that. 
It's not all bad.  The entertainment industry just got 4 years worth of easy material to work with :)
Dormanmu I've come to bargain
Hell, earlier today I really couldn't fathom it.
Even yesterday it did being perfectly honest...
And Massachusetts 
* Trump gets reelected.
With the first ever unanimous MVP. 
Bowie dead, Cubs win World Series, Donald Trump is honest to god president. This is a satire's idea of the future.
I don't think anyone *Wanted* her, she just refused to let anyone else take her potential presidency.
Maybe Hillary Clinton can try her hand at Secreta -- oh wait.
And 4 years ago the GOP was having an autopsy because it was doomed due to demographics. 
If we're going by stereotypes, I can also clean the hell out of a house so there's that. 
Florida, Arkansas, and North Dakota are all red states that voted for marijuana decriminaliztion but only for medical reasons. Only blue states voted for recreational marijuana. 
I can understand this in other countries where voting is mandatory, and people who don't want to vote are forced to. But actually going out of your way to go out, line up on a Tuesday evening and vote for a dead gorilla is some next level shitposting. 
Pro wrestler Matt Hardy got thousands of votes too lol 
When he brought up Hillary, I was expecting bashing. Was pleasantly surprised and I sincerely hope he keeps that kind of tone in his presidency..
I'm pretty sure 19+1+1+1+1 is less than 25852016738884976640000.
To be honest I think it took most of america by surprise. I'm really curious how the rest of the world that is on reddit will react to this.

On the other side, House of Cards and South Park are fucked.
Dormammu I've come to bargain
I still fucking cant
Just end me then.
Sometime last year we seem to have switched into a parallel universe
Uhh the DNC sure as shit wanted her
If only she would have refused a little harder and maybe, idk, campaign in places like Wisconsin.
Eh it's a vote of no confidence. I feel like it's saying I don't like anybody or I am not informed enough to vote so here's my vote anyway that I support the process but I don't believe I'm  being represented here.
I need a source on this please! My buddy was a huge Matt Hardy fan but doesn't watch anymore. He would love to see this.
Agreed, by all measures, that was a decent speech and a good starting tone hoping he can drop the 'crazy' act and act like a business mogul that is now fucking president of the U.S
If he proves that to be true, I will happily eat the "anyone but Trump" hat I have been wearing.
Dormammu I've come to bargain
Right? Sanders was cheated out of the damn primary because the DNC definitely wanted Clinton.
I live in Wisconsin and I know multiple people that flipped from Hillary to Bernie because her lack of campaigning. Bernie had 3 rallies at my campus and Hillary had one private speech. They also did not end up voting for her today either
It's up to Americans to hold him to his good promises (term limits, dropping TPP, finance regulation etc) and make him drop his bad ones (wall, Muslim ban, immigrant roundup, global warming denial etc).
RemindMe! 4 Years

Global warming denial is probably his worst 'promise', especially as he considers it a Chinese Hoax.

Finally someone asking the important questions
I just want to know what every girl wants to know; is Pascal single??
I think this is a sex joke. Pascal's law or the principle of transmission of fluid-pressure (also Pascal's Principle) is a principle in fluid mechanics that states that a pressure change occurring anywhere in a confined incompressible fluid is transmitted throughout the fluid such that the same change occurs everywhere. -googleI think he's asking if you can feel the change of pressure inside your vagina when penetrated.
When it comes to open channels, keep a girl's Froude number <1 so their flow doesn't make them supercritical.

Shitposters, when other people aren't around, how much effort do you put into coming up with original ideas for threads?
As a guy, I feel left out in this discussion :(

Don't know that anyone will see this, but my name actually is Pascal (I'm American, not French) This whole thread is hilarious to read. You can address all your questions on Pascals to me. 
My fluid dynamics professor used to ask questions like this followed by "...and explain it in terms your girlfriend would understand."  I was one of 3 women in the class and was slightly annoyed by his misogynistic attitude.  One day he asked the guy next to me to explain a concept.  The student was stumbling over the answer, so I grabbed his hand, held it up to his face and said, "No, Frank.  Explain it to your girlfriend."The professor never used that phrase again.

My organic final is in two days and I *barely* understand E1 and E2. I'm so fucked it's not even funny.
Just took my ochem final a few days ago... What about those exceptions though?Just to name a few common ones:tertiary alkyl halide --> (KOH,EtOH) --> mainly E2 (and not E1/SN1)2 benzyl groups stabilize secondary carbocations, so they undergo more SN1 instead of SN2Also, on a quick note, SN2 has inversion, whereas SN1 produces a racemic mixtureOchem is hard...Good luck!
Nope, not sharing my Dynamics homework, either.
Found the virgin
I suspect vagina juice is at least mostly incompressible 
This is science, you've got to do stuff like imagine a perfectly spherical, frictionless vagina, in a total vacuum. Then you can do science at it properly.
People are mostly full of fluid
Air is a fluid
Not when you specify one gender. Then it's going to be sexual.

I was just hoping you might give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the southern colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War, the economic modalities, especially in the southern colonies, could be most aptly described as agrarian pre-capitalist.

Okay, so this is very incomplete but you're in an emergency situation.  E1 is going to happen when you have sulfuric acid catalyzed elimination and E2 is going to happen when you have base catalyzed elimination.If you have any questions feel free to PM, I tutor organic chemistry all the time.
If you don't understand elimination mechanisms, things are gonna get brutal in the coming months. 
Jesus I already took my ochem final!
Already passed the class, friend.
So I want to check if that is true. I need a degent sample size, so if there's any girls out there willing to contribute that would be great.

Of course that's your contention. You're a first-year grad student; you just got finished reading some Marxian historian, Pete Garrison probably. You're gonna be convinced of that 'till next month when you get to James Lemon. Then you're going to be talking about how the economies of Virginia and Pennsylvania were entrepreneurial and capitalist way back in 1740. That's gonna last until next year; you're gonna be in here regurgitating Gordon Wood, talkin' about, you know, the pre-revolutionary utopia and the capital-forming effects of military mobilization.

I've always been kind of curious what the fuck that guy does with his hydraulic press when he's actually working....probably something super mundane like pressing bearings into fittings while he studies English (looks up from book, slides the next work piece into place).

"Reddit users admitting to using reddit rather than studying for his finals, desperately begs reddit for help."
Hmm, I like it.
Just started working at escape the room and we have rules about not jumping out the windows and not sticking keys into wall sockets because it has all happened before.
At our establishment we have a room called "Jailbreak" with a fake door towards the very end (it's covered with plywood). this girl takes one look at it and says "jail...break...." and charges the door full force and breaks through. 
Someone cleared all the boxes and locks off of a table in the corner, laid down on it, and went to sleep until the group escaped.
We give people a box for them to bring in, so they can store their belongings while they play. One time, about halfway in, an inquisitive older man started going through their own stuff. He pulled out a purse and shouts guys "guys, I found some... this is our stuff isn't it" It was hilarious. 
It was only a one-off escape room I designed for a university society event, but one guy was so desperate to find clues he tried to disassemble the wooden casing around a radiator. It scared me because I didn't own the room we were doing this in, so I could have been on serious trouble.
Did a space stationed themed room. We got paired with a mother and her adult sons. The sons did just fine but mom was clueless. There was a prop fire extinguisher on the wall that she was CERTAIN had to be for something. For an hour she wandered around aimlessly carrying a fire extinguisher. 
The guy gave some rules to us when we were doing the room. The first rule he gave us was "Please keep your clothes on."
Obligatory not an employee, but I'm sure my friend group looked pretty weird to them. We did the one where you get stuck in handcuffs and have to unlock them, but we couldn't get the key to work on one of my friends. We assumed that there was another key to get the last person, for some reason, and left her attached to the wall for like twenty minutes. Turns out her cuffs were broken and we had to pause the game so the employees could come get her out with bolt cutters. They were shocked that we'd just left her there but we thought it was part of it!
One time I did an escape room with some people from work. The final clue was "what time does Bible Study meet?" and a 4 digit combo lock. After we couldn't find any useful clues I just went over to the lock and put in 0600, 0615, etc. It opened at 0700. Apparently we were supposed to look out the window to where the church across the street had their schedule printed on a big sign. According to the attendant nobody had ever tried that before.
Actual escape room employee here.One couple couldn't agree on how to solve the puzzles and broke up inside the room.Another couple had the guy surprise the girl with a proposal. Another couple got a horror- themed escape room and just sat on the floor and cuddled. They didn't look scared. They didn't bother to solve anything either. They just cuddled with all the creepy props and sound effects surrounding them. I guess they couldn't find a creepy motel to cuddle in...?
I currently work at an escape roomWe had a youth group come in and play some rooms and halfway in we smell this horrendous smell (our control room is right next to the room)When we got them out we noticed they built a little tent and inside was two giant mounds of shit. Kid took a shit in the room, and we approached the adults and said "oh that wasn't us we thought you put that in there." So they denied it, even though the kid had brown stains down the back of his pants.Our owners called, they confessed and we deep cleaned the room while they got charged for it.Great times 
I'm not an escape room employee, but I asked this exact same question when I went to an escape room a few months ago. The guy working there said a man pulled out a pocket knife and started cutting the carpet out, convinced that there were clues under there
Not an employee, but partcipated in an escape room in which a key was stuck to a filing cabinet by one of those weird little metal puzzles. The key was to open a drawer in a desk on the opposite side of the room.No one could get the metal puzzle undone, so the guys just picked up the filing cabinet and carried it over to the desk. It was a mob themed room so we received a phone call warning about rearranging the furniture that was hilariously in character. We escaped the room :) 
I had a group pull out a tool kit. They unscrewed every furniture to find some combinations. They didn't escape and I made them fix everyrhing, took them about an hour.
A guy didn't help any of his friends he just sat and ate 2 pints of ice cream which he had snuck past me.
Some dude was eating this chick's ass when we checked on them
I went for a job interview at an escape room. My group didn't escape the room, so we didn't go through to the next round. I think they were using the process to get people to test new puzzles for free.
I work at a different escape game and have had customers drop kick doors,vomit all over the place but the one that takes the cake is a couple booked our latest game around midnight. After I did my intro and left the room he proceeded to bend her over a prop and take her from behind. I called in several times to no avail. So for the next hour I had to listen to them grunt an moan. 
We had a group come in last year who were doing really well, got about halfway through the game and then hit a wall. One guy left the room to go out to his car, and when he came back he had a whole 30 rack in his bag. The whole team proceeded to sit in a circle and use their remaining 30minutes to kill the entire thing. It was pretty damn impressive to watch. 
The "zombie" in our room cornered me while he was on all fours. Then he started rubbing the top of his head on my crotch and grunting and breathing really heavily. He did this for a good 10-15 seconds while I just stood there, frozen. At that point I said "well I guess if you can do that I'm out right?" And awkwardly shuffled past him (from the corner where he had me pinned) to the dead corner.It was a real hit for my co-workers to see that.
Escape room employee here.We have a zombie themed escape room where an actor dresses as a zombie and is chained to the corner of the room, and every 5 minutes he gets an extra foot of chain.Somebody once used the props to distracts the zombie (a chain hook used as a fishing hook on rope and pole) and stabed the zombie in the eye, the zombie screamed and the guy kept doing it thinking the scream was fake.
Not an Employee, but one time my group of friends walked into Breakout KC, and my friend proceeded to turn off the main circuit breaker. All the doors and some of the traps were locked electronically. So basically we beat the escape room in a record 9 seconds.
I've seen a divorce, a man came out as gay to his friends in the room. Various misuses of the props as in somebody not knowing how to you use a microscope or a MAGNET. I got mooned once. I think the msot wild stuff though, happens in the back room. The people rumning your room probably have 10x more fun than you do. Some weird shit happens there 
The easiest way to make our life miserable is the propose at one of these. It happened 3 time in the 9 months I worked there. It makes it so we have to get you to finish, and some people.... aren't smart enough
*Technically*, if you jump out of the window you do escape the room!
I mean I guess she figured it out right?
So is that not the correct way out?
Shes a genius.
The files are IN the computer! 
I don't understand people sometimes. No matter how many times i've told them before the game, that climbing is strictly forbidden, the first thing they do is climb over the first obstacle
That's great. Were they apologetic about the whole thing?
How do you put a spy in? Isn't it obvious the one guy not part of the group is the spy. 
Sounds like something Stanley would do
This exact thing happened to our group in an escape room a few months ago.  I guess some of the people weren't listening in the beginning and missed that the box by the door was for our coats, purses, etc...So about 5 minutes into the escape room, someone in our group drags out a purse, dumps it on the floor, and proceeds to go though the wallet.  At one point, he says loudly "hey, this wallet has a lot of money in it" and we all turned and saw what he was doing, including the owner of the purse.  She was horrified.
I had the exact opposite experience, I was playing an escape room and my group all ignored an iPad that was sitting on a table because we all assumed it belonged to one of us.
The bright yellow is the problem. If you want someone to leave it alone you have to make it as dull as possible. Like don't even use all caps. Source: made panels with buttons, the wrong ones always got pushed first if they were colorful.

this is so much worse than all the sex ones
> fire extinguisher on the wall that she was CERTAIN had to be for something. For an hour she wandered around aimlessly carrying a fire extinguisher. Mom sounds like she played a lot of early 1990s computer adventure games: USE FIRE EXTINGUISHER ON DOOR"That doesn't work that way."USE FIRE EXTINGUISHER ON STAIRS"Nothing happens."
"That's not on fire"
group dynamics suck
> THE FUCKING ZOMBIEThere's your mistake right there, should've just used a regular zombie so as to avoid giving guys the wrong idea.
My friend's boyfriend completely ignored all the females in the room or talked condescendingly over them when we did an Exit room. There was a station where there was a counter that started at 24. It had four items that could be placed in any order, and it would count down until you got all the possible combinations. I told him that's what the 24 meant and he loudly and rudely proclaimed I was wrong because 4x4=16. I tried to explain it was 4! = 24 but he ignored me. I ended up just doing the puzzle behind his back while he was busy with some other puzzle. 
That's incredible 
> I guessed PENIS, it was PENIS. Case closed.  Worst episode of Sherlock ever.
What's a one-hitter?
> you rotten childNoooo stop pleasee
My group was guilty of not leaving after beating the room. We had found the cure to stop the virus, but we were still looking for clues. The game master had to come on the intercom and say "ESCAPE! ESCAPE! ESCAPE!"  
Take off clothes, get kicked out, room escaped. Winner!
At least he went in A toilet.
Should have had a "these are not functioning toilets" sign 
>Im not a communist, and the room isn't communist themed>red clue paperWhatever you say commie.
"You have to agree to marry me so we can escape the room."
"HEY ZOMBIE, GET AWAY FROM MY WIFE!"*initiate dad powers*
My friends and I did the one in Dallas. You know the rule where you're out when the zombie touches you. Well, one of my friends had the idea of holding a rug in between him and the zombie. Technically he couldn't touch you. At one point we draped the rug over him. We got out and the actor said that no one has done that before. 
Your family sounds lovely and you don't sound lame at all. Congrats on the nuptials!!
"Sorry brenda, we can't all escape."
Weren't they curious the minute all but one person was unlocked? Or they just assumed you just didn't really like that friend. Believing you asshats all thought, "Oh fuck that bitch, let's just leave her cuffed!"
Oh man. Imagine breaking up in a room you can't get out of, then having to work together to solve puzzles to get away from each other. Was it fun to watch? This will be the plot of a rom-com in 6 months
Escape room 'the ultimate relations tester'
As soon as I read the cuddle one I immediately thought of April and Andy from Parks. 
So a group circling a table acting like a chicken is your idea of sacrificing a human being
/u/fuckswithducks what is your opinion on this duck?
I wanna see a pic of this mannequin kidnapper. 
When I played, our train of logic  pointed to taking apart a hanging light. The people knocked on the door loudly and told us not to dismantle live electronics. 
Did the man happen to go by the name of Dwight Schrute
I own an escape room and we've had people rip up all types of flooring. You think they'd stop when they reached underlayment but no.
Did he find the clue? Did he win? Did he have to pay for it?
Can't blame you.
I put on the prisoner uniform in the one I went to. Why is it there if you're not supposed to wear it?
They say wearing a labcoat some how makes people think more critically, perhaps the space outfit got you in the space escapin mood?
Some people are boring, WHY WOULDN'T YOU PUT THE SPACESUIT ON?! *CMOOOOON*
I can't even imagine how you would be the first person to do it. My first instinct would be to put it on. 
The first escape room I did, we apologized for the mess we made as we were leaving - as we had piled everything up on the table in the center of the room, rather than returning everything to where we found it.I now understand why the escape room employee laughed.
Usually it's because it is obvious when a prop has been tampered with before. When you see a row of books, dusty and all placed neatly in order, you don't think much of it. I spent ten minutes looking through one book at an espace room because it was pulled out slightly and more clean than the other books. Turns out, it was not a prop at all, and the announcer had to tell me twice to stop.
That is so hilarious, like what good could it do to drink it when you can just pour it out. 
Couldn't the one dude just have played the room and when he came back with his company he'd already have the answers?
Can't even tell those guys to get a room, they're already in one.
Seems like it would be courteous in this case for the couple to give the operator an extra large tip first and prepare them for what's to come.
The only thing I've ever heard measured in racks are ribs but somehow I imagine you mean beer?
How'd Selena do?
More please! I love escape games.
"Uhh shit, umm...use length of copper wire on...houseplant? No? Dammit. Use postcard on house plant. Fuck!"
And if you stick metal in electric sockets, you win on escaping life!
there is money between the space of the door and the wood, they're supposed to combine it with other props in the room for the code to get out. 
What was the obstacle? If it isn't supposed to be climbed over, it should be designed in a way where people don't think to climb over it. 
Yeah I don't understand either, maybe I'm just missing something, but how do you plant a spy in the group like this?
now i'm imagining an episode of the office where michael brings everyone to an escape room 
"Ah do naht get paid enough to escape this room, Michael."
I see this a lot too. One of our rooms has a jacket in it, and some people just assume its one of theirs.
"What's your job?""Oh, I make panels with buttons."
It's amazing what people will do to get out of Coventry. 
There's sex ones??
This is the most confounding behavior in this thread so far.
Similarly, I was doing a Jailbreak room with some friends and we got through pretty much the whole room but cannot for the love of god get our handcuffs off. One person tried to take mine off with a broken keychain we found in a cabinet but I told him that probably wasn't the intended purpose of the keychain. Eventually, we're almost through with the room when one friend reaches into the pocket of his orange jumpsuit and finds the handcuff key. It was supposed to be the first thing we found. 
My ex mother in law does this deliberately with puzzles. When getting close to the end she hides a piece just so she can put the last piece of the puzzle in. 
Might have been easier to clean if he didn't. 
I don't think that would have mattered to the drunk guy... 
Because of the implication. 
Is that so weird?? Seems like a smart thing to inquire about. 
You can get out at anytime. There's usually a door that's not part of the puzzle. 
That would be IKEA, actually.
And what a shitty place to propose
I think the idea is that the teammate on the phone sacrificed himself (turned into a chicken and couldn't talk) in order to deliver the hint involving acting like a chicken.
They're too weird for me.  It's even weirder since duck penises are corkscrew-shaped, so this is just a human penis pasted on a duck.  I imagine they float upright well with a rudder like that, though.
At an escape room we went to we started taking apart a photo frame with a "do not disassemble" sticker on it. They seemed quite annoyed but in fairness they also had "do not open" writing on a lot of things you had to open to solve the puzzle.
We only have minutes to harvest!
Oh shit and then each time you repair it, it probably looks more like it's a clue, so people rip it up again! 
I'm not sure. The escape room employee said that he was scared to enter the room to tell the guy to stop. If I'm remembering correctly, he was asked to leave
Yea that actually sounds like a legit step to solve the puzzle
Why was this knife here if I wasn't supposed to murder the rest of the group with it? 
Why didn't you listen to them the first time?
they automatically refill if you try to do that without drinking them, DUH
Yup :/ that they in all fairness paid for.
One time I had a group of kind of redneck people come in and they all smelled funny. We assumed it was some weird pot and just got them in the room. One of the weirder gentlemen went outside in the middle of the game and came back in and released a large cloud of smoke into the room. After they failed to escape, we took their picture and the same guy screams "All right guys, let's go smoke some more meth!" We still don't have rules against this. 
If you played point and click games in the 90s you know those might actually be things you'd have to do in some of them!
It's pretty difficult to electrocute yourself with modern sockets. Not impossible but you have to try.
Her way was faster
The solution here is barbed wire.
So did the professor let you take his name off of it?I had an undergrad professor refuse to let us take a non-contributing person's name off of a project. We did it anyways and told him it would be academic dishonesty to put the person's name on it.  Sadly, I bet the professor credited the kid anyways, he was adament for some reason.
I'm a HS teacher.   I put the human leech kids into a group together.   It's like our own classroom version of hunger games.  
That would have made a great episode
One chick rode naked through the streets on a horse
He was the guy. 
(your username is student of jorvik)
yeah I haven't gotten to them yet neither. onwards we go
I gotta flush my shirt. 
But now he's added legitimacy to the prop.
Similar situation with a bar I was in, except it isn't well known. The bar staff said we have to find our own way in. Only after rescuing us from the cellar room  (once) and the electrical utility room (twice) did they relent and show us the way. They now have locks on those other hidden doors. 
Definitely smart to look at the books! But they are REAL published books, they have page numbers and words. If you need to use them you will probably have a clue/colormarker/hints.  No escape room should make you look through 10+ books blindly.
Reality has never stood in the way of a rom-com plot before.
We've had around 3 proposals in the escape rooms so far. The first one was really nice. The guy met us weeks beforehand and asked us to personalize our prettiest escape room. All the clues were about their relationship like where they first met, first kiss, etc and at the end of it all, was the ring.The second was shitty. We were not informed at all. The girl was chained and blindfolded in a small, black box room. No idea why he thought that would be a good place to propose.The third was hello kitty- themed. I just heard about it from my coworkers but w h y
I've seen proposals at TGI Fridays and Logan's Roadhouse, so there are worse places to propose. 
See I would have assumed I was supposed to decapitate the chicken
But then why did it have a dick?
So you'll fuck a rubber duck, but only if it's a female rubber duck? 
Stanley would sit in the room doing cross words and when the staff asked him if he is lost he'll flatly say "I'm not finished yet". When he is done he solves the room cause he is good at puzzles 
So you're saying that cutting up the carpet with a pocket knife *was* the key to escaping the room?!
He's the only one who survives when they complete the puzzle and the whole station rapidly depressurizes.
I'd totally have the glass/polycarbonate/acrylic on the helmet have some treatment on it for revealing hidden messages. 
The key is inside them!
"Fuck you. This book is growing on me. I'll read it to the end. I am a paying costumer."
The book was unlike the other books, and the pages were torn. I thought the ripped off page numbers would be a clue. Turns out it was just a fucked up book.
Should have told them they should check Pornhub to get a video of them 'finding clues'
Keep em coming, this is fascinating 
huh. this rubber chicken has a pulley in the middle.
She was doing a speedrun.
That's just evil, and clever! How does this work out? 
It's part of a larger company wide competition between branches. Near the beginning of the episode, Dwight openly suggests tying up the escape room attendant and torturing him for the information. The camera would then pan quickly over to a slightly nervous looking teenage boy and then back to Michael who briefly ponders it before telling Dwight to get serious.
That's fucking ridiculous. 
No, No! No one's in danger. They're not going to be forced to have sex with me... but they can't say no, because of the implication.
How did you end up in the utility room twice?
The first one is actually genius
Chained and blindfolded? That makes my country's escape rooms sound so mild
So I have to ask, having only been to a single, pirate-themed escape room...   Exactly what kind of escape room has one of the participants chained and blindfolded??
I'm curious to know what the answers to each of those proposals was. 
Friday's would be perfect. If she says yes you can celebrate with endless cheese sticks and potato skins. If she rejects you then you can wallow in self pity with endless cheese sticks and potato skins. It's a classic win/win scenario 
I don't fuck my duckies, it destroys them after a couple years and I don't want to ruin all the good ones I have left.
'But *could* I?' he wondered,  'and *should* I?' he thought -  'It's present,' he pondered,  'and *surely* I ought?  It's *clearly* included,  and *why* would it be -  If not with a purpose intended for me?'Perhaps it's a pointer?  Perhaps it's a clue?  I'll *never* be sure,  But I'll know when I do!  I'll do it!' he whispered,  'I'll do it!' he cried.  He sat in his suit and he watched as they died.&nbsp;^^^:)
When you think about it, the Saw movies are just really extreme Escape The Room scenarios
But he told you to stop.
As much as I wanted to record it I can't ! But it would've been great for pornhub. Definitely would almost be black couch worthy. 
Then Jim argues with Dwight and gets Dwight to say that he's impervious to all torture techniques and gets Dwight to agree to being subject to torture where in which Jim can get Dwight to confess his secret beet sauce recipe which turns into Jim tying Dwight to a chair in an empty room and then just leaving him there 
In some way or another for a reason I don't know why, this reminds me of the "game/competition" where you go door-to-door starting with a dollar store item, and get people to trade you for equal or more value if they want it. You see who ends up with the best item at the end of the day.Some people start with a toothbrush and end up with a piano or TV.
The second one might be making the best of a bad situation.
I dunno, the second one sounds better. She can't say no... because of the implication.
Yeah, OP that sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen. You sure that's a public attraction you're working at and not a BDSM meetup?
We went to one based on the saw movies where we were all chained to the walls/ chairs and blindfolded. Some of us had a little play in our chains.  So there would be a clue near one person, who would call it out and it would allow someone else to open a padlock or locked combination box to get keys. It was exciting. 
1) Yes2) *mmmph*3) B-b-baka
Sounds to me like you're just looking to be in a relationship with potato skins and cheese sticks.
Wait wait wait, you can get endless cheese sticks and potato skins at Fridays now? I haven't been to one in years...

At some point we get a camera pan to Creed standing in the corner of the room visibly sweating. He points to the camera above him.  "I did something like this in Kyoto for a lot of money a few years ago. Let me know if anybody brings in chili peppers."
It's like when Dwight traded for the magic beans. 
The third one sounds like something my fiance would like. For some reason she absolutely loves hello kitty. I dont get it, but if I get her something hello kitty themed, it makes her smile, so thats more than enough incentive for me.
Are you going to hurt women?
You have to remember it's fucksWITHducks not just fucksducks ;)
Many escape rooms use don't touch stickers, usually a hand print with a slash through it or something similar. But once you think you have everything labeled or included in the rules, people surprise you with new ways to be destructive.
But it's free.
Moments later, Kevin claims he is starving despite having been in the escape room for less than 3 minutes. 
Dennis: *sees old woman giving him stinkeye* "Well I don't know what you're looking at me like that for, you're certainly in no danger!"Mac: So they **are** in danger!
No one is in any danger! What are you not understanding about this?
Jesus I had this question at the end of a job interview. Here's the joke I told (I got the job):Two engineering students were walking across campus when one said, "Where did you get such a great bike?"The second engineer replied, "Well, I was walking along yesterday minding my own business when a beautiful woman rode up on this bike. She threw the bike to the ground, took off all her clothes and said, "Take what you want."The first engineer nodded approvingly, "Good choice; the clothes probably wouldn't have fit."
A farmer and his dog are herding sheep. They finish and his dog says "I counted 40 sheep". The farmer replies, "That's odd I only got 37". The dog replies "I rounded them up".

So there's two blue whales drinking at a bar. The first turns to the second and says (Now you make whale song noises as awkwardly and as cringe-inducingly as possible, until everyone in the room is clearly a little bit uncomfortable with how long this has gone on)To which the second whale turns to the first, and says: "Frank, go home, you're drunk."

We have no leprechaun nuns in this convent.""And mother, do you have any leprechaun nuns in all of Ireland?""No my son, I don't believe there's a single leprechaun nun in the whole church!"The first leprechaun rounds on his companion and shouts "AH TOL' YE YOU'D BEEN FOOKIN' A PENGUIN".
A guy goes to the doctor about a rash he's had for a while. The doctor finally enters the room and takes a look at the guy and says "Well sir, I'm going to have to advise you to stop masturbating."  "Why's that doc?" the guy asked.  And the doctor said, "So I can examine you."
Mickey and Minnie Mouse went in to see a marriage counsellor. The therapist first met with each of them one-on-one, then brought them together for a joint session."Let me start by restating in a neutral, non-threatening way, the concerns each of you raised in your individual sessions.  Mickey, Minnie says you are quick to anger, and suspicious of her friendships with other males. Minnie, Mickey is concerned about your mental health. He thinks you're crazy."At this Mickey jumped in.

"A gator ripped off me leg while burying gold in Florida." He asks next how he lost his hand. "A shark bit ma hand off while I was throwing the gator into the sea."Amazed at the pirate's bravery, he asked how the man lost his eye. "A seagull shit in me eye." The sailor was shocked and asked, "a bird shit in your eye and you lost it??"The pirate said, "it was my first day with the hook."

The absolute MOST important part of this joke is to take a massive breath before the second whale speaks, like you're about to go off again

My friend in high school got me with about a twenty-minute version of this one, which I thereafter knew as the "J. R. Davis" joke (the name the guy had in his version). You can lay into it as much as you and your audience can stand.
In a similar vein, three logicians walk into a bar. The bartender asks, "Do you all want beers?" The first one says, "I don't know." The second one says, "I don't know," and the third one says, "Yes!"
Yeah but using the same cup used by infinite people are disgusting
Other version of this joke:An infinite number of mathematicians walk into a bar. Bartender asks, "what can I get you guys"? First mathematician says "I'd like a pint of beer please."

He pours himself one twelfth of a pint, drinks it and says "you know, you guys really ought to know your limits."

Good day to be the first mathematician.
I know right!? The others were good, this was incredible.
First 2 guys make typical and useful wishes while the last guy makes uncommon and bizarre wishes.  We as the audience expect the 3rd guy to have some clever plan on how to do something even better than the wishes of either of the other men.  But then we just get the imagery of a guy with spinning arms and a nodding head walking into the bar.
And of course it's Karl.
I'm so uncomfortable and happy watching that.
That is Karl Stefanovic, a national treasure! He has some hilarious moments on live Morning TV. 
To be fair, it is a very language dependent joke, and you can see that there is someone translating for him.

It's funnier if you think that the dog doesn't need a tree to pee because he's a dog, he can go where ever. The joke is he's holding his pee for no reason, or that his dog logic thinks he can't pee unless there's a tree.Or if you refer to a couple getting lost driving somewhere and one says they'll pee their pants if they don't find a bathroom soon. It's funny to think dogs share that experience.
What did the leper say to the prostitute?   Keep the tip.
The follow up to The Young Pope. 
I swear the internet literally has something for everything. Like if I were to say candy cane bubblegum sword fighting bear-men. Probably already exists.
I wasn't implying that it would be difficult to remember the specific sequence of events, just that I'm going to want to recall that this joke exists when the time comes that I want to tell a joke.
I like this version more. The punchline was more to the point so I knew immediately it was an anti joke, versus the other one left me wondering if I misread something

I knew the poem was a rendition of this joke from the first line but was still delighted. Top notch, Sprog. :)(My only complaint is that it needs to be much longer, for the full frustration-effect of the joke. Still fantastic though.)
If one of the logicians doesn't want a beer then he would say no. But if he does want a beer, he can't say "yes" because the question was do you all want beers. So the first two say I don't know - meaning they want a beer but don't know if the others do. The third one would then know that he and the other two all want beers and can answer yes.
Still don't get it...

I am not very cool (long story; very overprotective parents + orchestra-nerd-turned-science-geek-turned-medical-student) and had to google this reference... THIS SONG IS FANTASTIC AND THE FOO FIGHTERS ARE FANTASTIC WHERE HAS THIS SHIT BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!??
I feel like my life just found its purpose. That was to lead you to the Foo Fighters music.  I will tell this story to my children. 
I never trusted my ex bf's uncle. I just knew he was trouble and had issues with him visiting or my ex visiting him. He was arrested in Florida last year for production and selling meth and hosting a prostitution ring out of his home. Later learned the ex partook in all the activities at his uncle's home. Apparently my gut was right about the uncle, but not about my ex. 
My snake did.  I had the sweetest, chillest ball python who never nipped or hissed or reared up or anything.  She'd just curl up with you and hang out.  One day a friend brought over some of his friends and all of a sudden my snake went nuts - standing straight up in her tank and hissing at one of the guys.  A couple of weeks later, that dude robbed my house while I was out of town.RIP Guinevere.  A good snake.
My childhood best friend's mother's boyfriend. He creeped me out and I hated being over her house when he was there. Her family went on a ski trip with mine, and my parents both thought he was great-funny, charming etc. They didn't understand why I didn't like him. Years later, my best friend told me that he sexually abused her starting when she was about 9.  I probably was picking up on her fear of him. 
My mom brought her new boyfriend over the house one time for me to meet him. He weirded me out. I can't tell you why but I didn't like him. Maybe it's because he was a 35 year old man who wore visors. Friendly and funny guy who my family liked. A year into their relationship he beat the hell out of my mom and stole her dog. Probably the closest I've come to an assassination attempt. Edit 1: I didn't go after him as not to implicate my mom. Also, we got her dog back :) Edit 2: Yep, he's in jail.
While in the Army we moved into a new house in upstate New York. We were being neighborly and talked to a guy across the street. He had 5 kids. No wife. He also had multiple neighborhood kids playing in the yard. He told us We can always send ours over. He gave us both this horrible feeling so we smiled and gtfo. About a year later my wife told me (i was in Kandahar) that his kids were taken from him. He had been molesting them at least ever since his wife died. 
My older mother got this "boyfriend."  Mom was in her 60s and the boyfriend was probably mid-sixties also.  One day she brought him over to my house, where I was a single mom to a 3 year old boy.  I'm usually friendly, or at the least polite, but I looked at that guy and said "no, don't come in my house."  My mom was SHOCKED. She said "Wang_Dipthong, this is Blah Blah, my boyfriend!"   I told her I was sorry. I shut the door. About 6 months later he went to jail for raping boys. 
Exwifes second husband. Took 10 years but i was right. He is currently on year 1 of a 32 year sentence for repeated rape of his daughter.  
Yes, but I suppressed it so quickly and fast, because I felt like it was horribly ungracious since she was being so friendly.  Over the next couple years, she became my closest friend in the new town I had moved to.  Then the following couple years it vacillated between being close, but just feeling like she really didn't want me around or was messing with me a little bit.  Turns out she was having an affair with my husband and was literally intentionally driving me crazy.
My former handball coach:Everybody liked him, but I had a weird feel about him;After training he would come into our showers and give out shower caps for us to use, or in the winter, he would bring us snow to play.A few years later, he got arrested for sexual assault, when he went to a training camp with younger girls. Apparently he got into their tents and "played" with them.
My mom was a single mom and did the best she could.  However, she thought it might be better to leave me with the neighbor than at home alone.  From the age of 6, I pleaded with my mom to let me stay home alone until she got home from work,  that I would be ok.  My intuition was right. The neighbor was convicted of multiple murders of single mom one and two towns over when DNA evidence came into being.  He only liked to date and kill nonobese women.  Fortunately my mother was fat.
Apparently, when I was 4 or 5, my grandma introduced me to some new boyfriend. Everyone liked him, but I would have nothing to do with him. Wrinkled my nose, wouldn't be left alone by him.  I guess he just came into her apartment one day and walked at her with something behind his back, said nothing. She got an eerie feeling and said, "Are you going to kill me?" With a dead faced stare he came at her. She managed to jump over some furniture and get away (she's always been in great shape, running 3 miles a day until age 80).She got somewhere safe, called the police and never saw him again..
Not me, but my sister. She has this uncanny ability to detect crazy people. My first boyfriend who was secretly abusive, she called it after knowing him for two days. My next boyfriends mom who eventually forced me to take a pregnancy test because I had been "looking rather pregnant" and she wanted to know, she knew after the first visit meeting her. My toxic ex best friend of *seven years*, she knew after 1 year. All of the people my sister calls out for being crazy, I now believe and avoid wholeheartedly.
A pastor who was involved in the community outreach program for a prison (which i volunteered to for the first time).. seemed very friendly on the outside but seems really creepy to me... he kept putting his hands on my shoulder on that day and got my number from one of the volunteers and called me non stop that night to say he is lonely and wants to talk.. i was 14 at the time.. 
My first girlfriends husband. She and I had a bad breakup, but eventually got to be friends again, hanging out with the same crowd all the time. She met a guy who lived out of state and fell in love with him. I disliked him immediately. Everybody else thought he was fine. They got married, and a couple of years later, he started beating the crap out of her. She wised up and left.
Jimmy Saville. Turned out everyone had same thought and a lot of people knew.
Guy at my school. Everybody else liked but I had a bad vibe. My girlfriend at the time told me to not be so negative and automatically dislike people. Since then he lied to her about something I said, lied to me about talking to her. And then lied to everyone saying we broke up because I cheated on her.And guess who she's dating now?
I'm a chef and within one minute of hiring someone I know if they are going to work or will need to be replaced. First impressions mean a lot, so if you bring up killing your wife (happened last week) or pain pills (yesterday) within the first 5 minutes of your first shift its not gonna work out, because you're an idiot. 
A guy here on reddit who had a lot of karma. I was nearly alone in my hatred of him over in r/centuryclub. They all loved him, but I could just tell that something was off about him. Then he got busted for fucking around with the wife of someone else in CC, and their PMs revealed that he was a fucking child molester who had dreams of having a son one day that he could sexually abuse. Fuck that guy. 
I wonder how many wrong feelings occur for each right one
Did he kill her?  :< 
That was one very good reptilian dog you had there.Did you catch the guy?
The amount of pedophile stories in this thread is freaking me out.
I like to think she actually said "Wang_Dipthong"
While he's obviously a scumbag, and I'm happy to believe that he intended to tie her up, I honestly believe *everyone* should have some sturdy rope in the back of their car.  I have two 12' lengths for securing loads, a 25' for if I need to pull anything/pull my car out (I have since gotten a tow strap), another 50' for whatever, a pick and shovel, several saws, trash bags, latex gloves, and a machete.  I promise I'm not trying to kill anyone.
>Took 10 years but i was right.Nice :)>He is currently on year 1 of a 32 year sentence for repeated rape of his daughter.  :(
Did you divorce your husband after that?
It's interesting, I think we (women) generally try to repress those feelings towards other women who appear to be friendly--even though we're getting a weird vibe.  We sort tell ourselves it's us, not them.  And then, turns out, it's them.
>Next thing I know he says, "Can I rub down a little further? In front? It's your decision, you're completely in charge here."I felt physically ill when I read this. 
What the actual fuck. This could be a lifetime movie. 
I'm sorry in advance but the most frustrating part of this is how absolutely fucking cowardly your Mom is. Even if you had a rough life growing up, how can you not see how fucked up everything is? It makes me so fucking angry when I read these posts and see their parents doing *nothing.*
This story was a ride all the way till the end... but what really got me was that your family owns an avocado farm.... Also, fuck Dave.
Yeah fuck Dave. But thats pretty awesome that you guys have an avocado farm. 
It must have been fucking horrible to see that in him and not be able to do anything about it.  
Oh man, I can't imagine how that poor girl who was gonna live with him felt after she found out.
How did the "I told you so" go with the girlfriend and friends?
I just read the article. It said the mom was stabbed over 178 times. That alone creeps me out. Imagine how much pent up anger you have to have to stab some one consecutively for what was probably minutes after they had already passed. My morning is ruined. 
This is next-level shit... one life ended, and two more ruined, all because some guy grossly abused his power over a minor.... I feel so bad for the biodaughter :( 
So he walked into the shower with a bunch of naked girls? And no one else thought it was strange?
He would bring snow into the showers?  So you could throw snowballs in the shower?  Wth?
Yo momma so fat, she survived and lives a happy life!
I thought nonobese was someone from a country i hadn't heard of, but then I realized you meant non-obese. Anyway that's so scary, I'm glad you're ok!
Fuck, are y'all still friends?
It's amazing how people choose to ignore multiple very obvious red flags. 
Your grandma sounds awesome. Leaping over furniture and escaping from a murderer. 
What was behind his back, were the cops called? Answers! We need ANSWERS!...........seriously though, please answer these questions.
This is obviously mean but, she fucking deserved it. I just couldn't believe that your mother's cousin actually picked that bitch over his own parents.
Let's not forget your uncle is also a HUGE asshole in this situation. 
So he lied about owning and selling the store? 
I want to meet your sister and find out about myself.
Damn. She's got the sight. 
Report him to the police.
Wait, so your birthmother knew and still was on decent terms with her rapist? That's messed up.
This is super well written. I didn't realize I wasn't breathing until I got to the end and let out a sigh of relief. Damn. What a scary situation. Good on your for noticing and making yourself prepared to counter though. 
"You're just jealous you're not hot enough to get hit on by a creepy teacher" that sounds like many of the popular girls in my high school & middle school. I wonder how they felt when he got caught. Keep trusting your gut! 
If he made fun of you instead of flirting with you because you were unattractive, does that not bolster your argument?
I'm a bit surprised but very happy your parents believed you. Did you ever try googling her name and locale?
How did your brother find out?
A girl I know is doing this. All my friends love her but something in my gut told me something wasn't right. She was always flirting with all the lads, acting very single. Find out she's seeing a guy I know from other friends. Not only that, it turns out she also has another boyfriend she's had for years. So she has a long term boyfriend, is seeing this other guy, and is by all means, trying to get with my friends too. Was very surreal. But I was just jealous of her when I didn't warm to her straight away like everyone else. 
If I were you, I would feel bad for my brother, of course, but I would also feel such a victorious "I told you so" toward my mom. I can't help it. 
I used to work at a place with a rock climbing wall. It was my favorite attraction to run because I could swing the younger kids around by their harness and they loved it. Usually.I'm just glad there's only ever been one incident of someone commenting on the way I touch people as I fit their harness. It was a guy who jokingly said "Stop fondling my wife!" And I replied with something along the lines of "Don't be jealous I'm getting paid to touch her and you're stuck doing it for free."His wife was amused. He was not.
This is a great story, but for a second I thought the story was going to be that everyone loved this dog and you had bad feelings about it.
Who's good fluffy domestic assault detector?! 
This is a great story, but I have set off dogs that love everyone before. I don't have evil intentions, I've never slapped anyone and I am a dog person, so sometimes it's random.
One of my husbands Aunts has a German Shepard. He's a big, dumb, scared of his own shadow and fireworks type. He once knocked down a cousin and growled at her because "he thought I was being rough with my kid". No sweetie he saw you being rough and protected the kid. It was literally his first time jumping on anyone. Let alone knocking them over. He's seen us rough house and LARP. I would argue he knows the difference between real violence and play. He's a good dog and always get table scraps from me now. (And cuddles when there are fireworks)
> Sometimes our guts really know what's up.On that topic, read Gavin de Becker's *The Gift of Fear*.The book is full of examples how and why you get that uneasy feeling, and it teaches you how to pinpoint the source.
I'm glad that this is the top comment. A lot of people have this really naive and almost cartoonish idea of what a sexual predator or an abuser is going to be. They think that they're going to be obvious; an ugly, overtly & objectively creepy guy who openly shows deviant behaviour to others in an obviously way. NOPE. 99% of the time an abuser or a sexual predator is someone who other people *like*. Someone who is charming and who others simply "can't believe" could ever be a bad guy. Trust no one completely, man.
Do you work in Gary, Indiana?
Wait... pot?  How much pot was the guy smoking?
> added a photo to instagram while studying in a library and he showed up a few years laterhours maybe?
Not saying you did, but even if you made this up, you're a great storyteller. I honestly don't mean this is a backhanded compliment or anything - you just wrote this really well.
Assuming you're indeed from South Africa and that your story is true, you are far from the first person I've seen on the internet tell stories of how much of a piece of shit pistorious was/is.
I hate that I know who you're talking about. 
Let her keep that $60 as a gift. Someone like that should not bring a child into this world. The child would suffer too much.
> To be picked up by friend who had raped her.Yeah, the fact she said it was a stranger, then it was the friend but didn't want to tell the police, then he's the one that rescues her when she gets kicked out? Plus literally everything else about her? I don't buy her story. 
Well now I'm self-conscious about the fact that I prefer playing with kids to drinking beer and watching sports...Thanks for that.
While your gut instinct was correct, please don't demonize every guy who would rather play with children than watch sports. Male childcare workers have an extremely tough go as it is. 
He even took away her right to dump him? Evil. 
Not for that caper, but I think he got popped for something else.  And I got a phone call a few months later from an angry ex-girlfriend telling me my suspicions were correct and which pawn shop he used.  The police were just like, "Meh."
To be fair, it's not a thread about people who gave a good first impression and later turned out to have an exemplary character.
Classic narcissistic behavior.  You don't do what they want, they go scorched earth on you.  Sorry you got caught up in that.
Not yet.  Complicated, lengthy, messy, and almost entirely on Reddit (see feed)
I sometimes think my life story could have been a fantastic book for Oprah's book club.Maybe this is why I hate things like that and prefer humor? Sometimes dark, sometimes with cream and sugar.
This reminds me of our close family friends - father had been molesting his daughter for years and his wife (my mum's best friend) treated her like the *other woman* in an affair.
Yes, Dave sucks. But I, too, would like to know more about this avocado ranch. Specifically why it's not a farm, but a ranch. Also the avocados. 
Right? How's she going to afford the rent without a roommate??
From own experience: it never goes well, and the person who tried to warn the others becomes a cynical bastard because of it. 
Wanna come over for waffles? Maybe it'll make your day better :)
Why not just get a divorce, holy fuck. 
Um. Life Insurance money was 785k and bail was 785k? Either that's a ridiculous coincidence or someone in the article fucked up. 
I guess some did, I'm still friends with a girl, that also went there and she left the club for the same reason I did. I think they were either too embarassed to tell or they really didn't think of it as strange. As I said, he was loved by everyone, he also was teacher at my elemantary school. People trusted him. 
It was a legit reason for him to enter the showers and us being seven years olds somehow liked the idea of having a snowball fight...
It was a wedding ring. She asked if he was going to kill her, and his heart shattered, but he made sure not to falter. The only thing he could muster was a dead stare, unable to show any form of false happiness, but enough not to show his extreme sadness. He confessed his love, but she was out the door. The police were called, charges were dropped, and he moved away. A broken and shattered man, that will never allow his heart to love again.
How would they not notice the missing equipment the first time it happened?
Yep, and then to keep up with the lie (since he actually was just working there) he had to build more lies about going back to the store to work there. And then build another lie about how he's also rich from the stock market to explain the income he was getting from stealing and eBay sales.
I think if you spend time worrying that you might be secretly bad, you're probably not too bad.
Unfortunately where i lived (when this happened), these things won't be taken seriously by the police.. 
Yup, my birth family is really messed up. He moved to Australia a couple of years ago cause stuff got brought up from the past and a huge family brawl was close to happening.
Not only did I trust my gut, I also drew dicks on his car when I could find it in the parking lot.
Don't remember her name, unfortunately. My parents were really good about not being dismissive when I was a kid.
As long as my kid doesn't say that about most people, I'm 100% going to believe them if they say someone was being inappropriate with them. You would have to be insane not to. 
Now I'm wondering if OP just mistook a cute "You are so cute I want to take you home and bake cookies for you" for an actual kidnapping attempt. 
Having witnessed some weird-assed socially clueless but harmless mom behavior over the years (particularly from my own), this is hilariously believable.
Her other guy came to see her one day and she told my brother that he was an old coworker. So my brother said he'd take them all out to lunch and she lost her shit, and it all unraveled. She admitted to everything, from using my brother for money to having this whole relationship for their entire relationship. 
I know a Bulgarian girl doing this. Shes attractive and has a good job, and is married to an English guy, but has a 'soul mate' in Bulgaria. She also goes on dates with other guys, as long as they're rich or really handsome. It's weird, because all her Bulgarian girlfriends think she's perfectly entitled to do this, and being married doesn't take her off the market, while her husband is in total denial and thinks she's just friendly with other guys. 
I used to get people to pull their own harness up, and would show them how to close the buckles. When it came time to thread the rope through the loops, there was a good 5-6 inches of rope between my hand and the harness. Can't be too careful.Speaking of careful, I always double and triple checked harnesses, both to make sure they were tight enough and that they were properly done up.
Same here, turns out the dog had secretly been evil etc
Dogs always know dude.  Just turn yourself in to the police now and save everyone the trouble.
i finally understand why in english class they say to define pronouns
I had a friend who had a German Shepard. We lived about a half mile apart on a mountain road. At night, when I would leave his house, the dog would "escort" me home. Never beside me though, he would walk through the brush.It was really scary the first time it happened. All of a sudden I could hear something off the road. I quickened my pace until I got to my driveway then turned around. There he was, watching me. I gave him a wave and he turned and went home.GSD's are a wonderful breed.
I like to recommend this book as well, particularly for women, we are socially trained to be nice even when our inner alarms are blaring.
Convicted for sexual spying on a childLet off easy because he has children. Huh. 
Yeah, turns out some pensioner in the pub I drink in was a prolific pedophile, it turns out he was at it for decades, generally against very vulnerable people; disabled children etc, basically the worst you can get. What was horrific is that he was reasonably normal, you expect these people to be monsters, the idea that they're walking amongst you is the scary part. 
Not quite the same but the youth minister at my church when I was in high school set off my gaydar hardcore. He also gave several sermons about homosexuality being a sin. He ended up getting fired for cheating on his wife with at least 2 men, I think one may have been underaged. He was the epitome of the closeted gay bigot. 
My understanding of it is that people give off micro expressions and your brain notices these even when you don't.  So while, as you say the person controls the outer appearance, small expressions push through of their real thoughts.  Some people are better at seeing these than others.
Good ole' Gary. Make sure you gas up before you get there. You don't want to stop. 
No, she sat in the library for years 
Can't you see?
Username checks out. History shows posts about Africa. I'm almost 99% sure OP is really Oscar Pistorius and is just trying to be relevant again. 
Yup, my boyfriend was like "she probably just cheated" but me and my guy friend I guess were being nice and giving the benefit of the doubt.
People like that are the minority, but they're the ones that stick in people's brains and turn our whole society to think "men can't like playing with kids or they're pervs".
Try being a *dad* without your wife present at all times. I've had to defend myself from strangers accusing me of pedo intentions towards my own children on the playground. Though to be fair, this is more a statement on the sorts of people that would attack somebody they simply assume is a predator, than society itself - which seems to have more and more of those people in it anyways.
Somebody should make that thread
Don't let it get to you.  Sometimes you cannot fix stupid.  You saw the problem when nobody else could.  That is a very important skill.  Keep your eyes open man!
My gut instinct says no
He wanted the insurance money and didn't want to lose custody of his 3 year old. Source: the article.
That in itself is creepy.  Just the snowball thing... Yuck. 
Seven year olds had to shower after practice? That feels unusual to me.
Stand up move, contacting affected customers. If a restaurant did that for me over 5 bucks months ago,  I would become a fan. 
I think they did but just did not expect it from their prized employee
Reminds me of my favorite Mark Twain quote: "If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything." I don't know how people have the energy to keep up an elaborate web of lies.  I've lived by this for many years, and it has made life pretty easy, bitching even.  
Ugh. That's terrible. Sorry you had to deal with that.
Could it be a common "joking" thing to say in [asian country] that's meant to be flattering to the parents, but just doesn't translate across the languages?  Like "oh, your child is so well behaved, I wish he/she were mine." 
My Asian mom has also done some things that would freak out Americans. Once on a road trip we were getting ready to leave a ratty motel/apartments in a hick town, mom sees one of the live-in children watching her eat cookies. She has the kid come into our van to eat cookies with her. Needless to say when I came upon the scene I quickly explained in non-English why this shit could get her in some big trouble, this isn't Asia, get that kid the fuck out of the van before someone sees. 
So she is dead now? 
Do you happen to know if this is common among Bulgarians? Or just a one off thing 
>  statistically your child more likely to be abused/abducted by someone you know vs. a van-driving strangerI keep this in mind. And then I receive a mass-text from my daughter's school warning us parents to talk to our kids about not getting into cars with strangers, because of an incident where someone tried to lure a kid into his car on the way back home. Nothing bad happened, the kid bolted, told his parents and the police got involved. But the fact that the classical "white van" scenario does happen, and *is* happening in my back-yard gives me the absolute heebiejeebies. 
It's a tradition in our family to give a copy of this book to every girl graduating from high school. Really, everyone should read it, though.
> generally against very vulnerable peopleThis is important to remember. The poor, the disabled, the shy, the lonely...serial abusers learn who to hurt.
I had a similar experience with my uncle. He was always super friendly at family events, but as a kid I just had an intuitive feeling to stay the hell away from him. I guess he was just a little too touchy, especially considering how everyone else in my family would barely give you a handshake, even if they hadn't seen you for years. Turns out her raped both my female cousins, his daughters, the entire time they were growing up. 
Seems like its always the ones obsessing from the pulpit about homosexuality that turn out to be cock crazy.  
Your mom coordinated the attack.
You're just not the girl for me...
I had my infant son out shopping at Staples with my wife's Guncle and a random lady literally tried to take the baby out of his arms because a baby that young "must have a mother" and we clearly stole him. It was insane. She went from, "aww, cute baby" to "I'm saving him from you perverted gay kidnappers" in 5 seconds flat. Thankfully store management escorted her out.
I dunno man. I make pretty killer waffles
Yeah fuck snowballs. Snowballs are fucking pedophiles man.
It still doesn't check out. First time something goes missing at night you have your security system improved. Most people don't sit there and go "oh darn it, an electric piano disappeared again" and then forget about it.
that is an oddly heartwarming story
No, she's actually completely single. Apparently other dude didn't know she had been dating my brother, so when he found out he kicked her to the curb. 
I know couple of Bulgarian girls and they're nothing like this Might be it's just that group. 
His aunt has a really passive German Shephard. The dog was watching his female cousin play with female cousin's kid and saw that the cousin was being rough with the kid so the dog tackled her(the cousin not the kid). Her(the cousin who was tackled) excuse was that she was only pretending or wasn't being rough. This dog had seen OP Larp and rough house for fun so the dog likely knows when the violence is real or not. Doggie gets rewarded now for being good doggie.
Right, but in your area, how many "white van" incidents have there been, versus the amount of familial child abuse? Your fear is misproportioned, because your bias tells you that the people in *your* life wouldn't do something like that.
As the father of a severely autistic girl, this scares the shit out of me. I know if someone took advantage of her I would kill them. How do you protect a 7 year old who can't even tell you she's hungry, or needs to go to the bathroom. This is a terrible thread to start my day.
That is so fucked up. How does someone do that to their own children (well, any child)? What a monster.
It's the only thing that makes sense.Omama bin Laden?
I know it might be wrong
I think it depends on how often they check their inventory. Do they count their items in stock every day, once a week/month? By the time they checked, several items could've been taken over a period of days/weeks. As an insider, he knew their system and worked around it. 
Run away or run towards him with fists raised?
Did your brother start dating the other guy?
Please tell me he and your brother then went on to drink a beer together and became friends?
I used to work at a rape crisis center.  One of the staff had a FIL who had raped his wife, all his daughters, all his DILs, all his granddaughters and god knows who else. She finally put her foot down and made their family be no contact.  But no one ever stopped him.  It can totally be generational.  Which makes me want to puke.
More like Yomama bin Laden. 
I'm in love with Stacy's Mom
Work in a store, and now count our inventory every monday. But before we did it 2 times a year. You could have stolen a shit ton of products in that time, but once you do inventory, you finally realize how much you're missing.
I was actually gonna say or beat him to a pulp lol. But I don't want anyone being done for randomly fucking up a bad man with no actual evidence on what he did.
Though that would have been the best conclusion to bring this all full circle, no. 
Not that I know of. My brother moved five hours away shortly after that so I doubt it. 
> DILsHer raped his daughters-in-law?!? And his adult married sons reacted how? O.o
Right. I'm a teacher, so I have been able to observe the results of all of that in, oh, about 1300 children over the years. I HATE the stranger danger stuff. Kids very badly need to be able to deal with and interact with strangers. I wish families would teach healthy boundaries and assertiveness instead of the stranger bullshit.
I have a friend that works for a professional inventory counting service.  They go to huge warehouses to count inventory and have these weird hip mounted computers they use to count and keep track of stuff.  When I knew him in high school he could barely do math but now he has Rainman level skill at counting a group of matched items close together.  
Yeah mob mentality can be a lovely thing... I feel bad for all the innocent older men who look like Elvis and sing like him in Australian bars.
Schools should just make kids who are bad at math do inventory.
If it helps he has a kiwi accent.
Korean living in Canada here. It wasn't exactly hidden from kids even when they're young. I remember being aware of North Korea's existence as long as I can remember because of the whole reunification movement that is visible in everyday life, even before I started going to school. The general vibe was that they were taken away from us, living in harsh conditions and that we should try to reunite as a favour to them. I left before being taught any proper Korean history, so maybe somebody else will have more to say in that sense. 
I grew up in South Korea. It's probably the same stuff that an average redditor would know about North Korea, I guess the difference is that it gets taught at school and is brought up more often. Things like how North Koreans are suffering because of their horrible dictatorship government but their citizens are our brothers, how tragic the Korean War was, and peaceful reunification is the goal. To add a little bit more context, there was a stronger anti-Japan sentiment than an anti-NK sentiment, at least when I was growing up. This was in the late 90's early 00's.
Yup quite strange when we had a North Korean student coming to our school and the South Koreans tried to befriend him but he kept to hinself
>  he never found out what happened to his previous family.That's so fucked up.  Imagine going on a business trip one day from North Carolina to South Carolina and while you're on the trip the government suddenly says no one can ever go into or come out of North Carolina ever again.  You live the rest of your entire life not knowing what happened to your whole family.
This is probably the most accurate description of how south koreans learn about NK. Just note that the older generation that have been taught with anti-communism regime will probably not be using reddit  so you will not read their opinion here.
> we are taught to feel sympathy toward the NK people and hate the dictatorship.That is good I feel, hatred of the government but sympathy for NK people means there is still a slight hope of NK reunification.
US Air Force guy here, I was stationed in Korea for two years (loved it btw, you guys are great). How do you guys honestly feel about the American presence there? Everyone I met seemed pretty happy to see us, but I may not have gotten the full picture, you know?
Letters were allowed to be passed like that? Did you get a reply back?
It's always depressing when a born and bred South Korean uses the English language better than you (a born and bred Englishman. Your level of English is astounding. 
Any recommendations for a good film in regards to the SK/NK struggle?
I've heard from many Koreans that reunification right now isn't practical as there would be a huge refugee crisis and a huge cost for humanitarian aid.This seems contrary to your post, so I'm wondering if the above stance is mostly by a minority pragmatic group of people or do most people have this view but hope for "some day" of reunification?
That's a really compassionate way of seeing the North Korea situation
Ive heard that back probably when your parents were in school, kids were taught that North Koreans had horns and other demon like qualities and that some of that characterization still persists these days.I was listening to a radio interview where some North Koreans who escaped to the south and then came to America were shocked when people asked them where their horns are and similar questions about others in the North.  It was an interesting segment and ended with getting opinions from people in the South about how they feel towards NK now.
There seems to be a lot of Koreans living in Canada answering in this thread. Serious question, is Canada a popular country for Koreans to immigrate to?
From your perspective, is it one of SK's goals to actively reunite with NK? Or is the separation more or less accepted now?
It sounds like "eat your veggies because there are starving kids" is a universal tactic of parents.  At least in SK you are close enough to NK that the "well why don't you give it to them" comeback is actually viable.
The eat your vegetables part - not Korean, but my parents always told me this. Confession: I used to scrape a little from my plate into the bin everyday, in the hope that when a little kid found it, he or she'd be happy to have something to eat, instead of having nothing since no one was wasting food. :/
Interesting, this is sort of like for me Britain in world war 2, teaching children to watch out for suspicious activity.So, from what you tell me, they don't really teach you much about why North Korea is evil and dangerous, rather, it just is.
My family is also from Kaesong before the conflict! I wonder how they are... 
Which opinion is more popular in South Korea 
Did your parents talk to you about it? How did they bring up the topic!
> NK was still starving and forever looking for ways to attack SKIs that why Seoul subway stations are so far deep underground? When I visited I was surprised how many stairs I had to drag my luggage up before reaching ground level. I also noticed gas mask stations, which I didn't piece together until after I left.
Just got back from SK had many nights drinking where people got visibly uncomfortable with me speaking Japanese and being Chinese too. They would relax when i swapped to English and my British accent though.
Wow it's amazing that you grandpa managed to reunite with his brother at a marketplace! He must have been so happy.
It is due to the isolation and difference in North Korean language and culture in comparison to the South I believe.60 Years of total separation has its affects.
Why did you mom banned you from eating the North Korean candies? 
How was your grandfather able to go visit?
Huh, so that's where the racial slur "gook" came from. Unfortunate that such a nice word was twisted around for such cruel purposes.Do you think the American/SK alliance had an influence on the choice "miguk"?
Is that show propaganda itself? I don't know that I've ever viewed NK as anything more than impoverished. To think kids  received free fish with school supplies sounds wildly imaginative. I've been reading into this thread all day I'll have to check out those videos, thanks. 
As a parent I couldn't imagine. The darkness I would descend into...
Yea my parents' generation, they used to have regular evacuation drills and stuff. But they do not Reddit. 
I think most Koreans want reunification-- I, as a Korean-American do.  I'm afraid that that the only way that will happen is via a war where tens of millions die.
As long as Kim stays in power then I don't think there will be reunification, he wouldn't want that because then he wouldn't be treated as God and he would lose all of his authority and power. 
yeah this is what I wanted to ask. Can't imagine that there were actually children receiving these letters, NK government probably wouldn't allow it.
They probably didn't want to tell children anything worse. 
I think the difference is that North American media focuses on DPRK's leadership, while it seems like the people in ROK focus on the people of the DPRK.  My perspective on the North American obsession with DPRK villainy ends at it's leadership and government.  I feel for the North Korean people and wish they could be reunited with their families in the south.  
I heard there's a lot of prejudice towards NK defectors trying to find work at SK. People don't trust them and think of them as a lower class. Is that true? I would seem opposite of what you were taught in school growing up, that they just need a helping hand.
>What I always thought it was weird is that North Korea is portrayed as a crazy villain in North America Media. Have you even paid attention to North Korean messaging?   That's certainly the message they try to convey.  Plus they seem mostly to interact with the world in crazy villanous ways.  Kidnapping  foreign stars (and random seabathing Japanese)?  Assassinating people?  Selling drugs?  Counterfeiting U.S. currency?  Those aren't things normal governments do.   
People forget that South Korea was once a fascist dictatorship.
For younger generations, the consensus is to stay where they are now. SK people sacrificed a lot to get to where they are economically and does not want to lose their sons/brothers/fathers to war.My perspective is that the country must be united once again. Depends on what party takes over the government. If liberal, peaceful merge. If conservative, hit me and we will hit you back harder. However, both parties have aims to reunite. Just different methods
Well, we had to watch the videos of those kids and we felt bad for them. It hits you hard when kids who look like you and speaks the same language dies off from starvation
I was always told (living on US) of "starving kids in Africa".    I actually wanted to send them my half eaten bowl of cereal, and got upset when my parents told me it was impossible.   
They did, but not the people. Implication was that NK people are just "hypnotized" by communism ideology and needs to be save.
My parents were strict about speaking Korean in the house. I watched Korean news and debate programs to get more sophisticated vocabulary. Its hard to be bilingual. I can write full college level essays and speak both languages, but it took me a long time to get to that level. I still have the weekend hangover from speaking Korean all during the weekend and try to get my English together on Monday morning.
And do South Koreans even want North Korea back? 
I don't know when you were stationed in Korea, but younger generation does not even seem to care nowadays
which part of Seoul were you visiting? I find it hard to believe people were visibly uncomfortable with someone speaking Japanese, there are Japanese tourists everywhere.
She didn't trust it. Said something about not being regulated or something
No. Probably from the Chinese character for the U.S. which means "beautiful" and is pronounced "Mei" in Chinese. Same character is likely pronounced "Mi" in Korean. 
Same here but my mom and dad defected from Dresden in 79 and made it to NYC via Italy and Portugal on forged documents. Crazy to think. 
It would be awesome if South and North Korea unified like we in Germany did, but I wouldnt expect it. The leaders of the DDR are quite different to the leaders of North Korea after all.But you should never stop to hope.
I mean Korea transformed so completely during their lives, can I ask how they talk about this transformation and how the country was under the elder Park, or how they use industrial tools that they might not have had as children if they were especially poor?
I could potentially see a coup of sympathetic North Koreans finally overthrowing them.
Not to mention the fact that, you know, he's committed war crimes and will probably end up in prison for the rest of his life and/or executed.  Pretty sure he mostly doesn't wanna die. 
<3 I for one am glad I got the chance to follow in my grandfather's footsteps and stand beside you guys against the North. You were amazing hosts and I'd love to return one day.
Would you mind describing some the differences in culture and etiquette?
Oh believe me I feel awful for the North Koreans, I just expected the view of them in SK to be much more bitter and it cheered me up a bit to see that. Those people are fellow humans that need to be helped. We can't hate them for their leader. Not everyone in Germany in the 1940's was a Nazi
That could be the case. We definitely don't tell our children about the atrocities we've committed in the US until much later
there is a good reason for that. in the rather cruel and gruesome korean war about a third of the north korean population died.its easy to make fun of north koreas paranoia and hatred for the US when its expressed by a silly looking fat kid, but there are few countries and societes that were devastated to such an extent as (north) korea by us bombs and napalm.
By people do you mean South Koreans?  The demonizing of North Korea was probably done under the exact dictatorship you're talking about.  The people today are not ignorant of the dictatorships, and are very much resentful about it.  This is especially so after the impeachment of the recent corrupt president, who was the daughter of the dictator.
When I was talking to people who worked for reunification efforts in Korea, I heard that often times Koreans from abroad feel more strongly about reunification than native Koreans. He stated that unfortunately many people in Korea have become ambivalent towards the idea of reunifying. Would you say that's accurate? 
How much of that kind of footage exists? It seems like something NK wouldn't allow to be shot, let alone let out of the country.
My father, who grew up in a communist country, was told of the poor starving kids in America.
I'm European and I said the same thing. Then my dad said: "If you don't start eating quickly, I'm not sending food to Africa, I'm sending you off to Africa!" So I ate.It's about acknowledging the fact that you are in way better position than a lot of others in the world and being picky while other kids don't even have water or normal food is ungrateful to those who provided you with that food.But good luck explaining that to a 7 year old.
I once put my leftover bread in an envelope and my grandma "mailed" it to Africa to feed the kids
For me, it started out as, "starving kids in China," and then morphed into "starving kids in Africa" as I got older and China grew more prosperous and developed better food security.
Lack of modern healthcare (for the common man), food shortages, oppression, and lack of clean water most of the timeAll of that would cause us to freak out and do something if it was in a nation that would allow us to help but ug NK
hey man. How's your family doing after the whole government fiasco? I had people I was familiar with go into pretty bad situations because of it
Can you imagine the "re-education" programs that would have to happen, with all the people who are brainwashed into believing the god like status of Kim Il Sung, etc.  Funny story, after the German defeat in WWII, the allied government in western germany tried to have a "denazification" in which they would penalize and not allow former nazi party member to be in civil service jobs, but eventually the program was scrapped for a variety of reasons, one being that there were too many former nazi's.  Wonder how it would go with North Korea. 
Older gen: yesYounger gen: look at West Germany, our economy is gonna collapse
It was 2001, so 16 years ago. Times change fast so this wouldn't surprise me at all. I had hopes that the South Koreans would help the North Koreans if given the opportunity.
That's an amazing story. It sounds like your father has been through a lot. I'm glad to hear your family is together and I'm sorry that you face discrimination now. I hope South Koreans will get more education about North Koreans so they are not scared of them.Do you know anyone else from North Korea apart from your family? I wonder if you would become friends and support each other.
Very reasonable to say that, since there's not much science going on there, god knows what kind of food regulations they have over there.
> sympathetic North Koreans:\
> Pretty sure he mostly doesn't wanna dieIf he were to step down willingly, I am quite certain there could be an offer of amnesty and nice retirement package. If he is deposed, he will likely be killed in country long before he gets an opportunity to face war crimes trials (which is likley why Uncle died). Whatever amnesty is granted, it won't be the same as being dictator for life, so as long as he believes he can keep it together, he won't surrender. 
There's really no reason for south koreans to be bitter. You have to remember the split was ~65 years ago. A lot of people still have family in nk. During the war many families were split up because only some were willing to make the trek through dangerous conditions to escape north korea. My grandma had to cross through war zones at the age of 11 with her parents so we technically still have relatives over there. 
Well the view on reunification is pretty divided in SK. Let's not forget that they were under a military dictatorship as recent as the 80's. SK has quickly turned themselves around and become an economic power and there are still a lot of people who remember what it was like when SK was dirt poor. Because of past financial hardships and their recent economic turnaround there are a lot of South Koreans who are hesitant to reunify due to the strain it will put on the SK economy.
Japanese internment camps, trail of tears 
Most times it's not even explicitly told to them, regardless of how old they get. The only way you can find out about most of it is through research, since nobody wants to talk about the awful things their country has done in the past. It's always so interesting to learn about history from multiple points of view. It starts to show you how much history differs based on who is telling it. 
The fact that she was elected in the first place suggests the resentment is not as total as you suggest.
Maybe more like East and West Germany. Merging once  the government one one falls. 
I guess the same way actual photos we get from tourists that go there. Risk their freedom to get unauthorized shots. 
It dosn't have to be recent footage. NK was a fairly normal Soviet regime until 1990 or so. After that it went into Hermit mode. But before many Russian, Chinese tourists and visitors could go there. Presumably they filmed stuff. Other footage could be propoganda, accurate but staged. Both NK and SK have been "at war" for 60 years. Plenty of time to get footage.
He wasn't entirely misplaced. Tens of thousands of inner-city youth were and still are starving. And I understand that the Soviets in particular liked to portray the problems of racism and black poverty as endemic of the inequalities of the capitalist system. It was a "you may not have much, but at least you're not left to fend for yourself like those poor people capitalism brushes aside". 
It's just how you phrase it. Don't form a causal relationship between the food they waste and people not having enough. The finish your plate mentality isn't healthy anyway.
For me was always Africa. My mom gave me a kids book that had a spin wheel on it and on the spin wheel was an about 70% chance of hitting a third world country and it was supposed to say how lucky you are for not being born in shitty countries. She made me spin it if I didn't eat all my green beans.
A lot of people buy in bulk because it's cheaper than individual portions and can last longer. Poverty mindset is hard to get out of.
Biggest is food shortage. During famine, cannibalism happens often in rural areas. Also if 1 person defects, public execution for all family members left behind
Isn't there also huge mineral wealth and industrial capacity in North Korea though?  I'd expect the Unified Korea would be a powerhouse similar to Japan (probably more powerful economically) 
German here: Our economy didnt collapse! The east drags us down a bit, but overall it works out.
West Germany didn't collapse when reunification happened. Germany is a thriving and powerful economy and was that way before reunification just as SK is today
I mean like a general or something secretly wanting to end the regime.
They are the kind that will send millions to their death before making personal sacrifices.
Hell, there are people in the Republic of Ireland who are concerned about the economic impacts of reunification with Northern Ireland and that situation doesn't even touch that of the Korean Peninsula. I'll give those South Koreans a pass. It's an absolute clusterfuck of a situation. Although in both cases I think reunification is ultimately the best decision. What's a few years/decades of economic hardship versus fostering an unnatural divide amongst a people that doesn't need to exist. 
I'd say slavery is quite a big one
I've seen this said elsewhere and it confuses me and makes me wonder if education has changed. I certainly learned about all the atrocities against the Native Americans and slavery. We didn't get all the grisly details in elementary school, of course. But we did in high school. This was 25 years ago though.
Unfortunately, yes.  Although it has heightened definitely since then.  There are people who regard her father as a great person, since he was the only dictator that used his absolute power for "good" (for certain people).  People who lived during his rule, that benefited from it, still hail him.  Even today, there are protests by older conservatives calling for the decriminalization of the former president.  The rest of us are hardly sympathetic, and a lot of this resentment is also being carried on to such people.
To add a similar perspective to this from Cyprus, divided into 2 by Turkey in 1974: The efforts are very much geared towards reunification but amongst 20-40 year old who have lived in this situation all of their lives there is a lot of worry about how much the economy (especially) will be affected in trying to unify with a state that is very much lagging behind. I suspect this is many times more pronounced in the NK / SK story
I suppose there'd also be the lingual gap between North and South Koreans as well. Because of how isolated North Korea is from the rest of the world, even from its southern neighbour, there is beginning to be a noticeable difference between the dialects spoken by the people on either side of the border.
It would probably be a million times worse than Germany's reunification.  East Germany was backwards and poor but nothing like the disparity between the Koreas.
I could never see them doing this especially with Kim Jong Un in power 
The tourists are only brought to Pyongyang and other areas which are permitted.  The tourists don't get to see the real North Korea, the villages, or obviously the forced labor camps.  
> And I understand that the Soviets in particular liked to portray the problems of racism and black poverty as endemic of the inequalities of the capitalist system. They got many things wrong but this isn't one of them. 
> The finish your plate mentality isn't healthy anyway.Why, if I may ask?
Did this book also have a package of rice in it with a semi metallic cover? 
Definitely. If it's non-perishable (canned, frozen, dry) I buy in bulk. Otherwise not. Very little waste, and it's much cheaper buying rice in 10 kilo bags instead of little cardboard boxes.
What does buying in bulk have to do with "poverty mindset?" If you have the space to store it and will use the item buying in bulk is smart.  
:/ fuck me
Excellent point. I'm sure SKorean realtors would get excited too.
There was a 3:1 GDP per capita ratio between West Germany and East Germany. Between North Korea and South Korea it's something like 40:1.
But the situation in NK is a lot worse, people don't even have enough to eat. 
As if an economic depression is a good reason to keep people living in a totalitarian gestapo state.
Those at the top got there due to being complicit in the regime's practices, self-interests, and bootlicking.  They're not all of a sudden going to have an epiphany about altruism and risk their life to save the peasants.  Furthermore, a coup would take more than just one general-- it would take a group of people all risking their lives and the lives of their families for generations to come.  Why would they take that risk when they're generals with the best lifestyles already in NK?
That's really awesome. I think I only had one teacher who emphasized how terrible internment was. 
A few years back, I was at some function where an elderly woman spoke of her experiences growing up in an American WWII internment camp. She was probably late 70's/early 80's Japanese American that never considered herself to be very Japanese as she was born and raised on the American Pacific coast and spoke better English than I do. The part that stuck with me was how she talked about how she could never understand why they were there. 
That sounds a lot like my knowledge of reunification Germany
I agree, I recall reading from several sources that regardless of the problems in communist East Germany, their quality of products and volume of production was better per worker than just about any other communist bloc nation. I personally believe it was due to the German culture. NK has been more completely transformed in such an entrenched fashion, I think the difficulty of orienting their population into any kind of a modern economy would be profoundly difficult. I do not believe the pre-communist NK culture had a society as modern as the pre-WWII German example.
Are those areas visible on like google earth?
Starving ethnic minorities? I don't think the Soviets really should have thrown stones that way
Because you may well end up overeating by feeling obliged to finish your plate. I've seen American portion sizes in some restaurants; some of them are far, far bigger than I would ever get for myself at home.More to the point, if it's a house dinner, I'd find it better to bring items out and serve them out for yourself, then come back for seconds if you still want them. Any leftovers can then be saved for breakfast/packed lunch/quick dinner the next day because they're still clean, helping to reduce food wastage too.
And if someone commits a crime, 3 generations of their family have to be held in concentration camps 
Also, crucially, the West Germans were very highly educated. That's one thing the Eastern Bloc did get right. Building physical capital is easy once you've already got human capital.That sure as hell ain't the case with North Korea, especially because malnutrition as children stunts people intellectually.
No, but a giant war may be...
You're thinking of Midway.  Pearl Harbor was when the Luftwaffles bombed Ireland.  
Shit, if we give them all semi-auto Barretts, that would probably fix itself pretty quickly.
>Real-world politics doesn't work like fictional stories.>Or hell, after this last year, maybe they do, I don't know.I think it is important to note that although something has happened in the past, that doesn't mean thats how it will happen in the future.Circumstances change :)
People at the top may live a more luxurious lifestyle, but they are also in more danger as the Kim dynasty regularly "purges" the ranks of anyone they have the slightest suspicion of. It's possible that at some point Kim Jong Un will leave the wrong person with nothing left to lose, then it's just a matter of deciding if they like their revenge hot or cold.
My 2nd grade teacher was actually born in one. That's all she ever told us, I guess we were too young to get any real details
My understanding is that the culture, wealth and education gap between North and South Korea is way more severe (now) than the gap between East and West Germany was in 1989.FWIW, even now it's pretty easy to tell East and West Germans apart if they're above a certain age (~ 35)
I would imagine that the reunification would be more like nation-building after a fallen dictator. SK would have a lot of help from Western powers if NK government were to collapse. It would take time, but I don't think it would harm SK's economy in the long run.
I mean, NK was way behind the curve 25 years ago. Since then, they have additionally missed the internet age. Can't even imagine how that would go...their infrastructure is as behind as their culture. The problem if the longer this goes on, the more incompatible they become. One might point out that Cuba is similar, but they seem far more aware and open to the rest of the world.
It probably had more to the fact those people that were absorbed and running industry started from the height of German industrialism to their date. They were already well educated and highly skilled.
No, they just look like low-resolution brown and green. Same with large parts of Africa, unfortunately- I wanna see some elephants from space 
I have always wondered how they determined 3 generations. Like if the women don't have kids are they raped?
Yeah, at least the East Germans were well educated and had enough to eat, they just were like 2 decades behind in societal development and weren't used to personal freedom or an open society. North Koreans are neither well educated or well fed, and are close to a century behind.
You're thinking of Iceland. Ireland was where 99 Luftballons bombed North Korea.
> will leave the wrong person with nothing left to lose,I think you watch too many movies.Hard to picture a 60 year old aristocrat *John Wick*ing a whole government.
> it's pretty easy to tell East and West Germans apart if they're above a certain ageHow?
I still remember that picture of the Wartberg being passed by a Mercedes or Porsche on the Autobahn after reunification.  Very iconic.  
Keep in mind China lives next door. I doubt they'd be thrilled about American GIs handing out freedom on every North Korean street corner...
My understanding was that most of the time these family lines simply end in the concentration camp. The women are often raped, though not specifically to create a third generation.
Not a movie but a tv series called Black Mirror. The episodes are like an hour long, and focus on technology and psychological torment. Totally a fucked up show.
Threads. Especially as I live in Sheffield where it's set
Prisoners.  It had me terrified and on the edge of my seat the entire movie.  It was every parent's nightmare.  I am not even a parent and I was worried for my children. 
One Hour Photo - Robin Williams is a nightmare.
Frailty.  
Jacobs Ladder. Without a doubt, the most thrilling horror movie I've seen. 
Misery - No need for jump scares. The terror comes from Annie's swift changes in mood, and suddenly you find yourself fearing for Paul's life. 
Eraserhead gave me nightmares for a couple of days.
The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre - those long, still shots where the horror just comes into frame and you are helpless and can only sit and watch as it unfolds.
Silence of the lambs.  Most of the violence isn't even on the screen. But because we don't see it we started putting it together in our heads. Hopkins and Foster sucked me into that movie and had me looking over my shoulder for days.
We Need to Talk About Kevin.     Don't look up anything about it, just watch it. More horrifying than scary, though, TBH.edit- fucked up the title  edit2- should be on Netflix (US, anyways) for those who want to watch it.
Although the second half of the movie resorts to some cheap scares the first half of 'The Descent' is terrifying.
Mothman Prophecies to me was quite scary. Also, Coherence which is a really low budget movie gets me quite anxious and scared when watching it because I can imagine myself in their shoes if that stuff were to happen to me on a normal night. It is on Amazon Prime if anyone is interested if you like relativity and alternate reality stuff. 
Rosemary's Baby with zero jump scare scenes
The Shining. While less scary and more intense and dreadful, it's still awesome.
The Last House on the Left. The 70's one is great but the remake is pretty solid too. The idea of knowing your temporary houseguests harmed someone close to you is an interesting idea. Made me think about what I might do in that situation.Oldboy is a good example of this too. The more you think about it, the scarier it becomes.
Se7en (David Fincher). Saw it when I was 12 or something, barely slept for a week
Session 9. It's what you never see that really gets to you.
John Carpenter's the thing.
Zodiac scared the absolute fuck out of me.
Not traditionally a horror film but terrifying in a different way, Bone Tomahawk.
Coraline, that movie is scary
The Girl Next Door. Not the comedy one, the other one loosely based on Sylvia Likens.  Poor girl got mutilated and raped to death orchestrated by someone who was supposed to be a caregiver. 
Event Horizon. Sam Neil's a legend.
A Spanish film called El Orfanato (The Orphanage). 
Black Swan. A slow descent into madness is creepy and realistic and totally within the realm of possibility for most people
The original Blair Witch project. The fact that is was the first "found footage" and you never saw the witch or anything because it was always off camera was freaky. Plus I remember when everyone left the theater the fact that everyone thought that was real footage and not a movie. 
VideoDrome
It follows was pretty good at creating a creepy atmosphere. 
The Fourth Kind pretty much did it for me. But I'm a sucker for "realistic" alien movies. 
Identity and 1408.  Very underrated films.
"The mist" was very good for this. All about suspense and the idea of not knowing what was out there, and the ending.... Very good
The VVitchThere's *one* jump scare in the film, which doesn't involve any horror at all. It's a fantastic period piece and creepy as fuck
For me.....i dunno about 'scariest' but as much as people shit on M. night Shamalananan, I thought SignsIt had good tension. There was a lot of quietness in the movie which made the atmosphere more creepy, almost like you're on the edge of your seat feeling like they might jam the volume up high as shit to scare you, but they never do. To this day, i'll never forget how scary it was when they show that video of the birthday party and the footage capturing the alien walking by. I still won't watch that movie alone.
Nightcrawler had me on the edge of my seat.It's a diffrent kind of scary...
The Strangers. The fear of being hunted is just fucking awful 
Creep.This one left me with a feeling of dread for days afterwards.
For those who don't know, the show got its name from the way our devices resemble black mirrors when they aren't active / with their screen(s) locked.
I just watched this last week.  Wow!  Some of the stories stuck with long after. 
I watched this once. I won't watch it again. It was so well done but that heavy feeling stayed with me for days. 
Worked as a CVS photo technician when this came out.It was extra creepy for me because I realized how easy it would be for someone to be like that.I had been working there less than a year and already had so many people that I knew much of their family history and insight into their family vacations.
And people call this a "bad" Robin Williams movie. I think it was amazing. The only gripe I had was that they decided to weakly explain why he was the way he was at the end (molestation). I think it would have been fine to just leave it as "he's obsessed with this family and wants to be a part of it, and despises Will for betraying his family." 
There are a few jump scares, but in the context of Jacob's Ladder they don't seem cheap and they are legitimately unsettling.
The fucking shaking head in  the rear car window. Fuck. That. 
I believe I stopped watching that movie right after that lovely part where his wife gets fucked to death by a demon in front of him...
The book is like that as well. Even when she's being "sweet" you're on edge because you know she'll change in a snap. Such a haunting book. Need to see the movie.
Talk about a movie that's hard to watch again... just because of the sense of impending dread.  You just feel greasy watching that movie.
I've always loved how that movie just gets right to it and people start dropping like flies.
SPOILERS: I love how the original TCM ends. The final two shots make the film for me. The shot of Sally screaming in the back of the pickup truck as Letherface dances in the sunset. I use the term dances here because that is the best way to describe it. It is almost beautiful. The tagline to the original film is "who will survive and what will be left of them?" Even though Sally escapes, you are left asking what will be left of her? How can she go on after seeing what she has seen? Then to see Leatherface dancing almost triumphantly. I love that ending.
Somehow, even with me being a morbid kid born in 1974, I didn't see the original TCM until like 2003.  I really expected it to not hold up after decades of derivative works and desensitization, but it did.  That movie is horror art.
even though i love the film, it has plenty of jump scares, but they're done in a much better way. 
But that film has one of the most amazing jump-scares in cinema. You know, with the bag.
Ted Levine was so crazy as Buffalo Bill it really makes you wonder if it impacted his personal life. If he wasn't married at the time it must have been tough getting a date.  Who wants to date the guy who played Buffalo Bill. 
(Mild spoilers) The only actual "jump scare" I remember involves them mistaking the cat for the Alien. And that serves a different purpose than to be a cheap scare, obviously.The true horror is the lurking sense of dread that's there for the majority of the movie.
I don't know if you play video games at all but if you're a fan of the original Alien movie, then Alien: Isolation is a must play. 
Un, dos, tres, toca la pared...
And now that guy is The Flash. What were they thinking? Giving Kevin powers like that.
His mother. I don't think I've felt sorry for a character more than her in a film.
"We Need to Talk About Kevin".
I don't know why, but I always confused it with a comedy that had a similar title. (Or maybe not even that.) I was expecting a good laugh and was weirded out when I got Tilda Swinton.... and then it only got more horrifying.
Ok I literally just said the big jump scare in The Thing was the best of all time. But I take it back. The one in The Descent is the best of all time. It was literally the climax of the movie. 
Yeah that film still has me noping the fuck out of any caving expeditions a good ten years on. 
Oh man, I forgot about that movie!!! Mothman Prophecies scared the shit out of me as a teen, and then they casually add that it's based on real events? I just wanted to get that movie the fuck away from me forever. I gotta watch it again and see what I think of it now. 
The part where the kids are in the closet toward the end literally made me hyperventilate in the theatre. 
Oh, man, this deserves to be higher.The section where the husband comes back from the war, seems like he knows what's really going on, but is still haunted by having been there. Then has to go "back."Made me shudder.
Same, that was a damn good movie
The bathtub old woman is still one of the scariest things I've ever seen. That and the typewriter scene, which is one of the most clever and iconic horror movie scenes ever I reckon.
To be fair, I can think of at least one jump scare in that movie.[Specifically, when the cop is hovering over the junkie's face and he wakes up](/spoiler)
The one part of that movie that always gets me in the last session tape where the doctor asks "Where do you live, Simon?" and the response is "I live in the weak and the wounded." 35 years old making my husband check under the goddamn bed and shit...
I've watched that movie. Once. I bought it. It still has the plastic on it. Every time I think about watching it, I get this ridiculous sense of dread and decide not to
Hands down the best acting by a Dog, EVER.
Well there is the part where the defibrillators go straight through that guy's chest.  Or the scene where they're testing the blood.  I guess what's cool about the movie is they basically tell you a jump scare's about to happen but it still always gets you, and they don't ever really feel cheap.  So, after writing all that I guess I totally agree with you. 
That last scene when they're in the basement was the scariest fucking scene I've ever watched.  And nothing happened!  It was just the tension and the realization of standing in a room all alone with a killer.
same, i'm not sure you would even call it a horror movie. but that scene where he stabs the two people having a picnic was the scariest shit ever and it happens in broad daylight. 
Making up a song about Coraliiiiiiiiiiine!First half of this movie I was like, "Pshhh this shit is for kids. Was my friend high recommending this as a scary movie?"Second half of the movie had me on the edge of my seat and gave me the kind of goosebumps that last for hours after it was over.
I didn't really like the movie when I saw it when I was like 14 but the final act with [the mom](/spoiler) is batshit insane and I love it.
The book went for a few jumpscare illustrations.
Ugh I can't do sexual violence films they make me so queasy
Peters: Justin open the doorJustin: Did you hear it?Peters: Yes, yes i heard it, do you know what it is?Justin: It shows you things, horrible....thingsPeters: What does?Justin: The dark inside me from the other place. I wont go back there, i wont.Peters: No baby bear, come on open the door. You stay with me Justin.Justin: If you could see the things ive seen you wouldnt try to stop me.Peters:Thats not you talking. Open the door.Justin activates airlock.Sends chills everytime i see that scene
That movie has a boat load of over-the-top jump scares.
I was so afraid during that movie that i honestly felt like i would die if i didn't stop watching it.  So i had to finish it the next night.
I'm sad TBWP is so low down the list. Easily the scariest movie I have seen.
That doorway part though. Fuck.
Hell of a film score as well!
I saw this movie on the last day it was in the theatre. I was the only one in there. I knew nothing about it. I just assumed the footage was real. At the end, I was so terrified that aliens were real that I sat in the parking lot on Google for 20 minutes making sure that movie was fake. I'm a grown ass man, and I don't scare easily (or much at all, really). To this day, I have tricked 4 of my friends into watching it with the pretense that the footage is real. 2 of my friends - also grown ass men - had nightmares. Good times. 
I didn't really have any idea what I was getting into. I feel like the trailers did a good job of giving an overview without spoiling how intense it was going to be.
That movie kept making me second guess myself. When it started, I just knew Goodman's character was telling the absolute truth about the outside world. Then about halfway through, I wasn't so sure anymore, despite the evidence, or that it was something much different than what he described. I went back and forth a couple more times until the climax/reveal. ETA: this is probably a credit to the marketing team for not spoiling anything and yet still making it seem like something I wanted to watch.
The part where [Emmet died] (/spoiler) was one of the most unexpected things I've seen in a movie. 
I was pretty hyped about this movie after seeing the teaser trailer and I was not disappointed. I'm used to seeing Goodman play the "good guy" because he has such a warm voice and a great "dad" kind of demeanor, but WOW can he play the villain.
1408 has something for everyone. Are you afraid of heights, tight spaces, drowning, burning, freezing, dead bodies, ghosts, being drugged, or simply losing your mind? If so, then there's a bit in the movie that will make you uncomfortable. It's a hell of a trip. Definitely one of my favorite movies. 
If I remember correctly, Jake Gyllenhaal only blinks, like, three times in the whole movie...
"Why are you doing this to us?""Because you were home"*shudders*
also when the wind blows, the saddest cartoon movie ever
"Attack warning red! Attack warning red!"Threads is terrifying, The Day After is a movie for children in comparisonEdit - typo
Robin Williams is typically light hearted a goofy in movies, especially since he is a career comedian. They probably walked into this not knowing to expect a different kind of performance, only to learn that Robin Williams is an extremely malleable actor that is extremely talented.I don't think people expected Robin to play such a creepy character, so they wrote it off as bad when really it's a fantastic movie.
Some actors become the character, and some characters become the actor. One Hour Photo and Insomnia are two roles where Robin Williams stepped out of his own persona and really became the character. Maybe people were expecting the usual Robin Williams performance, but I thought his acting was good in both movies particularly because it showed that he has more range that most directors utilized.
I've bought a cheap Jacob's ladder and I agree they are surprisingly unsettling 
Kathy Bates nailed it. 
What's truly haunting is that Stephen King wrote Annie to be a metaphor for his drug and alcohol problem at the time. This is a quote from him on the character:> Take the psychotic nurse in Misery, which I wrote when I was having such a tough time with dope. I knew what I was writing about. There was never any question. Annie was my drug problem, and she was my number-one fan. God, she never wanted to leave.
greeheeheasy
It was 100+ degrees the entire time they were filing it in Texas. The movie sweats. The terror is sweltering. 
That's why it's so scary.. There's seemingly no motive for the killings. They just like to kill people!
> Then to see Leatherface dancing almost triumphantly. I love that ending.He was really swinging that running chainsaw around pretty dangerously.  Someone needs to talk with him about safety in chainsawing.
Anthony Hopkins had only 16 minutes (some say even less) of screen time and won an Oscar for it, one of the shortest. He played the part so well.I'm also a fan of the TV series Hannibal, not quite as good as Hopkins, but Mads Mikkelsen plays the character pretty well too. 
When Lecter makes Migs kill himself just by talking to him through the bars of his cell, you really understand how evil and cunning the bastard is. Super creepy.
That scene is a perfect tapestry.Starling is in control, barely. She is terrified but has to stay in control, if she looses herself to the fear she's done.Bill has no fear, but has long ago become lost to something else. Bill is not in control. He savors what's happening. He cocks the hammer of his revolver almost sensually.Starling reacts to the click too fast for him. She rides her adrenaline, she stays in control.  Just like her doctor told her to."...when you gaze long into the abyss. The abyss gazes also into you."
I dunno, I'd marry me. I'd marry me so hard
Agreed, Stottlemeyer really nailed it there.
The crawling around in the airduct Jumpscare is definitely up there...but it's not cheap. You kinda expect it to come.However, the worst part of the movie is when you know it's coming, and you can see it... 
It's why I bought a Vive.That and E:D
Should have been Green Arrow
I love Tilda in it. She was fucking fantastic! I got stressed watching her driving around without saying anything.I am ambivalent about how I feel about her character though. I feel sorry for her but at the same time I feel like she demonised Kevin a lot. I'll stop here coz idk how to do a spoiler tag on mobile and I might reveal important plot points.
That film fucked me up. Everything he did was just cruel and evil but directed entirely at her. All the things he did were done to torment his mother. I have also never felt so sorry for someone in my life.A friend keeps telling me to read the book, I need to get around to that. 
****POSSIBLE SPOILERS**** There's an interesting nature vs. nurture message that could be taken away from the movie. Tilda Swinton's character clearly did not enjoy being a mother, she found it difficult and unrewarding and she missed her former life. Even childbirth was a painful, horrific experience for her, and she had no interest in holding her newborn baby. You could argue that the mother's passive attitude towards her child contributed to him being the way he is, rather than he was born evil.
I didn't know what it was about before I saw it.First half builds anxiety with touches of eerie and possible fantastic elements, and right after that scene, everything devolves to a rush of adrenaline. I love this movie.
The film that The Others was based on, The Innocents (1961) is also excellent, loads of chilling scenes that just unnerve and really get under your skin. Zero jump scares, no blood and guts, just great storytelling. Think I watched the whole movie on YouTube, def worth checking out.
When he is slowly walking up the stairs "Wendy. Let me finish. I'm not gonna hurt ya. I'm just gonna bash yer brains in". And he slides between such an eerily calm delivery to growling and back again in a way that is some of the best acting I have ever seen.
The typewriter reveal is some deeply intense horror
Sesevenen 2: The Sesevenening
Okay, but don't you agree that it's way too good of a film to say it resorts to cheap jump scares? And the jump scares aren't what makes the film so scary imo
It's October...you HAVE to watch it! ...again
Just re-watched this last night on a whim. And goddamn is that dog perfectly CREEPY.
Excellent point.  The blood jumping out of the petri dish is one of the most effective "jump scares" in the history of cinema, frankly.  
In summary - the jump scares are not cheap at all, they are effective and creative af.
and cigarettes. What is also crazy, is he went from Machinist size to Batman size in 3 months.
it is the writing and how they filmed it (it is stop motion after all) really helps, I believe they drop a few frames in the other world scenes for the uncanny effect
It also didn't have that pointless boy character. Coraline did everything on her own (plus cat). There was no "eek save me" moment in the book. She tricked the hand and saved the day. And they left out just how long she was alone while her parents were kidnapped. That's every child's nightmare. 
That's the first completely silent jumpscare that scared the shit out of me.
When the huge guy just walks right in. Scene went from 0 to 100 real fucking quick.
> 2 of my friends - also grown ass men - had nightmares. Those weren't nightmares, they were memories of the abductions. 
I went it pretty much blind, and I'd definitely recommend people do the same. All you need to know is that it's a very, very tense movie - so be up for that.
I was on edge expecting Goodman to dunk him face-first in the acid but no, *pop* and he was gone like that.
It also ended "openly"...and I absolutely loved it. We watch the main character go from absolutely helpless and easily killed to...a heroine of epic proportions giving her a role in future Cloverfield stories. 
Stephen Kings short story of 1408 scared the dogshit out of me.  It was just forty something pages.  But it was psychologically intense.  
hey man, some people are into that kinda stuff.  not me, but...you know, some people...I guess.
No idea, but the way he stares does stand out.
That's the part that really fucked with me.  There are actual psychopaths out there.  This could happen to anyone.
My parents saw 'cartoon' and thought I could watch it. It wasn't until about halfway through the movie they figured out that 8 year old NothingEverWorks shouldn't be watching this and he is now crying uncontrollably because he understood it. Was traumatized for a while over the horrors of nuclear war. 
Kind of like Bryan Cranston. I spent the first few episodes of Breaking Bad wondering why Walt hasn't done anything dumb and goofy yet. 
There are two people in Hollywood who ruined themselves for future roles by playing a monster too well: Anthony Hopkins and Kathy Bates.
Also, in *The Shining*, the hotel and its ghosts are King's alcoholism.  Unlike in *Misery* though, he didn't realize this at the time.  He later said, "I was the guy who ~~had written~~ wrote The Shining without even realizing that I was writing about myself."
Fuckin right, boys.
Oh, boy! Here I go killin' again!
I expected to hate the TV series. But Mads did a great job concealing the monster that his character was with a serene and confident exterior. Some of the CGI and first season "Killer of the Week" stories weren't great, but overall it was FAR too good and high concept for network television.
That's what made Lecter scary. Not the fact that he could easily overpower most people without breaking a sweat. The fact that he *didn't need to*. The fact that, given enough time and the right environment, he could simply convince someone that it was a good idea to let him eat them.
Odd how Levine seems to have been typecast as either a cop/military dude or a psycho in like 90% of his roles after Silence.
I don't understand how videogames still haven't come around to making ventilation shafts scary and suspenseful. The vents are always the safespot in every damn game.
I honestly don't think I could handle playing that game with a Vive haha. It already gave we way too much stress. 
I can't imagine what it must be like to be in her shoes. Even from an incredibly young age Kevin seemed to know what he was doing in regards to how he was around his father, to make it look like the mother was always at fault.   Imagine the mental battle of "my child hates me" and "but he's only young so I must be mad."
READ THE BOOK. it's very good. it's like the move, told through the POV of eva through letters to her husband.
I disagree. She clearly enjoyed being a mother to her daughter. I get what you mean, though. She also seemed to have regretted starting a family and wished for her old life back of travelling and having a lot of fun.
On subsequent watches you'll notice that a lot of the cave creatures are visible in the cave before the big reveal. Usually only partially or for a second, so they look like normal cave fauna to the unaware. Good movie. 
From what I understand, that "dog" was acting like that because it was half wolf and in a terrified state. It was confused and scared, so it went into super quiet stealth mode.
Palmers face just before they test is fantastic. A resigned "Oh fuck."What's more terrifying that it's the Alien impersonating him so well it's got his goddamn mannerisms.
Yes! It scares you because no one, not the characters nor the audience, was expecting Palmer to be the Thing. It scares you with the suddenness and the noise, but also scares you because you come to accept the fact that anyone can be the Thing, no matter how closely you thought you were watching them. It's brilliant.
Steroids are basically magical when used safely.
Check out Kubo and the two strings if you haven't already. Made by the same studio and has a similar animation too. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^(The aunts are also pretty creepy)
In an interview, the guys who adapted it added the little boy so coralline wasn't just talking to herself the whole time. It made for a better movie, but the book was perfect
It caught me off guard. No jumpscares for the entire movie then one out of nowhere. 
I know every other form looked normal but for some reason the huge guy had like no eyes and it was terrifying
Something different is Prisoners. He has a CRAZY stare in that. Basically hes a detective that is assigned to two missing girls case. Although it doesnt say it in the movie, you can tell his character is wired and barely has sleep. 
Kathy Bates seems to have really found her niche in American Horror Story. Love all her AHS characters. 
I disagree. Both Hopkins and Bates were nominated (and won) their first Oscar for playing that monster in 1990 but have gone on to have several successful non-typecast roles including performances that led to more Oscar nominations (3 more for Hopkins, 2 more for Bates). They're both highly respected, versatile actors.Anthony Perkins is a better example of an actor typecast by an early role as sadistic monster in Psycho; unlike Hopkins/Bates, Perkins ~~has~~ was never ~~been~~ able to escape that career-defining role.
Further, he laments that he does not remember writing the book Cujo. He was drunk throughout the entire writing of it
Canadian Trailerpark Massacre
I'll kill anyone!
That first season is some of the best television horror I've ever seen. They did a great job. 
"Why don't you try peeling off your face and feeding it to your dogs?"
Damnit. I swore I'd never watch this one again, but now you have me curious. I've already got goosebumps just thinking about watching that again.
I love the tension everyone else has too in that scene, implying some of them aren't even sure about whether or no they're the alien.
> the Alien impersonating him Major Oscar snub.
I wish I had personal trainers, physicians, and dieticians to show me how to do it properly :(
Donnie Darko is the same - to give the idea he's kinda detached from reality or psychopathic, or perhaps even lost in introspection.
That film is so underrated. Hugh Jackman and Terrence Howard also give amazing performances in it.
I thought she was really funny on The Office too.
Bates' very next movie was Fried Green Tomatoes.  She was nothing but a sweetheart in that one.  Although she does go a little psycho in the parking lot hehe
Halifax Cheeseburger Massacre
I couldn't believe it was cancelled when they announced it, it had amazing reviews, just a small audience. 
> One of my favorite TV editsFu-GET you!!
Absolutely. They caught that a brief amount in the fillings scene in the 2011 version... some of them clearly have that "How the fuck do I even know?!" look on their face (Chris Hulve sure does!)Naules at that point looks like he's just going to die regardless, the reactions and breakdown in the psyche of all of the guys is fantastic."Now, I understand you gentleman have been through a lot lately... but I'd rather not spend the rest of the winter TIED TO THIS FUCKING COUCH!"
Me too, man.. I'm so heartbroken by finding out all my goal bodies were roiders telling me all I had to do was work hard.
Paul Dano, too. He's always solid.
Indeed. Also water boy... She has that honesty that some actors have that even though I recognize her face, I don't have trouble seeing her as the character she's portraying. 
"I'm older and have better insurance". 
Dartmouth Cheeseburger Massacre 
Nothing that good and morbid lasts.
"I'm tired of these monkey fighting snakes on this Monday through Friday plane!"
Seriously though, these guys sold that tension. if this wasn't viewed by everyone at the time as one of those cheap special effects block busters these guys would probably have gotten awards for properly showing that tension and fear from this scene alone.
Then Tom Hardy comes along and says "i did steroids of course" Paraphrasing.

Cheeseburger Picnic Massacre
I just realized I haven't sneezed in about four days.Maybe this is really happening.
probably very quickly. some people have allergies and sneeze a lot-they would notice
I read this about 5 minutes ago and my nose hasn't stopped bleeding since. Please help.
As soon as Kleenex stock starts going down.
People working in hospitals might notice a little quicker, seeing everyone with illnesses stop sneezing at once. My bet would be a couple days, assuming the government doesn't try to cover it up or anything.
/r/AskReddit needs more of these kinds of questions. 
This is the deepest shit I've read all day. I'm perplexed by this. Would we even realise? I can't remember the last time someone sneezed, could it have happened already? when did I last sneeze? OH GOD
Is this like a twist on that movie The Children Of Men"???
What a tortuous condition that could be (if interpreted a certain way): you still felt like you had to sneeze like you normally would leading up to a sneeze, but you never could get the release that comes when you let out that sneeze. Damn dude.
A lot of times I sneeze if I look in the sun's direction, so I would probably realize after a few months. Most definitely by Summer.
I fucking love sneezing. Its a full body instaboner when i sneeze a couple times in a row. I even get jealous when i hear other people sneeze. So i think i'd definitely notice if I or nobody around me sneezed.  Sneeze. 
This is just a decoy. Hiccuping has already stopped worldwide.
OP, how high?
Put me (and several witnesses who know me) in a room with an hour for a cat. They'll spread the knowledge. I'm *extremely* allergic to them.
I'd realize it as soon as sunlight hit me and I didn't sneeze.
There are people in this world that have life long sneezing fits.  They would know immediately. 
The first people to notice will be those who are plagued by sneezing often. And even then they will just be happy they personally arent afflicted anymore and won't consider it to have effected everyone. Even when pointed out, most people will be like "huh, yeah I havnt sneezed in a while. odd" then move on with their life. It's going to take years to decades for a formal study to look into it. 
Oh man, damn, that's a crazy and interesting question. I think there's like a 60% chance that we wouldn't notice for decades. 
Not really. I sneezed 30 minutes ago. Sorry.
> How can someone be happy if their two biggest fears are commitment and dying alone? I don't know what I'm doing with my life> > > > Fuck> > > > Edit 11:18 2/12/15> > > > She just sneezed again. This is a goddamn work of art. Hats off to you. 
This is better than jenny. Keep it coming OP!
individuals, maybe they would think it's odd after a couple days. But having that translate to a global understanding and acceptance is unfathomable.
I doubt so. They of course would realize that *they* had quit sneezing... But how long would it take for them to realize that their friends had also quit? Even then, they'd probably think "wow it's crazy that both of us stopped sneezing" and so on.
You think this is funny but there are like 10 people with bleeding noses reading this and freaking out
Keep me updated damnit!
Eww, I just realized that undoubtedly some people must sneeze while their noses are bleeding.  Now I'm terrified.  Thanks.
my nose is bleeding too now wtf
Holy shit no joke my nose just started bleeding too
How do I guild your comment in black pepper
/u/copious_hyperbole hasn't posted anything in an hour./u/copious_hypebole is killRIP
In my entire life I have never seen a person that realizes they are about to sneeze race for a tissue.
Who the fuck uses kleenex for sneezes?
Good in theory, but as a nurse most people in the hospital aren't really sneezing. My thinking is that a day care worker or elementary school teacher might notice it first. Or someone with a severe allergy to cats or something. 
What an insidious government plot that could be. Truly could be a cover up on a huge scale. Aliens at Roswell, the grassy knoll shooter, and now nobody sneezes anymore. 
This is starting to sound like a Doctor  Who plot. 
It would be pretty hard to cover *that* up, people would be talking about it on social media within a day, and the knowledge would spread quickly.
/r/ShowerThoughts
that's what I'm saying man. 
I sneezed this afternoon, so we're probably good.  For now...
it's like Children of Men but for sneezingit's **Children of Nose**
I have allergies.. I would know within a few days and realize something was up...Edit -added "and"Edit 2 - I didn't realize many other people sneeze all the time... I thought I was bad..  thanks for the comments
Don't panic, I sneezed earlier today. I somehow managed to get some bacon and cheese omelette up my nose and ended up walking around the house looking up at the ceiling with a weird look on my face.When I finally sneezed it all shot out, or evaporated in my nose somewhere.Either way, I sneezed, so we are still sneezing.
My stepson sneezes like a complete knob and insists on making sure the whole house knows about it. Can confirm last sneeze at least within the past 5 hours.
I sneezed today. Rest easy. 
That'd be good. At the end all of the soldiers put their weapons down as a sneezing man comes staggering out of the building. They weep.
No it's like the twist from Shawshank Redemption.
Define tortuous?
Every post is assuming people on reddit will be the first to notice.
I am right there with you. Fuckin love it. Especially when you sneeze like 5 times in succession and your eyes water and your nose just goes numb, like you didn't even have one. 
...has anyone hiccuped?
I wish! At least once a year I have a horribly painful hiccuping episode
I'm guessing he's anywhere from 5'5 to 6'3.
You are the third person to mention this. Can you illuminate? Bad pun was intended, to my dying shame.
HOW DO WE KNOW YOURE NOT LYING FOR ATTENTION
it'd take like a week max.  sick patients that sneeze no longer sneeze.  allergy sufferers no longer sneeze.  social media connects us all easily.  it would get noticed, go viral, and it wouldn't be hard to test the results.  i think you're looking at 3-5 days for the general global community to be aware.
Yep, I'm one of them. WTF
Like me right now. No seriously it's bleeding.
We can confirm that /u/copious_hyperbole is dead to his lack of response.goodnight sweat princ
I just noticed that no one has acknowledged your amazing IT Crowd reference yet and I would like to do so.A+, pal.
I have done this. It gets messy
Guys I think it's spreading, I just recovered from a nose bleed and I could've sworn I just hea
Y'all all need to lay off the blow a bit
I love this. Now I love you. Now I feel like you're suffocating me. Now I need space. Now I met someone else. Now I still want to be friends.
Kleenex suddenly starts being sold exclusively in Adult stores, and advertising on porn sites. Kimberly-Clark buys Vivid Entertainment.
Really? It sounds like people store that sort of thing in jars and boxes.
I do this all of the time
Any sanitary person who doesn't want mucus on his clothes?
Yeah, it would definitely be all the people with allergies first
With 7 billion people in the world, I'm sure there is someone, somewhere, who is doing research specifically on sneezing. Maybe they pay test subjects to sniff pepper and then measure the force of their sneeze, I dunno. Anyway, that sneezologist would notice right away and put the word out.
Well, *someone* is bound to overreact though.  *This lack of sneezing is mentioned indirectly in Revaluations! The end is upon us!*
Yeah no way those non-first world countries would ever notice the lack on sneezing!
They could hire people to pretend to sneeze.

I haven't smoked in weeks and I feel like I've got a contact high from that question
I think you're lying because I can't remember the last time I sneezed. OP is clearly a rogue government scientist that has decided to tell everyone the top secret research that governments perform to maintain control of the world.
I can't wait to see the cinematography for that.  A 10 minute long shot of Clive Owen walking with someone sneezing and everyone staring. 
The Mucous of Men makes *so much more sense*.
...or you are part of the conspiracy!Thanks, Obama...
How do you know that wasn't the last sneeze ever? You could have been the last person to sneeze.
When he opens the box and its his wifes head??
This is so handy. You never have to suffer with the half sneeze that leaves you feeling like you need to sneeze but cant.
I found the sneeze fetishists.
What the fuck is happening here
I had the hiccups a couple hours ago, sorry. 
Playing safe with averages and a range, I see. /u/Dudwithacake, I'm going all in with 5'3.
>  but it'd get mentioned on big internet hubs like reddit or 4chan.DAE not sneeze??
Excellent answer, followed up by an excellent followup question. Imagine if we all had lost the ability to sneeze a while ago, but still had that buildup feeling. You know how much it sucks when you're just about to sneeze and then you can't? So if that just happened every time you would have sneezed otherwise. How would such a phenomenon be interpreted/discussed? "Hey man, you know that feeling when you really have to.... do something with your nose or face or something but then you can't?" "Yeah that sucks I hate that"
I just keep thinking about what it'd be like trying to explain sneezing to my kids. "Daddy tell us again what it was like, in the before-time.""Well, kids, your nose would feel kind of funny for a second, then there'd be like, a nose-explosion that you can't control, and you sometimes involuntarily made a sound like, 'achoo,' and then you just went on with your day.""And what caused it?""Cats, for some people. Pollen. Too much pepper. Sexual arousal, for one guy I knew in high school."
Your nose, of all noses, shouldn't be bleeding! *Oh God it's happening.....*
Mine was bleeding a bit earlier, but I think that was because I accidentally inhaled some powdered benzoic acid in the lab earlier. Hasn't bled since, so it hopefully killed any eggs that were in there.

We can still blow our noses, you know.
You guys don't wipe anything other than sperm and snot? 
The worst is when the tissue box starts getting low and the tissue falls inside the box.Then when you have to sneeze you have be like a fucking ninja to reach inside the box, carefully lift off the next sheet, and pull it back to your face with 1-2 seconds. Anything less than perfection results in grabbing a whole stack of tissues, flipping the tissue box across the table, and sneezing all over your arm.
But who has kleenex always within reach?
"Huh, that's funny, I'm *not* miserable right now. Something's not right..."
And his time to shine would come. He would be world famous, and die surrounded by loved ones and admirers.

2 Kings 4:35>Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.
TIL the Bible has a section about adjusting the value on things
>Revaluations /r/TheyDidTheHolyMath.
They would, but lacking the ability to sneeze, while annoying, isn't life threatening. So while they'd notice, it'd be slower, as developed countries tend to have a higher availability of care and they're likely to have more important things to worry about than lack of sneezing.Not being able to sneeze would be odd, but when you've still got epidemics of TB and Polio, then it's pretty low down the list of things that you report to the WHO.

Then the wife looks up at him and says "Bruce Willis was Rosebud the dead sled the whole time"
and she sneezes??
This actually made me look like a fool many times before I knew about it.  I, too, thought it affected everyone, and more than once when someone said something like "argh I really need to sneeze but can't" I would respond "just look at the sun!"People looked at me like I was fucking crazy, but never said anything.  It wasn't until a few years ago that I learned about photic sneeze reflex, and suddenly felt like an idiot for all the times the above situation happened.
And so it begins.
Then a post asking that would result in answers exactly like in this one."Shit... I don't know... when was the last time I sneezed?"
The next big question is how long before /r/circlejerk picked it up.

The sled in the middle of the room was the jigsaw killer the whole time too.
Apparently it's something they test for in fighter pilots. Can't be colorblind. Can't sneeze when looking into the sun.

we need to start /r/nosneeze as a place to post that you just sneezed. that way, if you're ever unsure, you can check the subreddit to make sure that the world is still sneezing.
I have something very similar but it happens when I'm thinking about making a sexual advance. It's very specific, I can imagine sexy stuff and nothing happens but if I'm lying in bed and I get the idea to make a move on my wife some wire crosses and I sneeze and I hate it.

Google "sneeze Bible".
Why? Please tell me it sounds better in context.
They are both symbolic numbers. 7 is a sign of completion or fulfillment, and 40 is a sign of renewal or cleansing. There are a lot of symbolic numbers in the bible. 7, 12, 40, 3, 6, 50, 10 and others.
And the Lord spake, saying, "Thou shalt sneeze seven times, no more, no less. Seven shall be the number thou shalt sneeze, and the number of the sneezing shall be seven. Eight shalt thou not sneeze, neither sneeze thou six, excepting that thou then proceed to seven. Ten is right out. Once the number seven, being the seventh number, be reached, then wipest thou thy face of thy booger.
40 generally doesn't mean the actual number 40, in context it kinda means "until it's done"/"a large number".
God likes certain numbers. 7 just happens to be one of them. 
**WHAT'S HAPPENING ANYMORE? WHAT'S COMING ON IN FROM THE FUCKING HERE?**

You know you're in a good /r/AskReddit thread when an entire new sub spins off of it. 
As you may have noticed, I am definitely on board with this humanitarian initiative, but also deeply concerned for the fate of our sneezes. I believe we are almost 10 minutes out from our last.
This got weird quick. 
never thought I'd see those particular 3 words in 1 sentence.
If Man is five, and the Devil is six, then God is seven. 
What is this from? It sounds really familiar minus the sneezing part.
Checkmate atheists.
EMINEM IS *GAY*?
9 min old post, did it happen yet?
Yep, Confirmed HL3, picture Lord Gabe sitting at his desk writing dialog for the game windows open listing to Born Free, all of a sudden he has a sneeze attack and sneezes all of his work on HL3 out the window. Now before you have a stroke, know this cant happen now because we are free of sneezing.  
Yes, but now you can join the ranks of the photic vanguard and be forever vigilant...watching and waiting for the day when the sneeze stops.  
^^^**shit**
And of course, the inevitable /r/nosneezecirclebroke.
And when the sneeze cancels it still goes on cooldown, so you need to wait to cast it again.Just infuriating.
Sneezes should be more courteous and call at least 24 hours in advance.
*magical bible sneezing*
Why is the Devil afraid of God? Because God eight nine...wait
11 minutes. It had to have happened by now.
So far just itchiness and stuffiness, no actual sneezing. I also made the mistake of putting on mascara this morning so my eyes are killing me.
Nothing's worse than when you sneeze and you shit
*sneezing magically into the bible*
The government got to him first.
Thought you were a dude til the mascara part. Ehh, maybe you still are.
Early interaction with my boyfriend-Me: "That suit looks great on you. It would look better on the floor."Him: "That would wrinkle the suit."
My then-not-boyfriend and I were waiting at the train station on my train home; he would leave with the bus after it arrived. My train came and I thought 'fuck it' and kissed my then-not-boyfriend on the mouth. Immediately after, I jumped on the train, on which the doors then closed. I didn't see his reaction nor felt it so I sat pretty anxious on the train, thinking I ruined it all. About 5 minutes later, I got a text saying:'That was meant as a friends kiss, right?'Lol, bless his heart. 
Put out my hand for him to hold and he high fived me. 
Last summer I was doing my best to seduce who is my current boyfriend. We were going swimming at a friend's house, and while they were changing into their bathing suits in the house, me and him make our way to the pool.  I take advantage of this moment to strip in front of him, as sensual as possible. (Bathing suit was underneath my clothes.)He runs past me, full sprint, and cannonballs into the pool. 
"You are really cute and I like you" met with complete silence.... Later on that dude told me that he does not accept compliments well. We have already planned the next few dates.
I love to share this one:A long time before my husband and I started dating we were partying in my apartment. He said he was going to crash on the couch. I told him "you can come sleep in my bed".I shit you not he said "well where would you sleep? I can't kick you out of your bed."
Not exactly an answer to the Q but related.I was dating a guy who told me upfront that he was terrible at picking up the signs that someone liked him, was flirting, etc. So on our third (?) date, we planned that he would stay the night at my place. I thought that was pretty obvious, but just to make sure, I put a bunch of condoms on a platter on the bed, with notes all around it, pointing to the platter that said "This is a sign!"He thought it was hilarious. We had sex. It was awesome. 
Hint: "Want to have sex in the shower later?"Response: "sure!"~*later, in the shower, waiting forever, door left cracked open... I give up.*~Question: "Why didn't you come into the shower??"Response: "Oh! I didn't know you wanted me to!"~*crickets*~This has happened more than once.
This girl was sitting with our group of boys and saying "if I was to get with one of you, it would be you [my name]"And I was just like "Ah thanks very much, very kind of you to say that"
Hitting on my now boyfriend of three years. I was complimenting him on how handsome he was and how he had beautiful eyes. I wanted a closer view of them so he texted me this creepy ass shot of his eyeball with his eye as widely opened as possible. He legitimately thought that's what I wanted. After our first date, I immediately started talking about potential future dates and how much fun I had with him. I stayed out so late that I missed my friends party. However, because  I didn't hug him properly and asked to split the cost of the meal, he thought I wasn't actually interested. 
After a conversation with my boyfriend about not being obvious enough when trying to initiate sex, I decided to entice him by posing naked on the corner of the bed and seductively whispering "Hey, you" as he walked in the room.His reaction? He walks in the room, gives me a bro nod, and says, "Hey, babe! I gotta poop."We did NOT end up having sex that night.
All these comments are making me not want to try any hints at all....for now on I'm just going to be straight forward
I was living with my then-boyfriend a few years ago. Feeling a little flirtatious, I suggested we could take a shower together, you know, to save water, wink wink. His response? "Why? We don't pay for water."Shut. Down. 
Asked a guy for his number after a Meetup. Went on a date with him that he didn't realize was a date until his friend that we ran into texted him to apologize for crashing it. Currently sitting on the couch next to him, 3 years later, looking at dogs that are available for adoption. He eventually caught on.
I started talking to a guy who was behind on Game Of Thrones. So I offered to give him my HBO password so we could watch it at his place, thinking it would be a good excuse to hang out. He ends up marathoning the show without me. We're dating now, but he sure as hell not watch season 7 without me 
I was at a party drinking with a guy I had a bit of a crush on. We were joking around and I told him to touch my boob, because he jokingly accused me of padding my bra (since they're quite large).He DID touch them for a second, but then he just kept going on with the conversation. I figured he wasn't interested and I got over it.I think he realized his mistake cause he always made it a point to like everything I post on facebook.
When i was 18 and foolish a girl once asked me if i was into 'role-playing games' I said of course! And promptly started showing her my WOW account... she left pretty soon after.
In high school I sat next to a very quiet guy that I liked and whenever I was cold I made my arm touch his. He would never move but never talked to me other than to ask about class. Ten years later I messaged him on Facebook asking about the reunion and jokingly asked him to be my date. He said sure why not. We've been married for year next month. He said he didn't remember me from high school.
Him: "I dont want to pressure you, but it's pretty late and I think you should spend the night. My couch is super comfortable and I can make it up for you if you'd like.' Me: "Maybe I could sleep in your bed with you."Him: "I promise the couch isn't bad" Brutal.
I asked him if he wanted to go to my dorm for Netflix and chill. We watched Parks and Rec for two hours and then he went home without touching me once.
Not a lady, but I had this girl visit me and sleep with me in the same bed on four different occasions...from half across the country.    I thought we were just friends.    Ten years later I was taking a shit and it dawned on me that she didn't travel across the country just to sleep ffs.    I feel bad for the girl now, because I was really into her too.
One of my employees, whenever she is drunk, (brewery, not just kicking it with drunk employees) will constantly say how cute she thinks I am and how adorable my nerdiness is. Will ask me to go to bars after we close down, or to come over to hers and drink.I pretend every time I don't notice. She's pretty and all, but I like my job.I wonder if she thinks I am that dense. 
LPT: Don't beat around the bush
We were married two full years before I finally understood that if she took a bath at night I was going to get some.  Watched a lot of baseball while she lay sparkling clean in bed alone.
I had a very attractive young lady lay down on my bedroom floor, pull her pants down and showed me her newly installed clit ring.I told her it was nice and shuffled out of the room like the autist I am. Pretty sure it was a hint. I'll never know.
I'm the guy who didn't notice, but I was driving her home (we went to school together and she was on my route), and she started talking about how her boyfriend loves her blowjobs, and how good they are. I was like "lol okay that's cool".Also even if I had picked up on it I'm not a piece of shit so....
When I was 14 or 15 the neighbor girl asked if I had any porn (I did, duh, and on VHS!) and if I wanted to come over and watch it. Absolutely took her up on that offer. And after an hour or so went home with my tape and jacked off. In retrospect she wanted it and I missed the hint. 
I stripped completely naked, played sexy music and started rubbing his shoulders. He didn't even turn around and just asked if I wanted to order pizza for dinner...
Not a chick, but my fiancee  was laying on our bed in her thing and a t-shirt (on her belly) with our "pink thing" (vibrator)  next to my pillow. I came out of the shower and sat next to her an grabbed her ass and kissed her neck...she didn't react and I noticed she was on her Facebook..the digital cock block... So I tried again, nothing. So I sat back and waited like 10 mins and she goes "wow way to miss the fucking hint"WHAT THE FUCK
(I'm the oblivious guy, not the lady.)Before our third(?) date, she said I could stay over at her place if it got late. So we're watching a movie on TV there, and at the end of it, I said "I guess I better let you head off to bed. I'll take the couch."She literally had to say "I was hoping we could snuggle" before I got the hint.
Me: I think you're really cute and I like you. A lot.Him:.... uh, thanks.Accepting this unrequited crush, I decided I was happy being friends with him. 3 months down the line he spent hours comforting me after a disastrous night and then finally confessed he had feelings for me, going back 6 months. When I asked why he didn't say anything when I told him my feelings "but I wasn't sure you liked me"That was 4 years ago, he's still as cute and dense now, and is fast asleep next to me.
My current boyfriend and I started out in this weird friends that flirt stage.  I was trying to find a way to get him to make a move.  One very hot evening (middle of august) we were sitting in his backyard with a few of our friends drinking beer.  I sat on the SAME lawn chair as him, kind of wiggled in, and said "I'm cold".  He left me alone in the chair and proceeded to build a giant fire.  It took like an hour.  When he was finished making the fire he sat back down in a DIFFERENT lawn chair.  
My fiance and I were chatting on FB Messenger near the start of our relationship and it went something like this:Him: I haven't had sex in 2 yearsMe: That's quite a streak, I'd hate to mess it up ;)Him: Yeah it's been awhile....Wait, whatI then lured him into a hotel, fucked his brains out, and now we're getting married.
As a guy, I completely see your hints all the time but I'm afraid that I'm wrong and going to get rejected/made a fool out of myself so I don't do anything.
Wife started to slowly pull my shorts down as I'm playing video games. Tell her she's going to ruin my kill streak. Got punched in the dick
Her: How much do you wank during a week?Me: Well, too much lolHer friend: Haha, we could have sex then, we're also lonely at nightMe: Yeah...Then I just continued on with the conversation because I thought they were joking...2 sexy girls where asking mefor a threesome... And I didn't get it...
I wish I came close to getting any of these opportunities.
For a question that was directed at women, it sure is a sausage fest in here...
I straight up told a dude he had a glorious dick, still didn't get the "hint"
When it's hammered into your brain your whole life that it's creepy and predatory  to get forward with a girl because you think she's into you, you learn to ignore any signal that isn't bright flashing neon. The risk/reward ratio for responding to hints is not at all in our favor. Guys like to say they're just dense, but this is deeply-ingrained cultural training. Sorry ladies, until the culture changes we're going to remain oblivious.
As a guy, here's a hint to the ladies: if it's a hint, it's too subtle.
He probably thought you were going for his cheek and missed. 
Did you expect him to leave you hanging?
God... in middle school me and my best friend watched Scrubs all the time. We'd do a Todd high five in the hallways whenever we'd see each other, and one time the girl I had a crush on put up her hand like she wanted a five, so I smacked her hand as hard as I could and snapped... turns out she was waving to her friend behind me. I had forgotten until your comment.. 
Him: " Oh God, not going to be a guinea pig for that experement."
He was probably hiding his boner
The problem here is that you were hedging against rejection by turning it into a hypothetical, which also made it unclear. 
Gotta give her credit for having the confidence to just start masturbating in front of someone she doesn't know is interested...
Follow up, how do you feel about Hugo Weaving currently?
The only hint that is actually foolproof. Well done.
To be honest, I'd think you were kidding unless I was your SO. It would be too awkward to walk in on you showering and be wrong. 
> morning> walked right past me and looked for coffee in the kitchenYup, adds up. Please come back after 3pm.
Jesus. Back in highschool, I would regularly have coffee at a friend's place. She was one of those people that put a ton of effort into clothes and makeup, so it took her 30 mins to get ready.On several occasions, I'd guess 10 or so, she answered the door in a white t-shirt. Nothing but that, or at least she might have been commando, the shirt was *just* long enough to cover up.I figured she just got up late and hasn't had the time to go through the 30 min routine.FML
The extra "e" turning fiance into fiancee means your fiancee is female. If he is male, it only has the one "e": fiance.
At least you seem like a really polite guy.
I think some cases is about low selfsteem right? I used to talk with a girl online every day. And one day she told me    "I love you".    And I thought "no way someone can love ME", so I asked her    "Is it a joke?"    "Yes"    And then I thought "wait what if she is serious"    "are you sure?"    "yes, it was a joke"    Now I think maybe she felt I rejected her so she just make a save.
I don't get it, who's that Matt? (not joking....please explain)
That sounds like a joke someone would say tbh
>so he texted me this creepy ass shot of his eyeball with his eye as widely opened as possibleMY BRAND
I'm ashamed to admit I did something very similar to the eye thing
> he texted me this creepy ass shot of his eyeball with his eye as widely opened as possibleok that's actually hilarious, dude sounds like he has a great sense of humor
Her: *sends link* Him: "Thanks! I could use this in the future"
That video is hilarious. 
Haha, my boyfriend came over to watch Netflix 3 nights in a row without making any moves on me or reacting to my moves. We watched Wall-E twice. I figured if I restarted it having just seen it, it wouldnt be a distraction. I was wrong. 
this is BY FAR the most hilarious one 
if only you'd said "blow your penis" that might have worked
Probably too focused on not getting an erection to notice hints.
He was in need of oxygen at that time, since before we can speak, we have to be able to breathe.  I'm gonna venture here (thousands of miles away and never having met either of you before) that you took more than his breath away with what you said.:)Source:  Have lived it.:/
We did it Reddit!
WE DID IT! WE GOT ONE GUYS!
Honestly, I would probably do this just because I hate my landlord
I thought the dogs were in your living room for a minute and was confused. See what happens!
I know it was probably more smooth, but the thought of you saying "I could do better than that", pausing, and internally deciding "alright, let me talk about why the Alien would have easily gotten Ripley there" is too funny. 
Liking everything you post on social media is the guy version of dropping hints
if you're doing all that, why not move the inch to kiss him?
The arm thing is too subtle tbh. It could just be you being clumsy. Yesterday a girl I was sitting next to touched my arm three times in about a minute and the first two I thought might have been on accident, but the third time I said "what's up?" And she said that it was an accident. So yeah :/
i do the arm thing too i dont think it works asdf
I don't know what went down or how things ended but you should call this person. Like right now. You can't make up for being an idiot in the past but in 10 years you'll look back at this and think 'why did I never reach out to her after that stupid ex gf drama?'Reread your last sentence and apply that to your current situation dummy. 
I think you may have gotten rejected
Sometimes Netflix and chill just means Netflix and chill... Doesn't it? ...Shit!
I dunno man. I had a lady friend visit me in a different country while I was working abroad, share a bed with me for two weeks, and practically act like a wife with me. I told her I was into her and when I directly asked her if there was anything going on between us she said no. 
Are you a philosopher on the toilet?
Actually I think that one might work.
It's ok...I can literally invite my husband to get in the tub with me, and he doesn't get it. Sigh..
(Voice drifting down the stairs:)*Dear, second and third bases are up here waiting for you!*
Good on ya. Always cut that shit off immediately
It's been eight mins. That's like 6 mins longer than average. For ant killing I mean.
So what happened 
Well, did you?
Rub his penis. Touch the parts that are most involved in sex. 
Plot Twist: She was a ghost that haunted the Gym and therefore couldn't leave
Just tryna get free attention from you.... drop her
Omg reading this makes me rethink all the times I was flat out rejected. Maybe the guys were just dense.
Sadly I think I'm even more bone headed than you. I was sleeping over at a friends after a party when the hot girl I had been talking to all night suggested we sleep on the pull out together so neither of us had to take the floor. We lay down:Her: "You have great lips."Me: "That's really nice, thanks." *rolls over and goes to bed*
But where was the tattoo?
Honestly, good on you for not assuming. 
I mean are you?
Her : I want to have sex with youMe : Thanks.
Love this one. Glad it worked out.
Fire is much more effective at keeping warmth than cuddles. That man's a keeper.
The guy made a fire for you because you said "I'm cold". It took him like an hour.Marry him.
jesus that sounds like what i would do. my thought process would be, hmm she's cold oh i'll build her a fire to keep her warm. aw yea she looks comfy now, better not ruin it by crowding her in that tiny lawn chair, oooh look an empty lawn chair..... yea i did good, i'm so thoughtful!
No man passes up a good excuse to light shit on fire.
Man brain:*"Female, cold. Fire, hot. Female couldn't possibly be attracted to me. Must build fire."*
Oh god that's a hint I'd miss. I have an awful addiction to solving problems like that.I'd build a fire too :(
What the nut are "kiss me" eyes?
My wife and I have worked out a code phrase, for when one of us isn't picking up on the obvious signals. We say, "Howdy partner."It's a quote from Shanghai Noon, and it works like a charm.
Just saying I would do the same thing in his shoes.
No offense but smoking weed and watching saw sounds like the least sexual/romantic thing I could ever think to do
> palms were sweatyKnees weak arms spaghetti
Upstairs and coffee was the old Netflix and chill.
 Can't tell if Seinfeld reference
To be fair, X Movie was insane!!!! I remember waiting in line for hours for that premiere. So freakin nuts!!
I wouldn't have got this one to be fair. In fact, I still wouldn't even think that's an obvious hint even after reading it
> I then lured him into a hotel, fucked his brains out, and now we're getting married.OK but is he still oblivious or no? I reading a lot of mixed signals here.
If that was me, I'd have thought you were being sincere when you said you hate the thought of ending the streak.
You find her and you explain it, you dense mother fucker. I NEED CLOSURE. THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU.
Smerk a jernt
Idk man I feel like this goes both ways right?If you spend months with someone for the purpose of sleeping with them you might want to just say it after awhile haha.
also as a guy, its hard to tell to what extent that hint goesfrom a simple "i think you're a cool person and we should be friends"to a "you're pretty attractive and i wouldn't be opposed to having a relationship"to "perform intercourse with me"to "im being polite and keeping the party vibes up, but to be honest I am indifferent to you."its hard man. i can barely read books 
I think this is the REAL story. Some hints are a little too subtle, but for the most part, men just don't wanna be considered creepy if they're wrong.
As is tradition
Why'd you see his dong 
Rookie mistake I have made before
Definitely
And yet, if I do the exact same thing ONE TIME...
"Better not risk it, could be meant for someone else" 
Hahaha! Okay, I see your point.Counterpoint: I'm married to this guy. And I was married to him on every occasion of the above scenario. :P
Matt's gay
"How about we go back to my place and do what they did in the movie""Oh I'll show you a move or two"*leaves to rewatch the movie to know what you were referring to*
GRAB US BY THE DICKS!
I think the "I'm serious" is an important addition. 
I hear you. I've had bad landlords too. Unfortunately in this particular instance...our landlord was pretty great. 
That's pretty solid confidence. "Yeah I could do better than that and I don't even need to prove it."
I did this for shits and giggles to a friend's dog instagram. I sure hope that dog doesn't get the wrong idea.
Dude. You opened my eyes. This happened to me all through middle school and I blew it off every time. I didn't know that was a hint, I thought they were just teasing me. Which they also could've been doing
Reminds me of a time I accidentally touched a girl's ass 2 or 3 times in the cafeteria line. I kept dropping something, and every time I picked it up, she'd back her ass into my head.Before somebody suggests she did it intentionally, I received a death glare after the second time.
Yep, that's my husband. I've tried being coy and he picks up on it like 30% of the time. I've gotten to the point where I just say "Wanna go fuck?" rather than being coy. Works like a charm.
I killed an ant and she said "thanks, ttyl." Fuck this fantasy world it's outrageously misleading 
If your guy is still not getting the hint, try placing your vagina *around* his penis. With many men this may quickly result in arousal.
You can not underestimate the denseness. 
A lot of guys are very dense or they think maybe you're hitting on them but then they think they are reading too much into it and you're gonna freak out, which is pretty dense, so yeah.
> "That's really nice, thanks." I haven't laughed this hard in ages. That is truly a spectacular fail 
A surprising number of these are young men unsure what constitutes consent, and young women unsure how to grant consent in a way that doesn't disturb the sexual tension. It's almost as if the sexes have trouble clearly communicating their needs and desires to each other because of some unspeakable chasm.
Me: Hahaha. Sure you do. 
Me too thanks 
Worked out?  She has him captured and tranquilized!
Teach a man to cuddle and he'll fuck for one night. Teach a man to fire and he'll fuck for life. 
Seriously. She said jump and he built a plane, overachiever in my mind.
Yup yup yup, she's probably amazed at my fire building mad skillz.   Wait, she's not smiling. Why is she staring at me? Oh shit. Did I take too long to build a fire? Is the fire not big enough? Is it TOO big? That must be it. Oh nonononono. She thinks I'm a wood wasting blockhead.  I blew it. I'm never gonna get a girlfriend. Dude life sucks. I gotta go play counterstrike.*storms out of the chair into the night...*
*Build fire, demonstrate worth. Perhaps then female* will *be attracted to me.*
*Inner man-fire not as efficient as burning wood fire. Proceed with obvious course of action*
It's when the woman is staring at the man thinking "kiss me", and the man is wondering "do I have something stuck between my teeth?"
Mine and my boyfriend's code in public is, "Wanna watch Predator?"
Yea...that's a terrible hint, tbh. That would basically be screaming to me that it was a joke and to turn around/look away/give privacy.
Coffee at 3am is not coffee, coffee at 3am means sex!
"So where are you sleeping tonight?" totally sounds like she's making sure you have plans to sleep somewhere else. If a friend is drunk at your place and you want them gone before they crash there, you would ask, "So who's driving you back home?"
There's no way to tell. Maybe she's just being polite?
Hahaha, I have an SO now so that's a ship long sailed...I also wouldn't know how to find her if I wanted to. Last I heard from our mutual friend, she went to Asia to teach English.
Im laughing way to hard at this
Dont worry. I can mostly read books, and I havent really figured it out either.
We had sex twice, I guess he didn't understand all I wanted was more sex later on 
 >It's like she handed me a one-colored Rubix cube and I still had trouble solving it. And the only color was "SEX." On the bright side, you've certainly got a way with words.
"So she's sucking my dick and I'm here thinking, 'Does she like me, or...'"
YOU'RE CHEATING ON ME???
Okay then that's a missed hint
I have literally dragged my husband by his penis to the bedroom. He's pulled my hair. It's been a fun 10 years.
My first time I swear the entire time up until we were actually fucking, and I mean up until I was balls deep I doubted she wanted to actually have sex and thought it was just some joke and she would stop joking before I did. Welp, neither stopped joking for 3 years after that. 
I dunno... I've seen the movie Carrie. People be evil.
I hate that. Or when you're deep in thought, staring into space and you realize that you are looking right at some girl and it's awkward
We have a code now. "Want to take a nap?" The problem now with two kids, one a newborn, is I'm never quite sure if we are going to sleep or have sex until we get to the bedroom. Usually we have a nap and then have a nap.
Damn that ant died and you didn't even get any 
idk she might just be being polite
It's not even denseness, just a failure to properly escalate. Dollars to donuts says they picked up on it but thought "There's no way, she's just being nice or goofy or whatever".
This exactly. Girls are still under the impression that the guy is just supposed to "act" on his urges and make a move. I've always been worried that I will cross some line that I didn't see thinking I was getting "make a move" signals. Girls, if you want to give signals do something physical like touching his hand or taking his arm. We will 100% get the signal if it's physical rather than verbal.
But what if you're not good looking but can build an amazing fire?!
That, or he sucks at making fires
I knew my LV. 99 fire making skill would one day come in handy [EDIT]: and then you can wrap her in your skill cape to keep warm [EDIT2]: wow, first time getting gold, thanks. May Saradomin forever guide your path:)
Ok so I think I've understood the "kiss me eyes" finally. When I feel awkward that they are staring at me I should kiss them 
"She's staring directly at my face and hasn't said anything for 45 seconds....I don't like this" 
Me and my girlfriends code is "Wanna go to the garage?" Because the first night in my bedroom she said, "So this is your bedroom?" And I said, "No this is my garage."
As a military man, most of my 0300 coffees don't mean sex.They sure feel like it though.
Damn Canadians
You drove her off the continent!
Look at you, Mr. Fancy Pants. I saw a book once. I've never even been close to figuring it out as well. 
"She's probably just being nice, probably feels bad for me or something. It doesn't mean anything."
WHEN I SPECIFICALLY ASKED YOU NOT TO?
You're 100% sure he got the hint? Some of these comments are making me wonder if that was enough.
People suck sometimes, but pad yourself on the back for doing the right thing - even though it backfired
Do you nap first? Or nap first?
Maybe she's from Canada
...guilty of this. When in doubt, I default to this.
Well, yesterday I told a good guy friend of mine that I wanted to have sex with him. Just straight out. He was really surprised but hey, guess who got laid today?
He had to chop down a tree and split it into logs first.
"FIGHT OR FLIGHT"
Here in my garage...
Yeah you really cant tell in this situation. Shes probably just canadain and beig polite.
Sex happened so either he got the hint or just said "fuck it" and decided since the kids were outside and we were in the bedroom, why the hell not? Haha
As goofy as that sound, reading all those comments, I'm starting to think we really need to find a universal code. 
Probably Chris Evans 
When I was 8 or so my old nanny/baby sitter (choose which you prefer) was showing me a video of her time with her boyfriend in Paris. After it blacks out for a few seconds it then suddenly cuts to her lying on her hotel bed completely naked, legs spread, telling her boyfriend to 'come get it'. She jumped out of her seat tried to cover my eyes and told me to never tell anyone. I have now told potentially thousands of random strangers
Was getting a vasectomy and the doctor told me not to look down.I looked down....I shouldn't have looked down.
I was helping MIL cleaning out her closet. All was jokes and laughter until I pull out an unopened massive dildo. We were both paralyzed for a moment before she slowly took it out of my hands and mumbled something about the dildo not being what she tought it would be like and that she ordered it online. She then backed out of the room and threw it in a cupboard. We then proceeded to clean the rest of the closet.I desperately wanted to tell SO about this awkward event but decided to spare him. 
My boss forwarded me an email telling me to do something. I noticed the email chain had his bosses on it so I read through the chain. They had asked him to rate all my co-workers and I from best to worse earlier in the conversation. 
I used to do a little work after school at a local comic shop. One day after school I was bagging comics when the owners buddy came in. "Look at these!  Came out great!"  He had a stack of glossy amateur porn, featuring the shop owner, his buddy, and the owners wife fucking. He laid them out all over the counter and they started pawing through the stack excitedly. From what I could see it looked  like the three of them enjoyed one another's company equally and vigorously. Then they noticed I was there. I got sent home early with a stack of free comics. 
I was driving from West Berlin to West Germany in the late 1980's.  My bf gives me wrong instructions so I have to take an exit off the Autobahn to turn back and get back to the correct exit.  On the small country road on which we found ourselves, we see a large truck with a missile on it, surrounded by Russian soldiers.  They were as surprised as we were, but just laughed and waved at us, as we got the hell out of there as quickly as possible.
My teacher shoving a flask into his desk drawer when I came in unexpectedly.
I was about 8 or 9 and my parents were going to be out of town so they had me and siblings stay with a family from our church. Once we got to the house (which was really nice BTW) they had one rule, you can play wherever you want but the basement is off limits. Me being the little bastard that I was snuck down there first chance I got and was supremely disappointed to only find rows and rows of plants growing under lights.
More heard than seen, but...I was golfing with my mother's fiance when he got a phone call. He had his cell volume turned up really high, and I overheard a woman who wasn't my mother say some things, including the phrase "fuck and suck," in a seductive manner. I convinced myself that it wasn't my business, or that I'd misunderstood, and dropped it.A few years later, her now-husband was revealed to be a serial cheater, with active partners numbering in the dozens.Yes, I still feel like shit.Yes, they're divorced.
Saw a Homer Simpson keychain in my mom's desk drawer. Didn't say anything.Two weeks later its in my Christmas stocking and she goes "Wow, how did Santa know how much you like the Simpsons".Thats how I figured out Santa must've been sleeping with my mom.
Walking in on my cousins railing each other.....Now I understand why they were close at thanksgiving.
When I was younger, my family went to look round a house we were considering buying. Went into the owner's daughter's room and there was a blow up sex doll on the floor, it was really funny but we didn't end up buying the house.
Back in middle school we had this really strange gym teacher about 6'2 and ripped. Me and my friend were going to take a dump and thought that the locker room toilets would be clean since no one used them throughout the day. When we walked in to our left was one big shower room and there was our gym teacher showering while eating spaghetti out of a tupperware container. Thank god he was wearing swim trunks but he turned around and said you guys aren't supposed to be here so we left.
Was playing at my friends house once. His grandparents were staying in his room, and I forgot. Totally ran in on them getting ready to have sex. It was awkward. 
I saw a couple banging under a secluded water fall in the woods on a hiking trip with my parents when a was 12.  Majestic AF.
I was working the night shift doing post production on a well known reality show. I walked into the men's room and found our (lady) boss bent over the sink getting fucked by one of the other night guys. They both looked up, we made eye contact (in the mirror) and I closed the door without a word. I never brought it up, but she gave me the next night off "...for all your hard work."
I saw an employees check stub that he dropped. He had been there for a month and was making what I made after my first year and was not a very good worker. I got a raise
I went to my Aunt's house and walked in to see her standing over her boyfriend who was sitting on the couch. Her shirt was pulled up and he sucking on her breast. I quickly turned around, made a loud noise in the kitchen, and intercepted my mom who would have freaked out. 
My parents' collection of sex toys - that was way more reality than my 10-year-old mind was prepared to handle 
Beavis and Butt-Head Do America.My parents found out we went into that theater and they dragged us out REAL quick.
About 9 years ago, there were a couple of notes scattered across the computer desk in my parents' study. I happened to read them because words are in front of my face, what am I gonna do?They were notes my parents had written each other instead of just talking to each other.Because my dad had slept with 14 hookers.
One Christmas Eve I couldnt sleep at all so I went to the kitchen to get some water or something and out in the living room were my parents setting out presents and eating the cookies I had left out.  They said that Santa was running late and was in such a big hurry that he just dropped off the presents and asked them to put them out for him.
Alright, here it goes. I was in the 7th grade so I was almost 12. I woke up in the middle of the night and I heard my mom screaming. I jump up and get ready to defend my mom. I open up my parents bedroom door and my mom was definitely not in trouble. My dad was taking her from the behind. I didn't understand it at the time, but I wanted to get out of there before they noticed me. However, I fainted instead. That my friends is something I was definitely not supposed to see. Forever scarred. I'm 25 now and my dad still likes to bring it up at Christmas dinner. 
Similar story to the f-117 at the top. I was a contractor in Afghanistan working at Jalalabad air field (FOB Fenty). I woke up to take a piss and gave a cigarette. On the other side of the runway I saw a few helicopters take off but didn't hear anything. I thought it was strange as the base was dead silent but didn't think too much about it. It was only later when I read the news that it was the SEAL team raid to kill bin Laden. Because of my pea sized bladder I was probably the first non military or government person to see those stealth helicopters. 
A long time friend of mines dad was showing me pics of a car he was restoring. He accidentally pulled up nude pics of my friends mom instead. He looked awkward for a minute. He never said anything and then just started looking at car pics like it never happened.   
I worked at a fancy health food restaurant years ago. One day I was early and saw the owner mixing his homemade cold pressed garlic aioli, it was Cisco mayonnaise and a big jar of minced garlic.
An obese, greasy feller, sitting fully naked on a toilet, a mix of pain and confusion and surprise on his face as I walked into his stall at a Sizzlers restaurant.Stayed with me for a while, not gonna lie.
My dad's bank account balance when I was ~12, stopped asking for things after that
When I was about 4-5 years old I watched Eddie Murphy: Raw in its entirety around the corner from the living room while my parents were watching it. I was super quiet and they were laughing their ass off so they didn't notice. I learned all sorts of cool new words!
my mother's suicide note, unused
When I was little, my father set a password on a computer I was using for playing games. I wanted him to type the password (while I was away), but set a camera to record it. Hid it behind a pile of books.The trick was, the camera back in the days was only able to record for 30 seconds, so I had to call my father and run out of the room, so he could type it as quickly as possible. It stopped filming just as he hit Enter.
Ben Affleck's social security number.Years ago I was working for a company that I could access different departments' server files in.  I was bored one day and was poking through those files to see what else the company had going on.  I found a contract for a production deal with Ben Affleck, and his SSN was included (for payroll purposes).  I closed the file because I knew I should not have been looking at that, even if it was accessible. No, I didn't retain it or remember it.  No, I would not do anything with it if I did.  I don't care about his personal life.
As a middle schooler, I picked up a book at the library, flipped through the pages and found an application for a replacement birth certificate for some old man. It had every detail about his personal identification on it, so naturally I took it home thinking, "I'll just hold onto this incase I ever need to assume a fake identity by pretending to be an 80 year old man and flee the country." My mom found it and had to explain to me that no we don't steal people's identities.
When I was about 5, my mom took me to the bank because she needed something out of the safety deposit box. It was right when they were opening up. They asked us to turn around while they unlocked the vault, but I peeked. According to family lore, I went around the rest of the day chanting the numbers of the combination.
I walked in on my mom, dad, and stepmom having a threesome. 
My grandmother dying. I was 7 and the phone rang, so I answered it. I walked into the back bedroom where my mother, aunt, and grandfather were standing around my grandmother's bed. When I walked in the room, I noticed her move her head like she was looking at something on the ceiling. Then I heard someone say, "this is it..." I've heard my mother tell the story of the moment she died and it's exactly what I witnessed. I've never told anyone. I'm 25 now. 
It's more something that this person wasn't supposed to hear than see but back in the 80's, my AP US History teacher won an award and got to have lunch with Senator Ted Kennedy and hung out with him in his office. As he was leaving, he saw an aide walk up to Ted Kennedy and whispered something into Kennedy's ear. Then Ted Kennedy yelled "HOW THE FUCK DO YOU LOSE A NUCLEAR WARHEAD!" as my history teacher was just casually walking away. 
My dad's penis. He kept it covered, but I had the weird habit as a kid of coming downstairs at midnight and going for an hour long walk. When I came home, he was usually at the computer masturbating in a bathrobe. 
Two female long time coworkers in the office on a Saturday. One going down on the other in her cubicle. She popped her head up and looked right at me with that 'Oh shit!' Look.I gave her the thumbs up, said; 'I have seen nothing.' and walked away. I once walked in on my father masturbating. Nothing was said.
Luckily I didn't actually see it, but when I was about 10 years old I was awaken from sleep in our caravan by the sound my dad having sex with my aunt (both where drunk) in the other end of the caravan while my mom was passed out drunk outside.  Ah, fun vacation memories.
This isn't a particularly scandalous story, but I think it's amusing. My dad is a carpenter, and I used to come with him on installations to help out. One time we were putting in a cabinet for this nice Jewish couple, inside their study. I was walking by the computer on the desk, and I couldn't help noticing the open web page on it: OyWhatADeal.com 
I'm sure everyone can add the nudity of a friend to the list, so I'll skip that.  SPOILER ALERT: I learned at 6 that Santa was not really bringing me presents when I had my door cracked open on Christmas Eve and saw my dad and my cat wrestling with a present that my dad was trying in vain to get out of my cat's clutches. The scratches down his arm the next morning confirmed that it wasn't a dream. Sassy never took shit from anyone, though. 
I was on the doctor doom tower of terror, and when I was at the apex I could see Spiderman riding a four wheeler in an empty alley
Opposite side: I got married towards the end of law school, and after graduating stayed with my parents for a few months while I prepped for the bar exam. My wife and I were fooling around, when my then-18-year-old brother opened the door and walked in to a perfect shot of us both spread eagle, touching each other's bits. That was the last time that door went unlocked. 
For my HS lacrosse team, one of the parents put together a dvd of pictures and highlights from the season, they didn't double check all the footage so after a pic of my teammate scoring a goal, the video immediately transitioned into footage of said players dad taking a dildo up the ass with the wife watching. 
Oh I can share something that's has some value finally.So 16 year old me was swimming in the hotel pool when some girls about my age started swimming and every time she pushed off the top of her bikini would slip down revealing her nipples. Best holiday of my life and I must have stayed in that pool for at least two hours.... She wore a different bikini the next day :( I was wearing googles btw that's how I could see under water
My neighbor's panties, which were skidmarked to hell 
was drunk, walking with my friend. friend says he has to piss. I hear liquid hitting the ground. I look over, he has his dick in his hand pissing as we're walking.
The strange man eating a urinal cake in a public bathroom. He just stared back at me and we made really awkward eye contact as he shoved the remainder into his mouth.
When I was 9 my Mom wanted me to do some more advanced reading, so she went to the story and bought me an R.L. Stine "adult fiction" novel (Goosebumps were in their prime then). I started reading the book, and about page 5, a woman starts giving a bj. I learned a lot that day. I then went into my parents room and trolled my mom by reading the passage to her.
Not see but say. I was in a long 6+ hour car ride with the parents and I decided to randomly blurt out "Dad what ever happened to the girl you got pregnant?" I have no idea what prompted me to say that. Mom turned to dad and yelled "YOU TOLD HIM ABOUT THAT?" Turns out my dad got a girl pregnant at 15 and had to get an abortion before being in high school. It was a very interesting car ride thereafter. 
> old nanny/baby sitterWas *she* old, or does "old" in this case mean "the one you used to have?"
After my little girl's mum and I split up and I had her most of the time, being an apprentice with stupid amounts of bills I'd only normally cook dinner for my little girl (then 2) and I'd eat what she didn't. One night we had chicken bits I think? And I had a few and after I'd finish mine I looked at her eating hers and smiled at her, and she put some of hers onto my plate. I said " no you eat them" and she insisted. "You sure little bug?" (what I call her) and she said " yes! You are my daddy!!"I almost cried. Makes my heart melt
My MIL passed away suddenly a few years back and I ended up being the one to go through her things for donations because my husband and SIL were too emotional. I found 2 whole drawers of sex toys and homemade porn that went straight into a trash bag and into the dumpster. Never told my husband.  
>"there's a problem with the disc."Brilliant. 
You stole from the Mob and lived to speak about it. Do an AMA!
So I'm assuming as an 8 or 9 year old, you didn't know it was weed.. so when did you figure it out exactly?*15 years later, in bed sleeping...*You: . . .You: . . .You: . . *WAKES UP* IT WAS POT
I expected more of these finds here. Were they orchids? ;)
she wanted you to see. You missed out.If you took that opportunity you would now be living with her on an island in Greece with 2 sons, one daughter and 2 grandchildren. Your grandchild Arthur would like playing football with the local kids and Jasmine would be the kind of girl that occasionally grabs a book but most of the time she would take a boat and paddle out into the sea and come back a few hours later with a sunburn.fucked up real bad.
Well, on the plus side we know how dad deals with his sexless marriage.
She could have been saying "it would fucking suck if I framed you as a serial cheater"
Please tell me that they are on different sides of the family
You and your friend were going to take a dump together. Damn. Friendship goals.
You know, my first thought is they were smoking pot or doing lines or something, or even simply sneaking cigarettes. Seems way more plausible she would risk doing drugs/smoking with a friend -which presumably all the adults there would be cool with and merely hiding it from the kiddos- than two adults fucking with their spouses and children all downstairs *and* you not overhearing a single moan or grunt.Not calling you a liar or anything, just thinking from our adult perspective. There's more grown ups do in secret than bone.
ayyyy hell yea gramps you hit dat brah i'm out
I was once walking through the woods on a piece of property behind my parents property and saw two people fucking doggy style in the middle of a pathway. I was probably about 12 too. The brush was so dense I rounded a corner and was basically right behind them. It was not a majestic view at all. More like two cows going at it. I made eye contact with the guy, and he started cracking up. The woman seemed panicked and couldn't get her clothes back on. 0/10 would not recommend. 
I saw my dads successful hanging at three years old. That shit screws you up for life
Wow, no one should see that.  I'm sorry.
He wanted you to find it, so you could get a raise.What a bro!
> and intercepted my mom who would have freaked out.Such a good wingman for your aunt's boyfriend.
My parents never allowed me to watch Ed Edd and Eddy. They said bad words like "stupid".
This is bizarre.  I can't imagine that pills could be shipped in anything less than a tamper-proof container.  I always figured the procedure would be similar to how my company moves cash around- in thick plastic bags that are numbered with matching seals.
> HR gave 0 shits about its employees and only protected the managers.Worked at FedEx Ground. Can confirm. 
Goddamnit Cyril!
14 is a very specific number.  No more, no less? Exactly 14? I have to wonder, how did she establish that it was 14.  Did he admit to 14, which would make the number suspicious.  Or did she find credit card evidence of 14 transactions at 'Happy Hands Massage Studio.'  Or what?  Wow, I'm way too curious.  I'm sorry you had to see those notes. 
Something similar happened twice to me.  I'm not in HR and I grabbed a binder off the shelf that appeared to be empty that I was going to use for prepping and RFP.  Printed excel spreadsheet of every employees salary.5 years later, my boss sends me a budget spreadsheet for the entire team including my peers.  I'm making my own adjustments for my team and realized there are hidden columns.  Unhide.  And that's when I asked for a raise...  
Similar story: once I came home late at night when everyone else was asleep. My cat was sitting on the chair on the porch and there were about 5 or 6 strange cats sitting in the porch or the steps, all facing him. I watched for a moment and they seemed totally relaxed, all sitting with neutral body language. I took a step forward, they heard me and scattered in an instant, and my cat calmly asked to be let inside. He was fat, irritable, and a badass killer. I from then on assumed him to be some sort of cat mafioso. Happened in NJ btw. 
Man...I remember emptying my mom's purse out on her bed one time when I was a kid, and some condoms fell out. I'm being inquisitive, asking her what they are, I probably opened one? idk. Anyways, she claims they're balloons. And blows one up and ties it off. And that's how I got a balloon one summer day.
This makes me wonder if your cousin was just habitually chewing on condoms
You were standing there in a daze for so long that someone had to come looking for you.
" Used the bathroom "
What kind of helicopters were they again?
That's when you show him some nudes of your girlfriend so it won't be awkward
This happened with my wifes real hot aunt, and me. She was showing pics of her new backyard renevation to myself and her sister, and swiped onto a full nude shot.
This exact thing happened to me with my Uncle! He was showing me photos of an old Triumph he was restoring, and one swipe to many and I was looking at a picture my aunt must have sent him of her p*ssy. It's a real shame because she was my favourite aunt
Aww fuck man, sorry to hear 
Dude, same here. I was too young to know just how low that number was but I knew it wasn't much. Thinking back, I have no idea how they fed and clothed three kids with that. Oh wait, I do. It's called credit card debt. 
And a lifelong love of leather jumpsuits.
I found one of those, too. It made me feel very alone.
It's one of those, should i tell someone? would they believe me? Was it real spies or just dodgy companies?
Usually a dead drop is done so that you are never at the same place at the same time.  I know for a fact the the CIA likes to hide thing in airport bathroom toilet stalls.
Should have followed one of them lol
This reminded me of the time I pulled off some mission impossible level shit (at least to teenage me) with my dad.  I put the slightest amount of some face cream I found in the bathroom -- not oily, but left the faintest residue -- on the TV remote buttons, and got him to put in his pin # to unlock his blocked channels on the cable box for me.  I could see his fingerprints on the buttons and later while unsupervised, used that to figure out his code.
I realize if I had kids how screwed they would be with stuff like this."Hey dad can you log in?""Oh did you forget your login password? Here let me just reset it in AD for you."
This is so cute and innocent 
Similarly, Chris Pratt placed an order with us and i have his gmail address. i actually had looked the order up when i was investigating fraudulent purchases. People put in fake names sometimes. Sure enough, the address the package was going to was some huge mansion place so i deemed it not fraud. The email address is actually kind of funny, I'm sure he made it himself. No, I won't give it to any of you so don't ask. 
> No, I didn't retain it or remember it. No, I would not do anything with it if I did. I don't care about his personal life.That's exactly what I would expect a Slytherin to say...
To be fair IF you were ever to use it, the man would likely be dead by then. You wouldn't be ruining anyone's life by using it.
Did they at least tell you at some point?Didn't they wonder why you froze them both out?
> If there is one credit card number that you could get away with stealing, his would've been perfectI don't know.  If there's someone you don't want to fuck with it's an African dictator.
A girl just took off her shirt in front of me at bible camp once before she realized I was there. 
She covered herself up but it was too late. I'd seen everything. 
To think bank robbers in movies lay these really elaborate plans to get into vaults, and then it turns out they could just go in early and see the combination for themselves
h-u-n-t-e-r-2
Oh man, a threesome with an ex sounds dicey.
Usually? So this was a habitual thing, and you didn't make a point to avoid it?
Hope it was the Aunt on your mom's side
We need a follow up. Does your mother know it happened?
I looked it up. It wants me to confirm my city, with the only option being Detroit. Then it asks for my email. No explanation or details are given. I'm too scared to proceed any further.
this one's kinda cute and not completely horrible compared to the others in this thread.  the same thing happened to me when I woke up when my dad was putting coins under my pillowcase and taking the teeth for the tooth fairy away.
Homeward Bound fan?
I wonder how many UFO sightings it's responsible for?
Who has sex in their parents house with an unlocked door?!?! That's protocol number 1 for sex in the folks house rookie!!!!!!
Then what happened?
My SO's brother once walked in on his 75+ year old grandparents having sex. I guess he wasn't expected to arrive until an hour or so later. The worst part was instead of being embarrassed, the grandpa got out of bed and went in for a hug. And shrugged "What? It's natural. You should be happy we can still do it." I'm pretty sure he still has PTSD dreams about it to this day. 
I've seen this porno
Nowadays you can just search on Goggle for nip slips.
Oh god I can't believe you sent that to your personal email.... 
Multitasking.
Jesus Christ. I ... don't have words for that 
wow, what a selfish, greedy, philandering piece of shit.  Even cheating on your spouse with one other person is already expensive and time consuming.
dicks are dicks, but the porn u end up at towards the end of a session... thats private!
One thing I've learned is if it were socially acceptable, a large percentage of woman would prefer to be naked pretty much all the time.  They probably would too if it weren't for all us men trying to mate with them.
as someone who for several years could only afford to heat my house when my daughter stayed over, I know how awful it can be. Hope things are better for you, I'm lucky enough to be alright financially now
Best administrative assistant ever.
The peasant! *At the diner...*He didn't pay his check.
I don't think I was. She had a good 30 years on me, and never implied anything before or after.
My best friend in my early twenties married his cousin.
And that's what he did.
Damn, I'm very sorry that you had to witness that.I morbidly think of how different/better/worse life would have been had she succeeded. My own mentality aside, if it weren't for her, I would have never come to America, but because of her she has single-handedly ruined my (half)brother's childhood, and in a way I basically had to raise a kid at 12 years old while keeping her bat-shit crazy ass away from him as much as I could. Families are fucking weird man haha.
It's like when Daryl gets Michael to ask for a raise cuz they make almost the same amount 
Me too. I also wasn't allowed to watch Spongebob 
That was in the past two weeks 
When I was a PA I used to get sent spreadsheets from everywhere from my Manager which I then had to send out to the wider team. I always checked for hidden columns but also learned about hidden tabs. One time I almost sent out a spreadsheet to the wider team which had performance feedback per person and their ratings from their Manager and their peers. All this information was in a hidden tab. That could have been so damn messy. Silly HR.
Your cat was definitely the leader of a cult
Haha. That reminds me of my brother who almost did the same. He found a pack of condoms in my dad's old jacket(coincidentally he was looking for chewing gum too) and he started blowing or filling them with water. When my mom came home he started asking why would they hide balloons from him.
She was a habitual condom chewer.
"Hey, your daughter makes that same face! Lemme see if I have a pic..."
and then what happened
Dude. The person who took my first username attempt. Well this is fun.
Sounds like he became awesome at that moment.  Plenty of kids wouldn't have given a fuuuck and been mad about it,
Shit man there are some days when I wonder how I'm able to feed and clothe myself
you're not the only one. i found one written by my sibling from when they were very young. still really messes me up. i hope things are alright with you and your family, solidarity and all that 
> Was it real spies or just dodgy companies?Or just a married couple trying to spice things up.
That would explain the glory holes. 
Go to your room and fill out this captcha form
I think highly technical parents is what breeds hackers. "Oh you gave me an account with limited domain rights and a web filter? Let's see how we can get around that."
Can you send him my nudes?
Though I'm Australian I was born on Papua New Guinea. A little while ago I couldn't find my birth certificate anywhere so I rang the hospital in PNG where I was born and gave them my name and DOB and my parents name. With little fuss I was just told to wire them $70 and they'd send me a copy. I then realised how easy it would be for me to steal someone else's identity either living or dead. 
We had the same friend group so it got passed on to them pretty quickly that I saw them. Those friends had my back and also stopped hanging out with them, which was nice.
I am now going to use the phrase "wombats ate my salad" when I need to send my girlfriend a message.I am not going to inform or clear it with her beforehand.
Can confirm, I ate your salad.
They usually don't realize it when you are hiding in a bush.
You have to be quite early to be 5 years old.
Well of course, do you take my family for being savages or something?
Sassy attacked him?
I believe the F-117 was responsible for a number of UFO reports before the government acknowledged its existence. 
Personally speaking, I was never to have my bedroom door closed growing up unless I was changing. Didn't matter what age I was. My mom threatened to remove the door when I wanted peace and quiet once and I had it closed. I actually live with my future in-laws currently and at first it weirded me out, because they give us *all* the privacy and don't bug us for shit. They don't come to our room whatsoever. We could probably die in there and they'd have no idea until our bodies started smelling.
No kidding. There are so many logs generated for that. If it ever comes out, it is going to be pretty easy to find out it was you.
Efficiency
I do, what a cunt. Did you manage to get some money off him?
That's sociopathic. I couldn't handle an affair to begin with, you have to be mentally fucked up to manage basically 3 families plus girlfriends.I knew a guy kind of like this, family friends. They had a normal life, big house in the OC, 2 kids, etc. Their life blew up 4-5 years back because he had another house and 6 kids with a woman 50 miles away. How the fuck...
For real. I'd have waited outside the door to see shit hit the fan. 
Emperor's New Groove never gets old
Nah dude, you missed out on Greece. 
I'll do you one better. A friend of mine and his wife MET at a family reunion. Cousins. Same last name. Everything. I think they are at least 3rd or 4th cousins. But woah. 
Haha he told Michael to ask for raise because Darryl himself asked Michael for a raise at which point he'd make more than Michael. One of my favorite episodes.
My younger cousin wasn't allowed to watch Spongebob, either. His mom was fucking insane, and one of her rules was "inoffensive words instead of swears are just as bad." She said "what the heck" was just as bad as "what the fuck." Spongebob used "barnacles" like an expletive, so it was banned 
What do you mean by hidden tab? A hidden sheet in the spreadsheet??
We had a cat like this in our neighbourhood, a big, white, haggard looking thing. Found him meowling outside my house when my cat went in heat, looked out and there's like 15 fucking male cats on my lawn behind this big badass motherfucker like "send out the wench, human". She gave birth to a couple white kittens a few months later. 
Can we talk about how good those condoms taste? And how often they break?
"No, sorry, that's your wife again... hang on... I have your daughter here too."
Sisko makes the Maquis beg for mercy.
Do we get a fight to the death now?
Lololol that's actually fuckin cool
You go in the stall and say the secret password, "bumblebee." A dick slowly emerges from the hole in the stall. There is writing on it. You begin sucking, and slowly some of the writing wipes away from your effort, leaving only the permanent marker behind and revealing your next target.
That is currently happening to my friend group we cut all contact with them 
I will do this, too. I don't even know what a wombat is, but I'm sure as hell gonna persist in saying that those fuckers ate my salad.
Hmmm, that's a short answer... 
I could probably write a book of the shit I saw in room service: prostitutes, danger sex, people in the middle of sex, half naked women, half naked men, sex toys, used condoms. I've had to give my opinion on lingerie, tattoos, and piercings. Oh and there once was an aggressive rent-boy!

Yeah, a bit like a danger wank. Couple call up, order 2 sandwiches. The thought of getting caught by the room service guy spurs them on. I mean she was still naked under the covers, and he was sweaty wearing just a towel. Gave me a tenner tip as well, so I'm not complaining!

Probably all the not-so-great photoshops out there that appear to break the rules of physics. People missing shadows, or appear to be floating or bending space around them...stuff like that.

The longer i look at it, the more layers it has.
"Oh, there's kind of a lot going on, but it's pretty......That's all the same guy... and... huh..."
This makes me think of the guy who took a picture at his desk with both hands in the shot and then posted further and further out pictures explaining how he took them.
Is that the horse-sized duck I have heard so much about?

Ok, that looks way to legit, I reckon it might not be photoshopped

That would be super easy to explain. Everyone would just think that someone had painted a new version of the Mona Lisa with Mr. Bean's face.Unless losing our knowledge of photoshop also means we lost of knowledge of painting in general, in which case *every* painting would blow our minds.

By keeping the photo paper still under the enlarger, blocking the light from the enlarger from getting to certain places on the paper at certain times, and changing the negatives in the enlarger.  The way silver gelatin photo paper works is that the more light it gets, the darker it gets.  By making sure that only parts of the paper are getting light at a time, you can build up the image like stacking layers in photoshop.
you could be a sculpture

It's funny how people don't know (or forget) that Photoshop and its tools have the names they have *because* it's supposed to be a digital photo shop.The same way Avid Media Composer (and Premiere to a lesser extent) and its tools we made to mimic/emulate a physical film editing bay. *cut, splice, split...*(same goes with almost any other digitized process, cut, copy and paste anyone?) 
A literal photography shop.
Dude, you can't cut in line like that. THERE ARE PROCEDURES.

When you gotta write 3000 words, but could get the point across in 2000.
Your point exactly. It's all because of when these programs launched, they were targeted for that industry. Using their terminology only makes sense. But now the history and context behind the terms is long gone for most. I remember when I was first learning avid in school, a foreign kid just couldn't understand why the terms were splice/ cut. While everyone else didn't even notice and assumed it was called those just because.
Also how cellphone cameras make a snapping noise
that's why things like this and also d.a.w's and video editing programs were created. to have every one of these tools at your literal fingertips

Drink for every fragmented sentence.
Every time he refers to himself as "humbled", snort an entire ounce of cocaine.
Drink everytime he mentions he has a friend
Drink every time he says "Believe me"
Every time he claims he's the only person to fix something, drink.Every time he says "great," drink.Every time he says "bigly," drink.Every time he says "fake news," drink.
Just start drinking and don't stop. 
When he finishes his speech and says "Obama, you're fired!"fuckin cringe. 
I'm for fun and all, but this just seems dangerous. 
I'm imagining it will play out like Scar's speech in the Lion King. It begins slowly, with Trump reflecting on Obama's presidency and the death of democracy. Then, he kicks it up. The skies turn red, his voice booms as Russian politicians slowly pour onto the stage behind him. Trump announces a new era where lion and hyena live together.
If he actually surprises us with a well delivered inaugural address, chug a pitcher of beer. 
Won't be watching. But I will be drinking. 
Repeated sentence = 1shot
Take a shot every time you feel displeased Trump is going to be president.  If you're a Trump supporter, take a shot every time you feel smug watching the speech.
I feel like any possible drinking game is inherently dangerous, because Trump only knows like, eight words
Drink for every vague superlative. "Huge" "Great" "Best" "amazing" all get shots.Dead by the third sentence.
> how can we turn it into a drinking game? By not watching and going out drinking. 
Drink heavily every day for the next 4 years. 
I feel like Trump will get wind of any drinking game and then edit his speech in such a way so that he kills all people trying to turn his speech into a drinking game.Sad!
Anytime "the best" is mentioned. Doesn't matter the context.
Take a sip any time you are concerned about your rights being violated. 
"China" = 1 shot
Drink everytime he makes THAT face
Pro Tip: If you're underage and still want to play a pseudo-drinking game, find some of those jelly beans that have a 50/50 chance of being disgusting (bean-boozled, I think) and replace "drink" with "pick a random bean"
Take a drink every time he audibly sniffles.
Take a shot every time the crowd gets loud and he stops talking.
A little off topic, but if you can, skip watching the address in any form and read the transcript later. Trump is an insatiable ratings whore and it would just kill him if people didn't tune in to watch his inauguration. 
Every time he says Trump... 
I'm literally too poor to afford that much alcohol. 
This might be one of the most dangerous suggestions.
Snort two ounces if you don't believe him.
I want comic relief not suicide-by-whiskey.
I believe it's spelt "Gyhna", just fyi.
Soooo, I'm not a native English speaker and I've never managed to get what is wrong with the way he says China. Care to help me?
A lot of friends...So many friends
Or if he does the duck face thing he does.
**Finish your drink**IsisTax returnCyber**Drink two fingers worth**Ivanka
If Kanye also announces Trump as his running mate, run to your nearest liquor store and drink everything.
HOLD MY LIQUOR
Yeezus will save us.
And "let me tell you".
This is the most dangerous suggestion.
I think we need to approach these kinds of things in a measured way - like, one drink every three or so times he says it.
But if it made sense from the beginning then don't stop drinking
You could be drinking watered down hard lemonades and this game would still kill you. 
I'd say drink everytime he says "yuuuge", but people may die.
He once claimed "I'm the best at military!" With no experience in the military whatsoever.
Two minutes in, and I'm out of vodka.   
I'm preemptively cringing at the thought of him doing this. 
I... I don't know what to think.
Whenever Trump says something you agree with, drink.It's only as dangerous as the rules make it.
And instead of Simba, Joe Biden comes back in several years and fights Trump atop the burning White House. 
To even suggest Trump could be a fraction as eloquent as Scar is an insult to Disney, Jeremy Irons, and lions. 
So no drinking then?
If you watched the RNC acceptance speech that's actually what he did. No idea if he actually wrote it or not, but if you want a preview go look it up, it was not the same as one of his rally speeches at all.Also a pitcher of beer isn't very much, it's like 3 and a half beers. I thought we were trying to get drunk here?
That could be called winning the game

I want to offer one more rule. It's called "Quacktastic" and anytime the big D makes his signature duck face and holds his hand up, everyone must quack. The last to quack must have a shot. Is it too late?
#Handy Man Every time Trump mentions his hands, take a shot.#Sore Winner   Take a drink every time Clinton or a primary opponent is mentioned #Walled Off  On every mention of a border wall, the person with the most left in their glass drinks. Everyone else speaks in Spanish for 5 seconds.#Are You Not Entertained?  In the unlikely and unfortunate event of violence breaking out during his speech, everyone must drink all of the alcohol in the house. It's going to be a long presidency.
You have the best words /u/bLbGoldeN
For Wordator extraordinaire, would it also count if he was using a word in an unusual way, such as the way he says "the cyber" to refer to the internet?
You missed "*Tremendous*."
he uses the word "very" more than an elementary schooler who hasn't learned enough adjectives
The words President Trump are going to be a reality by the end of the week.
DEATH TO THE OPPOSITION.
I wonder if he'll rename the White House the Trump House.  It's pretty lucrative real estate you know
Don't worry, you won't have to be concerned with money after drinking that much.
6 ounces if you do.
I want both
Hey makes it sound like he's saying vagina without the va.
All of them such great people. You wouldn't believe what great people they are.
"Load 30 remaining images" had me laughing for a bit.
How have I never seen this before?  This is great.
I will no longer be bothered by him doing that for these are amazing. 
That's his face, we'd be drinking continuously all day.
> two fingers worth >Ivanka........
If they ask why you're stealing all the liquor, just tell them Kanye is Trump's running mate. They'll join in.
SLIGHTLY SCRATCH YOUR MIDDLE CLASS
"People are saying..."
Yea. Even if you'd do a non-alcoholic version. You'd wind up with water poisoning.
by the end of the speech, you'll be so drunk you might actually believe him!
Do you get combo points? I see the "unspecified contradiction" bonus from a mile off
Never stop. 
Lawyer here. I'd say it's assumption of risk if you choose to play the game. An argument that you didn't know what you were getting into wouldn't hold any water because everyone knows Trump is a self-aggrandizing jackass.
I think we've found the issue: His lexicon contains so few words that no matter what word(s) we decide to drink to, he'll almost certainly use them so frequently that there's a real likelihood we end up with alcohol poisoning. 
LOL. How'd I forget that one! Yuuuge mistake... my bad.
I've been drinking since June

Especially since it's so disturbingly plausible. 
Yayyyyy, soon we'll have a president with a catchphrase...

**It's Yuge**: Drink whenever Donald talks about any of his body parts (hands, penis, brain, etc.)
**Affirmative Action** : Every time that Trump says "Fake News" everyone exclaims "It's True!", last person takes a sip
**A reply from Daddy Don:** "That's a tremendous question, very very tremendous. There's a lot of questions like that, and you know, I get a lot of the, but only the best, only the best of the best and the best ones are always the ones I remember, I remember this one friend, Paul, and Paul was a great guy, great great guy, really an amazing guy. He told me Donald, he told me Donald, you're by far the best candidate to be president, no doubt, you're the best candidate of all of them. And you know, it's something I realized then, you know, he was right. Tremendous guy."
Fake News: Every time Trump criticizes major news outlet (e.g. CNN, NBC) as fake news because they wrote something he didn't like, take a shot.Orange Russian: If Trump mentions Russia take a shot. If he mentions Putin, take two shots. If Putin suddenly walks onstage, finish the bottle.
> Everyone else speaks in Spanish for 5 secondsdead
Everybody says it, all the time, everyone always says to me: "bLbGoldeN, you have the best of the best words, they're amazing, tremendous amazing!" and I know they're right, because everyone always tells me all the time and you know what? I've heard someone say that I had regular words folks, regular words and really, and really it's sad, sad!
You know there's a lot of research and complicated, very complicated stuff that goes on in the cyber, because it's made by very smart people. Some people once told me that China was the one that made it, but I look at them in the eyes and always tell them: "We're American, you can't fool us." Folks, we're at war, we are, we are, we're at war everywhere and there's people dying instead of being safe here with us, and having a tremendous time. Let me tell all of you something, I'm going to change all of it, I'll change things so much you wouldn't even believe, because I win, I win all the time.

Yes, Presidents have run with different VPs in the following election. Pence scored him a lot of votes with the true Republicans, though, so it's unlikely he would dump him.

If two of those are together, the penalty is added then squared. All three, and you drink the whole thing.

What do we drink if he says "dignity?"
u/TheMalteseSailor forgetting catchphrases and utterly failing. Sad!
Well if everyone who opposes Trump starts drinking heavily throughout his presidency, the only ones alive to vote in 2020 will be his supporters.
There's actually a documentary out there that floats the possibility that half the reason Trump ran in the first place was he was furious at getting embarrassed by Obama during the birther thing at the Correspondant's Dinner and this was his version of revenge. Might explain why he seems to be promising to replace Obamacare with Obamacare++
It's like Head-in-a-Jar Nixon, only much more terrifying.
It's okay, we can use it for 2024. Next election of course **has** to be "2020: Hindsight".

You are saying it could have been explained without resorting to vagina?  I do not believe you.
You dont know these people but they're fantastic believe me
pretty much.
She's gonna be in the First Lady's suite in the White House. Just saying.
She's about the right age to be his next wife and she looks like her mother. He's a sociopath with no sense of ethics. you do the math. He's probably of the Hapsburg school of thought when it comes to genetics anyway. 
"I've been saving this 50-year-old single malt for a special occasion."
I feel like, at this point, he will either come through as a decent president and wouldn't need Pence for the boost, or he tweets himself out of the oval office.

I think in mid-2018, trump is going to find out what happens when Obama gets bored. I don't think he's going to like it.

Put it in a concrete tomb.
A better question is: What would a snail do with a million dollars?  
I'd surround myself with whatever you're smoking, that would confuse the fucking snail to no end
At first I thought: "Why would anyone give a million dollars to a snail?" But then I realized "Why would anyone give a million dollars to me?"
Can't I just put it in a box?
Put the snail in a mason jar. Bury it in Antarctica. By the time he escapes imprisonment and being frozen solid, I'll be hundreds of years old and bored of life.
1. Spread the rumor that snails are poisonous,2. Give a dollar to every kid that traps a snail in a bottle,3. sell all the snails to a company that makes cosmetic products,4. Profit.5. Fuck OP's mom one last time.
Bit hard to do anything to the snail if it's always a decoy snail.
Buy one of those bubbles that you can walk in and live like that. Then he couldn't touch me :)
I have opposable fingers and a glass jar. Checkmate
Uhm, follow up questions might be in order... Like, how does the snail spend the money? Does it hire a butler or something that carries its debit card?It's highly intelligent but lacks vocal chords, can it communicate at all?How about airplane travel? Does it only travel by crawling?
I'll purchase a salt mine and live my immortal life in there, selling the salt is my new career.
Wasn't this on an rt podcast?
Pay someone to launch the snail into space using a small rocket with just enough power to launch it out of Earth's orbit. Its super intelligence means nothing if it physically is unable to do anything and is just floating through space.
put it in my ass
OP, this is exactly the kind of silly hypothetical shit I live for.  I'd build several houses on different continents surrounded by trenches filled with salt and rotate to each house every 5 years.
I spend five of those dollars on a hamster wheel. Pay someone three dollars to put the snail on it. When I finally want to die, I embrace my deathsnail as an old friend and go into the last unknown. But first I ask him what on earth he did with his million dollars. 
. . . wait but why does this snail *want* to touch me? Also 1 million doesn't really go that far these days . . .
The snail is super intelligent and rich, and immortal and will only die if I touch it. Yeah the villain in me is coming out. Seal him in a biodome, take his money and invest it. Then once we figure out snail/human communication I ask why he wants to kill us both by touching me. After talking it out if he agrees to not try to touch, I'll give him his money plus interest and set him free. If he still wants to touch and die I will seal him in acrylic and wear him as a necklace. That way when I want to stop being immortal and die, I can just drill in.
The snail has no real incentive to kill me so I'd probably just ask it not to.
Snails weigh 25 - 45 grams? Buy a tiny amount of freight on the next Space X project and launch that fucker toward Betelgeuse.
I go to walmart and buy a 5$ thing of morton salt and go dump it on that bitch
Rooster Teeth fan? 
Simple, I track down the wife of the snail and I implant an explosive on her spine. If the snail dares to touch me then I will blow his wife to kingdom come. 
Surround myself with salt. Lots and lots of salt. Like an absurd amount of salt. Like think of a quantity of salt that's too much, and multiply that by like, a lot. I'd probably buy from the manufacturer to get a bulk discount because of the sheer amount of salt I'd get. I mean, I would be investing most of my money into salt. Salt. 
Is there a rule against crushing the snail?Even if it immortal, I can still step on it right? Let's say I wait for him, for months if needed, at the end of a dead end hall. I see him, he sees me. I'm ready to pounce; he knows this. I start running. He starts running. I catch him and step on him, leaving his mashed and useless body there to whither away while he stays alive for the rest of eternity being unable to move. The snail is trying to kill me? Fuck him, he's a vegetable now.
Move to a different continent than the snail.  
With some reworking this could make for a lousy but successful horror flick about STDs
Can i have sex with the snail?
Easy.  Build a platform in the sky, where the snail cannot crawl up to touch you
Put a cup on it and enjoy my life
Decoy snail.
Imagine the irony of experiencing the entire heat death of the universe. No light or energy. Just bouncing around the void for countless eons hoping for death and wishing you kept tabs on that damn snail.
The flaw in this plan comes right at the beginning, when the friend you tell immediately throws the snail at you to "prove" you're delusional. Dead.
Eternity is plenty of time for the snail to not only get over the heartbreak, but also figure out that you are responsible. It would likely cause the snail to redouble it's efforts to get you.

I'd have a million dollar concrete paperweight on my desk with a immortal snail in the middle of it.

You know, a snail with money is a little like the mule with a spinning wheel. No one knows how he got it, and danged if he knows how to use it!
Decoy snail.
Whatever Gavin Free is smoking, more like.
It would actually be more interesting to give a million dollars to a snail.
Or you could put that box inside of another box, then mail that box to yourself and when it arrives you can smash it with a hammer. 
It was a decoy snail

Decoy snail.
30 years later you're making out with a girl.  Your hand brushes her cheek.  Suddenly, you feel your immortality draining away.  You look with horror at your hand, stained with makeup.  You taste her lipstick on your lips.  You realize that finally, after all these years, the snail has had its revenge.
Easy, make it hard for the snail by always being a decoy self.
If this snail keeps sending decoy snails to try and fuck up my plans then the stupid little shit will never catch me.He might be super intelligent, but only by snail standards.
That's the best solution I've read so far. Unfortunately, the snail hires a little boy to stab your ball :(Back to square one I guess
Except you just got baited by a decoy snail
I was thinking in the same way as this, with one million dollars, if it can only crawl, I would move accros the ocean, and first calculate it's crawl speed on avarage, and then at about 80% of that travel time I would move once more.
The snail is immortal. wtf does the salt do to an immortal snail.
Yes! I'm actually surprised that a mention of RT is so far down in the comments. I remember some other "Million Dollars But" and "Gavin or Google" scenarios posted here that got quite a bit of recognition. 
it wasn't just on there, they established this exact concept and premise verbatim, this is just copy/pasted from there.
Congratulations, you just stuck a decoy snail up your ass.
When your dead and they're doing your autopsy, there is some remaining waste that squeaks out of your ass. The guy hears the squirt, the a little "clink" noise and sees the snail. "Hmm I wonder how that got in there". He goes to pick it up, and the shitty acid burns through his glove, killing him too. The snail makes a dramatic sigh and takes in a gulp of fresh air. He climbs down the table and makes a dramatic slower than usual exit through the door. 
For one million dollars that might be a stretch
I don't think 1 million dollars is enough for that kind of travel/housing unless you want to live in trailers.
Not sure a super intelligent snail will willingly run on a hamster wheel for eternity
"Well, snail... It's been a *shell* of a ride. Come here, old friend."

But you asked a decoy snail
So the speed of the snail is your primary concern? To the point of taking measures to slow him down?
So it would just become like, some sort of immortal snail goo puddle?  
So you're saying I need to put my bed in a circle of salt.

The snail summons cultists to regenerate its corporeal form. There is no escape.
The snail sneaks into a plane to your destination 
You got me curious as to what movie you're referring to.
Decoy genitals.
But the thing is that he never took his eyes off the snail from the time the deal started. Also, i can only assume that since you got the money when the deal started the snail only got it's smarts when the deal started.  Therefore there is no conceivable way for there to be a decoy snail.
20 days later after you posted this, people still talk about a decoy snail. Did you start this trend?
How to check for decoy snails? Hit it with a hammer. If it dies it's a decoy snail. If not then there you go. 
I was thinking the same thing! After probably just a few million years, I'd wish I could die. Not just like when you get depressed when everyone you know dies, but pushing through all depression, I'd say only a few million years before I become Bowerick Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
"Someone I can trust with my life." I'd sure as hell hope my closest friend could trust me and not try to kill me for a million bucks right on the spot. I'd promise him way more money from the investments later on down the road.
Would you really deny 50k in cash to tell your friend that he's delusional?
Nahhh bro.  *"The Cask of Amont-escargot."*
What does the snails long term financial strategy look like? Has it considered global markets?
That's oddly specific. You have been thinking about this for a long time.
Were you sent here by the devil? 
Do people like grapes? 
Yo isn't it crazy how you could put a million dollars cash in front of a snail and it wouldn't give a fuck it will just crawl away
or, to save on postage, you could poison him with salt! Talk it Kronk! Feel the salt!
It was a decoy box
What if I box every snail I encounter? Will they all be decoys?
R/flatearth 
I could try to crush it with something first. If it lives, it's the immortal snail.
> you're making out with a girlThis plan is foolproof!
Use amazons mechanical turk service to create massive amounts of videos of people capturing snails then with some clever marketing you can have a fad of snail catching every 6 months to decimate and eventually exterminate the snail population. Then when only the immortal snail remains I buy a glass jar and trap the non decoy snail
He's super-intelligent, though. Can't fool that snail.
What if you hire a larger boy to stab the little boy?
You said "super intelligent". You never said the snail could talk. How would he hire anyone?
I have friends with opposable fingers and a glass jar. Checkmate
This is like the asshole at the playground who has a invisible invincible force field around them. 
...are you just looking for someone to say "figure out how long it takes to crawl a certain distance and just hop on a plane whenever that time is running out"?because if so, then that's my answer.E: I didn't make the question, guys. 
It could probably get on a plane in a few hours
The ocean is salty. Salt is painful for snails 
Wow that is literally the exact same premise.
Google or Gavin is one of my favourite games.
Also, after a couple years, the snail will probably get bored of trying to kill you. He's a super intelligent snail. He's got super intelligent snail stuff to do. 
That's a complicated situation to explain to the doctor.
I want to die
A hamsterball then. Intelligence isn't going to do much for a snail stuck in a hamsterball.
> snail> run
Could just be a mean fuck and surround the wheel in salt. 
Keep your friends close and your anemones closer. 
Correct. Rather unrelated to immortal snails, but the series doesn't get enough credit for how well it handles the concept of death. While it's absolutely still treated as a tragedy, it's never treated as a "loss," as in "this person has died, which means they 'lose' at whatever we're doing." It's an inevitability. And the tale of the Deathly Hollows concretes that idea perfectly by treating Death not as some Devil, but even as a potential old friend. "You will die, and that's okay."
is his GF a snail also? How did that work? did you break her? Is this how you developed your weakness to snails? did you steal your million dollars from Super smart snail's Girlfriend? Can snails have mustaches? These are things we need to know OP. 
Idk I think I could tell the difference between a real super intelligent snail and an ordinary snail pretending to be super intelligent
I feel like there's literally nothing that would be more efficient than "wandering away from the snail". 
Oh well then, lucky it was a decoy rocket.
ok then.  if it dies, it's a decoy.  If it doesn't, it's immortal.
mineral water company
Wait, I thought the snail thought I slept with his girlfriend? How recent was this divorce? Was the snail cheating on his snail wife with his snail girlfriend?
Hey, now. 
Plane probably takes off again after landing before he could get off
It is never stated that the snail would be presented, visually or otherwise. Therefore there is no way to keep your eyes on it. If you happen to be shown a snail by the person making the deal with you, you have know way of knowing if it is the intelligent snail or not.
I'd lose it in less than 200 easily. 25 is pushing it already.

If I knew how to answer this question, I'd do it myself
No good sir, I'm on the level.
Wot if...Yer legsDin't knowThey wer legs?
Snails are very wise.
Might crawl towards it. Maybe parallel. Lots of different ways this one could go, really.
Oh... I feel the salt...
you cant kill it

Maybe not. That's not a bad idea

Even assuming one does not look like OP, i think you might reach a point where you go "so.. i am 10000 times older than her, this is not happening."
Super intelligent full stop?Or super intelligent *for a snail*?
Why is every answer to every answer "decoy snail"?
You get arrested and locked up. Good luck getting away from the snail in a cell.
He writes a letter with his slime, duh.
>I have friends Now now... a million dollars can get you a lot but not the impossible.   
"FORCEFIELD CAN'T TA-"*tag****"I SAID I HAD A FORCEFIELD THAT TAG DOESN'T COUNT THIS IS BULLSHIT!!!"***
I am the snail. I notice that periodically you move vast distances, presumably to keep your distance from me. I now make it my goal to position myself in anticipation of your next move, rather than mindlessly crawling in your direction like a not very intelligent snail.
I'm cracking the fuck up imagining a snail going through customs at an airport 
What is the motivation of the snail to touch you, seems like the intelligent thing to do would be to invest it's million dollars and live a simple retired life
Yes, but it's immortal and will forever crawl towards me, I will make it's life miserable :)
Well its copy/pasted of course
Burnie you got the name wrong.
Sounds pretty sweet. I wish it wasn't a death-touch snail, it would be cool to be a sidekick for super intelligent snail stuff.
"I fell on it"
Snail will bribe a person with $20,000 to get him out of the ball.I know I would free a magical snail from a hamster ball for less.
What if you just get a sense of it deconstructing you psychologically in the ball. You know that's what its doing right? It can see right through you
If a Magikarp can run from me, so can a snail.
And if you treat him well it's not like he has a reason to kill you. He knows your location and he knows that he can kill you if you touch him but he has no motive to actually go through with it if you treat him well. Also who wouldn't want an eternal companion if they're immortal since the death touch thing only works one-way.
Snail's immortal.
Snailed it. Actually that pun had very little to do with snails. So bad. 
Does anyone think if it as a "loss" in that way?I've only ever heard of people saying "loss" to family and friends that no longer have the deceased in their life.
It's pretty simple actually. You just put your micro penis in the shell
"Moving just like, a little" might have it tied for laziness though.
It was a decoy of a decoy snail, so it was the real snail, meaning you launched the real snail on a fake rocket so you just wasted money on a fake rocket that did nothing to the snail.
You're an all star.
I just spat my coffee on my desk, this is fucking hilarious
have friend smash the snail with a hammer to prove its the immortal snail. if it lives, proceed with the plan, if it dies, shit self.
/r/2meirl4meirl Seriously though, hang in there...you still have a long ways to go
The fuck?  Is that sub trying to cure depression and cynicism?  Well it's doing a bang up job.  You go sub!
Clearly you haven't figured out a way to become a super intelligent snail either.  
The ring came off my pudding can!
"Ryan, why does a triangle add up to turning the other way?"
The poor man wants all that he has notThe rich man wants not all that he hasThe snail neither has nor wantsSo who among them is the wisest? 
Right! The salt...the salt for kuzco...the salt chosen to kill kuzco... kuzco's salt...
Except there aren't enough boxes on earth to box every single snail. OP you're no more prepared for this than we are.
Oh my god.
As long as she's at least old enough to get a senior discount, I see no issue.After 65, age is just a number, right?
Asking the important questions.
I have 25 square feet of room to dodge the snail for the next 10 years, who needs sleep anyways 
Oh then I'd just order a new ball every year.
can't believe I'm getting roasted on a post about a hypothetical murder snail 
You're moving the goal posts. The premise is that it crawls towards me, not towards where it thinks I will be. 
>And I'd be living in a place where snails can't survive - namely, the desert city of Las Vegas.  A man mysteriously arriving in Las Vegas with $1 MM, fleeing from a sentient mollusk, and constantly paranoid about every speck on the wall? Yeah, I'd watch that. 
> where snails can't survive - namely, the desert city of Las VegasScrew that, build a nice house out on the salt flats. 
The snail is a super intelligent being and as you know by reading this thread, with a own mineral water company. It probably made the 1 million it received already into 234 billion dollars. And it uses that money to create clones of itself to decoy you, hardcore advanced technology to track you and travel to you and probably also has its own human slave cyborgs that do its bidding.
> By my calculations, even if the snail was at the terminal, it still couldn't move fast enough to board a flight before it took off.Wrong. It'll move just as fast as you thanks to TSA.
"I was makin' vegetable soup and I dropped the carrot, and I tripped and landed on the carrot, and now there's a carrot in my butthole"
But how could the snail communicate with people in order to do that? OP's snail doesn't speak, and snail drool is transparent when it dries.
You could spraypaint the hamsterball black
What if the super intelligent death snail is tormented by its own immortality and decides the only way to end it is to end *you*?
Doesn't mean it doesn't hurt like hell
"Now it's time to escargot to heaven."
Decoy, not fake. The decoy rocket is headed to Arcturus. Bon voyage. 
Get your game on.
the snail would find a way to make it look like it died
I try. Each day I get a little closer.
Take my pen knife, my good man!
That salt? 
I have a pet snapping turtle.  I already pick up any snail I see with tongs (because they are slimy and gross) and feed them to my turtle.In this scenario, the snail which my turtle cannot destroy in the one that gets boxed up forever.
I think you can fit more than one snail in a box.
It's a very intelligent question. Watch out for this guy.
Ummm just put a glass cup over the snail. Too heavy to lift for the snail, and now you're safe. Why is everyone complicating things?
and hire someone to steal the snails money
It's not like he's embarrassing you in front of your friends.
Technically, every direction on Earth is towards you since it's a sphere that you can travel all the way around. The prompt doesn't say "towards you in the shortest path" so away from you is also towards you. Checkmate.
>you both become immortal
That snail is immortal though
Holy shit this snail doesn't fuck around 
But does it actually *want* to kill you, or is it just in its nature that when it's crawling around it tends to crawl toward you.Also, super-intelligent or not, if it must continue heading toward you, and directly toward you, that will make it difficult for it to stop to invest its money, to communicate with people, to find or head toward an airport, etc. In fact, that million dollars is just going to get left behind as the snail heads toward you.
Superintelligent snail goes to a beach and writes a message in the sand by rolling around. Good counterpoint though.  
You can't spraypaint your knowledge its harsh thoughts away though ;_;
Someone call the cops!
It's a smart/immortal snail. Not a damn reality-warper. We're talking Deadpool immortality here, not Mephisto.
Because I'M ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE SNAIL, SHIT THIS IS A MISTAKE!
Fission mailed!
He might be a snail.
Oh dear Lord forgive this young man for committing a murder.
He would live there to eliminate the chance of decoy snails. Only the immortal snail could survive coming after him. Then he could set a trap for him.
Just because it survives doesn't mean the journey needs to be pleasant.
Not invulnerable though. It would hurt the snail so much that it would probably think it isn't worth it.
Seriously, this part wasn't made clear at all.  Can the snail be reasoned with?  Maybe I can convince it that it's in the snail's own best interest to let me live.  Maybe he didn't read the rules too clearly either and only just ASSUMED he had to try and kill me.Everybody's all focused on running away from the snail or trying to trap or kill it first, but... Did anyone ever stop and just ask the snail why he's doing it?
I just witnessed a murder!
EVERYTHING YOU SAY TO MEEEEEEE
We're on to you, snail 
>What are your deepest fears?>"The French for sure"lmao
The worst part is I can't even relate the story of this burn later without sounding like a loser. 
And then it all turns out to have taken place a) in a dream b) during a bad trip. I'd watch the shit outa this movie.... Actually, can you imagine the trailer for this? How boring would that trailer be? I'm just imagining a bunch of ominous cuts between a guy running and a snail crawling with a gleam in it's eye.
This would be a great way to fish out the decoy snails though. The one that survives the trek across the flats is obviously the one that can kill you.
Buddhists burn alive while sitting still and meditating. This snail is super intelligent, it can meditate across a salt flat
Well now the snail has a stillsuit
Seriously, the little guy doesn't gain anything from my death. It's not like I put him in my will or anything, why does he want me dead?
SENDS ME ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE SNAILGOTTA INCREASE MY SALT INTAKE

Excellent! A few grains on his leaves, then I'll propose a toast, then he will be dead before dessert!
Maybe you're not as captivating as you think you are?
No one has friends on Reddit anyways. We're all karmawhoring
The snail would seek your death quite naturally.  You are both immortal.  You and artificial intelligence are the two concepts on this planet that represent a real existential threat to it.  Eventually even if people imprisoned it, their culture or even species, if someone doesn't try to free the snail for their own benifit prior, may go away.
My dad's stripper girlfriend is here and she's been farting nonstop since about a quarter after seven.

There is only so many times I can listen to Mariah Carey 
Because I'm at work. How do you like all that electricity you're getting?Also, half of my family is in Mexico and half of them are in the Caribbean. 
My granddaughter is sitting on the arm of my chair watching a Christmas movie, as I type this.  
I'm taking a shit.
I lost at monopoly. Don't feel like family right now.
I'm doing both.
Oh fuck lol. This post got me. There'd a bunch of little kids running around downstairs, and I'm waiting for my cousin to get here so we can open presents and stuff. What about *YOU*, OP?
Alone Christmas is amazing. Zero stress. Tons of food. When it would cost $1200 to fly my small family one hour (in airplane time) away, I say fuck that and FaceTime instead. 
Because I'm cuddling in bed with my 2 yr old son.  Two weeks ago his dad told me he wanted a divorce because he's had a 2 yr affair.  I am so depressed this Christmas that I can't do anything but sit and stare.   
Because I'm at my in-laws house and yet again, after being in the family 10 years, nobody got me anything.  My wife and I got them all something and they only buy her stuff...I hate them.  This is garbage.Worse, I'm the bread winner in the house and bought all of this stuff.   I just don't have the energy to smile and be nice anymore.    Football and Reddit in the other room... 
Its 8am christmas morning, just woke up with a hangover. Whiskey w/ beer as chaser 5/7
This is the weirdest Xmas of my life. Parents both passed so it's just me and the sibs. Oldest bro was thrown in jail this morning until we managed to bail him out a few hours ago. Hit the bar to soothe our woes, then last minute grocery shopping at Walgreen's (and drunken flirting with the pseudo punk cashier girl).Now my brothers are blasting music and dancing like morons and I'm taking a break with a cig and some redditation.Happy Holidays, love all you idiots
Haven't talked to my parent's in over 3 years after I came out and was kicked out. Currently working overtime getting paid a fuck ton of money. 
I don't have a family...
Because I have nothing to do and pretty much nothing to talk about. If anybody talks to me I put down my phone.
I'm Jewish. It is Hannukah but it's not a super important holiday and we have seven more days of it, so I don't feel guilty about not being with them right now. 
My mom told me she didn't think I could handle being around family, so she left me at her house and went to theirs. I have a mood disorder and sometimes have issues keeping it together. This is absolutely the last year I am celebrating Christmas. 
No one loves me. This is fine.*edit* my family does love me, I just prefer to stay to myself, hang out with my cat, and browse reddit.
Big thing tomorrow. Wife is baking cookies and I am baking a doobie.All is well at the Compound.
I'm Jewish and my family is in another country
My family went to Paris for vacation and forgot to bring me. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to finish rigging the house with booby traps before some burglars show up.

> strokeHang in there. They're just never quite the same after a stroke. They can heal over time but it's just never the same and they get really frustrated/aggravated because they know something has drastically changed that they can't fix. And some of their less desirable qualities can really manifest themselves. 15 years ago we had to spend Christmas Eve/Day in an ICU waiting room. This time of year has forever changed for me. I've learned to make new traditions and have found new family. It takes time but you can get through it.Source: 16+ year caregiver of a stroke survivor
I'm in the same boat. I did hang an Xmas wreath on my front door.This has been an absolute sucky year, made a gazillion times worse because my 12 yr-old dog died in August. He was the family I celebrated with.
Hey congrats on graduating! And happy holidays and birthday. I hope you have great friends to celebrate with, and enjoy every day. 
Well congrats on graduating college. Merry Christmas! Have a Happy New Year! I hope you have an awesome Birthday! 
I just want you to know that I read all that and greatly empathize with you. Your son and wife are blessed to have you 
I work in hospitality. You'd be surprised how many women in our restaurants freak the fuck out when Mariah Carey's "all I want for Christmas is you" comes on. It's alarming the screams from the grown women everywhere.

Parents just divorced, at my grandparents house watching elf for the 70th time with my sister, love the holidays!
Look at Mr. Fancypants here flying one hour instead of driving.
It's my first christmas since my dad died. He was estranged from all of the family except me, so I'm sort of alone in this. The cancer care centre where he died gave me a hand-made quilt donated by volunteers, and I brought that with me to my family's, just so I'd have something of him with me. 
Damn dude, sorry for your loss.So watchya playin?
Hey friend, me too.  Mom passed in September and I've been thinking about her a great deal.  Feels weird going through the motions when you know you have to.
Sorry for your loss.
I'm still struggling with my soon to be ex wife's affair, the holidays are tough. It's been 4 years since I found out and everything fell apart and I'm still a wreck. If you need someone to talk to I'm here to listen, trust me you need to let it out or the holidays will fucking kill you.
My house burnt down earlier this year, so Christmas is total bullshit this year. Everyone's annoyed and frustrated and cranky..
You know what? Get your revenge by holding your head up high and enjoying yourself. It will take time but you will get past this.Source: Someone who's had their fair share of life ass kickings
Happy first night of Hanukkah
Why aren't you eating chinese food with your family?
Well then I Jewish you a Happy Hannukah. 
So? You should be watching a movie while nursing your Chinese food baby with your family.
Just a jew, a lonely jew, I'd be merry, but I'm HebrewOn Christmas...
we're Muslim, I feel you dude
There's a fuck up in every family.
It's only 7:52 PM Christmas Eve here. Trying to get your presents early you time traveling piece of shit?
1200 Xmas Day in Australia!
It's even worse when there are people you'd rather be with, but you're forced to be with your family.
r/eyebleach?
Just start singing "All Star" by Smash Mouth as loud as you can until they stop arguing and join in. 
Your day sounds like a great independent movie I'd put on a list to see once it hits the shitty cinema in my town which it never will so I'll forget about it until I see it on Netflix four years later after scrolling through my suggestions for half an hour.
We are your family :D
Exactly, people are always like, "YOU KIDS ARE ALWAYS ON YOUR DAMN PHONE YOU SHOULD TALK ONCE IN A WHILE""Ok what do you wanna talk about?""...""Exactly.bitch"
Psych nurse here. If your blood pressure is stable, ask your doctor about Prazosin (minipress). We use it specifically for nightmares related to PTSD.
If ya need a friend those 2 hours hit me up we can talk or play online games 
Hannukah isn't a big holiday?  Then what is?
Gotta get them 5 free loot boxes
I'm sure your cat loves you.
God damn, I wish I had a compound. Or at the least a barbed wire fence around my house.
Perhaps you could make something out of clay to play with?
Have my upvote, ya filthy animal
/r/unexpectedhomealone
Not as hard as my dad hits.
Mom had a stroke on January 9th of this year. I'm the caretaker, brother too busy with work. Sucks but it is what it is. I'll get my life on track when I can.Hope your holidays are great and have a good new year!
Appropriate response lol 
Why are you 5000 miles away?
I can't help but think that the nearest animal shelter might have a lonely dog that's anxiously waiting to celebrate Christmas with someone who will love him back.  
Thanks, it means a lot (:
I'm a grown-ass man and you'd be surprised at how I freak the fuck out when it comes on. There's a diva in all of us.
I can explain my jealousy in crippling detail. 
So do astronomers, that is why they went there. 
It is :)  Had a hectic day. Last minute shopping, travelling for hours to get here (on public transport with an overexcited kid) and helping my folks prepare for tomorrow.  Now it's time to relax with shitposts and wine!  
Probably. She's out with her fiance.  
AND firetrucks.  *eyeroll*friggin' Divas.  Put out your own fires and drive yourselves to the hospital.  You'll never learn to take care of yourself if we're always doing it for you!
Someone coded on my floor tonight at work. Don't they know it's Christmas Eve?!Edit 1: Coding is a medical colloquialism for cardiopulmonary arrest. For you programmer bros, if one of you can help me with my python script that'd be great.   Edit 2: My first Reddit Gold! It truly is a Christmas miracle. Thanks stranger! 
Entitled chest-clutching a-holes.
You ungrateful little shit why I oughta send three ghosts over to your house to frighten you into realising the true joys of electricity millennial good for nothing you don't even know how electricity works dumb fucking shirt fuck youMerry christmas
3pm to 1am here. Single with no kids. I offered to work Christmas and Christmas Eve. Time and a half plus a two full day's worth of vacation. Gonna be a nice paycheck.  
This is my human granddaughter.  I also have a pug and chihuahua on my lap. 
The family that squats together, plops together.
We need a subreddit for people who lost Christmas games to recover.
As weird as it may sound here is where I can talk without being judged for who I am(instead of what my opinion is). No one in the family gives a shit about me till I am earning well and doing what I am supposed to. I could start doing drugs and I am sure no one would notice. All my friends live a thousand km away. So yeah.. this site/you guys <3.
Me too. I don't call it reddit, I call it brownit.
4 kids screaming, dogs going crazy, wife and mother gossiping with each other, blah blah blah. At least im in the same room
Ah, this is the nuclear family I can appreciate.
Thanks for your kind message. Despite reddit's imperfections, it blows my mind that ranting into the digital ether can bring out genuine support like yours, even at a time like Christmas Eve.
Thanks dude. I guess I've only delayed the inevitable; soon, she'll start demanding to know specifics of my "program." But it's reassuring to know this happens to other people out there.Out of curiosity, what are you studying?
Education, it turns out.
Mrs. Fancypants, and the drive is 9 hours over mountains with a two year old, so...nah. 
Thanks man. Been playing Fifa and Final Fantasy XV! FF is so good! 
Hey buddy. I lost my mom in October 2012 and the first Christmas was absolutely awful. Four years later and it's a mostly happy affair for my family with a few sighs and sometimes the occasional tear.  The pain never goes away but it's less "front and center" as time goes on. I hope you'll come to appreciate it for the time you have with the family that's still here at some point like my family and I have.
I feel so hard for you people. I've never been married but my ex broke up with me after dating for 3 years on Thanksgiving 2 years ago and i found out she slept with a roommate of mine the day after christmas. Holiday's kicked my ass and I was only 19. I can't even fathom it being someone you trusted so mich to marry them and have kids with.
I had this happen 15 years ago.  My mom somehow managed to out together one of my all time favorite Christmases  it was a real rough year but I'll always have fond memories of that Christmas. 
on the first night of Hanukkah my true love gave to me
Because us jewy-jew-jews (everyone say that out loud) do that tomorrow night.
Do you have a "merry Christmas" saying for an Islamic festival? Something like "joyous Eid" or "happy Ramadan" would probably roll off the tongue.
And now, 3 hours later, it's still 12pm Christmas Day in Australia.Everyone forgets the west coast #bestcoast
Or the person you'd rather be with told you to fuck off and ran directly into her exes arms. 
This is a great suggestion OP. I did 5 years in the Army Infantry and got injured in Mosul Iraq. Every night afterwards was a nightmare(literally). VA prescribed me mini press and life has been much more tolerable. Even if your PTSD isn't service related don't hesitate to PM brother. We're all in this together. 
Now that is the holiday spirit! If you guys want a 3rd, let me know. 
Thanks! I will keep this in mind.
Damnit! Should have thought of that when the stores were still open. 
I could go on forever, baby.
Please make sure that you take care of yourself. You can really get worn down over time. The stress will really do a number on you physically and emotionally. My brother and her family could care less and it's taken a toll. I've let my life get off track for too long. Please don't make my mistake.I wish YOU awesome holidays and a fabulous New Year. Please PM me if you ever feel the the need. I never understood what far reaching impact strokes could have until my mom had both of hers.
If he doesn't have disposable income even after losing his dog, maybe taking on the long-term responsibility of another animal isn't the best choice. You really should be able to afford to care for an animal before you adopt one. I can't tell you how many people I've seen barely scraping by whose pets need to see a vet, but they put it off because they can't afford it.
if you don't have friends like me you can always shoot me a PM buddy
#&nbsp;#&nbsp;^^that's ^^deep.
That sounds exhausting.Have a Merry Christmas tomorrow! =)
Ugh, I guess I'll make sure the runway at this airport doesn't ice up so all you jerks can go see your families... Then again, I'm Jewish so I kinda volunteered to work.Edit - WOOWOO!!! ALL ABOARD THE GOLD TRAIN!!! SEE YOU SUCKERS IN THE LOUNGE!!! Seriously though, thank you muchly kind stranger! I hardly think doing what I do is gold worthy. Honestly, I'd do it for free. I get to be up close and personal with big trucks and planes.Edit 2 - Hanukkah started tonight?! I had no idea... /s
Number please! 
So... Was that the shitpost of Christmas Past, Present, or Future?
7pm to 7am here. Working at the front desk of a motel. Someone's gotta keep the rooms warm and doors open for hookers and junkies ;) 
"This is my human granddaughter." i can't stop laughing at this 
My mom refers to my cat as her granddaughter. She has settled for second best after she gave up on me ever having human children. And admittedly, I do spoil my cat. I bought her a quarter pound of King/Chinook Salmon for Christmas.
You see Ivan, when you of squat with fam, you share bonding time over hating of Capitalist pig.
/r/paindeergames
I'm sorry dude. Here, take some love.
You're human man, there's no being worthy about it. Don't feel guilty for taking, when so much has been taken from you.
Sometimes it's reddit. Those are scary times
Are we in the same house?
We're not the typical household, but it works! :)
The way you write tells me that you are an intelligent well rounded and reasonable person. PhD or not, you'll be fine I am sure. 
Well, at least it sounds like you're living away from home. Distance definitely helps. Also, r/AsianParentStories is your friend.Applied math! Specifically, physics-based models that are used to study living systems.
The next time she starts in on you, tell her that you're just not smart enough to earn a PhD like her and your late father - and that's it's obviously because of the recessive defective genes they passed on to you.;>
Did you keep the maiden name of Fancypants when you wed, or did you marry into the Fancypants family?
Nice! Ive been wanting to play FFXV but I can't justify getting another game with the 5 im already playing.
Similar situation after 5 years. I know plenty of people have it worse, but its been 10 months for me and feeling like shit is putting it pretty lightly. She was once my best friend and I don't think I will ever be the same again.
We have been really fortunate, we were donated a tree and ornaments. It's just been waves, I'm okay and trying to handle it, and then I just have a pity party. I go between pity/sadness and then guilt. I had so much, I'm fortunate, I'm lucky - why am I feeling bad for myself?? It's been a rough year.
One present
Lots of us did it tonight! In fact, I'm just heading home from a big ol Jewish Christmas Eve right now!
Eid Mubarak!
I have PTSD from something not service related, and I have constant nightmares. I haven't been able to reliably sleep in years. Is there really a medicine that I can get that would help out with that? I never mentioned it to my doc because I figured the nightmares were just something people dealt with...
I know you've been smooching with my brother
OK Johnny I'm sorry 
YOU BEEN SMOOCHIN WITH EVERYBODY! Al, Leo, Little Moe with the Gimpy leg!
It was. But we got there safe and sound and that's all that matters :)  Merry Christmas to you too! Have a great one <3
You're in Denver, I'm in the news station working because things like that still happen on holidays.
HAHAHA. YES. I AM HUMAN. COME, FELLOW HUMANS, LET US ENJOY COMPANY AND MERRY FESTIVITIES WHILE INJESTING GLUCOSE INTO OUR ONE-WAY DIGESTIVE TRACTS.
I am so sad that is not a thing.
I'm trying to force myself to think and feel that way. I'm just so terrified of people getting the wrong idea about me or something. I've never *ever* been good at accepting help from others, but lord knows, if I've ever been in a situation where I needed assistance, this is certainly that moment. 
Maybe, do you see a five year old wearing a Sonic costume and screaming that he's a "speed-type" Pokemon?
Sounds like a house I would like to live in.
Diabolical. She might respond by deciding to limit the spread of said defective genes by massacring me.
Oh, sorry, forgot the hyphen.Fan-Cypants. 
Stay unsinkable, friend.

As someone who's family insists on going to the movies during the holidays, I am so sorry and thank you so much
The movies are open? What a shitty tradition.
Just you wait 
Hey buddy: take the gift and pay it forward. One day when things are working better for you, you can do the same for someone else. That day will come!
When they get grounded they play games for my husband. They mentioned it to their friends and all of them were like, "I wish I could play video games for my punishment!"
Phone, or in public.Toxic parenting 101. They can't be an asshole in public. And if they are it's hilarious
Gonna give you to the count of ten... to get ya ugly, yella, no-good keester off my property...
as someone being dragged to the movies on xmas day, thank you for your sacrifice.
There's a million things I haven't done 
WITH ARTHUR FONZARELLI 
My tired eyes read that as on oxmas day, I imagined you having this awesome pagan holiday around a roast ox and bonfire with lots of mead.
What's yo' name, man?
That sounds like... 10x more exciting than Christmas. Someone needs to make this a thing.

In college I had a fair number of all nighters and usually had the tv going to help keep me up and help with concentration. Once a couple weeks after submitting an essay for a political science class I noticed that the message I sent with it to my professor went something like: "attached is my water for Italian cooking". My essay was completely fine and had nothing to do with Italy. I guess my brain just turned off as soon as I'd attached the paper and there must have been some cooking related infomercial on tv while I sent it. 
Was on the phone with my boss and she was getting really irritated about something, I don't even remember what. The combination of her irritation and my exhaustion made my brain misfire, and I ended the call with "okay bye bye Mom, I love you!". I was so embarrassed but she thought it was hilarious and started calling me her adopted daughter after that. I mean, she is the same age as my mom so it's not too weird, but I certainly felt like a child around her instead of a colleague until she left the company. I miss her ):
My husband and I had an inside joke. Whenever someone lost something, the other person always asked, "have you checked inside your butt?"  I was in a meeting at work (conservative and traditional corporate office) one day and a coworker said, "I can't find my pen." Without any thought or hesitation I quickly responded, "have you checked inside your butt?" As soon as I said it, I snapped back to reality and realized I was at work. As you can imagine, everyone went silent and stared at me as my face turned bright red. 
Not too weird because it does make sense, I recently moved to the apartment directly above the one I used to live in. My former roommate leaves the door unlocked. The frequency at which I just storm in and enter my empty old bedroom is staggering. 
I'm a security guard for Amazon and I have to do bathroom checks. Caught myself yelling "SECURITY!" right before going to the restroom at a bar on my day off. Thank God it was empty. 
When I was in school (6th grade I think) my mom would make my bagged lunch.  She would wrap soda cans with aluminum foil so they would stay cold (pretty sure that doesn't work).  One day I un-wrapped my soda and discovered she packed me a beer that day.
Cleaning up my face with electric clippers.  Thought, "Oh, missed a spot." and proceeded to shave off my fucking eyebrow.
Answered my cell phone"[911 center] what's the location of your emergency?"Makes my spouse laugh, my friends roll their eyes, and scares the fuck out of telemarketers. 12 hr night shifts are a bitch.
My wife and I were dying some Easter eggs and drinking wine this past Saturday night and I watched her take a big swig out of orange. There was an egg in the cup and everything.
Opening a Mozzarella cheese stick for my daughter, threw away the actual cheese stick and gave her the wrapper. 
I have two:1) Walking to work on a very straight path through a nature reserve. I fell asleep and sleepwalked for about 10 mins. It was so weird, i blinked and suddenly appeared near the end of my journey.2) Got into my car with coffee and a newspaper. Carefully held the rolled-up newspaper whilst hurling the coffee onto the passenger seat. 
I grabbed my "lunch" on my way out the door for work in the morning.I kept wondering what that beeping noise was the whole drive there. Couldn't figure it out.Got to work and grabbed my lunch, only to realize I had actually grabbed the baby monitor.
Instead of ground coffee, I put a couple scoops of sugar in my coffee filter and brewed it.
Once while playing an intense board game, I was concentrating so hard that my buddy realized that he could just hand random things to me and I'd take them and put them in my jacket pocket or place them on the table in front of me. I only realized when I ran out of space to put things. 
I cared for a horse for several years. First thing in the morning I would go put feed and water in the field, lead her out, and close the fence behind her.One morning as I'm walking back into my house, I hear a weird sound behind me. The sound of hooves on linoleum. She looked as surprised as I was that I had brought her into my kitchen. Luckily, she never told anyone so my secret is still safe.
Patted one of my coworkers on the butt. I was in the habit of walking up behind my husband and patting him on the butt, so it was just automatic. Fortunately, coworker wasn't offended.
I used to work in a call center and would answer my personal phone with my call center speech 
Woke up three hours early for some reason and didn't check the clock but thought I was running late. Rushed through getting ready for work and hit the road. Think it's a bit darker then usual but it could just be grey clouds before the rain. Roads are bit emptier then I'm expecting, must be lucky today. Finally pull up to work and start opening up the shop before anyone else gets in. Look over at the clock and realize I still have two hours to go before I even wake up. Almost went home but decided to stay and just take off three hours earlier then normal.
Texting my wife while cashing out at the grocery store. She had just done laundry so I wanted to thank her. Rather than typing, I spoke aloud to the cashier saying 'thanks, love you'
I used to work at the airport while in college, and one day I went to get groceries and drove 30 mins to the airport instead. 
I woke up one morning in college, got dressed, left my room and got halfway out of the dorm before I realized I had no pants on.
Spent ages cooking dinner only to pick the plate up and empty it straight into the bin. I was so tired and hungry, I cried
Raising my hand to voice my opinion while in a conversation not a school
I feed my cat while I make breakfast. One very sleep deprived morning I made cereal in her bowl and put her kibble in my cereal bowl. I didn't realize I fucked up until I shoved a giant spoonful of cat food in my mouth and chewed a few times. 
grabbing my keys, phone, wallet, etc. before work.why is there a tv remote in my car?the etc. included the tv remote
I tried to put a pacifier in my mother's mouth as opposed to infant she was holding. The best part is that she was nagging the hell out of me. 
When I was 18, hanging out with my then girlfriend at her place. Fell asleep for a bit, and when I woke up she said, "you're cute when you sleep." My immediate sleep-brain reply was, "not when seven people end up dead."
I drove a city bus in college.  My route and my commute home had a road that overlapped.  Driving home from work one night I ended up doing my bus route instead of my commute home and didn't realize it until I ended up in the bus terminal at the end of the line.  I guess it was better than driving into my apartment complex with the city bus.
Lose my phone in my hand while in the middle of a call.
put my phone in the fridge to "charge"
I asked a customer to let me know if we were out of something and I would grab it for them and instead of saying "come yell at me" I said "come at me". Also at different job told a customer "goodnight yourself"
probably the time i cracked 3 eggs into the sink. one after another.
Left my house extremely sleepy and drove to my old high school instead of the university. I'm in grad school and have been out of high school for 5 years. I was turning in before I realized what I did, thought I had stroked out for a minute.
I got out of work late, drove home. Must have dozed off because last thing I remembered was being on the freeway a couple of exits from home. Woke up in the garage 10 min later, with the car turned off. I got home safely without causing an accident. Scared me still thinking about it.
Post Duty ER. Was already home and asleep. Mom woke me up for dinner, saying "Food's gonna get cold", thought I heard "code", so I jumped up and shouted "where?" And ran down to the dining area only to realize I was at home.
Cooked my phone in the oven.
Had a pet rat out roaming with me while I made some toast.   cleaned up, put the rat in the fridge and didn't realise until I put the butter in the cage that *oh shit*Went to reclaim the rat, she was all "Fuck off, the food box is MINE now". Already gotten into the ham.
Locked keys in car then locked car inside house garage.good times
Someone knocked at my door and i knocked back...
Was at my fiances house for dinner. Had to leave early. Was in a rush. Kissed her dad on the way out. 
Sprayed my hair down with what I thought was hair spray. It was Lysol. 
I tried to put the cat into the tool drawer and then almost put the poor thing into the fridge 30 seconds later. 
I wear a fob watch at work. Pinned to my chest. On my days off I don't half get odd looks if someone asks me the time and I automatically start pawing at my boob. When my daughter was very young she loved trains. So I'd take her on short trips and the line passed some fields, where I'd point out the animals to her. Got some weird British alarmed looks that time I pointed out of the window and loudly said "look! Moo cows!" when was on the train by myself. 
Spent all afternoon making chicken soup with the remains of a whole baked chicken carcass. After hours of simmering, it tasted great out of the pot...so I walked over to the sink and poured the whole thing through a colander like it was pasta to be strained. It didn't hit me for a second. I just stood there stupidly looking at the non-fluid portion of the soup in the pot. I felt like such an idiot.
Put toothpaste on my razor and almost went to town on my mouth.
*sighs* It had been a long, rough day at work. Once I got home I really had to pee, I pulled down my pants, sat and started peeing. I forgot a step. Pull down underwear. You read it right everyone, I pissed myself on the toilet.  EDIT - Fun fact, I never shared my embarrassing moment with my husband. I wanted to share some of the funny responses I got and finally just told him. He hasn't stopped laughing yet. (He was having a bad day so I'm glad I shared.)
I was woken up at 3:30 in the morning for a random drug test for baseball last semester and after I pissed in the cup, I drank it.Don't know why, but I did it. Luckily there was still enough in the cup to test. 
I often have the urge to say "ok, love you, bye", when ending a work call.  
I kissed a teacher on the cheek, she told someone "I can't hear you" while tapping her fingers on her cheek and I thought she wanted a kiss...
Was typing up an essay, mind started spacing out, came back around and I had typed a page without any errors. Was strangely proud of myself
Walked into the bedroom and started peeing in the trashcan 
I ordered a meatlong football from subway. I then got upset when the dude had no idea what I wanted.Then we both laughed.
Poured orange juice instead of milk into my cereal, put the bowl of cereal into the fridge, walked back to the table with nothing wondering where the fuck I put my cereal.
Put the dinner on and realised I had no carrots.  Decided to drive to the shop to get carrots - ended up driving to work.  Burnt the shit out of all the pots and had to buy new ones :(
shaving my legs, i'm 20 so have been doing this for 7+ years. go to clean hair out of the razor blades between strokes: the usual way to do this is just swirl the razor in water/wipe with a flannel etc. for some reason i just ran my finger along the blades to get the hair out, instantly realised i had been a fucking idiot and was in massive pain 
I put on a coat I hadn't worn in awhile and felt an Altoid in the pocket. Sweet!, loose mint. I popped it in my mouth and it was a watch battery.
Responded to a question in the wrong language
Vigorously picking my nose while holding a cigarette and driving; crammed lit cigarette up my nose
I was in the midst of an 8 hour shift at work. I had to pee for over 2 hours at this point but I was in the middle of working a lunch rush (I worked at a restaurant) so I didn't have time to go. Suddenly things calm down. A-HA! My opportunity! I rejoiced. I run to the bathroom, unbutton my pants, and take a squatting position. In front of a urinal. In a bathroom with roughly six men inside. I am an 18 year old female. 
one time, one of the kids asked for... shit i don't even remember what. probably asked for a sandwich or something. on autopilot(i was tired and sick) i go into the kitchen, got a bowl out of the cabinet, sliced up a bunch of ham, put that in the bowl, poured in apple juice, stuck a slice of toast and a teabag on top and handed it to him with a steak knife. kiddo was smart. he watched me do all that, took the bowl and knife, said 'thank you', put it on the table and went and got my wife and said 'daddy's super tired' and showed her what i'd done. she put me to bed after that. 
When I was a kid, I was having breakfast, pancakes and apple juice.  Somehow, I poured myself a glass of maple syrup and took a slug, expecting apple juice.  Spit it across the room.
Lately when im browsing internet i suddenly get an idea strike and i have to search for something,i open up a new tab and instantly forget what i wanted to search for,i get really mad close my eyes and try to figure out what i wanted and succeed like 2/10 times, most of times i just close the new tab thinking that im a young man with a mind of a old man with some brain damage. it hurts
My wife and I had a really long day running all over the city with out daughter. This was three days after my second deployment where I had been gone for 12 months. We got in bed and I just sort of opened my laptop, put headphones on, and turned on the ol porn. I didn't understand why I had just gotten slapped until nearly 30 seconds after the fact.
Put my keys in the freezer
On a similar note, I did park maintenance for awhile and often entered the opposite sex bathroom to clean. I have found myself yelling "FEMALE MAINTENANCE WORKER!" before entering the ladies room
What did you do with the beer and why is the answer you chugged it?
Been giggling like mad at all the stories, but yours? yours pushed me over the edge. I think My laughing just woke up the neighborhood..
Thank you for the diabolical idea of how to get rid of telemarketers! 
"Fuck you, this is all you get."
I just burst out laughing at 2. Thanks for that.
Imagine you pick up someone elses signal with the baby monitor and start hearing voices in your car. 
How did it taste 
The other day I was checking in at an amusement park. After the guy scanned my ticket, I, for some unknown reason, held out my hand. And the guy handed me his scanner. 
Haha I've done that.I was walking through town with my gf at the time, looking at stalls and shops and she was in my periphery, or so I thought... She had stopped to look at something else and a woman of roughly the same height and hair colour was stood next to me.I checked my phone for time, gently caressed her shoulders and said "come on now, it's time for us to head off". And just walked away from this woman.I turned around a few meters later to see my gf a luminescent shade of embarrassed and this entirely freaked out little old Asian woman.
I had to go to Walmart once after finishing my midnight cashier shift from a competing grocery retailer across the street. I absentmindedly grabbed my stuff, approached the cashier and asked her if she found everything ok. We stared at each other blankly for a little bit.
I would always try to greet people when they walked into clothing stores/restaurants and then realize I'm shopping/eating too, that's not my job here. 
What flavor was Mister Peepers?
What did you used to do at the airport? I think airports are interesting
I did something like that when I was like 8. My dad was in the car getting ready to take me and my brother to the game room, and I didn't want to miss out so I ran to the car without pants on. Then I hear my mom yelling out the window, "YOU HAVE NO PANTS ON!"
I was making breakfast one early morning and cracked my eggs straight into the garbage.
Aw, I feel ya. That must have sucked. 
I once did this in a skype conversation
Every year I have a day or two where my first period learns something a bit wrong because my brain isn't working. I usually hope they're not paying too much attention and try to reteach it the next day. 
So.. how did it taste?
I have done this. Instead of grabbing my coffee, I got my tv remote and didn't notice until I got to work haha 
Once I was feeding my 1 year old a banana and talking to my mom. In the middle of the conversation, I pushed the banana in front of my moms face and just waited for her to take a bite. It took like 30 seconds to register that I was force feeding my 48 year old mother NOT my toddler. It was hilarious. 
My boyfriend tried to wake me up from a nap and he started tickling me and I started freaking out and getting scared because I thought he was a wire stabbing into me and I was a mountain? 
i was really hoping it was the other way around :(
I was on a bus with a guy new to the route but finished his training. He got mixed up, took a wrong turn, got more mixed up, and some people who were regulars to the route straightened him out and got the bus on track again. It was funny as hell. No one was mad, everyone just apologised and laughed because Canada eh.
It's better than looking for your glasses while you're wearing them. Not my proudest moment...
Makes sense.
Have done, but with just two. First egg: "oh, dammit!" *Rinses egg down sink*Second egg: "oh...oh, fucking come on"
What does code mean
That was the best day of that rat's life.
You reminded me of my favorite one!I kick my truck door closed all the time.  One time, I kicked it closed before grabbing my phone, and in a sleepy panic *threw my keys into the truck just before the door closed.*  I was so out of it I yelled "Yes!" because my sleep addled brain must have thought that was awesome.  Had to wait for my wife to get home to open the door to the house to get the spare.
I worked at a restaurant where we had to knock on the bar door before opening it, I probably did it about 20 times a day for 6 years. Almost every time I open a door that you just have to push open, like a bathroom door at a restaurant or something, I knock really hard like three times. Lots of weird looks. 
Ah crap something similar happened to me. I got to a party and saw people I knew, mostly female, so I gave them all a hug and a small peck on the cheek, get to the one guy in the group, both of us bearded men and proceeded to give him a peck on the cheek. We both just stopped and stared at each other. 
Oh god, I can't!How did he react?
Just who the fuck is Pete, Tiffani?
Do you know any Petes?
I can't stop giggling at the moo cows, now *I* look crazy
Yeah... they probably didn't need the pee to know if you were on drugs after that.
I drive a friend home from work as she has no car and its like 2 am. Done this a few times but one day I drove home about half hour ride. She didn't say anything until I got into my driveway. I was like omg. I forgot you where here as she was quiet. Apologized profusely as the implication could be misread. Took her home after we both got naked at wawa.Good times.
I had this happen to me. I had procrastinated on a film study project, started working on it at 8pm the night before it was due, made it about 1/2 of the way through by midnight, and woke up in my bed at 5:30am to go to school with no recollection of anything after midnight. I was freaking out thinking I still had four hours of work to do to finish, but checked the document and it was *done*. Last saved at 3am. I got an A on a project that I barely remembered doing, and I had done the second half *faster* than when I was conscious.
That sounds more like drunk than auto pilot
What size sub?*meat long*
I've tried to put milk in the cabinet where the cereal goes a bunch of times.  I've even tried to put the box of cereal in the fridge. 
What are some other quotes?
When my husband and I started dating,  we were long distance, and often talked on the phone late at night, due in part to his job and the time difference. One night,  I fell asleep on the phone,  in the middle of my own sentence,  and finished the sentence with something like,  "... but then we need to find a place to camp." It was like my brain was playing mad libs and just filled in with "adjective, noun, verb," or whatever. 
Sounds like you forgot more than just her password. 
My boss was speaking to me in Italian the other day. Another co-worker, also Italian, had to remind him that he was speaking Italian to me and I couldn't understand him. He quickly realized why I had been ignoring him.
Did anyone say anything?
You have the best child.
that combination tho
Did the guy you walked in on say anything?
Had I been a year or two or I probably would have drank it.  I have it to the lunch room teacher who has known my mom for years.
this has been the most entertaining thread I've read in a while.  I think my heart is starting to beat irregularly from all the laughing.
My old girlfriends mom used to pay for fast food in a drive through then drive away.
Just the very image of him angrily hurling coffee at the passenger seat like it offended him somehow has me in tears.
I knew none of those people where paid. They all just pass on the torch.
Can confirm, as a dog, your shoes are delicious
I would be flattered personally if I were old and some young thing accidentally carted me off, but maybe that's just me.  When you're old it's always nice to have something random happen like that, as long as you're not being abducted lol.
I worked as a greeter at a store that isn't Walmart.  One day I was thinking about how I had to go to Walmart after work and greeted people with "Welcome to Walmart" several times.  
Nothing I could compare it to, to be honest 
He was an autopilot. 
I'm glad I'm not the only one, something about airports is really fascinating to me.
Skype meetings are the worst about this because you don't have any body language to clue you in that someone wants to say something.So usually one or two people just steamroll the conversation and you basically have to talk over them for 30 seconds to get them to stop and give you some time.It's honestly a real problem with conference calls in my experience.
Like old beef jerky flavoured sand.
I'm imagining the bus driver just pulling into the driveway, getting out, and leaving all the passengers ~~lol caked~~ *locked* inside.
If it was OCTranspo in Ottawa, people might have laughed about it in public but you can be damn certain they made a bunch of passive aggressive posts about it on /r/Ottawa.
Not as bad as not being able to find your glasses because you can't see without your glasses.
It's faster if you do it in the microwave
He just wanted to chill while watching TV. 
I cracked one right into the trash can. One tap on the side of the stove then right into the garbage you go! Liquid first, shell second, patience last. 
A heart stopped, or someone stopped breathing. Code red or code blue.  At least that's what I remember from when my mom worked in the emergency room. 
haha, oh jesus, those poor guys must get so stressed. I cannot imagine another profession as stressfull that would make you wake up mid panic. "The walk-in freezer is open! Someone left the Walk in freezer open and there's a problem with it's fans!"  Said no cook or waitress ever when waking up in the night. Poor Medical staff, you guys are all nerves. 
I rushed all over there concerned and apologetic and she's fuckin' arse-deep in a packet of ham and actually tried to cling to the door as I took her out.  She'd seen fuckin' paradise and wasn't leaving.  
I worked three jobs once, and they all had different ways of answering the phone, plus, of course, my own phone. One day, I picked up a call at one job, and my mind went completely blank. All the caller could hear from me was "Ah, uh, Thank, hello." Pause. "Thank, uh, This..." Then I hung up. 
Most of my friends would probably just roll with it
He smiled.And said.I know why my daughter likes you.It made it worse
He doesn't want to talk right now. 
No, but when I was a kid I was a bit of a tomboy and wanted people to refer to me as "Pete". I think it was a regression!
The guy who was monitoring our test was just like "WTF?!?!"
Wait what?
He was piloting under influence. 
MEAT. LONG
I heard their meatlongs are not actually twelve meats long.
I did this once. In pretty warm weather. I didn't realize I did it until I came home from work and wondered why the whole apartment reeked of spoiled milk. 
A really common one is she asks me what I'm doing (through text), then asks me again a few minutes later (after I've answered, I'd like to add). I always respond "you just asked that" and she says "oh yea. Autopilot".
Nope. Dead silence. 
he has some serious moments, i admit. other times he's a shrieking pain in the ass.but sometimes he's pretty awesome. 
yeah it was so weird he didn't even blink he just thanked me and went and got his mom. 
He did not, no.My hope is that he didn't notice me.My fear is that he was only pretending to not notice me.
Sounds like you had a few beers before writing this.
I used to be pretty good at making people do this. If you say "Thank you, have a nice day" in the right tone of voice when you hand their card or change back, about 1/3 of the time they'll just drive away. I got two cars in a row to drive off one day. IIRC, only one of them came back, looking sheepish, to get their fried chicken.
It took me a minute to figure out what was going on. I looked down at my hand and I was like "uh, I think you need this," and handed it back to him. He just took it like "thanks..." and went on checking the next person like it was totally normal.
Sir, you are a potato.
Oh yeah? Then what's his vector, Victor?
I think it's because almost everyone at the airport is probably there for an important reason
My brain does that too. One time I couldn't decide between saying France or French, so I ended up with "Franch." To make matters worse, my brain has decided "yup, that works" and now if I'm not careful I'll always end up calling it Franch. 
Do you process the information at the moment and just don't store it? Or is this cool trick a cause of accidents? 
"There's a bug!""Uh-oh" said the programmer, as he rolls over into a more comfortable position.
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO BACK
Just keep rolling with it until after the marriage.
Is Norman available?
That's amazing. How did they respond?
Did you pass the test?
hahaahah that's so great. 
I love to see that good in people. "Oh look some stranger passed out on my couch, drunk. I should get him a blanket." Those people are awesome, and probably going to die from being too nice at some point.
You guys are amazing friends. Kudos to you.
AS LONG AS THE MEAT IS, SIR.
My mom will ask me the same question three times in succession, forgetting I already answered each time.
what happened after
I am laughing so hard thank you so much love you bye
We have clearance, Clarence.
"What's your favorite salad dressing?""Franch"
One phrase I do this all the time with. I often say "take care buddy" or "take care bro". More often than I'd like, it becomes "take care bruddy" or "brud". Makes me wonder if I English as good as I think.
I could do with a tasty dream bear myself...
"I HAVE SEEN WHAT LIES ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE HORIZON, MAN-BEAST. YOU WILL NOT CAST ME BACK TO MY PURGATORY OF IRON BARS AND PROTEIN PELLETS!"(Translated from *'Squeak!'*)
No, just Walter, but he's shy. 
Shock and hysterical laughter ensued. 
By far the best in the thread so far. Just imagining the coworker's face is fucking killing me hahaha
I mean, If I was planning to kill someone, and they offered me a blanket and pillow, I'd probably change my mind.
... So like three inches?
It's been an hour. OP's dead.
You cannot even blame it. Kind of sad for the rat to having seen the truth.
So is Pete a nickname for you around them?
Not to mention that laying prone on someone else's couch is almost the worst killing strategy you could use
the men bit her, now she's turned into one of them. A manpire
Unfortunately. 
"Never pick a fight with an ugly person. They don't have anything to lose."  ~Robin WilliamsOut of the tens of thousands of hilarious things he said, this one always made me laugh the loudest for some reason. RIP, funny man. The world is a lesser place because you're no longer in it. :(
When I was maybe 10 years old, I was in the lobby of a hotel in Baltimore and my dad tapped me on the shoulder and pointed to a guy standing in line. I turned and saw a short, hairy guy with a big pack pack. When I realized who it was, I let out a gasp and made eye contact with Robin Williams. He then looked back at me and let out a gasp of his own. Small, insignificant story, but it makes me laugh thinking back to that. 
My favorite Robin Williams moment: He was asked by a reporter what he said to aspiring comedians who asked him if they should be a comedian.  He flatly said, "I tell them no. Don't do it."  When asked why he would say such a thing he replied; "If they have the drive to make it; they're not going to give a fuck about what I say. And if someone quits because I say that; then they were't going to make it anyway. I just saved that person from wasting their time."
I've always heard people talking about how a certain celebrity death really hurt them, and I couldn't honestly understand it. I had never really looked up to or had been effected by someone I never even met before. Now I know. This death hit me like a ton if bricks. I am at a loss of words truly. All I can say is I truly will miss this man and everything he has done. 
"If you're that depressed, reach out to someone. And remember, suicide is a permanent solution, to a temporary problem." -Robin WilliamsSo sad :(
Finally, the megathread is upon us. Does anyone have any favorite quotes? I like "You're only given one little spark of madness. You mustn't lose it."
One Hour Photo.... Anyone?
For every person who is saddened by this I feel Robin Williams did his job on earth. If you have the feels right now then he positively affected your life and he'd be happy he did. Mission complete. RIP
Favorite story about Robin Williams?
Just goes to show even the most happy, upbeat, and funny people can suffer from severe debilitating depression. He spent his entire life making other people happy. He will be sorely missed. E: Just wanted to add that I'm reading all of your replies and if anyone needs to talk, or perhaps let some of their burden go, my inbox is 100% open. 
Goodbye, Robin Williams. You will be missed. Why did he have to go? :(
Favorite Robin Williams movie?
His portrayal of Patch Adams inspired me in my medical career.  How did he inspire you?
How can we as a group rally to support the people we already love?  Will they speak out and accept the love that we have to give?  I just wish I could hug him and say everything will be all right...last week... 
He's not dead, he's only wandering the forests of Jumanji waiting for his time to return and take us away from the sadness and evil in the world. 
"I heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed, life is harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in threatening world. Doctor says, "Treatment is simple. The great clown Pagliacci is in town. Go see him. That should pick you up." Man bursts into tears."But doctor" He says, "I am Pagliacci." Good joke. Everybody laugh. Roll on snare drum. Curtains."RIP Mr. Williams
"Reality is just a crutch for people who can't cope with drugs." Robbin Williams
Your favorite thing about Robin Williams?
I normally don't care about this sort of thing, people I've never met dying. This and Steve Irwin though really hit me in the feels. 
Who could play Robin Williams in the inevitable biopic?
Any Robin Williams stories from people who met him?
When your job is to make everyoe happy, i guess you forget how to make yourself happy..
He was a social genius among other things.
Patton Oswalt expressed my feelings exactly. 
Spoken like someone who's struggled with depression.
It makes me sad to think how overwhelmingly depressed he must have been to not take his own advice that he has given to millions of people.
Don't forget What Dreams May Come. 
Well, I think it's a pretty safe bet Louis will be at Robin's funeral.
The last time I saw him was in *Wilfred*. 
> The show ends with Robin and Louis agreeing that they'll at least go to each other's funeral, should the other die first.I started thinking about that episode after I heard the news and it really effected me emotionally.  Powerful in the current context.  I'd like to hear what Louie feels about this...  
Today, I learned that Hook has a 31% on rotten tomatoes which is ridiculous because everyone I know loves this movie.
He had a small part in my favorite movie, Artificial Intelligence, as Dr. Know. He recites this poem in his scene and I love it so much.Come away, O human child! To the waters and the wild With a faery, hand in hand. For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.
"Cricket is basically baseball on valium."
Fucking loved it. Proved he could step away from comedy and still nail a performance.Good Morning Vietnam was my favourite though.
You just made me sadder :(
I can just imagine the movie.... The new ash ketchum knock-off has a five minute montage thinking what his life will be like if he chooses the regular starter Pokemon.. Sees himself flying with charizard, blastoise surfing through the water and flying through the jungle like Tarzan off the back of venosaur... Instead the funny professor oak decides to give him a magickarp..... And a few pieces of candy.... That are quite rare.... And have magical properties...
I have been depressed lately, so the other day I went on Netflix looking for a movie to cheer me up. I ended up watching The Birdcage, even though I have seen it several times before. I picked it because I loved Robin Williams and he has never failed to make me laugh. I feel so honestly sad that there was no one and nothing to cheer him when he most needed it. I feel like one of the brightest lights in the universe just winked out and the world just got a little bit darker.
When he burst into Christopher Reeves room shortly after his accident portraying a russian doctor there to perform a colonoscopy...Reeves said it was the first time he laughed and knew things would be alright.
I had a friend that grew up in San Francisco and went to Robin Williams' house on Halloween and he told me Robin always had the best candy bars and made everybody that came to his door laugh. 
It seems to me that the most successful comedians always have an intimate understanding of how life can make jokes out of us.
Aaand that's the thing tonight that pushed me to tears. I feel fairly confident that this is the only presidential statement to say "bangarang"
<hug> to you.
Hug...  Can I have one too?
While this is a huge tragedy, it's important to remember that Williams had been struggling with severe depression for years.  One especially bad day with the ultimate consequence was always a possibility.  It's important to keep that in mind, especially if you have loved ones in a similar position.Don't forget there are great resources higher in the thread.
Good Morning Vietnam
Good will hunting. Amazing performance
Jumanji. ***WHAT YEAR IS IT***
The Birdcage. 
Death to Smoochy
Fern Gully 100%
Mrs. Doubtfire. Hands down.
Dead Poet's Society
World's Greatest Dad
What Dreams May Come, amazing performance with so many angles.
Bicentennial Man
Patch Adams.
What Dreams May Come.
You treat a disease, you win, you lose. You treat a person, I guarantee you, you'll win, no matter what the outcome.
Dead Poet's Society. I'm a teacher. 
He showed me that it's ok to be a goof as an adult. As a kid, seeing a grown man running around making funny voices and great jokes in movies made me realize the adulthood doesn't have to suck.
I'm silently sobbing watching hook with my kids (6, 4 and 2). They've been obsessed with it the last few days. 
RIP Mr. Williams. We'll all be waiting for God to roll a 5 or an 8.
The thing is with Steve Irwin at least I could've expected to see him go in such a way. While tragic it was oddly fitting of him. But, I can't even imagine Robin Williams without a smile on his face much less depression and suicide. His death seems to hit something deeper because of how unexpected and unlike the image we all had of him. 
I don't think anyone could do it convincingly, this made me realize how one of a kind he truly was. 
My uncle saw him jogging in Hawaii--he yelled out, "That's Robin Williams!" Robin Williams heard him, turned around and screamed "Where!!!" Then continued on his run.
An excerpt from President Barack Obama's statement sent from the White House:>"Robin Williams was an airman, a doctor, a genie, a nanny, a president, a professor, a bangarang Peter Pan, and everything in between.  But he was one of a kind. He arrived in our lives as an alien -- but he ended up touching every element of the human spirit.  He made us laugh.  He made us cry.  He gave his immeasurable talent freely and generously to those who needed it most -- from our troops stationed abroad to the marginalized on our own streets."
"Heard a joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says, "Treatment is simple. Great clown Pagliacci is in town tonight. Go and see him. That should pick you up." Man bursts into tears. Says, "But doctor...I am Pagliacci." Alan Moore, Watchmen.
His words finally just broke the floodgates... As someone with a similar depressive disorder it really hurts to imagine that even at his age after starting a family and all his success that he was still hurting underneath it all.
I think Weinger's and Gottfried's comments got to me the most. It's wonderful to see the huge celebrity outreach in this time.
He also struggled with alcoholism. That is actually a quote thrown around in aa meetings quite a bit.
Now that's dark, because in it, he plays a man coming to terms with his wife's suicide. He dies and travels through hell to find her, only to see her cursed to relive all the pain and sorrow and rage that led her to that decision, again and again for all eternity. This hurts to type. 
If I see a picture of him at the funeral I'll burst into tears.
He also paid for treatments Christopher Reeves' family couldn't afford. 
"...will be the cornerstone of my administration. I'm proposing that America get behind a brand new biparitsan comprehensive medical coverage bill that is bangarang as all get out." - from Obama's 1st Inaugural Speech, Jan 20 2008
This one. I was talking to my son just last night about Robin Williams and told him he needed to see this movie. I think we'll watch it tonight.
Damn, he stole my line.    RIP
Guys, I've never seen Good Will Hunting.....
He brought humor to the role, but he preserved the character's dignity and humanity to prevent it from being a complete joke or a characture of a gay man.
This is one of the few movies that makes me laugh out loud any time I watch it.  I might watch this tonight.
You are the pan :(
This was mine too. Even though we couldn't see him, it's amazing how they got the genie to look *just a bit* like him in the face...So god damn sad right now...
This is one of my favorites. It was the first time I saw Robin Williams in a serious role. His character totally creeped me out in this movie.
Miranda: What happened?Mrs. Doubtfire: He was quite fond of the drink. It was the drink that killed him.Miranda: How awful. He was an alcoholic?Mrs. Doubtfire: No, he was hit by a Guinness truck.
It's a driveby fruiting!
I don't work with the males, because I used to be one. 
Oh captain my captain!
I have never seen this movie and I feel like it will have such a different feeling to it now. Too sad.
YES. This movie is SO underrated. And Robin just absolutely kills that role. 
Such an underrated film. I could never understand why the critics hated it so much. 
 You treat a disease, you win, you lose. You treat a person, I guarantee you, you'll win, no matter what the outcome.
That was my favorite quote.  The theme and ideas are so pure in that movie, the delivery is so perfect.
Oh god. His family. :(
I've read this multiple times, which makes me feel both better and worse about myself.
Whoever could do it hasn't been born yet.
I was just trying to explain this to my girlfriend. I use humor all the time to deflect my true feelings.Also dethklock: comedy is pain
How many of you just read this in Barack Obama's voice?
Good joke.
Prepare for tears.
Oh man, I forgot this fact and thanks for reminding me. God dammit Robbie, why did you have to go!?
I've always seen overdosing as a kind of suicide... Plenty of celebrities do that. 
I'm rather surprised this is so far down. I guess it must be a generational thing... 
It's not your fault.
So watch it now, it's on Netflix.
I started the movie thinking it was going to be dumb and over dramatic. In the end I was laughing every two minutes. He just played the role so well.
but that poor boy, who wanted to be an actor... I was crying for days
Our job is improving the quality of life, not just delaying death.
Or discovered.
How could you *not*?
Everybody laughs.
They were roommates at Julliards and they promised each other that if one of them got successful they would take care of the other.  
/u/sucks_at_people probably meant intentional suicides. ODs are often accidental
Don't fuck with me!
From those bust blockers. 
Just checked. They took it off.
I just watched it two nights ago, and he played the perfect "straight" man (har har) to Nathan Lane's over-the-top hilarity. But the true star of that movie is Hank Azaria. He steals the show, which is saying a lot considering who he shared the stage with. 
Or invented
 Roll on snare drum.
And they did. The Williams family took care of Reeves' son after both Christopher and his wife passed away. 
Well, I was going to recommend he pirate it, but that seems wrong on a day like today.
I just want to say, I love you too. I wish I could hug you right now. 
It's not your fault.
Don't fuck with me!
My "stink eye" becomes a real thing and anyone that recieves it will be minorly inconvenienced in some way within the next 5 minutes: drop their keys, almost trip on something, find their shoelaces untied, whatever.Seems like the kind of thing a kind of shitty genie would find amusing.
I'd wish that for the next week, the days are 25 hours long so I can procrastinate just a little bit longer.
To instantly become bilingual, but only in a fictional language,  like Dothraki or the black speech of Mordor. 
My old Ford really needs new tires.  I could get by with two, if he wants to be really shitty about it.
He could clean my house, he could do a kind of shitty job too. 
I get to trade in my car any time I want at no cost to me.  But I can only ever get a 1986 Datsun.
That my fingernails and toenails will stop growing and stay at the appropriate length forever.
I would wish that every time someone around me said they lost something, I would instantly find it but I'd have to keep it for myself. It would be nice because I'd get all this new stuff but shitty because I could never use the new things around anyone since they would probably think I stole it. 
Can I get the ass and back hair to move back up to the top of my head where it used to be?
I can toast bread with my mind, but only a whole loaf at a time. I saw that somewhere once years ago and it still makes me laugh. 
The ability to throw my farts like a ventriloquist.
I'd ask him to make the walk to class 10 minutes shorter, but only when it's raining. Kind of a shitty wish since it'll make me slightly inconvenienced on sunny days, but not enough to actually do anything.
Be able to leave the house without forgetting something, especially that one specific thing you needed for work that you realize you forgot halfway to the office and have to decide to either go without or turn back and end up being late!
Some more cheap beer
You know when you're trying to put a fitted sheet on your mattress, but you can't seem to get one side to stay down and you think to yourself, "Man, if only I had someone here that could hold down one side of this fitted sheet while I'm putting it on my mattress?"I'd ask for a blowjob.
$500, won't make shit of a difference but I'll have $500. 
My wish would be to always have a couple drinks in the house for guests. Wouldn't change my life other than being a slightly better host.
I'd wish to have a clean shit every time.
I want to increase my likelihood of finding spare change on the ground by 500%
I wish for the ability to make an actual rimshot noise just by doing the hand motions, instead of having to say "badoom-tshh".
My wish; if I get drunk with someone who speaks a different first language, then for the duration of said drunkeness, I get the ability to speak that language as well as they can. My English skills also change to match my drinking colleague's.Basically, it would be useless for a job or anything like that, but it would lead to fun.
A burrito.  You know what? Two burritos. One for me and one for the little shit Genie
I'd probably wish to never have to cut my toenails again; I'd probably gain a cumulative hour of my life. 
Could I make my dick half an inch longer?
Every time I toss something at a garbage can from this day forward it goes in. Every fucking time. No look toss? In. Behind the back toss? In. From across the room? You know it's in. 
$1000 in loose change.  Significantly more shitty than $1000 in cash or check form because I'll either have to roll it or pay the Coinstar fee, not enough money to alter the course of my life, but would definitely moderately improve my life in the immediate short term.  I would probably spend most of it on food, or forget to take it to the bank and let it sit around collecting dust.
For the rest of my life, I never pull into a gas station on the wrong side. On my car, I know it's on the right. But sometimes I'm listening to the radio, or thinking about something, or just being fucking old and I pull into the wrong side. And I know on rentals or a buddy's car there's always an arrow on the gauge, but still, sometimes I'm jetlagged or distracted or shit and I pull into the wrong side. I would like the shitty genie to grant me always pulling into the correct side at the petrol stop. 
The ability to shoot queso out of my fingers.
I'd wish I could just click on some interesting looking Facebook articles and they'd load like a regular webpage, instead of taking an effing month to download a bunch of shitty ads and then randomly hang, reload the page and lag. 
I'd ask for my clothes to clean themselves every night, even if I'm sleeping in them.  I'd look like a cartoon character because I'd be wearing the same clothes for the rest of my life.
I'd ask that every time I take a shit at work the larger stall is available so I can live like a king for 15 minutes out of the day. 
I wanna know why the ice maker in my freezer keeps fucking up. Shitty Genie doesn't have to fix it necessarily, but I wish for him to tell me what the fuck is wrong with it.
If I have enough cash to pay for something then I will always have the exact combination of notes and coins to pay for it without having to deal with change
A slightly worse genie and so on until I get the worst genie you could get
Everytime I sneeze, a random person in a 1 mile radius of me shits their pants.
I'll wish that he curse those people who pissed me off that whenever they push or press a button, 75% of the time it wouldn't work.
I'd wish the farmer behind our house would fix the flooding problem. The whole field drains onto our property. The head of the drainage board in our county is best friends with the farmer so nothing will get done so the back part of our property is useless. 
Another shitty genie. Let's see if we can't get a party going.
I'd probably just ask for a brand new backyard fence so I don't have to worry about my dogs getting out all the time.By the way This is a really good question that should've been asked in peak hours because it probably won't get any traction now.
10 king size milky way bars. Though if it has to be shitty then I'll take them partially melted.
To always know which are the decoy snails
If I complete the hardest or most time consuming assignment, all my other assignments are automatically completed.
An endless supply of beer, but it's only Budwieser
Not have to cleanup after a wank. Can be a real downer
Not being able to stink.
a free meal at Denny's whenever i want
Could I get a magic carpet with a top speed of 10 mph
Give me a million reddit karma. The points mean nothing. 
Tan skin during the winter 
I would wish that every time someone sneezed it would be too loud and stuff would come out. 
About $8 for a Spicy Deluxe and fries at Chick fil a would be enough to keep me happy for a few hours...
I wish for my cell phone to always be at 60% battery life. 
I'd like to not go to a stupid meeting I have to go to tomorrow.
In each of Trump's tweets going forward, one random word is replaced by profanity
The ability to make other people piss themselves. Wouldn't make my life any better except that I can make people piss themselves for my own enjoyment 
To lose 10 lbs 
You've just described a Toyota Camry.
What if this is true, but you've never noticed? 
> My "stink eye" becomes a real thinga bad genie would probably turn that wish into you getting horrible body odor.
Oh man I'd kill for an extra hour of ~~sleep~~ watching old tv show reruns and playing with my phone.
Those extra hours happen when it's most inconvenient, like if you're stuck in traffic or have work to do.
DOVAHKIIN, DOVAHKIIN, NAAL OK ZIN LOS VAHRIIN!
It's not even one of the Tolkien languages people have heard of, so you get a useless L2 and a bunch of Tolkien nerds stalking you because you're the world expert on Avarin.
He'd clean the entire house thoroughly, then take all of the trash, dust, and misplaced items he's collected and toss them all into one important room. It would probably be most effective in a bathroom or bedroom. The genie could also "clean" the house of some things that would bother you if they went missing- batteries, some lightbulbs, a remote, maybe a door.
I see a loophole here. Buy one of those two dollar toy cars, classify it as 'your car', trade that in for a 1986 Datsun, sell the 1986 Datsun, repeat, profit.
Easy get a 240z? Call it a day. 
what if you accidently rip off one of your nails? you're fucked dude. 
"Oh no, I can't find Spot!"*Arf arf arf*"Aw fuck..."
And you would never be able to have friends over or you would look like a total klepto.
You'll end up with 70 TV remotes, 25 car keys, ass tons of socks and maybe a wallet or two.You might even find a virginity
I can kind of feel the emotion in this one.
Yes, but it still has the texture of ass and back hair.
This reminds me of the "shitty super powers" game I used to play with my friends whenever we went to to all-night diner after a closing shift. My favorite one was telekinesis, but only within the context of making soup.Other winners included:- creating sexual tension- always knowing how old a person is- being able to turn on lights with your mind, but not off again 
Imagine going into stores with this power and toasting every loaf of bread so when people open the package they're all "????? toast??"E: thank you for the gold, kind redditor!
Would it also throw the smell? If so, I choose this one too.
Is better dirt expensive? 
I did this today... I work in a oil refinery and they WILL NOT lemme in without my badge... And I forgot it... Had to drive 45 minutes home to get it and then 45 back... Lost $50.... :(
Shitty part: it's always warm and mostly flat
The ol' bait n' switch
Sound like an intro to a prono
Granted, but you'll get $500 worth of shit. 
$500 is a life changing amount of money for me right now. 
Fuck, I would use a real wish for that.
Take powdered Metamucil every day. Use to only think it was something old ppl drank until my buddy got me on it. Takes 2-3 days to kick in. Have had only no wipers (wipe once of course for confirmation) for about 2 years now. Best LPT I have ever learned to date. Orange flavor is excellent.
"I'm sorry, but this is beyond the power of the genie of Old Milwaukee."
I wish that, even if it were just for a day, my dog could converse with me as a normal intelligent human.Not only would I explain what you did, but also what thunder was and that it wasn't going to hurt him. Then I'd try to get a system of nonverbal communication worked out for various situations, as well as ask him what he dreamed about and what his favorite dog food was.
But it's only ever pennies...
I used to fantasise about having the power to know where every bit of dropped currency was in whatever city I was currently in. I would then realise I'd rather just have the power to give myself lots of money without having to walk around for it.
You should specify what type of rimshot.
Could substantially change your life, though.  You could use it to get laid a shitton, especially in tourist heavy areas.  You would speak the first language of every foreign girl in the bar.That would be life-altering.  In more ways than one.
this is my favorite so far
This is /r/writingprompts level. 
This is perfect.
You can get toilet hardware by itself for like $2
Why do you clip like you're running out of time?
So... double its size? 
Yes, too bad this isnt real and you still have a small dick
What if you're in a room with the door closed and it's outside the room?
You can turn this into a super power. Place garbage cans near an area a villain (Dr. Always Leaves Piss On The Toilet Rim or something like that) is going to be at and throw a bomb from long range and you're basically human artillery. 
Dump it into the self-checkout at your grocery store, or wherever. It'll take a few months to burn through that much change, but it's free, and using the self-checkout avoids the burning judgement of a minimum wage cashier.
Bring the jar to your bank and they can count and exchange it without a fee. 
There's not always an arrow, sometimes it's just an icon on the dial.AND ON MY PARENTS' 05 SUBURBAN, IT'S ON THE WRONG DAMN SIDE.That is all.
Dude that's not shitty at all, I would invite you to every shitty party I ever threw.
They said shitty genie, not download adblock.
I had a professor in college who only owned black slacks, brown dress shoes and white button-up shirts (the kind that are formal, but don't have an actual collar, so no ties ever). He owned a lot of each (showed us a picture of his closet), but it was all the same outfit. Great, smart guy but you're right, he was SUPER cartoonish. 
"This is the last one""Id like a sandwich""Here's a fucking bullet to the head""Thanks"
Definitely shitty when you're on a long drive by yourself
It will be amazing when that person is nearby.
That would harm me so badly. I'm obsessed with the old arcade game Snake. 
Do brakes count as a button?I feel like there's a fairly good chance this wish will kill everyone who pissed you off.
As someone with. Ridiculously heavy flow, you do not want this. I promise.
It's okay we'll just steal this question, reword it slightly, and ask it tomorrow while we have nothing better to do at work. 
What's peak time on reddit? Lol
The shitty part is that the genie is the one doing the other assignments. He dropped out of high school and doesn't particularly care, so the grade you get on them hovers just barely above failing.
> but it's only BudwieserOP only said *kind of* shitty.
Nah, the real wish here is to have chik fil a open on Sundays
would people be able to tell the difference?
You could easily test by doing it in a mirror and seeing if anything bad happens to you
That... that isn't sleep, buddy.
That sounds fucking fantastic. I bet the sex was angry as hell. 
Was that the couple who tried to raise a kid with Klingon as his first language?
> DOVAHKIIN, DOVAHKIIN, NAAL OK ZIN LOS VAHRIINGoogle Translate thinks this is Arabic.  Translation:He pushed you, pushed you, he got your ax
> sell the 1986 DatsunTwo dollars!  Yessss!
That seems like exactly the sort of wish a shitty genie would be happy to grant. Sure you could be rich, but only in a assortment of 1986 Datsuns and you must progessively go forth to travel the states until none of the dealerships have them anymore, or they're worth less then the 1$ hotwheel car. 
Who the fuck spilled spot remover on the dog again?
WHO THE FUCK SAID THEY LOST THEIR 3 FOOT DILDO?! WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE?!?!
Well, if op doesn't have theirs anymore, I feel like this could cause almost infinite virgininess.
Yeah, he misses the smell of ass hair on his head.
Does it have the shit bits in it still?
I like "able to breathe underwater but only in soup", "able to be invisible but only if no one could see you or record you anyways", and "able to teethshift - mildly change the shape and color of your teeth within normal human parameters".
I imagine it like a magician, like Gob from Arrested Development.."Ma'am, open that bag of bread.""It's toasted.""ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?"
I'd throw it into people's mouths
It's as cheap as dirt. 
My work is strictly about passes but they always keep a couple of temp ones spare if you forget...And you're nice to the receptionists.
Ok? It's easier to chug that way 
$50 bucks right now would make life so much more comfortable. Just enough to eliminate a few small worries.
Get a bidet. You won't care if it's a clean shit or not.
An Amazon review of Metamucil: 'It's difficult to fully convey how much I love this product. No single household item has so drastically impacted my life. It's like thinking that the whole world is black and white, and then someone flicks the colour switch in your brain and you see rainbows and Haribo for the first time.That's how I feel about my new found bowel movements. This is stuff if legit, yo.'
Holy shit really? This might change my life...
Came here to also tout the wonders of fiber.  It doesn't just help with shits, but also to regulate blood sugar.  Afternoon crashes are a thing of the past for me.
Stuff gives me hot peanut butter shits. Takes half a roll just to get enough of it out of my ass hair where I can roll into the shower to finish the job without having to waffle stomp turdtangled toilet paper down the drain too. 
still, adds up and is better than a kick in the teeth
[ ](/fl_excited)I call dibs on the other kind of rimshot. I've always wanted to be able to fart on command. 
Found the percussionist
Pray the clay away really did it for me.
You are perfect.
Like I said, not worth the effort. It's the mildest inconvenience in my life
Clip day and night like you're running out of time/Every day you clip like you're running out of timeKeep on fighting in the meantime. 
well, average size but yeah
Ruined it with the edit tbh
You overestimate my throwing capabilities.
Having been a "minimum wage cashier," gotta say, we're not the ones burning with judgement.
Most banks aren't accepting loose change any more, only rolled.  They exist, but finding one would be an adventure.
The side the little nozzle of the tiny gas pump icon is on is *not* an indicator of which side it's on, some just don't have it
That's the shitty part.
And when you have a quick sneezing fit in the car on a back country road, that would lead to true discomfort.
Yeah but occasionally that person is going to be you. 
^started my period last night with PCOS. Sleep with tampon+pad, still have to get up every 2-3 hours to change both unless I want to change my sheets too. 
And if it gets really successful, we'll do it again next week. And the next week. And the next week. 
Looks like it's getting some traction to me.
When the Americans are all awake. 
OK fine Bud Light Lime it is then.
Make America fuck again
Holy shit! I did it and then I dropped the toilet paper roll in the toilet!**I HAVE THE POWER!**
So, like German sex, but less efficient.
The dad only spoke Klingon to the kid, the mom spoke English, kid started rejecting dad at about 7, and by 14ish could not speak or really hear Klingon
You could fix a inconvenient loose toilet seat with the profits!
Still, getting and selling 1 a week for $10,000 (that's how much decent ones are selling for on ebay) would still be $480,000 a year if you took 4 weeks holiday off. Granted the amount of money you could make would go down as time went on, but even if you worked for 10 years you could retire comfortably. Even if we assume the toy car trick didn't work and you had to buy a real, shitty, car for <$500 a week, that's still a lot of money.That doesn't seem like a shitty wish. It'd be life changing if used properly, so I doubt it'd be allowed.
A dildo with three feet? I likey.
Yeah but think off all the great olive oil OP could make
Only if you don't want it to
Me and a friend made up a superhero with the ability to turn street lamps orange, but with the weakness that if caught in the spotlight created by the lamp he would immediately lose the ability to use his legs.We called him Amberlamps.We were also very baked.
This one could actually be useful. Shoot/graze yourself twice in relatively painless or quick-healing areas, and then you've got one-time stray bullet protection forever. 
Yeah but the fertilizer is expensive as shit
God invented funnels for a reason
Shit, mate, I'd take 10 bucks now and be happy I don't have to starve myself for another few days.
Bidet? Don't mind if I bidoo.
>you see rainbows and Haribo for the first time.  That's how I feel about my new found bowel movements.If those are sugar-free Haribo, he'll be feeling those new-found bowel movements all right.
What's your daily intake of fiber?
Unless you're always down on your hands and knees picking up loose change, and end up getting kicked in the teeth anyway.
You probably use them just as often, it's an easy mixup. (this is probably funnier if you're Canadian, sorry)
You shall be called Sir douchebag, the dragon born.
$2 for a years worth of inconvenience?! Even if that isn't your property it's still your throne. Just poo it!
How do you measure? I start at the tip and stop until I reach a number that I'm comfortable with.
What did it say? 
Blessing in disguise; If you're ever suspicious of someone watching you, just throw something at the nearest bin and see if it lands or not.
Can confirm, the people behind you in line are probably much more annoyed by it.Looking at you, old lady who still uses checks, didn't even bother to write out part of the check ahead of time, and writes as slowly as is humanly fucking possible.
My credit union has a mechanical change sorter. It gives you a receipt to take to the teller, and that much gets deposited into your account. No fee if you're a member!
Given /u/AlienVoice lives somewhere like London with a population density of 1510 per square kilometre then there is roughly a 1 in 12,140 chance of it being them. I think that's pretty decent odds.However if you're out camping or something then you're in for a shitty time.
Still better than spending the night crying in a ball of pain on the bathroom floor waiting to puke again. (Me, age 13-23, until I went on birth control.) I would literally rather die than go back to that.
Anyway, what was the scandal at your high school?
Doesn't look like anything to me
Fuck America great again.
Yes, and probably bloodier. Lots more fighting and power struggle. 
If someone's selling one on the market every week, it'll drop below 10k pretty quick.
It adds character
Every third bullet fired in the world then. You could get extremely lucky and have every one ever fired at you be useless, have it never work at all in a meaningful way, or somewhere in between 
Double dang!
Hallowed be thy funnel
If you have a paypal or something I'll send you 10$ right now. I'm pretty broke but I'm not "10$ will keep me from starving" broke.
I don't know why this is making me laugh so much.
Sugar free haribo and metamucil would have an epic battle over bowel movement consistency, in you.
A year in which I sit on the loo twice a week at most. I think you're vastly overestimating the size of this inconvenience, I literally picked the smallest flaw in my apartment. That loo seat will still outlive most of our society
Tip to asshole
Hook the measuring tape on your asshole.
Long ago when I worked at a grocery store, I asked a customer why she chose to use checks. She proceeded to fucking complain to management about me after I finished with her.Excuse me for trying to understand the benefits of using checks.
PREACH. I started using the Nuvaring to skip shark week because I had been given heavy narcotics that didn't put a dent in my cramps. Shark week free for nearly seven years. People always say something like "that isn't healthy, you shouldn't do that, blah blah blah," but even if it takes years off my life, I have a QUALITY of life that I wouldn't trade for the world (in terms of lady business, anyway - still a mental health clusterfuck who may have narcolepsy, but at least I'm not crippled for seven days each month). 
Make fuck great again.
With surplus rum, I will be drunk, on turps as I am on bourbon.
Thanks for the offer, but I wouldn't accept it even if you did.My mess to get through.
It reminds me of this joke: What's the difference between Dubai and Abu Dhabi? People in Dubai don't like the Flintstones, but people in Abu Dhabi doooooo  
**EDIT6:** HERE'S A FUCKING MUTANT SWORDFIGHTING A ROBOT. ^^^^/s
You can make a payment with no money I your account. Checks take 3 days to clear a bank. They can even bounce and then you didn't pay at all but you still have the food and now you're 3 days away.
Make America great fuck
Yeah, that's what I mean! Like an exoskeleton made from fingernails. That's fucking disgusting. 
Give us this day our daily Mead and forgive us all tresspasses as we did not see that this was not our own home...
I respect that.
As someone who is living in Abu Dhabi at the moment, this is my go to joke. love it! thanks for making me laugh.
Teethless they bite, lipless they smile. Eyeless they watch.The trash misses again. Again and again. You think you sense a slight chortle and whip your head around. Eyes searching furiously into the void.
it doesn't always work like this anymore. a lot of places process your checks electronically right then and there like a debit card transaction. 
After that, what is your (not actually) controversial opinion that we all share?
Great America, make fuck?
Just gild him $10 worth. Then he'll still have had someone waste $10 on him, and he doesn't get to use the money. 
Shia Lebeouf
Can confirm. If they run your check through the little machine at the register it was just turned into an electronic transaction like a debit card.  Even if they don't do it right there in front of you it is pretty rare any more to have a few days before your account is debited.
Not my story, but my brothers.He lost his wallet and was retracing his steps looking for it. A homeless man approached him at a coffee shop and said to him "Don't worry. It's in the bathroom sink. Your wallet is in your bathroom sink"Later that night he did indeed find his wallet at home in the bathroom sink. A few days later, he saw the same homeless man and thanked him for his help. The guy became really irritated and told my brother he had never seen him before.Could have been a lucky guess, but I think Magical Bum makes for a better story. 
I've had glasses since the third grade. I was playing tackle football with friends after school (I wasn't wearing glasses), tackled one of my friends, really big collision, for a second I regained full eyesight...then I blinked and it was gone again.
When I was about 10 years old I saw my old dog catch a crow out of the air then just gently release it. 
My dad swears he once saw two cats, a raccoon and a skunk all meet up in the middle of the street at night. 
When I was about 10 they started putting missing children on milk cartons. Every morning for a while I was looking at this boy's face on the side of the milk while I would eat my cereal. Then one day a car went down my street while I was playing outside, and there was a boy in the back seat with his face up close to the window looking out. I'm 99% sure it was the boy from the milk carton. I told my parents but they didn't believe me.
Went and got the mail from the previous day at like 7 am. No one was around, but this massive black dog was walking around my neighbors Ford Windstar. By massive, the dog's head went to the windows and when his head was at the back bumper, his hind legs were still at the driver's door.
I was at the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago.  I walked up to the cuttlefish tank, and for some reason all 20 or so of the cuttlefish rushed over to me.  It was a big tank, maybe 10 feet long.  I walked the length of it, and they followed me.  I walked back, and they followed.  A few other people saw and tried it themselves.But alas, the cuttlefish only had eyes for me.My best guess as to the cause was that the guy who feeds them is my doppelganger.  
A chameleon escaped from a bag when my friend was giving it to me and it leapt into a big pile of snow. I looked around for it for a while but couldn't find it so I gave up. Several weeks later the snow all melted and I was out there and found the lizard partially frozen to the ground. I peeled him off and put it in one of those little plastic tanks and sat it by the radiator in my house. Within an hour or two the lizard was hopping around the cage like nothing ever happened. It lived for several years after that, and was known to my friend and I as Jesus the resurrection lizard. 
One day I was looking out the window of my office and four semi trucks drove past one after each other.  They were in order Costco, Cosco, Cisco, Sysco.  Half the people I mention it to don't care and the other half don't believe me.
I was snorkeling in Hawaii once, and I swear I saw something that looked like a clear chameleon, but as soon as I got close it buried itself in the sand. I still vividly remember discovering a new species. 
When I was around 10 years old I went down to a lake when I was on holiday. When I get down there I vividly remember a massive ball of lightning just hovering and then it struck the middle of the lake. I never ran so fast in my life back to the litte house we were staying in. 
As a child I touched some weird pest plant in our garden, I think it stung me. Then I saw everything in inverted colors for short time. And then back to normal. I was in such a shock, I couldn't explain it to my mom. I just went to her crying. 
I once saw a man in an Abraham Lincoln costume complete with top hat running for what seemed like his life along the street. I slowed down and when he turned to look at me he was missing an eye. I drove off and of course no one believes me.
My bathroom had a towel holder thing, which was a fastened bar parallel to the wall. It had started coming out of one of the holders and one day I accidentally pulled too hard on it. It came flying off and landed in a clatter, but I couldn't find it.Mind you, this was a small bathroom, maybe fifteen feet by six feet in area and the counter and cabinets are seamlessly fastened to the wall. I checked in the bath, behind the toilet, under the towers -- nowhere.To this day, I have no idea what the fuck happened to it.
I slipped on icy stairs last winter and swear I saw my own butt crack as I fell. No one believes me.
When I was at my family's cabin when I was like, 10, and It was the middle of the night, but me and some of my friends were just dicking around outside. Then, I swear we saw a blue flame on the water. Not just a light, it was actually fire.
My friend and I were watching basketball in the early days that Charles Barkley was a panelist. He was apologizing for calling a team "midgets" and saying that he now knew it was offensive. But as they were going to commercial, we both heard him say over a hot mic "Besides, they shouldn't hate me, they should hate God."My friend and I were amazed, and convinced he would be fired. But not only did we never hear about it again, the clip doesn't even exist online anywhere. It's as though we had a double delusion. 
A fat squirrel in a tree threw a piece of fried chicken at me. 
A monkey jumping from car to car on a busy street. I could probably draw a sketch of it even though this happened about 5 years ago. Definitely one of the most odd things I saw. Unfortunately everyone thinks I am telling a bad joke when I explain what I saw, or they just nod it off and continue not giving a fuck.
One time when I was really young, maybe like 10 years old, I came home after school and was making myself a salami sandwich.  I pulled the bag of salami out and took out two slices. I smacked the two slices together, and suddenly they became one. I tried my hardest to separate them, but there was no seam or anything that I could split them up with. I even showed it to my mom but not a single person believed me when I told them. I had fused two pieces of salami together.
I'm in line at a cafeteria.  The guy in front of me is holding a pudding cup.  Someone walking by stumbles and falls into pudding cup guy, knocking his pudding cup out of his hand.  While everyone is looking at stumbling guy, the pudding cup goes a good two feet straight up in the air.  Pudding cup guy is totally focused and at the last second turns and catches the pudding cup behind his back.  He looks at me, smiles and that was that.  No one else saw it.
When I was about twelve, I was riding in the backseat of the family car. I looked over and the car next to me had three people sitting in the front (this was in the 1980s) and it was a man, woman and man. In that order. At the stop light, the woman leaned down and the two men leaned in and started making out.This was the first time I had seen anything like this. I was so dumbfounded, I couldn't even tell my family.
I saw a bunch of crows, around 20+, gather around in a circle. I was like wtf and took a closer look to see 3 other crows in the middle of the circle, all on their backs. And some crows from the circle would hop in and try to peck at the 3 crows, while they cawed and tried to defend themselves with their feet. I know crows are smart and all but didn't expect this level of social behavior. It went on for a while before a kid ran in and scattered them all. 
While I was playing poker with a few friends, I was dealing and somehow managed to deal a royal flush on the board, giving every person a royal flush. This was well into our game and the cards were definitely well shuffled, and don't forget I'd also placed the burn cards down. The odds of this are so astronomical that, apart from the friends I was playing with, no one would believe it happened and would assume I'm just a liar. 
Years ago, when my mom was pregnant with me she saw a monkey in the tree outside her house. She went to tell everyone but no one believed her, "Sure, pregnant lady."But sure enough the news that night had a story about Zoo break out.
I was at the airport and saw a businessman with a carry on wheely bag get off the escalator.  He turned the corner, broke into a sprint carrying the bag by it's small strap handle on top.  He swung the bag forward and let go of the strap handle. While it was in mid-air he grabbed the currently unextended extending handle, pressed the button and on the back swing extended the handle and landed it on its wheels and continued sprinting, all without breaking stride.
I saw Tom Jones in a back street in Santiago, Chile, going in the back door if a club.
When I was 5 I liked to mix various liquids... playing chemistry, I guess.  My grandma let me play with all her bathroom stuff.  I mixed her shampoos and creams and cleaning products, etc.  (I just realize now this might have been dangerous if I had mixed ammonia and bleach, for example). I swear I created a white liquid that produced a single black bubble that would come to the surface and pop at a regular interval.  No one believes me, or maybe no one cares.  I guess it's not that cool. 
A cat impaling a roasted chicken on a fence and eating it while on said fence!
I saw my neighbor walking down the road in a red party dress around 3am.  I wasn't fucked up or on anything.  He denies it and the rest of the neighborhood thinks I'm making it up.  I saw you Tim.  You and I both know.
I was at my mom's side when she passed away.  I swear, seconds before she departed, I heard her and my grandmother (who had died in the 80s) behind me.  Mom said "I really look awful," and Grandma said "It's time to go."  I turned around but the sun was coming in through the window so a little bright.  It was at that very moment that mom passed away.
I don't believe in Alien invaders. I'm sure there's life on other planets, seems ridiculous that we'd be completely alone, but I'd imagine you couldn't keep a visit from interplanetary species a secret.That said, I swear to god I saw a tall thin, long armed, long legged thing walk from one wheat field across the road, in front of my car and over into the other. I thought my eyes were just playing tricks on me so I didn't say anything for a second but the. My friend in the seat next to me said '...wait... did you see something just now?.'No idea what it was but I saw.... something.
A man dressed as a confederate soldier walking down my street as I was heading home from work. There was a school bus coming and he stopped on the other side of the road, as if to let the bus pass before crossing, and I stopped at the stop sign. We looked at each other, the bus passed, and then he was gone. 
I saw Jon Voight outside the Baskin Robbins in colonial Williamsburg in 2010 or 2011... I swear it was him, I said it to my friend who was next to me and she didn't know who he was (we were students at William and Mary at the time). He must have overheard cause he come over and stood near me and said nothing waiting for me to ask if it was him... but I chickened out. JON VOIGHT, if you see this, WAS IT YOU?!
Once when I was a teenager I was watching a movie by myself. The tv room then had two chairs separated by a couch. I was on the chair to the right, and at one point I laughed really hard at the movie. I heard someone else laugh and saw what seemed to be a girl my age double over in laughter in the other chair. The weird thing is it didn't startle me; it just felt nice to share laughter. Then I realized that I was alone in the whole house and the chair was empty. So I turned off the tv and went outside lol. 
A giant. This guys feet were as long as a pillow, and his hands made a newspaper look small. My friends think I exaggerated how large he was. I don't. 
I was watching a football game a couple of years ago, and in one of the shots where they panned over the crowd I saw a girl look straight at the camera and mouth my name. Scared the shit out of me, but when I rewinded it the seat was actually fucking empty. Maybe I just need to find someone to fill that seat.
I lived in an income based apartment complex and I watched a kid take a shit behind a tree next to his apartment building and then step in it. 
I was riding in the back seat of a friend's car one night. I looked over to the side of the road and saw a dog. It's body looked something like an English bulldog. As we got closer, I could see that it had a human face. That freaked me out a little bit. 
One night I was sleeping at my grandparents place. I woke up around 3am needing to pee. I raised my head slightly and looked at the base of the mattress I was lying on and saw a gown just floating there near the wall at the height it would be if a person was wearing it. I froze for a couple of seconds before quickly rushing to get my phone to shine the light on it. By the time I did there was nothing there. Safe to say I was scared out of my mind when I finally worked up the courage to get up to pee. 
Growing up, we had a door in the lounge with that glass in that distorts whatever is behind it. This looked into the hallway where the stairs were. My family and cat were in the lounge, leaving the rest of the house empty, but we all saw someone walk down the stairs, but no noise. (We had no carpet on the stairs, just wooden steps and they were creaky as hell). So weird. 
When my Grandfather died (god bless his soul) my 12 year old self was quite upset.  I asked my dad for two dimes, I know it's odd. I put one in his breast coat pocket and held one myself. Years later my whole family has been finding dimes everywhere in random spots. They attributed this to "Grandpa looking over us" kind of turned into a thing. On that token, my dad forgot about the double dime I requested at gramps funeral, I brought up what happened at family dinner recently and they think I made it up. I hope they have reddit. 
My girlfriend insists she saw five deer sized rabbits running in formation on a weekly basis. The truth is out there 
Snoop Dogg on Chatroulette. It was only for a second but I'm convinced it was him.
I remember hearing that dying animals sometimes go to places they never normally went before before they died.
They call the Magical Bum homeless. What they don't know? The world is his home.
He probably realized what it was and didn't want to get taken to crow court.
Your dog was probably thinking "hmm... I didn't think I'd get this far"
Something similar happened to me. I was 5-6 and was playing outside with other kids. All of a sudden, those two cars stop by a sidewalk, they grab a girl on a tricycle and speed off. Only her bike was left. We ran to my mom to tell her someone got kidnapped. She was cooking, somewhat listened, nodded her head, smiled, "Oh, really?" and that was it. I think about it often. 
could have been the colour of your shirt as well.i work at an aquarium, and as someone who wears the uniform, animals get thrilled at the sight of me often, just because of my shirt colour.
Ball lightning lasts that long? I always assumed it just kinda came down from the sky and burst. 
Are you sure it was a chameleon? They don't really hop/jump. And they don't have sticky hands so it wouldn't have been able to climb around in a plastic tank 
And behind them was Sisqo's tour bus.
You need to name it, man
I saw the same thing! I told my dad and he looked at me like I was crazy :(
Our house was struck by lightening one night and my mom says she saw a hovering ball of lightning. Apparently it's something that can happen.
Ball lightning
You probably touched a Brugmansia. They are loaded with scopolamine and can cause you to see things that are not there. Inverse colors are a common hallucination from them. Brugmansia are a very common garden flower, despite their effects, because only small children will be effected by contact alone. Did you have big orange flowers that hang downwards in your garden?
You should have caught him. They evolve into Radicate when they level up.
My dad used to work in construction and built a lot of stuff around our house. He used this thing to mark long lines, it was like a tape measure made of string, covered in blue chalk. Bright, royal blue chalk. Maybe the mouse got into something like that? (Might have been why it was hauling ass too, it fell into that and got trapped or stuck, yall moved a board and it ran?)
Wait what do you mean exactly? Like you fell in such a way that your pants slipped down and your back twisted over? Or you like, saw a vision of your buttcrack appear before you?
Best post in this entire thread. I believe you. 
Could have been a Will-O'-Wisp especially if it was over a lake. The theory is certain gases like methane and phosphine are either ignited by lightning or chemically react and release light creating what looks like a floating light.
Kangaroo's do have a tendency to escape from travelling circuses. That's the only real explanation I can gather
I was walking to class and passed by a trashcan with a domed lid. On top was a bottom piece of a bun. As was walking by it, a squirrel came out of the trash can and put a Chick-fil-A chicken on top of the bun, then went back inside the trashcan. I assume it was to get the top bun. I really wish I took a photo of it.Another instance was a squirrel with a cigarette butt in its mouth.
My mom used to see her dead sister standing at the end of her bed watching her for years after she killed herself. It was always peaceful and tranquil, she says. She liked seeing her. But then one night it just didn't feel right. My mom got scared and shouted for her to go away. She never came back after that. 
You probably just smacked them together so hard one went flying and you didn't realize. I bet it's still stuck to the back of your head or something. 
How did they rule it as a drowning if they didn't find a body? 
We (people in southern Appalachia) call that a Crow Court. I've seen it happen too, just with one in the middle. While it definitely does happen, apparently no-one knows why. We all know that corvids are crazy smart, so I think the idea of a Crow Court isn't far off. Maybe the crows in the middle did something to endanger the Murder, or they're sick or something. Either way it really is surreal
I read this as cows at first and was seriously impressed.
crow fight club?1st rule of crow fight club = caw caw motherfucker
So you're saying you witnessed a murder of crows?
That is neat. I can't come close, but, in around 2001 I was playing online poker (hold 'em) on dialup. I'd been dealt AK suited, played it moderate cool, then the flop came up giving me an instant royal flush. Immediately my connection dropped, and by the time I got back online I'd been timed out and we were on the next hand. It took all I could muster to not put my monitor through.That was the end of online poker for me, but over the last sixteen years of casual kitchen table games I've never seen it since.
You obvious that you did not see any old businessman, but THE businessman from which all other businessmen are born.
I feel so sorry for you, my brother and sister taunted me for 'imagining' a baby raccoon when it was probably just a grey squirrel climbing down the tree right in front of our house. I called them back and smugly watched as another baby raccoon came, and another, and then 6 baby raccoons were snuffling around in our backyard with their huge fat parent staring at us for a bit and then they walked away after like 10 minutes.
Perhaps someone's pet escaped?
Going by the way it was moving I'd say experimental air craft or teenage aliens doing their version of donuts around the locals.
It's not unusual.
Investigate this! Surely theres a science subreddit who can explain? 
That's fucking Metal. 
Yeah, sorry about that, I was pretty hammered so I had to take breaks every few minutes of flying. Thanks for not running over me or something.
What the fuck Steve? You said you wouldn't tell...
Chills so hard wow
Well according to wikipedia one of the only two places they were naturally reintroduced was Zion national park, so I believe you. 
Some skinny, tall farmers feelings are hurt by this. *I'm not an alien guys!*
Slenderman?
All the atoms lined up perfectly and fell into the floor
Is your ashtray by any chance actually a guitar pick?
Did you recheck the top of your cupboard? I bet it's there and maybe you dreamed or hallucinated dropping it. It's worth a shot.
Just a heads up... if no one in your house smokes, putting an ashtray full of ash in your kitchen is the worst idea ever.  the non smokers 100% smell that.  Hate to break it to you, but you smoking is no secret in that house.
Are you in North Kansas city? Theres a guy in my girlfriends neighborhood that dresses up in a civil war uniform 3 or so times a week and walks his dogs. We finally saw him walk past her house the other day. Very strange, we even Googled to see if there were any reenactments near by but found nothing. He's a doctor of some sort so I suppose he just has a passion or heavy interest in that sort of thing and has the money to make or buy those uniforms.
So what does a Sprite look like?
Omg please get a picture of this squirrel!
What's the CIA blue space program?
My husband and I each saw strange aircraft while living in New Mexico (though we were both alone each time and the things we saw were not similar).What I saw was silver-ish, very narrow and hovered a hundred feet above ground; what he saw was bit higher, moved at high speeds and insanely sharp angles.Neither of us have seen anything like it before or since, have since moved away and the topic doesn't come up much. But once you mention "New Mexico", everyone thinks it's a joke anyway.
That could've been the start to a real touching Rom-com or maybe even a drama, but you fucked it up.  
That was you from a different universe. Only the alternate you sat to the left. 
There's nothing like the laughter of a child.At 3 am.When you don't have kids.
That went to fucking terrifying to fucking beautiful real quick lol
Sounds like ball lightning
> about 9/10Damn you must be very good looking.
I've had similar experiences of this too, only with smells. My gran used to wear this cheap perfume that can only be described as old lady perfume. She was the only person I knew who wore it.                   I have moved house a lot since her passing, but every time we get moved in and semi-settled the smell of that perfume comes drifting through the house, my partner also smells it but he never knew my gran. I like to think she's just checking the place out and tutting to herself.
Here in Japan there is an urban legend about human-faced dogs called "Jinmenken". They are said to appear running along highways at night and have the ability to talk.
This one I can imagine is legit. Just not real. I used to get very real hallucinations right as I was waking up. 99.9% of the time it was seeing a spider or spiders climb up a wall or across the ceiling. Like, huge spiders. Sometimes bigger than could ever exist in nature. I used to go literally flying out of the bed, scared outta my mind (huge arachnophobe). But then one day I stared at one, too afraid to move, and it slowly faded away as it crawled. Still happens once in a while now- I just ignore it until it goes away. Anyway, it seems very similar to what you described.
My cat went to our neighbour's flowerbed. He was a roamer, so I can imagine that he'd been there before, but I remember him hiding under our rhubarb plant and meowing sadly a few hours before that. Poor baby.
I will defend any dog in crow court, I'm very educated in _bird law_
I once wore a maroon shirt to a zoo whose uniforms were maroon. I attracted the animals everywhere I went. This is probably the right answer.
I just googled it and you're right, not a chameleon. I think it was an Anole. 
I think humans reserved that name a while back. 
In Hawaii? 
Yeah, its called ball lightning. It can pass through windows, and is SCARY SHIT.
Brugmansia are terrifying! Not two days ago I read a "trip report" about some dude who took Brugmansia tea he made out of TWO LEAVES *AND* TWO FLOWERS (one leaf per 32oz+ of water is MORE than enough), and the guy ended up crashing knee-first through a plate glass window and then ripped the back door to his house off its hinges with his own two hands. Shit is terrifying.
And it was a Shiny, too! What a missed opportunity.
That's a chalk line. Sounds better than someone catching him and spray painting him which is what I first thought. 
Sounds like a skinwalker. People see them here in northern AZ. Never seen one but I think one came by my grandmas house one night when were spending the summer with her. Dogs went crazy outside and then all of a sudden went quiet. Then the smell of rotting flesh came in through the open windows. Me and my older brother were playing video games and were the only ones awake. Just remember my brother jump up, turn off all the lights, TV and GameCube and drag me to the bed and told me to be quiet and not move. Like he knew what was happening. Scariest experience of my life. 
His buttcrack flashed before his eyes.
I have just spent twenty minutes trying to understand what way he flexed in order to see his buttcrack, by twisting up a teddy bear. 
I have a cousin who lives in Kentucky that has a petting zoo.  She has a kangaroo, an alpaca, a camel, and various other animals you'd not normally see in Kentucky.  She's brought the kangaroo with her to family reunions a couple of times.
I think this is still possible occasionally? I remember last year when WWE broadcast from the UK someone picked up the raw feed and streamed it live online and you could sometimes hear the commentators during commercial breaks. It's fun to watch. 
The real question here is who threw away a whole Chik-fil-A sandwich?
Join the club. We've had a cougar in our backyard on several occasions and it has been seen around the other houses outside of town. People have pictures of the tracks but the DNR constantly says it's "just a big coyote". There have been a handful of farm animals mauled in the area. This is in central Wisconsin so it's not unlikely that it's actually a cougar. 
He sleight-of-handed himself
He was fishing with mates. They saw him go overboard. 
Crow mob justice 
So Bird Law is real
> the flop came up giving me an instant royal flush. Immediately my connection droppedThis just sounds deliberate on someone's part.
And his profession? Business.
There's also lots of small, barely-regulated zoos in Appalachia. It's far from certain that they'd report something like that.
As long as it's preceded by 7 What's New Pussycats
They will need the year this happened to research known substances available at the time, possibly any name brands and any measurements OP might recall.
There's a *LOT* more to the story of that day, this is just a quick summary of the last minute or so.  It was very very very surreal.  I have no idea if my brain was forcing me to see things a certain way or if it was very supernatural.  
LOL, and of course it's the guitar pick you juuuuuuuuuuuust bought.
Yes. Also the kitchen was recently redone and it still never turned up. 
I wasn't walking about 2 blocks from my house to 711 one night when a very low helicopter shone its light on me like that. A voice over the loudspeaker told me to get back inside immediately. I guess they were looking for someone dangerous. 
Or at least photoshop a squirrels head in a buff kangaroo with a buffalo wing.
> Neither of us have seen anything like it before or since, have since moved away and the topic doesn't come up much. But once you mention "New Mexico", everyone thinks it's a joke anyway.I don't think New Mexico has aliens, but it is where they developed the Atomic Bomb and there's still tons of rocket scientists and military people out there. Who knows what's going on at Los Alamos. 
More like a horror. OP wouldn't be living to tell this story if he decided to fuck with whatever freaky ghost bitch decided to join him. He did the right thing. 
HOW DO YOU NOT SPEAK OF IT?! Seriously, so often people experience something strange  and then say they never spoke of it again. If that was me I would still be talking about it to this day trying to figure out what happened. I mean how can you never mention the time an exact copy of you was mistaken to be you by your own parents and then vanished into thin air while nobody was looking? 
>When I was a little kidYou are now on a list.
LPT: when going to the zoo, where the same color shirt as the staff uniforms
/r/unexpecteddad
Ball lighting chasing some teenagers through some woods could make a good low budget movie.
Well, I think you just discouraged a lot people from experimenting with it.
I too have seen a coyote man. I was driving in my home town, which is a tiny little farm town, with my best friend. We were driving through a stretch of road that we call "the tunnel of trees" because the trees close above the road and it is very dark. At the end of the tunnel on the corner of a dirt road stood a humanoid creature on its hind legs. It had a coyote type face and it's front legs were bent in front of it very unnaturally. We both saw it and could describe it perfectly. We didn't talk about it for years. I've seen a lot of other coyote related terrors near my home. 
Did you ever ask him if he actually know what was happening? Or was it just in case it was your granma coming to tell you guys to go to bed? 
I think it just depends on whether the feed is scrambled. Most of it is these days :(
I did that once. It was a stressful day and I just wanted to enjoy a spicy Chicken sandwich. The bag broke which ruined the fries I was really looking forward to so I was already pretty upset. Then the first bite into the sandwich was that weird chewy feeling where maybe there's a tendon or something* that your teeth can't bite through and it grossed me out so I quit and gave up on the treat I bought myself. Just wanted to vent about that
From northwestern Iowa. We get a cougar every couple years wandering through neighborhoods. Last one they killed in front of a school bus. 
No, I wonder if that was Toby's choice going for 156 takes just to do it. Raimi: "Okay, we have the shot... We'll just add in the things later in post--" Toby: "No! I have a better idea! Let's just keep doing it until I get it for real! I wanna *be* spiderman!" 
I looked over and watched a guy rub his girlfriends back while she threw up all over one time
At the end of the day, you win some, I win some.I think I've made myself perfectly redundant.
LOL THE LADY "does anyone wanna go....break this up"
Holy shit. The one just continuously pecking the other in the head. Don't fuck with crows man.
Holy crap that's actually pretty scary. I wonder what he did? 
Started watching that because I was curious about crow combat. I can't say that I know a lot about bird "fighting styles," but in-species fighting is so different. I was expecting a lot of foot-biting, and some eye-pecking, but not at all for one to hold the "sentenced" bird down by the neck and bite it. Or for an attacker to use their feet to hold the other's feet down.Regardless, I couldn't make it through the video. Little too intense for me. I need to go hold my parrot.
Or perhaps 3 What's New Pussycats, and it's just a really long song.
Where do you guys live? I want to make sure I never go there.
Goddamnit I don't know what I expected 
Do we really have to assume that all ghosts are murdering assholes? Why cant they just be chilling watching game of thrones with us once in a while.
I know right? Not even to try to figure it out or anything, just to have a cool story to tell. I wish I had weird/cool life events like that to tell others. My go-to "interesting story" I tell others is about the time I tripped while running down the stairs and sprained my ankle for a week. I would trade my sprained ankle story for freaky doppelganger story in a heartbeat. 
Why is this not a thing
Yeah. He knew. I was young and didn't know much about them. Just knew I should be afraid of them. Smell of rotting meat can be a sign that one is near. He knew this and reacted. The smell lingered for about ten mins then went away. Followed by dogs barking like crazy again. 
You appear to have a tenuous grasp of the English language 
My mom always tells me that when I was born she thought I was abducted by aliens.
Maybe he went overboard, got amnesia from the lack of oxygen and forgot who he was, and then hitch hiked or died out of sight. 
I'm so sorry for your loss. That was really beautiful.
Gonads and strife...
Or faked his own death and took on a new identity to start a new life?
Was he part of operation treadstone?
Several years ago, my cousin went in for a tattoo at the shop from 'Inked'. The one in Vegas. It was an 'off' filming day, so NONE of the artists from the show were in. He got his tattoo started, and they asked him to come back in a few weeks when it was healed up to schedule an appointment to finish it. When he showed up, filming for the season was finished. The shop was closed, cleaned out, and the space was for sale.
I was on Jerry Springer. The episode never aired but the entire thing was fake. They even asked me to find friends to complete the storyline of a double love triangle. Coolest part of it all was when they literally asked me if I wanted a fake doctors note or a fake death certificate made out in a fake family members name in order to get me out of work. They literally had a guy on staff whos only job was to get people out of work so they could attend filming.
I was on set for a filming go Ghost Hunters in Buffalo. On the show, they are "investigating" an upper level of the Buffalo Central Terminal when they hear a "disembodied" voice say "Get out!"It was the property manager on a lower level yelling at some homeless people to clear out. Everyone knew it was him, but it somehow made it in the show as an "unexplained" event.
I was on "this morning" when I was about 7 and they did a big makeover for me and my siblings. The premise they created was that we were a nightmare and my poor mum  just  wanted  us to look smart for an upcoming christening. The main part I remember was them telling us to jump in the mud and shout no when our mum asked us to stop. Normally we wouldn't have dared so I remember that being fun! Oh and my sister ruined her hair three times before going on stage so they made us hold her hands so she couldn't touch it. 
In Holland there was a Dutch version of pimp my ride, a player of a football team we played against had his car ''pimped'' the car didnt even make it home, he had to call the car repair service on his way back from the studio...
My cousin was involved in filming for the bachelor (not a contestant) and said they film many scenes in several different ways. For example they might film them cuddling while walking and then walking while looking annoyed and so on. Not that fake but yeah... 
My mate was on "tattoo fixers" if you don't know what it is, basically they get people in with tattoos they regret and make a design they don't tell them about, tattoo it on and cover the old one up and "surprise" them at the end. He filmed the "big surprise reveal" like 5 times because he wasn't surprised enough. 
I was on a European version of "Survivor" where we went to an island and had to survive for 2 weeks.Whatever was seen on camera was what actually happening. The only fake thing is that we got some food to maintain a somewhat healthy diet.
My uncle was on Pawn Stars attempting to sell something. The item wasn't even his. He knew a guy who worked on the show.
I was on "Cops". It's pretty real.
My brother was on Xfactor UK. There are several rounds before the televised rounds, so all those rubbish acts you see on TV have been picked by producers to go through.I've also been in the audience of The Voice and Xfactor and they make you do loads of fake cheering, dancing and clapping before the show starts so they can cut it in to the actual show. 90% of the cheering you see/hear on the televised shows have been added in post production.
A guy did an AMA about being on Pimp My Ride. Everything done to the car was cosmetic. I believe his car didn't run before the show and didn't run after. Basically, a polished turd. 
I was on Stan Lee's Superhumans. Long shoot day at the high altitude chamber I worked at. They brought a guy who had climbed Mt. Everest a bunch of times without supplemental oxygen (29,000 ft) so we brought him to the same altitude in the chamber with some "westerners" to compare against. He asked for oxygen after 15 minutes, and after 30 they asked me to pretend to pass out. Looking back at what aired it's obvious to me I was faking. The way they edited the show, he does "win" the competition.     Season 2. "Spider Man" is the episode title.     Edit four speling
I had a cousin on the new Chris Hansen. I wish that was fake, it's not :/
Never been to the Pawn Stars store but one of my customers told be about going there.This must have been 4 years ago, they said they had to wait in line to go into the store, and they all pitched in $100 to have Chumlee come out from the back room.
A family aquantience had a house built for their disabled adopted kids from Extreme Home Makeover. I think Ty was a dick, but they were just so grateful to have the house that they didn't dwell on the negative aspects
Obligatory not me but my cousin: She was on Hell's Kitchen and said that they would film for over 10 hours on a day, then would go to sleep around 11pm only to get woken up at 2am to film again to make them more irritable. The producers would purposely bring up topics to create drama within the chefs. They re-tapped when they answered the door in the beginning a couple times to make them seem "more surprised." They portrayed my cousin as the "classic hot blonde". It was certainly more of a reality TV show then a cooking show...
I went into the Pawn Stars shop when I was in Las Vegas. They have a line on the side walk to get in, bouncers at the door, and none of the cast in the store. The place is pretty much packed all the time, so my guess is that if someone brings an really interesting item in, then employees have them come back in a week and clear out the store for filming. Either that, or none of the items are actually from real customers.
I had a friend who auditioned for The Voice on the second season I think? He has a beautiful voice but was told his "look" wasn't right for the show. Always thought that was pretty stupid.
Has anyone been on Impractical Jokers? How 'real' is it? Especially in the later seasons - since theyve become quite popular dont people recognise them on the street while they are doing various challenges?
I wonder if supernanny is fake? I know kids are good at acting but still...
Does anyone have an experience on the show Naked and Afraid? Something tells me that show is bs
That seems somewhat fraudulent...
My sister was asked to go on jerry springer by a coworker, but she declined. It was the episode where a man was dating a woman who turned out to be transgender. Not sure what my sister's role was supposed to be. 
My favorite is the episode (no idea which of the ghost shows it was) where they hear this wheeze. Most of the show was them freaking out about them. Come to find out it's a really fat cat just chilling on a bed upstairs with a breathing problem. It was pretty funny.
The first 10-15 minutes of those ghost shows, where they go through the history of the place, can be legitimately interesting though.
It's a running joke amongst friends that if you see a white guy driving a yellow taxi in Manhattan, be ready for Cash Cab. 
It would have been soop awkward if you lost just as he had gotten onto the fdr or west side into stopped traffic. Oh you lost well i cant let you out here or i would be at fault if a real taxi killed you. *sits in silence for the next 20 minutes*
Wow, that's fucked up lol. That almost feels illegal
I mean, if they're making you do things that you wouldn't do normally, that's literally fiction...
I tried out for Canadian Idol. Reading the contract they made us sign, it literally stated that the producers could override the  fan votes if needed to make sure the person they wanted to win, would win. So yeah. I still tried out. I was not the next Canadian Idol. 
"And everyone voted so hard that the palace caught fire and burned down."
Fuck me, that sounds like it sucks balls. 
I heard that because of mounting complaints and a couple lawsuits they had to change the way they conduct the show. Now they have to do a proper job of the make over and show the transformation in 60 minutes. Not sure how true that is though
"...we already agreed what it would look like after its done.""I know but at least act more surprised!"
Did he discuss what it was he wanted with them prior to filming? Because I always thought it was strange they'd make a decision as big as their next tattoo completely on the fly like that.
Out of all of them it doesn't surprise me one bit to hear that 16 and pregnant is the only one that has enough real ridiculous drama that they don't need to fabricate things.
I have no clue how people love his show so much... my gf is obsessed. And I'm like wtf it's so fake it's ridiclious. 
I was born in Henry County, VA and lived there until I was 8, and my sister is 40 and has lived there her whole life. Shining like that actually happens, but not nearly to the scale that it was shown. My sister's ex did have a cold water creek still and made illegal shine (albeit in Patrick County). Now I live in east TN, and everything here is legal. 
> profiteer rolls.That is an excellently accurate typo.
The CC prob cooks nothing ever, he prob puts his name on it even though a line cook made it
Fuckin Aristos
Can confirm, Survivor is some real shit. I had a lecturer who used to be part of the medic team. People got hurt pretty often, although it was usually the crew, since there's a lot more of them. But exhaustion was a big part of the cast's issues.He also watched a fellow cast member drown, while on an expedition/day off on one of the islands. Those islands can be genuinely dangerous places.
> I was on a European version of "Survivor" where we went to an island and had to survive for 2 weeks.Koh Lanta?
This shows how fake these show are.  It's a show about pigs and they're using bullshit.
When the production leaves for the night, do the wives stay at the house alone with the husband? well i know most of the families had kids (if not all), but im just curious.
Everyone seems to know a guy.
Did he just tell the *guy* that he wanted to be on the show so they just gave him a random item the shop already owned? haha Or did he borrow an item from *another* guy he knew?
I always wondered if they got to keep the furniture and whatnot. Do any of them offer to pay extra to keep it or try to set a budget for them to spend on it off camera? 
I'm just sitting here in this alley smoking Meth and next thing I know this 7 foot tall gorilla of a man and a skinny dude holding a bright camera are yelling at me. I start running and next thing I know the gorilla is on top of me, I'm sweating and bleeding from my forehead.
My uncle was on Reno 911! and he said the whole thing was fake.
My friend was one of the rubbish acts. He knew he was awful, the producers knew he was awful. He was only putting on a character for a laugh. He got called back for the novelty "shit act ensemble" at the end of the season.Also, this is why so many people come out with shit like "I quit work to be here!" and are devastated when they don't go through, the fact that they've got through the untelevised rounds already has gotten their hopes up.
I've heard this. Apparently you only go through to the actual auditions if you're great or really terrible. And then they add a couple of average people to make it seem more normal. 
A close friend of mine made a trip up there to check out the shop.  They were filming that day.  Friend and his wife were approached and asked if they'd like to play along.  They were handed a comic and told to ask about something specific.  Basically, it was a filler spot so the guys can have a chance to talk about their extensive knowledge.  They ended up not being able to use the footage because my friend is a manager at WDW.  Disney owns Marvel, yadda yadda.
With David Dickinson? How much more mahogany is he in real life?
Even as a viewer, I've reacted to that. They do a lot of stuff that looks good, but they don't do anything to the bits that keeps it running and safe.
As a car person I ALWAYS wondered about this. Never seen them touch the mechanicals.
It took me quite a while to realize that they just turn broken cars into glorified "ricers".I only realized it when I actually learned of that term, I enjoyed the show when I was younger tho. The thought of 2 TVs at the back of the car hooked up to PS2s or XBoxes was amazing to me.
For interviews if you want to be absolutly sure they cant edit the footage without it not making sense at all, interject random stuff into each sentence that way even the most experienced editor cant mash words together.
Had a friend of a friend enter this show. The only way I found out was I was watching the show and saw her. She wore baggy camo clothes and cowboy boots like 100% of the time, no matter the occasion. They gave her new clothes and hair style. But about 2 weeks after the episode aired, I saw her with her Camo get-up shopping at Walmart. 
I love What Not To Wear, but I'm surprised they would pick you for wearing punk stuff at a concert. It seems like most of the people on the show aren't people who just have an alternative style, but wear clothes that are really poorly fit/unflattering, outdated and worn out, or especially inappropriate for their lifestyle and job (i.e. a 40 year old attorney wearing clubwear and flip flops to court).
"This girl is way too boring for tv we can't use her""Tell her it's because her clothes looked too good so she doesn't feel bad"Lol I'm joking but totally off topic I looked through your post history and it turns out we have the same auto immune disorder! Woo!..?
"Wait, wait, can we try that entrance again? I don't think I seemed surprised enough."
I've always wondered what they do with the Taco Bell and Wine Coolers after they arrest the perp. Shame to see a Crunchwrap Supreme go to waste. 
A month ago Reddit told that the show was filmed in a recreated studio, due to laws pertaining to the filming inside pawn shops. Anyone know the truth?
Never understood the point of this show. Why don't you sell your stuff on Internet? Or at least when they call someone to evaluate your product and after that they give you shitty deal, why don't you tell them to screw themselves and use what the expert tell you to sell it yourself?
My dad volunteered as a carpenter for Extreme Makeover Home Edition awhile back when they came to our area. He had the same story. They would film what they called "camera ready" volunteers for a bit during the day and then a crew would come in and do all the real work. He also said Ty was an absolute asshole who never left his trailor other than to shoot his couple segments and looked like he had never actually swung a hammer in his life. I was really bummed about it because they do such a good job of making him look good on the show. 
The neighbors must have LOOVVEED that going on all night
Is it allowed in the US to work overnight in a residential district?Thats not possible in Germany.
Extreme Makeover did a home for a family here in town and their property tax and insurance went up so much they ended up having to move out of the house.
> go to sleep around 11pm only to get woken up at 2am to film again to make them more irritableIs that why most looked dead inside?
Did your cousin get to meet Gordon Ramsay?
> When she got out of the limo, she was at the airport and they were sending her home after the first episode.Haha, fucking savage.
Wait. So on a scale of History Channel being 0 and NatGeo being 10, where is Animal Planet?
I mean how do you know he didn't learn it from the ferret? 
My favorite thing about Pimp my Ride was the fact that it took months to do up the cars, not a couple weeks like they say.
THANKS OSAMA
One of my highschool friends who is trans ended up doing a Springer show where they did this whole "I'm a man" reveal to their boyfriend. They had never met before.
My favorite for this is Destination Truth. The host is an archaeologist and part of the Adventurer's Club. He does another show on the travel channel now that's a little less outlandish in what's being investigated, but with both shows they go into pretty nice detail about the areas they're visiting and some of the customs of the local people.
Those orbs are just dust motes that are close to the camera lens and out of focus. 
Haha for realz. To avoid that pitfall, the producer gave us an address that avoided highways 
When you get into the cab, they give you a rundown on the rules, and you'd be free to say "no thanks" and not ride anywhere.  But it seems fun, so I'd do it.I'd be annoyed at being hungry though.  There's no reason they had to tell to eat less at lunch.
> I mean, if they're making you do things that you wouldn't do normally do, that's literally fiction...Nah, don't you know? It's "REALITY" tv!
Not sure if it's true, but I heard they have that clause more in case they need to, but it's not something they actually use.ie- they find out a contestant is a convicted rapist, they can just vote him off the show without worrying that a convicted rapist will win the grand prize. 
There is no escape from the Bill Wurtz memes.
There's a few times (never aired of course) where the person came home and went apeshit that their house had been violated and that everyone had to put it back how it was otherwise lawyers, etc..
Wouldn't surprise me. Lord knows if that happened to me, and I was unaware of it beforehand, I'd sue. I like my furniture thank you very much.
I dont know, the show got aired on ''veronica'' i forgot the name, it was a blue orange car.
"When I say 'Hello, Mr Thompson' and press down on your foot, you smile and nod."
Or they hated it.  
Are  you saying that all reality shows should have their characters replaced by pregnant 16 year olds?Survivor just got *way* more interesting
Yeah "made me watch..." My husband says he hates my shows and yet he always seems to come around when I watch, and asks questions... 
people like to look at nice houses I guess
The international version is just interesting  to watch, especially if you are planning to visit or ever think about moving there.  The Australian ones have essentially confirmed I will never retire there due to the stupidly high prices for real estate.  "Bob and George want a three bedroom house near the beach, their budget is $1.6 billion..."
It seems kinda strange now that I think about it, but I enjoy the tours of the homes and the before/after of the one they got. I skip through most of the reality stuff.
I was on my phone and couldn't be bothered googling. Took a punt on the auto-correct. Totally wrong.Better change it before this hits front page and my inbox gets flooded with corrections. 
A restaurant I used to work for catered live celebrity chef events. Several of them were winners of Top Chef or various Food Network cast members (not the big names, but members of the teams that swoop in to help). They would send our owner a signature  recipe in advance, he would show up with one of his chefs and while the Celebrity Chef was making one serving of their dish out on stage to demonstrate the two of them would bust ass and make a few hundred copies to serve to the audience once the demonstration was over. 
Booze seems to be key for many reality shows. 
I was watching some American survivor like show and one of the guys who initially scouted out the island got bit by an extremely poisonous snake and had his flesh on his leg destroyed. 
"I know a guy who's a specialist in Napoleonic-era French enema kits, lemme give him a call."
Best episode of cops was"I'll get you bitch"or that episode where that lady was so angry at her husband she takes out scissors and starts cutting everything in their house.  Even her hair.
I'm glad he knew, I always felt bad for the shit acts because I thought they all believed they were good when they were basically being asked back for the public humiliation.
thats weird that just because he works for a company hes considered property of disney.
Not always.  A few people got lucky enough to have some decently impressive engines installed 
They are *really* experts at preventing this kind of thing from happening. I have heard stories of people on big brother where the staff was trying to push them to trash talk on other people and they would ask the most horrid manipulative leading questions and when they tried to refuse, they held up their contract and threatened to sue them for not cooperating.
Haha I actually have a feeling that might have been how it went down. I assume most people put together their worst outfit for the interview but I still had some self respect so I put on something I'd actually wear. I think if I had a pic everyone would agree it looked alright -- just looked like a movie assassin outfit or something. Woot let our spines fuse together! Ha pun. AS power. 
I've actually thought about how funny it would be if they show the guy getting taken down after he walks out the front door, and then it cuts back to Hansen just unwrapping the happy meal the guy brought with him. 
I went there a couple years ago. There is the pawn shop where you could buy stuff like a normal pawn shop. Apparently, the Pawn "Stars" come out sometimes to interact with people, but not very often.  One of the workers told us there was another shop they did the actual filming at. 
Everybody that appears on Pawn Stars has to apply and have their inventory pre-examined for authenticity.  It's not like random people bring in that kind of stuff. They also pick people with stuff that isn't real, to try to make the show seem authentic.
Adam Carolla actually called him out as being a fake. Asked him questions a real carpenter should know. It didnt go well, Ty is a phony.
I've heard that Ty Pennington is a dick and a fraud probably a dozen times on Reddit over the past few years and now I hate his stupid mortgage commercials even more.
Oh yeah. Plus the family was fairly wealthy and totally didn't need to be rescued. Meanwhile my friend's dad's house was still flattened.
You can, but local noise ordinances apply. Of course you can do whatever you want if no one enforces the laws or you bribe the neighbors. 
To be fair the 30 Mexicans were probably picked up in a Home Depot parking lot and being paid cash. Rules tend to not apply.
I'm from.CA, Mexicans were the hardest working dudes Iv ever seen. Never complained, even the illegal ones. They would do any job, they just wanted to work. Never even took breaks when they put a new roof on my house, I went out and got them.all lunch they didn't even speak English. Respect for them.
As a chef I can tell you we are all dead inside
He's just a dog trying to make his way in the universe.
Probably about a 2. You sometimes get an actual documentary about animals, but for the most part it's Finding Bigfoot season 23 and Jackson Galaxy Cat Whisperer reruns
My favourite part was on the show they got all this cool stuff and then as soon as it's over they take a lot of the cool stuff back. 
Was it where she was dressed as a hula girl? I didn't see the whole episode just a clip, I have no idea why she was dressed like a hula girl. 
We are all dead on this blessed day
Josh Gates is definitely in my Top 5 People to Have a Beer With list
But what would dust be doing in a haunted house?!
So are you saying that the cooking show opportunity was false, and that they baited you into cash cab?And that they abandon people hungry and alone and remote as standard operating practice?
Also on the x factor you usually have to have a sob story 
You could make a religion out of Bill Wurtz memes.
Completely understandable 
That would be me, but if they smashed my old stuff, lawyers would be inbound regardless.
I always assumed that, even though it's a surprise to them on-screen, surely they're in on it for this exact reason AND they'll need to grant permission for the team to get into their house?
Like seriously, who the fuck thinks it's a good idea to redecorate and repaint a person's house without their knowledge or informed consent?I'd be fuckin pissed too, even if it was a quality job. 
It must be "De grote beurt", what a fucking shit show that was.
My husband is a tattooer and I've watched the show. Based on the information I have available to me, this is probably the correct answer 
Okay so we found exactly what you were looking for, and, it's under budget!"I know, it just doesn't feel right, you know babe? I mean, did you see the backyard? It was so, not us." 
Nah I like on Property Brothers where they have a wishlist that's for a 4million home and a $9 budget - then they show them their dream home like **psyche!!!** You can't afford this you broke fool - here's a rat infested shithole we can show you! 
Oh crap! The real estate market has crashed??! *drops smashed avo on toast*
The international ones are always explained simply as "American wants to move to the other side of the world and live in an exact copy of his old American home." Half of the episode is spent highlighting that American guy wants X but 90% of the homes in Y don't have X and American guy is not pleased, but oh my god, look we found one that does have X but it is also located in the middle of an alligator pond and there's no kitchen. Needless  to say, it's fun to watch. 
Sarah wants to live in an ancient Italian flat, in a charming village. She wants 4 bedrooms, 3 bath, two car garage, full washer and dryer mud room, and a fenced in backyard. 
See I'm kinda more okay with that IF the recipe was made by the CC. I dont think it will be very smart time wise to just have the CC cook for the whole audience
It's part of the Aussie food pyramid.
People used to do enemas for medical reasons a lot. Tobacco enemas were a thing in the past.
Nah, hands down it's gotta be that "I can break these cuffs" dude.I was on the edge of my seat when he tried to break those cuffs. Turns out he couldn't break those cuffs.
Wasn't there one guy who got a brand new car because his old one was Frankensteind from two or three different cars?
True, but when they did that, they didn't do all the things needed to run such an engine safely, such as stiffening the chassis, better brakes and so on.
\*Chris Hansen turns to the crew\* "Hey guys what do you want for lunch? I can message the next perv from the bait account and ask them to bring some fast food."
You know you've hit rock bottom as a tv personality when you start doing mortgage commercials. 
That's OK, it's probably half made out of cardboard!
Noise ordinances aren't enforced based on who's making noise.
We have the same situation in the UK with polish guys. Hardest working people, do such a good job, never complain. And a lot of people regardless still have the same bullshit attitude to them, that they're terrible scrounging immigrants. 
> I rather not say because it would be easy to find the episode that way, and I'm trying to remain anonymous on my accountFair enough.Thanks for sharing! Pretty interesting as I remember watching that show when I was much younger and assuming it must all be exaggerated so interesting to see "behind the scenes" to some degree.
Back when History and Discovery were still decent, Animal Planet was pretty good too.
What seriously
Speak for yourself!
He definitely seems like an awesome guy. I imagine just listening to him talk about his adventures would be fun.
then they film them for survivor NYC
No, don't 
Hey guys I just found this cool new religion. It's called Wurtzism and I think you should all try it.
Where's the reality show for this? I'd rather watch this.
Right? What are they expecting? That the person is so overjoyed they completely forgot about all the other things that have been in their daily lives for years?
Yeah, if youre gonna fake anything, fake the reactions. Tell them beforehand, have em sign a waiver, then have him fake surprise
It was so bad that it was amazing!
The people on that show, specifically that Sketch guy, are universally hated by the tattoo scene. He also steals designs from other artists. All sorts of controversy about him and this show. 
When the adverts come on I genuinely have a bad time telling what's the bad tattoo and what's the 'fixed' one
My husband is a tattooer (we're in Australia fwiw). The first thing he says any time this show is mentioned is what a piece of shit that sketch guy is. He has the privilege of probably being the most internationally despised person in tattooing 
The woman always need a place to "entertain guests" and the man always needs a "man cave." Or it's just "not authentically [insert current county] enough."
Will it have an open concept floor plan?
It's the one with no personal items in it. The other two are other people's houses. 
There's always that one person in the couple that seems to complain about every little thing. "MMMm yeah I dunno bout this caaarpet""Mmmnoot feeling this kiiitchen""Yeeeah this one doesn't have a ocean viewwww"
She also wants to live in the middle of the city but also wants it to be quiet and charming. Her budget is $12 and she also has a sack of potatoes. 
It *is* the Aussie food pyramid.
Thread went from 0 to 100 real fucking quickly.
That's brilliant. Did they do a few takes for the awkward handshake with Holly Willoughby? It looks like she expected it
I specifically remember one episode where they had something like sacks of potatoes in the back of their pickup so their shitty brakes would at least get a little bit of braking power (I'm not sure if that even helps or makes it worse tbh) and Pimp My Ride actually gave them a proper set of brakes and made a big deal out of it actually braking now.
>The show is hosted by the guy who writes Black Mirror.somehow, feels as though it could never have been any other way
I love the way Ty justified himself "Nevermind", "of course" like he only knew the answers after it was reveled.That's not how it works buddy 
I got 30s into it before I had to stop... it is sooo brutal. You can hear the disappointment and frustration in Adam's voice. Lol
Look at mr. fancy walls, using cardboard! I built my home out of toilet paper and used McDonalds straws!
Noise ordinances are also probably not enforced when all the houses are flattened in the area.
stereotypes don't help anyone. I worked with poles for years and like any group many were hard working, especially the younger ones. Then I'd go home to my house share with 5 of them, 3 were on benefits and two were incredibly violent alcoholics who I could hear drinking all day and often woke me up belching. They were both women. People are people.
Steve irwin's death also killed Animal Planet
In said AMA the dude talked about how for example he had a cool TV put into his car for the show and once his episode was over they took it back. It's kinda funny in the end 
"No said everyone"
Trading Spaces used to air the ones where people were pissed. You should look for the purple house episode.

If I got the opportunity to hug Holly Willoughby, I'd insist on at least a few takes. 
I'm surprised they didn't just install a sack of gold plated potatoes.
Well, it's Death grilling you, I'd be 100% ashamed as well 
Shoulda made it out of bidets and straws, uses much less natural resources.
I hope this is only "the stuff we did was not actually street legal so we have to take this out so you're allowed to drive your car" and not "well show's over, pack it up boys"...
"Tryyyyy iittttttt" he said again
That show was terrible.  It was like they were trying to play practical jokes on each other instead of making something nice.  I saw one where they spray painted someones couch.  
I have a 100+ year old piano that's been passed down through my family. I would commit felony assault at the very least if I came home and found it gone/smashed in a dumpster.

this is the first time i've experienced the creation of a meme in real time
Face it OP, you're watching a movie tonight.
It's hard to distinguish between who's kidding and who can't read 
I was looking forward to make out tips, but everyone just has really weird tastes in what gets them hot and bothered.
Just saw another post that OP commented on and you guys followed him to tell him, "Not movies." God I love Reddit.
Just go with it.Of course I'm referring to the 2011 Adam Sandler movie.
This is glorious,  I've never seen this much karma given for spamming "Not Movies".
Listen to Too Short.

Backdoor sluts 9
First of all Rat, you never let on how much you like a girl. "Oh, Debbie. Hi." Two, you always call the shots. "Kiss me. You won't regret it." Now three, act like wherever you are, that's the place to be. "Isn't this great?" Four, when ordering food, you find out what she wants, then order for the both of you. It's a classy move. "Now, the lady will have the linguini and white clam sauce, and a Coke with no ice." And five, now this is the most important, Rat. When it comes down to making out, whenever possible, put on side one of Led Zeppelin IV.
People just love movies man. But I found that killing that awkward silence the moment before by just announcing that you're going in for the kiss works well. Saying it right comes off as confident

With joy and excitement, he posted his thread -  'I wonder what answers they'll give me?' he said.  'Perhaps some advice on the best way to start?  The finest of moves for the amorous art.'And so, with elation, he waited a while -  He opened his inbox and read with a smile.  Misguided. Mistaken. Misread and misquote.  He frowned with confusion. '*Not movies*,' he wrote.
Hmm.. never heard of that movie.

Look for unusually long moments of silence where your just kind of staring into each other's eyes, sound cheesy I guess. Also keep an eye out for if she drops her gaze and glances at your lips.
You could gaze in her eyes for 5 minutes, and still not get the hint. So the sure move is to just put your hand on her in kissing position. You know, side of her face, or on her chin, or on the back of her head/upper neck. She will deny you instantly if she doesn't want it, if she doesn't do anything, then you can spring on her face. 
I've never laughed so hard at a thread before. Bad puns, not movies, famous poem accounts chiming in. People stalking OPThis should be a movie.

I like the description. A rope of jizz. Now imagine climbing that rope to the top of Mount Everest. Now imagine it breaking up in mid air because it's not really a rope, but jizz. Now see yourself dodging that jizz like Neo from the Matrix as if your life depended on it. Now imagine you are at home getting a blowjob while watching the movie the Matrix.

I work at a bar, I tried to take a spoon back from someone who was leaving, but he wouldn't let me have it. He kept insisting that someone had knighted him with it. Hope you got home ok spoon knight...
I got so drunk, that about an hour after the new year I jumped off the balcony, fell to another party and stayed there for a few hours before realising I don't know anyone.
Had to convince my friend not to jump in the pool because he thought "This water is 2016 water, I gotta jump before it becomes 2017 water!"It wasn't even a pool party.
clapping to the beat of a song, a drunk man from holland comes up to me and says I have great, powerful claps and we should clap our hands together in the form of a high five
Grandpa got very racist towards my black cat
My gf started puking, and between outbursts says "At least this is all good wine, it doesn't taste so bad coming up!"
ER Nurse.Guy came in complaining of scrotal pain. Stated he was at home, in his living room, high on coke and quite drunk, sitting on a bicycle when he slipped and caught his marble purse on the sharp pedal. He felt wetness and assuming it was blood wrapped his manhood in TP and ran to the ER. He got back to my room and finally found the courage to check the damage himself. Noticed it was just urine and he had peed his pants. Ran straight back out into the night without another word.Happy new year central Ohio. 
I told someone I was done drinking for the night because I'm a pussy and he gave me this real emotional speech about never putting myself down.
He kept praising the invention of balloons
I threw the lighter away instead of the firecracker...
A guy sat in the corner in tears because he didn't want 2013 to end.
There were a few singles at my New Year's Eve party. They were joking about just all kissing each other when my buddy offers to kiss all of them. When asked how he's going to accomplish it he manages to slur out the words "Midnight is a whole minute, and I'm a slut"
This lady was much drunker than everyone thought and no one realized until around 12:10am when her husband tried to get her to leave and she grabbed him by the throat and push him down some stairs. He got up, dusted himself off, and calmly walked out the front door. She attempted to sober up in the dining room while someone downloaded uber to her phone so she could get home.I felt bad for the guy, but secretly I was so happy to see he said F This and bounced completely. 
Friends friend passed out on the couch still wearing his ski gear, let's out a huge fart waking himself up. He turned to look at his ass simply asking "What?" While looking confused.
My friend started belting out the theme tune to an old British kids show called "poddington peas".Then he started crying, and said "when I was a kid there was an episode, about a fucking pea who was too fat to get out of his house - all the other peas tried to help him, but they couldn't get him out - I remember identifying with that pea - that pea was me!"He cheered up once we bought him a kebab
I ate a 8 piece family bucket of fried chicken and chugged a few beers. While walking home I  vomited in the middle of the sidewalk and basically laid down on top of a bush to recover. Some guy with his lady walked past and when he saw the scene I just heard him say "Jesus Fuck". 
"STOP TELLING ME WHAT TO DO, I HAVE NEVER DIED BEFORE." a  friend who got kicked out of 2 clubs and wanted to keep drinking and partying. 
Him: "Can I use the food garage?"Me: "The what?"Him: "Oh, the oven."
My bestfriend went over to the keg to get some beer. He pumped the keg and preceded to spray beer all over his phone which he thought was a cup. I was so stunned I didn't say anything for like 10 seconds and when I did he looked at me like I was stupid then looked back at his phone and threw it across the room. 
She called her husband a sad fat dragon. He's really not sad or a dragon. 
We asked our friend how drunk he was, he responded, "twice."
I found my friend hiding a statue of a mermaid in the top of a toilet. His reason? it needed to be back in the ocean.
My friend told me he will donate my car to Kars For Kids if I vomit.
"I fucking love Kidz Bop." As Fetty Wap was playing on the speakers 
Sent a dick pic to his long time good friend instead of who he wanted it to go to.
Was on the beach and this guy couldn't find anywhere to hide his bag so he just tossed it into the ocean and yelled "those fuckers can't steal my beer now!" 
"its not a real blowjob unless she works the balls"- my drunk uncle
I live in Texas and have a friend who moved here from Scotland a few years ago. Ever since she moved here she consistently has faked an "American" accent to fit in. Last night she got so drunk she forgot about her American accent and started calling everyone dirty sluts in the thickest Scottish accent for an hour or so.
Somebody ran through a closed door
Went with a friend to his coworkers party. By the time the party was settling down his supervisors girlfriend was all over him and I mean like sitting on his lap, trying to get him to dance, kissing him on his cheek on her way out, etc. Meanwhile his supervisor was right there, kinda drunk, fairly embarrassed. She kept looking over to her boyfriend and saying things like "It's okay if I dance with him right, you don't care right? See he doesn't care." I felt so bad watching the whole thing unravel in front of my very own eyes.
No Ubers were running late after the party ended so my two buddies caught a ride home with the Domino's delivery guy
Shook up an open bottle of champagne and sprayed the ceiling, TV, and the host's girlfriend. Party fell apart shortly after.
Had a small get together with friends, we were all getting stoned and playing the new VR I got for Christmas. One friend is playing and out of no where he starts falling, once he hits the ground he just lays there and says "so this is how it ends."
Not a party but I saw a guy peeing in the middle of a busy road, flipping off the cars driving by. It was only about 9pm at the time
Handed my drunk friend a pine cone and said, here eat this apple. Two bites later he spits it out and says, THIS IS A PINE CONE!
I went cheering with the police and firemen just after twelve when they were putting out lit fires.
A really drunk guy took the giant bowl of noodle salad and started trying to feed everyone with it. He would walk up to people and put a spoon in their mouth, it was pretty hilarious. He also tried selling his scarf because he owed  some guy money so he would just casually ask everyone if they wanted to buy his scarf. 
My girlfriend told my family how much she likes sucking my dick
Went to give my girlfriend a cuddle while she was peeing in some bramble bushes and face planted into the wee/bush. Impressive cuts on both of them 
My aunt got high and passed out on the living room floor.
Not this year, but a couple years back. Somehow an infomercial got on the TV with one of those "call now before this commercial ends" countdown clocks in the corner. Everyone was so drunk that they counted down with the last ten seconds of the infomercial thinking it was the New Years countdown. We were all the drunkest people at the party that year.
Drunk buddy tried to shoot a firework holding it in his mouth. He tightened it too hard, the firework never flew and exploded right on top of him. He ended up with the face completely black from the powder and some small burns on his face. Two policemen were next to us when this happend, they told him it was the most stupid things that they had seen this year, and yes we were still in 2016.
A guy I'd never met named Tony kept asking all the female party goers if they knew what his name was spelled backwards. Then would slur out " y not" my wife thought it was funny and creepy at the same time. 
The host got belligerently drunk, forgot who he'd shook hands with/talked to, and spent the rest of the night making rounds shaking everyone's hand at least half a dozen times before passing out. 
This one girl dropped a slice of pizza on the floor. She then proceeded to rinse it off in the sink, and then ate it...
Quite a few people Indian leg wrestled in their underwear. Apparently pants make it hard to Indian leg wrestle.
She made SO MANY new bffs. And tried to start an orgy
I vomited so hard that I've burst/damaged a load of blood vessels in my face. Also the punchbag at the back of my mouth is swollen from the vomit so it feels like I have something stuck in my throat. I think I was probably the drunkest person at our party...
Coming home from the party last night, we stopped for pizza. The super drunk guy in front of us told us he paid for our pizza. He made a big deal out of it, but then fumbled the machine and almost forgot his card and dropped his pizza box on the floor. We asked the cashier if he had actually paid for our pizza, and she double checked and said "he... didn't even pay for his own pizza." We paid for his pizza. 
He is 17. He tried to kiss my friends drunk Mom. In front of the buzzed dad.  he did it. 
We were at applebee's, they had hired a DJ for NYE. This girl stumbles over from the bar and slurs to him (he was right next to our table) "I have nothing against Hispanic people but can you not play any more Pitbull?"   And then she tripped over a chair and almost spilled a drink all over someone's food. 
A friend of mine was extremely drunk and saw this guy walking his dog. My friend started petting the dog and when the owner asked him to stop he started petting the man instead. 
One of my buddies came to from a brown out mid choke hold. He slid and fell in the kitchen somehow and got grabbed by another friend so he'd stay off his ass. Then not knowing why he's in a choke hold he proceeds to flail around spilling drinks, chips, and the like.
After osu lost he was throwing stuff around on the front porch (it was his house). He chucked a big cooler into the air and it bounced at a really weird angle to land perfectly to cover up one of our friends heads. Everyone at the party and a bunch of passerby all collectively cheered
Played hotline bling on repeat and kept toasting everyone so she can have an excuse to drink.The most drunk person was me. 
This guy who wasn't invited took all of his clothes off and started smearing his cock on people. When we told him to leave he put on someone elses clothes (like from a cupboard) and tried to walk out wearing it.
I yelled merry christmas instead of happy new year :(
 For some reason, I texted my best friend, "I don't have enough alcohol to love you."I still don't know why. I think I was channeling my mother. Apparently, not all families talk like that, just mine.I'm sorry Katie. I know you're going to see this. I made it public. I do love you btw, you're my best friend and you always make me laugh.Edit- /u/frightened_anonymous 
I broke 3 glasses within an hour of each other. Kind of wasn't my fault but still got forced to drink of a plastic cup for the rest of the night. 
My wife of 7 years around 2am drunkingly told me she loved me. I told her I loved her back and she responded with "you do?" As if I said it for the first time.  It's how she said it that was funny, almost like after all these years she never knew I loved her.  It's one of those you would need to be there for it moments. 
A drunk girl was asking guys if she could grab their package. Her boyfriend was there and didn't seem to care. They've been rumored to swing on occasion. 
I think I was the drunkest person at the party.Aaaaaaaaand I kissed my ex. Like a fucking moron.
This guy found out that no had ever peed out of this dude's bedroom window before and decided he needed to be the first to do so... a second story window. 
My best friend's girlfriend invites me to a threesome with them. It was... interesting.  
My girlfriend threw an entire double deck of Uno cards into the fire :(
Dude asked a girl out for the evening. Kissed her at midnight and told her how happy he was she came out with him. Then extremely drunk him took a different girl -one he had just met- into the hotel bathroom, everyone noticed, and proceeded to do things with her that entirely pissed off first girl. When he came out of the bathroom, his first action was to hit on another girl (me). Everyone was pissed at drunk dude for the amount of drama he brought to the night. And he wasn't hot, at all, just a douche.
That's an officer actually doing public work.
If there are people in a pool, then it's pool party.
YOUR CLAPS ARE OF THE HIGHEST CALIBER, FELLOW HUMAN. PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE IN A COOPERATIVE EXTENSION OF THE ACTIVITY? I AM CAPABLE OF PROVIDING A COMPLETELY NON-SYNTHETIC HAND
The most optimistic woman in the world. 
I'm imagining him running out without pants on with arms flailing behind him as he happily runs all the way back home.
The real MVP
Is your hand okay?
That's my new life motto
Your buddy sounds fun
This is vastly under-upvoted how in the hell did he find space enough to do that
do you live in new orleans bc i'm pretty sure i said that a few times 
I mean, I've heard much worse drunk logic. 
I hope you didn't let him
He had to confirm the kill.
A sad fat dragon with no friends? 
I think we have different definitions of the word tipsy
My friend has a recording of me sulking over a girl years ago and I said, "I'm gonna kill myself in half"
My very drunk friend made me a mixed drink last night. I asked him how strong he made it, and he shrugged and mumbled "three or four". 
Did they reply?
plumber couldn't be assed to use toilet, shits in pot
He wasn't wrong, fuckers aint gonna get his beer.
Why were people trying to steal his beer?
That's awesome. I have a couple of Scottish friends. The accent gets stronger the more they drink. I love it. 
Who the hell would want to hide a Scottish accent? She's got her priorities all wrong.
Someone stole my friends front door, just ripped if off the hinges and ran down the street
That's a motherfucking sorcerer.
This is the best one, honestly. Dude may have been trashed but he knew what he was about. You gotta respect a guy who stands in a campfire to prove he isn't lying.
Wow, I now need those shoes!!!
What about his pants?
No matter how fireproof the shoes are, wouldn't his feet get unbearably hot after ten minutes over a flame?
Happened at my brother-in-laws house as well, champagne EVERYWHERE
>  he starts falling, once he hits the groundThis reads like quite a length of time passed between him losing his balance and actually falling. But I'm sure that's just a case of weed time dilation.
You let drunk people play with your new VR headset? You brave soul.
"Hey have some noodle salad. Good isn't it? So anyway do you wanna buy a scarf?"
Does she work the balls?
Bet that volcano was the life of the party
This is the most wholesome thing in this thread
I once put a bottle rocket between my butt cheeks, someone lit it, things were going well until it made that screech sound and I got scared; I clenched my cheeks and it exploded right there.College.
I wonder if that's ever worked for him.  
What do you even say after you get a response
One night I pretended my name was Tony and it worked for me. My Korean friend Park didn't have much luck that night.
*bathtub fire*
You need to expound on this story a bit more than that.
Yeah you can't just leave it there. At the very least you have to explain how/why a bathtub is so close to the TV, never mind the fire in it.
You call that belligerent?
What is Indian leg wrestling? 
I have a friend who does this every time she gets drunk. She tries to hint that she wants to have an orgy with the subtlety of a freight train. 
While on vacation in another country last year, I made friends with a group of girls my age, drank waaaaaay too much and basically begged them all to skinny dip with me in the ocean. Solid nope all around. 
>10 vodka shotsHot damn. Respect but also I threw up a little.
At least somebody paid for somebody's pizza. Nice act of kindness to start off the new year!
Hahaha this reminds me of my brother on our birthday (same day, three years apart) many years ago. I realized I'd lost track of him and asked his friend where he was. Friend pointed and said "over there, petting that guy's beard."Beard guy looked super uncomfortable. I felt bad, but quickly got him to stop.
Why was he in a chokehold? 
Really starting to sound like you pissed yourself and are blaming it on the dog
what the fuck is a cooler if it wouldn't kill someone if it landed on them
Did you do the dance? 
You were THAT chick
> smearing his cock on peopleIt can... *smear*?
Sounds like a Portlandia skit.
this one is my favourite. innocent and hilarious. 
Have a similar story. My friend's grandmother passed away and he visited my place shortly after and my mom accidentally said congratulations instead of my condolocences. He gave me a very strange glare. 
Was totally your fault.
This is why I don't drink heavily, until it becomes the reason I drink heavily.
I slept with my ex. in fact she's sleeping next to me right now
that song is extremely sad. i don't get why it was played in the first place.in any case, sorry for your loss. :(
Was he aware they were fake?
I know this feeling exactly. Isn't it like oddly exciting.
You sound fun, but I'm worried about the quantity of stink bugs in your domicile. 
I'm concerned the skull might be too scary for them. Have you considered a treasure chest as an alternative?
"It's not blood, guys! It's not blood!"
If I get you for a Reddit Secret Santa next year, I promise I will make you a lovely cross-stitch sampler- instead of "Home Sweet Home" it will say 'Midnight Is A Whole Minute, And I'm A Slut", maybe with some pretty flowers and vines along the edge :)
I'm invested in this story, how'd it turn out 
Surprisingly enough his phone is fine. 
I like to think that it's one of those "every square is a rectangle" kind of things. If you're wasted, you're also significantly tipsy, and probably have a heavy buzz going on. Every subsequent level of drunkenness also includes the previous level of drunkenness. It's like building a pyramid, except instead of getting closer to the sky, you get closer to the floor. 
Did you do it?
5 more minutes of this, and I'm gonna get mad!
The dolphins will though. Dolphins are notorious drunks.
I'm thinking that's how the accent developed in the first place 
If they can do that with their bare hands it's probably best to just let them keep it
Or maybe just a person who tries hard and believes in himself.
For all those times you need to stand in a camp fire!
A guy with fireproof shoes is definitely rocking cargo shorts
For fucks sake I knew I'd find us on this thread somewhere.
It's a miracle he didn't suceed in selling his scarf with that, honestly.
That's the only way to do it; Uncle knows best.
Intelligence stat:1Luck stat:10
60 percent of the time it works every time.   In reality, I saw most females start talking with him then quickly make their retreat. He seemed to be having a great time though. 
I spent way too much time trying to figure out what "k rap" is...
You know, the traditional New Year's bathtub fire.
He just drops 'bathtub fire' like those are two words that go together all the time...
Well he was belligerently friendly.
It sounds like a euphemism for something much more exciting
Tony backwards 
It was a joint venture. Pretty much everyone in the household screamed, peed and subsequently cried at the stroke of midnight.
It's an insulated box for keeping drinks and food cold. They're typically made of plastic
Every party had one. Sorry in behalf of all of us
i've done that... then tried to correct and the recipient said not to worry. 
"If I delete them they never happened"
It almost sounds like drunk friend actively hates your sober friend in a Jyckle and Hyde way.
To alcohol! The cause of, and solution to, all life's problems.
Yes, he was formerly the banker.
He did in fact kiss every person at that party before 12:01 
What kind of phone?
It's not a pyramid scheme. It's more like a funnel. 
Can't remember 
It's not MY fault this is happening
Turns out, there is no actual Scottish accent. Everyone in Scotland is just drunk all the time.
That's what I figured... like.. Merry Christmas to you bud.. enjoy your door
I love Frankie Boyle's story of the most Scottish thing he'd ever seen. A drunk guy pishing against the door of a house. He finishes, gives it a shake, puts it away, takes out his keys and opens the door.
It's the car dealership tactic:  First they feed you, then they take your money. 
You sure the volcano had nothing to do with it?
I'm actually quite impressed.
100% limb damage resistance
Like "garage raccoon."
Must be Canadian 
Not just every single girl. Not even every girl. Every *person*. What a champ. 
Seriously, OP, we all need this answer.
He's getting himself a house, one piece at a time.
Ah, the ol' restaurant tactic.
Yeah, who contributed that peice of paper to the stack? 
and it didn't cost him a dime. You'll know it's him, the shittiest house in town
Its a '16, '17, '18, '19, '20, '21, '22 split level ranch.
A lot of people don't realize this, but during wars and other significant military campaigns countries capture one another's records. Much of this tends to be banal bureaucratic stuff, but in the case of governments that are meticulous record keepers, there are sometimes volumes of damning information about war crimes.The US National Archives has a Rebel Archives, captured from the CSA during the Civil War. It contains descriptions of the treatment of prisoners of war, some of which are gruesome.Union medical officer logs are no better.
Aren't the JFK files suppose to be declassified this October? 
On January 3, 1961, a United States B-52 bomber went into a tailspin and broke up mid-air, accidentally dropping two Mark-39 hydrogen bombs over Goldsboro North Carolina. One of the bombs worked exactly as intended, it's parachute deployed and it's triggers activated, armed and ready to detonate on impact, 3 of the 4 safety switches failed, a single low-voltage switch prevented two 4 megaton nuclear explosions.
You can read the speech that was written for the President, in the event that the Apollo 11 crew were stranded or died on the Moon. It's creepy and horrifying to think about.
I think it was called project Timmy. They wanted to drop 1/2 ton iron rods from space that would have similar efforts to an atom bomb with no fallout.
The remaining JFK assassination documents are going to be released to the public in October 2017 so that will be pretty crazy.
Reading all of these posts, from around the world, I can't help but think about how the internet is going to change the way in which we all live/are governed. Twenty (hell ten) years ago, most of us would have never known the details behind these operations. We may not even know about them. How will our ability to share previously unknown information change the way things happen in the future? Will we see less of these horrible undercover things, because those conducting know there is a good chance the rest of the world will find out?
In the 1960's during the time period where the Canadian government was trying to wipe out aboriginal beliefs, they were abducting children from their homes and giving them up for adoption in the United States and other countries. The Canadian government was also putting these children into Residential schools where they would beat and sexually assault these children to try and "beat the Indian" out of them. The government was very Anti-Aboriginal for a long time.
Also anybody working in factories with phosphorus (look us phossy-jaw).
The Germans were meticulous record keepers, and a lot fell into Allied hands, at the end of WW2.
Andersonville. A prison camp where the treatment of prisoners was so bad that the commandant of the camp was hanged after the war.
It is interesting that all of these evil experiments the US did happened not long after WW2 ended. I wonder if there is a connection?
That reminds me of the fleet captain, also Russian i think, that disobeyed orders and decided not to launch missiles and prevented war. 
Aurora Borealis, at this time of year, causing a nuclear war, localized entirely in Russia?
My family were all miners from the Midlands, and my dad mentioned that during the miners strikes it was common knowledge amongst them that a lot of violence was incited by Metropolitan Police undercover as protestors. 
could that actually work?
"The SLAM as proposed would carry a payload of many nuclear weapons to be dropped on multiple targets, making the cruise missile into an unmanned bomber. After delivering all its warheads, the missile could then spend weeks flying over populated areas at low altitudes, causing tremendous ground damage with its shock wave. When it finally lost enough power to fly, and crash-landed, the engine would have a good chance of spewing deadly radiation for months to come."
Do these people hear themselves when they name their projects after death gods and demons?
In general, biological weapons are the 21st centuries scariest weapons because I think there is a strong potential for custom viruses that make everything else look like child's play.Essentially, playing pathogen. Infect a target population via somewhat clandestine means with a virus that ends up overwhelming the health infrastructure and creating chaos. 
My roommate told me about this a month ago and the very thought of it is creepy as fuck. Just an entire town, all the ruckus and noise and then....nothing. There are pictures too, those are just horrible. 
My understanding is that they taped the sermons over existing cassette tapes, mostly pop music and the like. I heard a bit of the final sermon and there's slow, deep, pop music playing ominously in the background. The actual sermons themselves were free of background music.
Unless they get reclassified for 25 more years
Kudos to the tech who said "Three is good, but four is better"
Holy fucking shit. So North Carolina basically almost had a new lake. 
To put this into perspective, the Little boy and Fat man bombs were 15KT and 20KT of TNT.
So you mean that with one bomb, the safety switches worked as intended and prevented it from going off, whereas with the second one only one of them worked?
That was during the Cold War too. Could you imagine that shitshow that would've resulted? 
Had to be so surreal. "wonder what the weather's like next week. Hmmm light showers on Tuesday and... Oh! Localized apocalypse on Thursday!"  
Woe, that was a chilling read. I cannot imagine looking up the weather and seeing that bulletin. 
I've always said that the kind of people who aspire to positions of power are not the kind of people we really want holding those positions. This is a prime example. 
It is exactly what you would expect of a religion founded by a Sci-Fi author.
Go with what works for you, man. Never be afraid to think outside the box.ed: did I accidentally reference something? Why does everyone keep talking about iceboxes
Something like this really makes me wonder how this kind of 'network' of professional lawbreakers form. Do people go knocking around their colleagues' office asking "Do you know about this new moneymaking scheme that Friar Billy came up with"? I mean, I'm sure there were no small amount of self-justification, religious indoctrination, and hierarchical pressure involved but still for a ploy this big to last 5 decades with so many people's willing involvement... Do people really get out of bed each morning thinking "I should steal some babies today"? 
 "In one case, seven volunteers in Kentucky were given LSD for 77 consecutive days."I've done acid for a couple days in a row and I'm trying to imagine 77 days but I just can't...
whats insane is that one of the larger minds behind MK Ultra, Henry Murray, wound up at Harvard and performed psychological experiments on a then 17 year old Ted Kaczynski, who would eventually become the Unabomber.  
LOTS of fucked up crazy shit is associated with MK-Ultra. 
Wasn't this the basis of *Close Encounter of the Fourth Kind* or something like that?
Well of course they would try all sorts of things to see what worked. If you've got basically infinite money, why not take a run through the phonies to see if any are actually real?
Great, now you've got me thinking that Mars is really a past version of what Earth really is today, I mean we've got our own pyramids, and definitely some strange inhabitants as well (looking at you, Dennis Rodman). Now does this mean we're destined for some sort of strange planetary catastrophe? All out nuclear war because Russia and the US couldn't get along? Mars sure does look like a fallout planet, indeed.Fasten your seatbelts, friends.
The government has tried some really, really weird stuff over the years. It's almost comforting to know that every crazy angle has at least been looked at instead of being shut down. I'm sure there are plenty of things in modern science and technology that once sounded as baffling as using a psychic to find the history of mars.Yes, the CIA tried it, but that doesn't mean much of anything. 
Jesus fucking christ. I read the first part and thought that was sick enough; then I looked at the scrollbar. It's really fucking fucked up that he turned it into this every-day thing that happened so regularly he had to make a video for it. 
Did he actually let people go like he said in the transcript, or did he just murder them?
I read this about 6 months or so ago in a similar thread and still remember it vividly.DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU ARE PREPARED
Not sure which is more surprising - that they had such a plan or that they actually declassified such a plan.
I read somewhere that the German higher-ups didn't trust their low level workers and soldiers to carry out their orders against the jews thoroughly, so they made them fill out paperwork meticulously, thus that is the reason there is so much documentation of the holocaust. 
So did their parents just sign away their rights and leave?
Cropsy really shook me. The footage from the hospital is haunting
Never gave them penicillin for decades after it was discovered and known as the cure.
Largely for the same reason, if the US were to nuke Russia it would probably send more than 1 nuke.
I mean, doesn't everyone know that different police forces do this? There's literally a phrase for it: "agent provocateur".
What keeps them from using this tech to make desert places like California, Nevada etc get more rainfall in times of drought?
At its simplest level, "We won't kill your wives if you don't kill ours" is a very enticing proposition.
I think it's about control and target. You can control who you shoot with a gun, but a flood will kill innocent people and serve no purpose other than damaging the individual. The same logic applies to chemical weapons - they're indiscriminate and hard to control.
100mt was its max potential, what they detonated was 50mt
For some reason I love the idea of a nuclear powered rocket whose only attack ability is to fly all over the place at Mach 5 breaking shit with shockwaves.
The scientists who come up with these ideas give them appropriate names. Whether they're ever actually used is usually up to the MoD.
it was a direct cycle reactor. at the very, very, very least it spewed activated Oxygen (which is no fucking joke)
What was crazy to me was the scale. Usually when you hear about these cult communes it's like a handful of people - maybe 100 people if that. This was over 900 people. Over 900 people willingly took their lives for a crazy idea. They also murdered a congressman.
I think they'll reclassify it all.  It won't be declassified until everyone who remembers it is dead and it's of historical interest only.
What is it that's creepy about this? I'm confused. Just that it's fragments from the bullets that killed the president?
Imagine having to autopsy the President of the United States.
Russian pessimist says: "Things cannot possibly get worse." Russian optimist says: "Yes they can."
> "Not great."perhaps the largest understatement ever uttered by a member of the American armed forces. 
There was also a nuke accidentally dropped on Mars Bluff, SC back in 1958.
6,000 barrels of contaminated Spanish dirt were shipped to South Carolina for storage.  Amazing.
I'm starting to think they shouldn't be flying with these. 
Wait, so it could have been 200 times the size of fat man... fiddily fuck that shit RIGHT off.
From what I can gather nuclear bombs don't detonate by themselves. They need to be triggered. So it just disintigrated on ground impact.Meaning they are not impact sensitive. They get triggered.
And in Guatemala, they actually *infected* people, on a larger scale than Tuskegee, and lied to them about what they were doing. It's one of the most sickening atrocious in modern US history, IMO.
I was listening to Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy today and you reminded me of this. "It is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it... anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job". - Douglas Adams.

Lol:  > ...most machine gunners are trained to spot their fire on target by observation of strike. This will not do in assassination as the subject will not wait.
> They could NOT be seen adopting.So how do they explain not being visibly pregnant for months before their baby is born?
At the time this was written, 1983 if i read the article correctly, who was the potential threat for WW3? The Soviet Union?
You'd pretty much lose all sense of yourself and reality, I can't imagine going through that
"As the experimentation progressed, a point was reached where outsiders were drugged with no explanation whatsoever and surprise acid trips became something of an occupational hazard among CIA operatives."
So the UnaBomber left Harvard in 1969, and that report was published in 1976. I was too lazy to read it all, but did anyone read it and confirm the unabomber was a victim? That would be some next level shit. If anyone was wondering he's 74 and currently serving 8 life sentences if my Max Payne trivia is on par 
Just "The 4th Kind" and it is a very scary movie. 
Wow, just read through this. It's like they crammed quantum physics, cosmology, parapsychology and eastern philosophy into a blender. It reads more like the manifesto from some crazed serial killer than a government report. 
Seriously, what's the worst that could happen. Best case scenario you got a new superweapon of people who can look into the office of USSR secretary, realistic case scenario you wasted a time of a few interns
Some odd million years from now some space squid from Europa will be looking at a barren scorched Earth thinking. I wonder what happened there!
The most fucked up part? His "drug cocktail" to erase memory appeared to have worked. While trying to find victims, only two were found because others asked about it recognized tattoos on the women. When the women were approached they offered to talk to law enforcement but had no recollection of anything even remotely like that. Then the moment they heard the audio from the tape the memories came flooding back and they remembered everything.Last Podcast on the Left has a pretty good episode covering this.
Can you tell me what kind of things to expect? 
"What we're telling them to do is so bad, we don't expect people to do it. So instead of saying 'fuck that, no' we're gonna make them prove that they did it."
Good thing they didn't know about the SUNDIAL. 
It's absolutely not cost-effective
Let's agree not to kill each other's kids.Don't attack clinics or the medics, we both need to help our wounded.Long ago people would trade PoWs back and take breaks at night, in winter, or during holidays.The goal is to keep the battle contained and restrict suffering. Our soldiers fight yours, and if we get a win condition we stop. After all, we all had lives before this that we kind of don't want to be super shitty when we finish the fight.This only works when both sides agree though. 
Jesus fuck.The Sundial probably could've burnt and irradiated nearly everywhere on earth regardless of detonation area.Holy shit. The dude who designed didn't stop to think at all if he should do it.Why would anyone ever need a weapon that absurdly destructive, to the point you could irreperablly damage the earth and kill literally billions of people? That's just... Wrong.
A lot of them didn't do it willingly. There were guards forcing them to with guns.
Cant help but think people would point fingers at the soviets too. Nuclear war avoided.
Nope, but to be fair, I didn't spend a lot of time in the actual town.  There were three occasions when my family would go to Goldsboro:  Birthday dinners, movie nights (which were rare), and the county fair.  Usually for dinner we'd go to Ruby Tuesday or Outback, which were right off the highway, same as the theater and the fairgrounds.  I'm not sure where specifically that sign is, but I would assume it's downtown-ish.
Isn't there any ethics approval for experiments in US? WTActualF 
And Beeblebrox was perfect because he didn't care for governing. He made the people happy. That is until he stole The Heart of Gold. 
Or to quote Frank Herbert, author of Dune:    > All governments suffer a recurring problem: Power attracts pathological personalities. It is not that power corrupts but that it is magnetic to the corruptable.
Levels above OT8 have been "nearly available" for years (like, at least 30 years), but they have never been released.  Lately, instead of additional cash grabs by making new material above OT8, they've simply been releasing new versions of the low-level courses and requiring that people go back and take those again.  The number of people who actually go all the way up to OT8 is actually very very small. Even (most) famous Scientologists that you've heard of never make it that high.
and the less body thetans you have (through thorough and expensive cleansing of course) your Operating Thetan level goes up
My Tia Machi from the DR was born in jail for this exact reason, and was given every name her mother could think of that came from her/her husband's family line to make sure Machi could keep her identity even if her rebel parents didn't survive. Machi is her nickname, since she has around 10-15 names total. Her mom did make it out of jail, but her dad was killed. 
Yup, the Soviets. It was a serious consideration at the time.If you fancy having the shit scared out of you, go and have a watch of the BBC drama Threads (readily available online) which dates from that period and depicts exactly what would happen to one of England's biggest cities in the event of a war. I was born well after it was produced and well after nuclear war was even a possibility but it still scares the fuck out of me.
Thank you. Even though the content is very sad, its a beautiful speech.
but doesnt acid lose half the power of its dose if you use it the next day, for example if you do 100ug one day, and do the same amount the next day it would only feel like taking 50ug?
I've heard 4 life sentences, but yeah, this is what Wikipedia has to say; >As a Harvard undergraduate, Kaczynski was among twenty-two students who were research subjects in ethically questionable experiments conducted by psychology professor Henry Murray from late 1959 to early 1962.
Pretty good for 40 years ago. But I don't know if they really put google to shame.
The flashbacks of being terrified by this movie are coming back. 
> Then the moment they heard the audio from the tape the memories came flooding back and they remembered everything.This is fucking horrifying, I imagine that flood of information could near destroy your mind.
Torture, rape, dog rape, rape and torture with a nice touch of psychological torture
The Sundial blast would've been the size of Texas. The fallout and subsequent nuclear winter would have probably killed almost everyone on the planet.
However, if you wanted to blast something out in space, I could see some use for it.. 
There was a guy on NPR talking about Jones town. He said over half the people were either kids or elderly who would have had no way surviving in the jungle and would die either way. Basically the mos of the people had no real choice in the matter
Saying you'll shoot someone if they don't commit suicide with cyanide doesn't seem like a good threat.If I don't want to die I'd rather get shot and have a chance to survive that.
They killed the children first so that the adults would be more willing to die.
Smart of your grandma. I would assume they'd just give the kid a different name though (once they took her). 
I watched Threads once a couple years ago. Never again. I was on edge for days. It scared me so bad. The raw suffering it simulates it unbelievable and horrifyingly realistic. You can imagine all this happening to you in your own circumstances. I have no desire nor need to ever watch it again, it'll be sticking with me for a long time.
The worst part of that is the implication that the problem would be a technical one with the lander, leaving the astronauts alive and well, and in contact with NASA, but stranded. What would they do in that situation? Keep taking to them until their oxygen ran out? Let them speak to their families?
To further elaborate on the above. We aren't talking like a paragraph of extreme detail here.We are talking like a full on page or two about him and his buddies getting off on watching his dog rape the victim in more detail than you can be prepared for. I think the beastiality portion is what fucked me up and stuck with me all this time more than anything. But there isn't a "that's not so bad" part to any of the transcript  
Sounds silly but this would be the perfect defensive weapon. Don't attack us or we will detonate it and everyone loses. This was part of the plot of Dr. Strangelove. The Russians couldn't keep up with the us economic system so they built a weapon that would wipe out all life if a nuclear explosion went off in their territory. The problem is that once this weapon was built and the design known all it would take is some rogue state to say we all lose and boom. Game over planet earth. 
I had no idea this was in Guyana until you said jungle. I honestly thought this happened in the U.S. 
You should read up on Jim Jones, he was nuts near the end. Apparently he would give people Kool-Aid tell them it was poisoned as a test on a regular basis to see if they would drink it before he actually did this.
I read somewhere that procedure was that NASA would cut communications. Imagine that, being stranded on the moon, just you and one other person until you suffocated to death. Scary stuff.
> AFTER THE PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT, AT THE POINT WHEN NASA ENDS COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE MENRe-read the very last part of the comment you replied to.  Sounds like a lonely way to go.  I guess you have to be cold in situations with no hope.
Holy shit if that's true, I'd imagine they can read our thoughts from Langley by now. 
Not the same as a satellite but when I was in Afghan we would regularly be walked onto target by drones. The operators would say _10 metres left, 5 metres right_ or something and we'd still not see anything. Then they'd tell us to throw a grenade over a wall or whatever and boom, three Taliban fighters dead we had no idea about.
That was the philosophy of most of the arms race at a point. Dr. Strangelove wasn't just some goofy movie, but it was an analysis and criticism of the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction. 
Can't we just bluff? It's not like anyone's gonna say 'I don't believe your bomb is that big, prove it.' 
Is that where they came up with the fact that variations on 'Drinks the Kool-Aid' means being part of a cult?
The idea was to let them die in peace and with privacy, not broadcasting their every panicked word to everyone on Earth.
That's exactly the line that got me thinking. 
Honestly I see being cold as only justified in situations with hope.  If there's no hope and death is inevitable, you switch to comforting people and helping them die well.
if you think there's not at least one division working on that tech, you're out of your mind
Real life wallhacks
There is Mutually Assured Destruction and then there is Mutually Assured Destruction via SUICIDE BOMBING.
I think North Korea uses these sorts of bluffs. 
Which Kool-Aid execs have to be just thrilled about
As someone who works in a control environment I'd imagine it's also taking into account that listening in to them as they died would just break the comms guy and ruin his life...
The thing is, they were actually drinking Flavor Aid. It wasn't even Kool-Aid. So it's probably doubly annoying for Kool-aid execs.

If you on the shore, then you sure not me ohhhh
I'm a chef.Don't be a chef.
Currently I am doing environmental work- I survey birds. I walk about 12 miles a day and see some beautiful sites.
I'm a cobbler. I fix shoes, cut keys, engrave dog tags wedding rings, hell I'll engrave your poop if you want me to. I chose my vocation because, well they had a vacancy and I needed a job. But now I love it.
Well, it's not exciting, but I'm an Audiologist and never had to worry about finding work. Also have worked in 3 countries (so far). 
Speech-Language Pathologist. I personally work in an elementary school, but in the field you can work with people from birth through old age with a HUGE variety of disorders: articulation, language, stroke, swallowing, autism, traumatic brain injury, fluency, voice, and lot more! Or you can go into research. It's such a huge field that you'll definitely find a niche you love, and speech pathologists are hard to find these days, so you'll definitely find a job. 
I own an ice cream shop and leave work everyday covered in chocolate and caramel. It's a pretty sweet job.
I'm a CPA working in public practice at a regional firm. I do a little bit of everything on the client service side - audit, tax, process consulting, etc. Would love to chat. 
I am a Registered Nurse.I got into the field quite accidentally, when I started nannying for a family whose daughter had prematurity-related health problems and a feeding tube. I had to learn CPR, and give crushed medications, and it was a natural progression.I have spent 2 years in Cardiac, 3 years in Postpartum(Mom/Baby) and a year in Labor&Delivery. It is beyond fantastic.

Any redditors with a career in politics... but not as a politician? I am 2 years into my BA in PoliSci and very interested in a career as a political analyst, but have yet to come across someone with inside experience.
I'm a graduate student. Turn back now
I'm a full time baseball umpire. I mostly work high school or adult league games. I'll sometimes work a semi-pro game. I got into it because I was able to start at 13 doing little league games and a paying job at 13 is something any kid will take.
I process the backroom of a TJ Maxx. My best piece of advice? Don't work for TJ Maxx.
I am a network engineer for ATT mobility. I chose the mobility field because I saw handheld computing as a solid industry that isn't going anywhere. 
I am a lawyer. AMAA. 
I make gaming-themed YouTube videos (mostly Minecraft) for a living, and do some speedrun livestreaming on the side.I have an abnormal love for Minecraft which makes the job a pleasure most of the time, and I love the freedom of self-employment. However, it's more of a job than a lot of people would assume. Obviously it's not something easy to get into, but I can still answer some questions if people have them.
Unemployed. It's great but the pay sucks
I'm a psychology researcher with plans to study to become a therapist after my social psychology PhD. I also volunteer as a crisis counsellor and earn money on the side by working as a research assistant for a professor at my university. I get paid to learn about things I find fascinating and fucking love it. AMAA?
I work in the film industry! :)
Active duty Navy here.I have training in a few different specialties, but my primary job is dental assisting. Didn't really choose it, the navy was just more or less trying to fill a quota when they stuck me with the job. Assisting dentists all day isn't half bad. It's the military aspect of it all that can be debilitating sometimes. But I've been a few places, seen some cool things, and met very awesome people. Plus, it's steady income.
I thought job fairs were for companies looking to hire
I get pissed on every morning for $300 AMA
I love cookingI worked at a busy family run restaurantI hate cooking
I like eating though, so I salute you. 
I'm a line cook. Get my ass kicked daily to the point of pure rage. I guess I love it since I don't see myself doing anything else.
I am a chef... and i love it. 
Do they save money with transfers by delivering them with the mail?

How stressful is the job truely?
Have you heard of Google Ultron?
92-94%? I always thought only about 4 or 5% of the sea bed has been explored
Sounds like very hard work, do you do this by yourself or do you have people that help you?
how on earth do you get this job? Did you go to school? how hard of a job is it to land?
How are things going with youtube?
Is it a well-known chain that you frost for? And was it an entry position, or did you have to work your way through to the people-free position?
I used to work at Dunkin Donuts. Had to wake up at 3 in the morning and had a 4-12 morning shift. I always had a great time spreading chocolate on the donuts and making creative designs on it. It really is more fun then you'd think.
Do you get to bring any free doughnuts home at the end of the day? Free or not, I'm fairly certain that I would be extremely obese if I had your job. Doughnuts are my weakness. 
Do you ever eat the frosting whole? I love that stuff. 
Is that a good wage where you live? That's a bit below minimum where I am so just curious.
> If you don't have a CS degree, don't worry, you probably won't ever be in one of those areas. One of our team leads is a Ph.D in Mathematics, and the other had degrees in Theology and Philosophy.  They were also older though, so I don't know if CS was as big of a field back then.  All of the younger people whose majors I know went through CS, though.
I am a fresh new front-end web developer who just worked his first day at a full time agency! What advice would you give a new web developer like myself just getting into the field? Anything you wish you learned when you were at my point? Anything that is a necessity to know about the industry?
As an 18 year old who has a month to decide what I should do with my life: should I go to college?

What kind of lawyer are you? is being a lawyer as boring as people make it out to be?
Heard a story about an underwater welder using a warm water circulation in his suit when it sucked a jelly fish into it and he got stung 100 plus times, does that worry you?
sweet! how did you get interested in something like that? have you had an affinity for water all your life? or machinery?
Im not familliar with that, what is an underwater welder?
So were you like a computer science or engineer major before youtube? You seem to know a lot about coding and circuits.
Have you ever had problems with friends or family acting like you've never done (what they perceive as) "a hard day's work"?
wow, just checked out your channel, very impressive, over 1.000.000 subs is pretty amazing.I don't really have any specific questions about youtube or gaming, but rather the selfemployment.Would love if you could describe how much you work dayli, how your friends feel about you being self employed and just in general how your life is different from others.Would really appreciate it, if you took the time to answer! :)
What does a normal day of work looks like? Also how much do you make?

Job fair can't be complete without the armed forces :)  where's the telemarketer guy?
Hi,Joining the military has always been on my mind but mostly if i couldnt find anything else. Mainly becouse i heard it is a really good place for building character. How is life in the navy. are you stuck on a ship or a base or can you go home at the end of the day?
Yeah upvoting since this seems like a really great idea and I can gain insight on jobs I am considering
I love cooking, always considered myself good at it, and that's exactly why I never ever want to do it for a living.
I worked as a server at a restaurant before I started at USPS. So I went from getting little to no respect, to everyone I walk by smiling and saying hello! It's crazy! People really like their mailman!
It's really not that hard at all, that's the problem.
Funny thing is when people take the link to be both ways. As a locksmith, I lost count of the times I was asked to reattach a heel or something. Sorry ma'am, I'm aware that shoe repairers cut keys, I can't fault your logic, but I can't fix your shoe.
Both involves cutting metal. And back in the way long day copying a key means you had to cut the pattern by hand which means you had to be skilled. Not the key machine they have now. 
"Works on my machine"
Exactly this! I'm currently working a fairly complicated page with lots of graphs and charts, and it works perfect in Chrome and Firefox. IE outright crashes before I can hit F12 to open the debugger. I hate Internet Explorer. It is probably the single most annoying part of my job. (I'm a web developer/software developer.)
It's not that bad to be a starving artist. :)I went to school for creative writing. After I graduated I worked as an editorial assistant for a magazine, but found out reaaaally damn fast that I'm not cut out for a 9-5 office job. I finished the first draft of my first novel two weeks ago. I nanny part-time and am definitely poor (though not starving, since I eat all their food!), but it's worth it to have the free time and brain energy for my book! 
I have a half eaten bag of m&m's and some flour I spilt on my kitchen counter a week ago. I'll supply you with raw material.

As soon as you start talking. Its not nine, its niner etc.like when you write strips you underline your S's, and slash Z's.Also you have to say everything correctly, if i said remain clear of class bravo airspace instead of remain outside, i can get fired. The pilot may only hear what he wants to hear and think "oh hey cleared into class Bravo" then when he goes into it and causes a problem, it comes back to me.

Hehe, yes. brb, downloading Adobe Reader.
I had all 3 but the connections are what nabbed me the job. I suspect without experience and education my resume might have been ignored. I know some peers who are more gifted than I am, who are struggling because they are less well-connected.Right now I am working on a celebrity biography show (boring) that pays the company bills and a time travel show (AWESOME) both of which will be airing this summer. If people like em our itty-bitty company may get an itty-bit bigger.
Great edit. You'd make a fantastic editor. 
It's a well-known chain, yea. I was hired on as a "production baker" after years of fast food experience with other chains.
Not all jobs need college.  Nobody can answer that question until you know what you're gonna do.College is expensive, but very rewarding and can lead you to a great career that pays well.  You have to decide for yourself -- is it worth it?
Lineman are professionals who build, maintain, upgrade distribution (sub 34kV) and high voltage transmission (up to 765kV) in the states. They are some crazy but very skilled individuals. Source: I'm a transmission line engineer.

Mods can't verify if information is actually yours. Even if you say "My name is John Smith and my phone number is 555-example-555", it **could** be true but how can we know?
Criminal. It is, actually, more boring than people make it out to be. At least until you step into court to argue your case. 
And from that day on, /u/SkittlesMacGee decided against pursuing his dreams, and picked up an office job in the city.
Yeah, but then again where's the excitement without some danger?In all honesty I'm not too worried.  Chances of that happening are fairly low.
Not OP, but pretty much exactly what it sounds like. Someone that welds while diving. It requires licenses that take time and money to earn, but can prove to be profitable if you are willing to put in the time. It is still a manual labor job, so you will need to consider how long you can do it for. Finding the right contracts can be very lucrative with people allegedly earning a six figure salary in USD.
Yep, I have a degree in computer science from one of the top colleges in the United States, and I worked as a software engineer for Microsoft before doing youtube full time.
Actually, ElementAnimation did the animation for those videos, so I'm sorry to say that I don't have any good advice for you. Best of luck, though.
I'd say I work roughly 40 hours a week, though it varies. I'm working a bit more now that I'm live streaming several times per week. I work a lot on the weekends.My friends generally are very interested in my job, its much easier to relate to the minutiae of my job than a normal desk job. I also get a fair number of video ideas from my friends, and they like that sort of limited involvement.
Really more of a marsh, honestly.  
There are three* general fields: prep, production, and post-production. *maybe also marketing and distribution...    I work in production, where the actual shooting gets done. Specifically, I work as a grip: sort of lighting and rigging and support department. and yes, all aspects of the industry are pretty stressful. But usually quite rewarding. 
Luckily for me, I'm not on ship. I'm on a military installation and I do get to go home after the work day.
good god I can't believe that was 2 fucking years ago...I think I need to go outside more. 
The phrase: "If you love what you do, you never have to work a day in your life." is total bull shit in my opinion. Never ever turn your hobby into your job. Just accept that work sucks and that you need to sell some of your life to make other parts better.
 As a drummer that sits next to amps all day, everyone tells me to protect my ears, but I don't hear them.

So I shouldn't go into communications/disorders right away? Psychology/sociology would be a better choice? I'm not really one for working with kids but I'm fascinated by all the disorders people can have and I want to be able to help people, perhaps I'd like to be a researcher more. Thank you so much!

I went to school for creative writing, too. I'm currently a bartender at a major chain resturaunt... 
Kickstarter here we come. 
I wouldn't last 10 minutes.
Now you say you Reddit all day unless you start a project. What kinds of projects do you work on? I'm currently on my way through school to hopefully do the same type of deal when I get out. 
I know this may sound a little stupid, but how does one get 'connections'? Is it purely luck in knowing the right people or did you actively seek them out?
I can't even see the asterisk. It really feels like part of the original comment. Very well crafted.
Professional timbit maker?
I didn't like welding in the rain. I couldn't imagine welding in the water. Especially in water with salinity.   
Yeah, most underwater welders dont last long though, usually 7-10 years before their body can't keep up with the pressure. That's why the pay is so high
If the views ever stopped coming in would you go back to working as a software engineer, or try to stay in the video game world? Also, I love your videos! Good luck in UHC! 
Doesnt it ruin movies for you if you see how everything gets done?
What kind of jobs are available in the navy and what can i expect in your line of work?
Life is stupid like that because you've made your life work, eat, computer games, sleep. Life is what you make it.
It's Okay,  It's only 18 months.  I had the same freak out..  It's from December 2012, not two years.. ^ this guy and his exaggerations.
I graduated with a creative writing degree. I moved to taiwan. I spend 14 hours a week teaching English and all my insane amount of free time reading and writing. I still make enough money that I literally don't know what to do with it. I save 1k usd every month. Its just sitting in my bank account cause its so cheap to live here. 
If you weren't trained sure.
The way he abbreviates "you would" is extremely forward thinking. OP loves to be efficient, definitely would hire. 
No timbits, just munchkins!
If anything, it makes you appreciate the good movies even more since you understand how much hard work went into them. 
I can barely spit out a drive through order for a coffee I get every morning. That combined with my lack of attention span, and destructive curiosity, I definitely would be fired within 10 minutes. 
Jimmies or sprinkles? Coming from a professional doughnut maker, you should know best of all. 
You should be a mechanic, I am and I have a hard time pronouncing my name some mornings. I ruined a "defective" fuel pump because I wanted to see how much distance and pressure I could shoot water across the shop. Got bored a few days ago and was curious to weather or not anybody fucked with my tool box so I wired roughly 120vs to that bitch and went to lunch.  He doesn't mess with my toolbox and I feel bad because the porter got involved and she's such a sweet girl. She hasn't talked to me in 2 days now and throws my tickets at me
The boxes say "sprinkles" but my family is from New England, where they're called jimmies. I'm so conflicted!
My dad says jimmies. The way I see it, if they're just chocolate, they're jimmies. If it's rainbow or any other kind, they're sprinkles. 
Use a piece of the answer in quotes as your query.
Add "forum" to the search. This will bring up people who are writing about the problem or issue you are searching for of just about any product out there.
Putting a / between first and last name for a person will search for the names together E.g, searching John Smith Podiatrist will give you podiatrists with both the names like John Wilson or Fred Smith, Searching John/Smith will only bring up John Smiths Hope this helps :) 
Use *site: reddit.com* and *filetype:gif*
Use as few words as possible
Three words: GOOGLE. ADVANCED. SEARCH.You can find pages with an exact phrase, omit certain words, look up numbers, file types, and all on the domain it's on. Seriously, you don't even need to be good at phrasing things, just put in what you need and you'll probably end up finding it.
Google stuff the old way. Search for the potential title of the article that would have the information you need, rather than just asking a question.Search for "Cherries bad for dogs" vs "can my dog eat cherries?"Doing this helps you find the answers, not just more people with the same question.
Add "Reddit" to the end of the search and there's most likely a thread about whatever you're looking for
Use incognito mode in your browser for the "scientific" queries.
Key words only. Don't ask full questions, just enter the main words. Good tip is to keep it as concise as possible
#1 Protip of all time* Dont be lazy, just do the search. 
Haven't tried it in awhile but i remember being able to change my user agent to googlebot and browse gated forums that way. There are Chrome add ons to do this. 
Oh wow, I'm a fan of that AROUND() function
google got rid of the + operator, so now you have to put " around single words or use search tools->results->verbatim
How do you stop Google from searching for synonyms? Many times I'm searching for a word relevant to a particular context where the synonym is not relevant
Be aware that there are strict caps on the <number>..<number> syntax that can get you IP-banned from using google for short periods of time pretty quickly
you can also filter by site. for example>google analytics site:reddit.com
To filter out words use -, I think you can filter out whole websites as well using -inurl:.
Aside from quoting and exclusion, I find most of the fancy search features unnecessary if your queries are reasonably specific (ie not things like "problem with ms word") 
When I'm searching about something, I often click the Reddit link as well. Reading the comments often gives me a bunch of useful info or links from other redditors.
-pinterest saves your dang life
Just a warning: it's common for bots to use these, so getting too fancy with filters (allinurl:"URL", etc.) will get you flagged as a bot.
Didn't Google start ignoring literal string / exact match quotes a few years ago?
Or add "Reddit" to the search
What's the difference between using "John Smith" and John/Smith?
That Miley search is oddly specific 
You used to be able to get into directory levels and download mp3's like this. Haven't tried in a while. 
You can tell how much internet experience someone has by the way they phrase their searches. 
I think you mean "Eliminate unnecessary words."
Hmmm...I want to find a place to simulate being at the bottom of an underground condition, where the temperatures will be high, the light will be virtually nonexistent, and the air will have high humidity. "hot, dark, moist"
Maybe I'm lucky but being especially descriptive seems to help me. I'm sure it depends on the topic but searching a complete phrase works well for me. For car problems it will often take you to a forum specific your car and someone who experienced the same problem.
I find the exact opposite is useful. Sometimes I just make a word salad of several words pertaining to what I'm looking for. The Trick to this is using the right words. A proof of this is google's uncanny ability to find movies or songs based on obscure descriptions.
This and never word for word phrases unless your looking for a specific passage
I had success with "what was the name of that satellite with the gold disk launched way back when"
pale curvy teen tattoos
Google advanced search works if you're trying to sift through a tonne of things that are close to your search but not exactly. My problem is that my searches turn up nothing anyway so advanced search narrows 10 useless responses to 0 responses
True, but this can also bring up biased information. Check the inverse search too, if possible
The old way? I don't understand. Are you saying the Ask Jeeves method is now the most common way people are searching? 
"Cherries for dogs" will do also
>you don't really ask the search engine a questionJeeves would be disappointed by how far we've fallen
Except googles algorithm has been modified so that you can literally ask it a question and get the same results
In my experience, if I think it's a super common problem I actually ask google the question as I figure thousands of others probably have as well. Usually the easiest to read/follow instructions are the top results when I do this too
How does boolean fall into this? 
That's how I found Reddit in the first place. After multiple google searches to my questions I would keep ending up here. So then I started always added Reddit to the end. Couple years later made an account.  Now I'm on here every day.
Actually they got rid of the "+" operator.  I really...REALLY miss it.
Right click on the gray screen that gets displayed over the site and select inspect. The when it highlights the code for you go up a level or two and hit delete and that changes your cached copy which will not render what's called a "modo". Because it's cache it will come back when the timer in the files tells google to pull a new copy. The same goes for page blocking ads that won't go away.
This might be too specific of a question but I was trying to figure out something similar to this a few days ago.  Would that work for a website that has overlays to blur things out? For example, if you wanted to see the answer to a question on Chegg thats partially blurred out?
What are gated forums if I may ask?
Huh. Wonder why this thread was axed.
I loved Around (I don't remember the syntax) from Nexis searches. I have been missing it for decades not knowing it was available in Google 
Thanks, this had bugged me lately, but not enough to Google the solution. Which is totally embarrassing in retrospect. 
For 'actual verbatim' you need the undocumented triple quotes """like this""". I use it so often I made a global hotkey to easily surround my queries with triple quotes.
That is the first I'm hearing of this. When did this happen? I have the olds. 
I would put just that word in quotes. 
Years ago you used to be able to use this syntax to search for valid credit card numbers (e.g. 4000000000000000..4999999999999999), of which there were a jaw dropping number posted online, not even by scammers or whatever, more like small businesses not knowing the difference between intranet and internet site... I think Google censors those results now.
Why's that? I use this routinely to get up-to-date results for computer issues. The missing expiry date for information is a growing problem. Why should Google be concerned about "issue 2016..2017", but not "issue"?Isn't this just one search with even stricter criteria?
This is the only good way to search redditNow if only it didn't link to shitty fucking mobile versions
I trust Reddit more than many other sites. I can read a bunch of different opinions and be sure that I'm not being misinformed by a biased source.
Seriously, pinterest in image results is fucking cancer.
oh so that's why i enter captcha so ofteni can't leave google now
I do this primarily because every single website I find on a given topic is either loaded with garbage intrusive ads that block my whole screen, is segmented into ten pages, or flat out crashes my mobile browser. Reddit threads on the other hand are almost always buttery smooth.
Google treats the slash (and lots of other punctuation) as basically any word delimiter, so `John/Smith` becomes `John[non-word character]Smith`. Since it has no spaces, then Google will not separate the terms and search them as a unit. The difference between that and `"John Smith"` is that `John/Smith` should return any of:* John-Smith* John/Smith* John.Smith* John Smith* etc.
Dear Google, what's that thing where the guy does the stuff with his hand, and then the girl gets that thing that smells bad? Thank you, from Doris.
I dunno, I consider myself fairly experienced, and I sometimes just literally type a question I have into google. The results tend to be forums where others have posted the same question.
Oh, you need a pressurized cement consistometer
As someone who doesn't get the reference, just searching "dank" would yield proper results if it wasn't for meme culture. 
The more words you use, the more of those words need to be in your ideal search result. Similarly, Google has an easier time mapping synonyms and similar words to those chosen if the string is shorter.*That said*, if your query is very close to what you're actually looking for, this isn't a bad way to go.
This is easier if it's a common problem many people have asked questions to.If say, you're trying to open an obscure or old program and you get a 3DGlobe.wrf error or some shit, then it's important you only google 3DGlobe.wrf and hope for the best
If youjust searched "satellite with gold disk" you get similair results. Depending on what youre looking for too much filler words can make it harder to find things.
I too had great results this way! Google knew the movie I meant when I put 'movie about kid who sells drugs in high school'. 
I just caught myself wondering what the fuck pale, curvy tattoos were and why they're specific to teens.
Absolutely. For instance, searching "vaccines cause autism"... 
Sadly after years of watching people use search engines I would say minimum 75%+ of people ask questions. 
Honestly just 'dog cherries' would be fine
Returned results for:Jeeves disappointed we've fallen
Actually probably optimized for this behavior 
Probably because all the old people do this

I tried that, well I tried removing the overlays and it appears that they are just images being blurred. It could work, but I don't know. 
Forums that u need a login to read the content.
- "obama" AROUND(74) "australia" - 69 900 000 results- "obama" AROUND(75) "australia" - 69 700 000 resultsThat's not a typo, the thing is broken.What's funny is that *"obama" AROUND(10) "australia"* was one of the auto-complete suggestion when I typed *"obama" AROU*
I got 95,300,000 and 95,500,000 respectively.
Teaching people about the + made me feel like a genius when I was in high school sad it's gone
What's the difference between single and triple quotes?
When they started Google Plus. I think they want(ed) to dedicate the + sign to search for user handles. 
Problem is these days it thinks it's smarter than you and sometimes searches synonyms even then.
I tried it a little while ago to search for products with UPC numbers registered to certain companies (within certain GS1 company prefix ranges) and discovered the cap. 
Because you're basically performing hundreds or thousands of searches at once if you extend the number range too much. So this would be an easy way for bots or humans to abuse google and overload their servers.
-site:i.reddit.com will exclude mobile pages.
Even worse is googling something on mobile and the damn google amp page opens instead of the reddit page. 
Honestly, this site can be a gold mine at times but the search function here is garbage. So half the time I need to google something I add "reddit" at the end lol.
Reddit can be very biased. Techical solutions are pretty trust worthy but I wouldn't take anything upvoted on reddit at face value.
Just when you think you found something cool, you have to make an account 
I used to do this all the time around 2002 or so, it was the easiest way to get mp3s (way faster than Kazaa etc). Every so often I check it out again for shits and giggles, but all I see are fake sites and DMCA notices.

that illustrates your point well, though I've often found when I google that it's overwhelmingly about how trustworthy vaccines are.
Interestingly enough, that query will give you:- A bunch of sites stating that vaccines *do not* cause autosm (including the CDC).- An article on Trump's stance that vaccines *do* cause autism.Pretty amazing three-word search: both the truth and the context that fuels the bullshit.
Autisms cause vaccine?
I don't know why you regard that as sad. Depending on what you're looking for, typing a question is frequently a good way to turn up a result of someone asking the exact same question in a forum somewhere, followed immediately by the answer. This is particularly true with common software. You being the first person anywhere to have a particular problem with Excel is like winning the lottery - not fuckin likely.
Asking questions can actually work out great many times. 
Yep, in a presentation a few months ago from a guy at Google, he told us they are trying to make it answer questions that are in natural language... Which obviously is not helped by people who type only keywords (like me) because they don't trust it lol. He was working in a team that makes some back end stuff about understanding natural language better, which helps with all Google products like search, translate, etc.
I'm confused.
Yeah I do but those are no replacement.  The "+" operator forced the results to contain a certain term.  For example "+adidas running shoes" would return results that ALWAYS had the term adidas.  It was great.
So the gold subreddit 
You're right, I don't think that search would work. OP's mom would be on both sides of the house.
Yup, may be that's why it is "undocumented"!
I got 2 and 2 respectively. WTF is going on?
I get 743000 results for the 74 one... 
No wonder I was having so much trouble last week.  Why the hell did they remove it? 
Damn, what will happen when they launch Google Colon in 2018
God damn I hate it when it thinks its smarter than me. The other thing is when it takes the one key term *out* because it found way more results with that term missing... except I was *trying* to narrow down the search to the small subset of manageable results, not wade through 100,000 unhelpfully broad ones!

Google scholar puts this argument to rest. You can literally search "thimerosal" and read the abstracts of the top cited papers.You don't even have to understand the study, abstracts are often written in plain English and are easy to digest.

"ananas" is the word for pineapple in a few languages, it's not a plural of "anana".
Correct me if I'm wrong, but "or" actually meansX or Y, or both.

me too.  Since my name is fairly unique, searching for the issue is easier if I knew I had done this before.  I post my answers unbidden on usenet groups
It's no joke! There's a lot of active research into sub-Coulombic inductance coils. Apparently they could have applications in electric cars, Hyperloop projects, and Cranford C-beams. 
A hammock of cake?
Or most things they do. Here's a laptop! But you can't take it out of the house as it needs data to work. No it doesn't have data capability haha
that's too gay dude
Your name is not as unique as you think it is ;)
My buddy did his PhD on Cranford C-beams. Their paradoxical change in structural strength compares to withstanding deep oceanic pressures when the forces are applied perpendicularly, where only the hypercrust plating was applicable in the tangent corners. The sub-Coulombic inductance coils could funnel out the weak energy so only the forces necessary to maintaining integrity of the C-beam and increasing its resistance/kg property remain within the structure.
I think this may be something more serious/different than what most the Redditors up til now have said!The commanders of the special forces don't support those in the coup. Which means not all the military is joining in.  This could get much uglier than a "return to secularism" that many are advocating, especially if the military is split on its support.
I don't know much about Turkish politics but apparently the Turkish military has a standing order to overthrow the government if it becomes too Islamic.
Pro Tip: Don't trust partial video clips claiming one side wiping out another.  This PR tactic was used to great effect during the Libya civil war as well as during the Venezuela coup against Chavez with very little editing needed.  Took a long time to get uncut versions of videos that gave you context.
"There are decades when nothing happens. There are weeks where decades happen"-Vladimir Lenin
I love CNN's live stream"The coup is over""Soldiers entering CNN's studios in Turkey, it may not be that clear cut"
Urges his supporters to go on the streets and fight, while he's safely on a plane and seeking asylum in Germany. Typical Erdogan.
Welp, he's saying he's going to neuter the military.  Welcome to authoritarian goverment, Turkey.
Asylum in Germany for Erdogan?Fuck off you moron and don't come here. I prefer you rotting in a cell. 
While principally not a fan of coup d'etats, it's been increasingly hard to not kinda want one in Turkey. Though that feels awful to say. I hope it'll pass as bloodless as possible and cool heads will soon prevail.
Erdogan calling people to the streets, wow what an absolute mongoloid. There are tanks and helicopters out there. The civilians are fine where they are.
For those wishing Erdogan would be a little less authoritarian, I don't think this will end well. When Turkey gained its independence, Mustafa Ataturk viewed the military as a way to keep the politicians in check, and that seems to be the basis for what happened tonight. Some in the military must have felt that Erdogan was overstepping his bounds, becoming too authoritarian and too sectarian for what was demanded of him, and so in response, I expect Erdogan to come down with an iron fist and be even more authoritarian than ever. 
Has the Coup really been repelled or is it propaganda? 
If this coup fails, any hope for a secular Turkey is completely thrown out the window. Another batshit crazy dictatorship run by laws from the dark ages. Way to respect Ataturk. The man would spit on what Turkey has become
Gulen this, Gulen that, cleanse this and that. Erdogan has become delusional, paranoid, and worst of all, dangerous. Turkey is in a 100x worse position now compared to 24 hours ago.
Why does nearly every "Hey, Turkish guy from Istanbul here, coup failed!" comment come from new accounts?  
So Erdogan is denied re-entry at Istanbul, denied refuge in Germany, asks UK, then turns around and hovers south for a couple of hours, then zooms right into Istanbul in the face of a millitary coup and starts talking trash about the millitary?  Something doesn't add up
So is this like when the Jedi try to arrest Palpatine and fail, and through that event he gains the sympathy of the Senate and consolidates his power to create the glactic empire? 
This whole thing looks more and more like a deadly ruse. Erdogan is flying into the airport, how could he do that if he had any uncertainty on whether he'd be shot down or taken prisoner. He'll land and look like a fearless conquerer. This is too real to be a game, but it's too silly to not be one... 
Idk why people are saying this is over, it does not look that way. I am still seeing new video of gunfire and smoke coming from Ankara.
Sky News have just inadvertently aired civilians being gunned down on the bridge 
Is no one else actually looking at the live thread?  The coup is failing.  Everybody saying this is good, it isn't.  If this fails, Turkey will truly be fucked.
So glad I was not born nor live in Middle Eastern countries.
So ultimately, Erdogan won't mind the results of this night that much, huh? He's still in power, and he can use these events to effectively place himself into a position of full dictatorship, if he wasn't there already. I imagine he'll go full Stalin on his army for a while. I guess ultimately, everybody loses. The army loses, Turkey loses, the world loses. It would almost seem like this will end Turkey's long tradition of the military stepping in to fix when yet another government fucks over the country. 
Reichstag fire.
Askreddit again with the breaking news.  I guess /news is pretty much irrelevant now.
Turkey is part of NATO, will this require other NATO countries to protect the 'current' government by taking actions against the military group?
Turks have betrayed Ata Turk. Turks have backed an Islamic government over what the father of Turks had laid the ground works for. Turks who have the most freedom out of any Muslim nation, have spoken loud and clear. They do not want secular governments anymore. 
It's military v. Military v. Police v. Public support for coup v. Public support for erdogan. Then you've also got the Kurds...many against the coup, some I presume will see this an opportunity for advancing their own political aims, etc etc. What a complete mess.
As is tradition
The government doesn't control the military?
They're the ones throwing the coup, not overthrowing it but yes it's a bit of a tradition over there. 
This is my take. Erdogan ratcheting up control. The opposition all disavowed this coup, likely because they reached the conclusion that it was a setup, and I think they're still liable to be rounded up anyway.Erdogan wanted a huge crowd at the airport so he can land, make a triumphant speech and then declare some marshal law himself. Next it'll be President for Life Erdogan, placing the military firmly under his control followed by a purge, and a rewrite of the Constitution.
Are you saying this is a fake coup?  Not being sarcastic, seriously interested.
Fake coup then? 
Having been to Turkey, seen the jewel of Istanbul and met so many kind and friendly people there, I'm truly sorry for what's happening to your country. Take solace in the fact that tyranny cannot last forever. 
Is the coup still going on, or has it died down?
Thanks for writing that. As an American who doesn't like Erdogan, I'm disappointed that the military is losing/this might have been a fake coup so the bastard can further expand islamist bullshit. 
>All international agreements are still valid. We hope that all of our good relationships with all countries will continue. Knowing the military's purpose in Turkey, it sounds like they've still got their heads straight. Pretty interesting structure of government.
Dang I didn't know you could use a puppy filter while facetiming
Erdogan started creating a way too islamic government. Turkish military has quite a tradition in overthrowing governments to get back to democracy. 
The Turkish military has a long history of removing Islamists from power with coups, this is another go at it
I feel like this summarizes 2016 so far.
RIP Harambe
These past few years have proven why "may you live in interesting times," is a curse and not a blessing. 
I am the walrus?
Only if the coup succeeds 
What a slimy, spineless little shit. 
Urging them to take to the streets and fight *people who have fucking tanks and attack helicopters*. Nothing says "I love my people" like asking them to go aggravate guys piloting 50-ton murdermachines while you desperately flee the country on a private jet.
Yeah, it didn't really last long and now he can put forward more extreme laws and reduce the power of the military who's only job since the foundation of the country was to make sure it stayed secular
Request for asylum was denied by Germany, haha. 
Wow. Theory number 2- Erdogan = literally Darth Sidious
"We are hearing that a coup is occurring in the democratically elected Turkey, the military wants to out democratically elected leader Erdogan, who was democratically elected" -CNN  
Calls people to the streets, flees instead of helping. Lmfao
Last resort definitely. Last I heard he's going to try to get asylum in Germany
This is a coherent and sensible analysis. The clumsiness of the coup suggests gross incompetence or an ulterior motive.
Yeah, I'm on holidays in Turkey right now. This really scared me, because I've never been in a similar situation. I don't know much of politics, but I hope nothing bad will happen.
Germany told Erodogan to fuck off. He's done for. It's well known he's an asshole, so the only countries to give him asylum would be Sunni Muslim countries, and I highly doubt anyone wants to do that.
exactly,now erdocunt is asking to snitch on internet coup supporters so he can hang them all as traitors.yeah thats democracy bitchez.
The is not required by the North Atlantic Treaty
Why are the Kurds against the coup, I thought they didn't like Erdogan?
Relevant username
"The president now urinates on a bucket of fish heads while the army marches in hexameter. It's a glorious day for Turkey and therefore the world."
Correct, Turkey is one of the few nations where the military is a separate entity. They were built and designed by Ataturk to make sure Turkey never turns to Islam.I don't think this is the first time they've done this, too.
That's pretty bizarre, but hey if it's stupid but it works it's not stupid. 
Or some more eager faction of the military got swindled they had more support and to go for it and are now used as scapegoats. 
Well, tyranny lasts for as long as people refuse to stand up to it. Every nation so far has shockingly, subtlety backed ergodan tonight...
As an American who knew nothing about him until an hour ago he sounds like a total douche. 
Many of the old military and police leaders have been replaced throughout the years by the current president with people who are loyal to him. It was really only a matter of time before either the people or military took back control.This coup seems more like a cleanup of all the shit that Erdogan has been putting in place. Hopefully there are no casualties and new leader can be elected.
Turkey's military also is very trusted by the general people which makes things smoother
He backed the democratically elected government, he didn't mention Erdogan by name.
It's a snapchat of a TV of a facetime.
That's the second most important thing a military should be doing. All enemy's both foreign and domestic. 
What I've read is that people really like the military and support them when they overthrow.You would then think that the people would then elect people who would please the military.Yet, obviously not. Why?
2016's Franz Ferdinand.
Shut the fuck up, Donnie
The winners write the memes
Don't worry, Germany told him to fuck off I think.
Wonder where he's gonna try next. Russia? Greece? France? Of course, none of them are gonna take him. Especially not France, because Erodogan has taken a very weak stance on fighting Daesh, who has done way too much damage to France. 
Believe it or not that's a strong argument here. And considering Erdogan's supporters don't even hesitate to call for our death(infidels) even in peace, the guy is seen as the evil-found-body by the more educated population.Don't mistake, Erdogan's voterbase is unarmed ISIS. 
Just do as you're told for now and come back with great stories for the grandkids one day. 
Are you presently there?
Germany rejected him, now's he's looking to the UK
The Turks there would lynch him, that's a bad idea.
If you're on holiday in the country, I suggest you contact your embassy in the country (if you have one) and ask what they advise you to do.
Military has done worse to Kurds through our history than Erdogan even including recent events. For decades when military coups were happening on the west side of Turkey military was for the lack of better term killing and pillaging east Kurd villages with no oversight or care.
Well not necessarily stopping turning back to Islam but more to stop any straying from secularity.
I don't know anything about Turkish politics or political/governmental structure. This is pretty fascinating. So in theory at least, their military is like a government watchdog? Only with constitutional power to take action?
Ataturk is my hero. I wish someone like him came to power in Iran too instead of a fucking Mulla.
I had a Simpsons level flip-flop.  "Oh a coup, that's bad." "Oh the people leading the Coup aren't doing too good, that's good." "Oh, the leader of Turkey is an Islamist with an agenda, that's bad." "Oh, the people leading the coup support democracy, that's good!". "President Obama just backed the government instead of the military, that's..."  "It's bad."
German government was even more vague: "The democratic order in Turkey must be respected."
What a time to be alive.
Isn't this the man who wanted to imprison a journalist for comparing him to Smeagol on the Internet? 
How did he get elected by a majority? Were his aims unclear prior to his election?
It is, but the dangerous bit comes in deciding who is the enemy and who is not.
Secularists in major cities like the millitary more than edrogen and his Islamist party. In the 1980 coup the millitary ruled for 3 years before democracy was resorted same.will.happen now prob if they succeed. The goal if this coup is to remove edrogen who is trying to seize more and more power 
Is it safe to assume, then, this will help to cut any potential ties Turkey may have with ISIS?
Take me out
You're out of your element. 
> Russia?Lol, my fucking sides XD. Putin is probable laughing his ass off right now.[
This country, man...
I feel like an idiot when I fantasize about being around some drama like this or a tragedy. I want to feel like I've seen REAL shit and have crazy stories. But I always remind myself that peoples lives are obviously more important.
Yes. I'm presently at a Hotel in Side quite far away from Ankara and Istanbul. Everybody, that is Turkish, here pretends like nothing happened. It's odd.
That's because Erdogan took over the Turkish media.
Tell him to fuck off, we dont want himBring him to Glasgow if you must, then we can deal with him efficently
The U.S. embassy in Turkey has said try not to go to the embassy.
Correct, but considering their position geographically it's unlikely that they'll lean to anything except Islam.
More or less, yeah. It's really confusing compared to Western powers, but it's a very interesting setup the more you read about it.
> I saw one thing saying the coup was crushed. Interesting to know it is not.It's in the interest of the defenders against the coup to make people believe it's lost, and vice versa.
Of course the government would be trying to say they're winning, please ignore the fact that they've been getting bombed constantly by the military and a tank column is en route to Istanbul to detain Erdogan.
I don't think he's really backing Erdogan it's just that if the coup fails we still have to work with him so best not to say we support the people trying to kill him. It would make meetings awkward 
I'm not sure if it's a good or bad thing that they are so good at overthrowing the governmnt.
The message from the followers of Khorne were slightly less so: "Blood for the blood god! Skulls for the skull throne!"
The very same.
Take me out inside
>Greece?Yeah, historically speaking Greece and Russia both hate Turkey more than anyone else.
The moment you do, you'll wish you didn't.
They should, better to stay calm and not 'pour out' onto the streets like erdogan says. Maybe they're used to it or expected this stuff anyway.
Even more disgusting is the call to prayer. If I was a practicing religious muslim I'd be offended my beliefs were used towards political gain WHILE RISKING MY LIFE.
What is the reasoning behind that? Is the embassy in Turkey and too dangerous to go there?
Based ataturk. I will read some books about him. Sounds like a great man. Real shame they seek to destroy his legacy. 
"What country ever existed a century and a half without a rebellion? And what country can preserve it's liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants." The exact context for the lazy. 
The government will say Erdogan has won until a helicopter is flying his hanged body through the streets.
Like when the US voiced tacit support for the 2002 coup in Venezuela, during the brief period when it looked like it would stick.
Personally, I think if you're in a region that has a risk of Islam coming to town and taking over, it's probably a good thing to say, "hey, FYI...military can come in and protect the people's democratic rights."
Say what you will about khorne, but we always know where he stands. A real straight shooter.
Under most circumstances, I'm decidedly against a military coup of a democratically elected leader. For this one, I think my feelings are pretty mixed.
Can't take out
Erdogan is a fucking moron. He's going to get his own people killed.
They probably say this because it would mean leaving shelter to go there, and if the embassy is attacked, there is a higher chance of civilian casualties.
That's because if it's a coup and it's in Latin America the United States is almost always the one throwing it.
Yeah that's assuming the Army never undergoes a religious awakening.  I know it's super unlikely as they think it's their job to be secular, but weirder things have happened.
The main problem with democracy, and its greatest internal contradiction:What happens when a leader or government is democratically elected, which seeks to undermine or dissolve the very democracy that brought them to power?
TAAAAAAAKE MEEEEEE
Good way to demonize the military, no?
no way would they attack the embassy - isn't that pretty much declaring war on the us?
Then it's fair game to kick them out.
Knowing how much of a dick he is, he's probably willing to use his own people as pawns.
But how do you kick them out when democracy has been subverted?  In other words, is it ideologically consistent to "save" democracy through undemocratic actions?
97 - sarcastic, grungy, smoking more cigarettes, more clique-y and edgy 07 - petty, attention starved, overwhelmed, but much nicer 17 - under so many layers of irony and memes they dont even know who they are anymore or care. there's no point in being creative or devolving a personality, anything you could think of has already been done.  
Devices and helicopter parenting, which doesn't mean parents who are intensely concerned about their children's futures, but parents who never leave their damn kids alone.
my dad taught middle school from 1968-2004,when he retired i asked him what changes he saw in students from the beginning of his teaching career to the end.he answered;"the kids never changed. a teenager is always a teenager. the parents however, changed dramatically. they used to respect teachers and side with us in disciplinary matters, but now they think their kids are perfect and we are wrong. glad i'm getting out before it gets worse."
1997 - "You won't always have a calculator with you everywhere you go in life!"2017 - "Before beginning the test, every student must disable the multi-function calculator that goes with them everywhere in life."
No phones.Small phones. Big phones. 
Going to sound like an old man here, but when I was in high school in '97 we had a system where various teachers aides would photocopy all of the notes, answer keys, homeworks, etc. and put into an unused locker.  My whole class - even the future valedictorian - used that locker.  I'd imagine cheating efforts have advanced since then.
The 2017 students don't seem so... Alive**EDIT** This was a very shit Daft Punk joke that has now sparked debate about student life and satisfaction
1997: Colorful hair and piercings 2007: no Colorful hair, lots of tattoos2017: Colorful hair and tattoos(I teach in college)Oh the other difference was 1997: No one talked about being gay, 2007: students came out to me privately in my office, 2017: Students talk about being gay in class 
'97 - "Quit passing notes"'07 - "Quit texting"'17 - "Are you seriously watching Netflix right now?"
Senior Pranks in 1997 were outlandish and acceptable. Senior Pranks in 2007 were less common and more basic. In 2017 Senior Pranks are illegal.
TI 83 is still king.
Different consoles used to play Pokemon.
Electronics. Hands down.  They are the most wonderful gift and the biggest handicap at the same time.  Too many students use them as crutches or distractions instead of using it as a tool.  
The whole be cool stay in school thing seemed to work I'm not a teacher but I used to volunteer as a middle school basketball coach. Kids take school more seriously than when I was a kid. Which is a great thing.
I can't say with 100% confidence, but I bet kids weren't dabbing on teachers every day in 1997 & 2007. 
Students from 1997 and 2007 got to enjoy Daft Punk's Alive concerts
It's no longer frowned upon to be fucking your 1997 students.
Am I the only one who's currently a student and not relating to the descriptions the teachers are giving about today's students? Like my classmates are incredibly rude and lazy. Not diligent and polite. 
Ya everyone in school lives on 7 layers of irony and I love it 
But how dare your father not give their *little angel* an a+ on everything.What's frustrating is that the same parents that read your post will likely agree with you.  But then a teacher gives *their* kid a bad grade?  Well, now that changes everything.
Once you hit college: you better have brought your calculator mother fucker, no we don't have one for you to borrow.
But I rocked a rad pager during my senior year in 1997!!!
Next is big *thin* phones
Now it's just "you do that assignment?" "I got it from Johnny you need it?" "Yeah send it" then we just text pictures over
You mentioned gap years so not sure if you're American. But I don't know how most American students can consider a master's with the current cost of education. Some careers it's obviously necessary, but I can't for the life of me figure out what people getting MBAs right after undergrad are thinking...tacking on that kind of extra debt seems insane. I've never once heard someone with an MBA say it was worth it. The wages aren't that different. Unless their employers are paying for it idk why you'd do it. 
Failure in the past was mostly accepted and treated as an indication the student didn't understand the concept. Failure was a teaching tool.Now failure is seen as a character flaw so parents don't teach kids how to come back from it, they're just taught to avoid it at all costs.
Is this a Daft Punk joke?
2017 student hereCan confirm. Am not.
I'm class of 2014. There's nothing to be alive about, you work insanely hard at school for a future you can't care about. No one really has goals or hobbies besides do well
> 2007: students came out to me privately in my officethat's interesting to me. What were their motives to explain themselves to a teacher?
thanks for your post!
My little brother just recently graduated high school. During his junior year, another student streaked at a football game.  He was arrested and they tried to get him booked as a sex offender. He ended up killing himself. It was devastating, many many people were horrifie at the school's reaction. I remember my parents specifically saying that streaking at a big game would've been frowned upon but ultimately not a big deal when they were in school.
Nah, TI-84s are far more prevalent in my HS. Especially the new sim ones.
Its called something "digital migrants". When we were young we didn't have smartphones nor simple mobiles. They just arrived so we slowly learned it, but not correctly ( well i myself is still slow with smartphones however I love my kindle reader) and then there is who born into the smartphone era. They are the "digital natives"? Or some short... They see this stuff while they are young like 0-4-10years old so their brain catches up faster and easyer for them to learn. You can see the technological usage between generations.

As a high school teacher, I definitely agree that kids these days have an extreme reliance on their parents. Instead of approaching me about a grade, they have their parent email me. If a student emails me, it is along the lines of "hey fam can u tell me what homework i missed". The majority of kids have no idea how to appropriately email someone. Also, I can say something in class and within 20 minutes get an email from a parent of a kid in that class. Parents are involved to a point that is ultimately detrimental to their child. 
I feel like this account of your teacher conference will be the realest thing I read this week.
I feel like this was what was portrayed in 21 jump street 
When I was a kid in the 90s my school took us on a field trip to the internetWe all loaded up in a bus and went to a high school in the city that had access to the internet, and learned how to use web search tools like webcrawler and askjeeves 
I like how /r/prequelmemes is so big high school teachers are specifically aware of it.  
Born too late to explore the Earth, born too soon to explore the galaxy. Born just in time to post dank memes.
There is actually something called "Google amnesia" that exists where it does just what you say. People aren't remembering the facts but instead are memorizing where the facts can be found, the internet 
Under what law could they have arrested you?
> 2 days in and we see a helicopter, then a coast Guard vessel, then we're boarded by us government guys with guns who say "alright, boys, what is it today, you moving guns or drugs?""Quick fellas, ditch the rum ham!"
I was under the impression dabbing died with 2016. Was hoping anyway.
Where I am, heroin has become the new thing within the last 5 ish years. Weed is normal. 
> some 16-year-old with mutton chops will spring out to open it for meWhat year is it?!
You could fuck someone born in 1997
Dude on my bus in the 8th grade stopped coming to school.  Someone sold him poison ivy and told him it was weed and he smoked it.  Don't think he died, but we never heard from him again.
This happened at my high school in 2014...
97 - racial slurs07 - you retard17 - ~ironic~racism, homophobia, sexism, etc
It's even worse when a professor says "Go ahead and cache the entire internet on your laptop and bring it to the exam. It won't help you. Have fun."
A Google drive or a network for the students to share everything, making cheating streamlined and efficient.
MBA is a networking degree. You should get it after excelling in the private sector. Kids who get them asap miss out.
God damn if this isn't the truth and most of us are still dealing with the repercussions of not knowing how to handle failure. 
So we're inching closer to Japanese culture and are about to start seeing NEETS lock themselves up in their parents house?
That's because failure now has severe consequences.  The path to a successful future is now seen as so incredibly narrow that any failure along the way, even a small one, is likely to knock you off the path.  How is Johnny ever going to get into Harvard Law if he gets a C in high school chemistry?
2017 studentCan confirm. Would rather be dead.Not joking.
Are you human after all?
To be fair, this description sounds pretty much exactly like my life in high school graduating in 2006. It was fucking exhausting. I just kept doing more and more and grinding through the work until I pretty much had a nervous breakdown midway through college. 
Yup class of 2018. I was literally crying last week because I realized all I care about right now is my grades and that I'm so caught up in it that I can't even answer the questions "what are your interests?" Or "what do you do for fun?"
Not OP, but I'd guess they likely are students who consider OP a mentor or friend.
School will never stop blocking sites.
I'm 16 and go to a public high school. Everyone I know uses the open school wifi along with a plethora of different VPN apps.
I just use a VPN to do whatever I want on school wifi.
this happened at my school but the administration got wind of it and had a "random fire drill" during the time when the alarms were going to go offso by the time we got back inside, all the alarms had stopped ringing....
The whole idea of a "Sex offender" has become so warped and diluted. It is no longer just for people who pose an actual sexual threat by means of rape or molestation, it is now a catch all for anyone unfortunate enough to have had somebody see them naked. Drunk and peeing in the bushes when a kid sees you? BOOM, Sex Offender. Harmless streaking prank? BOOM, Sex offender... 
That's absolutely terrible. I remember seeing streakers on America's Funniest Home Videos (albeit censored) and Bob Saget and the audience would laugh. I have no idea what is happening to our society but at the very most the guy should have gotten a misdemeanor for disturbing the public or something. There are far too many laws and regulations for the land of the free
They should have gotten extra graduation points for making funny Reformation jokes!
That is really creative!
Three kids got arrested for trespassing and missed the last day in school my senior year. They were going to put face paint and a wig on a statue of a teacher helping a student that was in the courtyard. they did not even have to hop a fence or pick a lock but apparently showing up to school at 5 in the morning was illegal as shit. 
> And how one year couple drunk seniors threw it off a bridge. This makes me think the prank restrictions are probably a good thing.
TI-84 Plus CE is a work of art
I lived literally through the "hey, look, Internet!" and "hey, look, cell phones!" age. Maybe it's because I was tech inclined, but I learned very quickly to use both really well.There are a lot of people from my generation that don't, though.
And Star Wars.
I'm right there with you. I've had that experience twice. The first time it happened, they actually drove two hours and met with me and the student. Very awkward. The moment when I realized that the student had basically been lying to their parents about their performance/effort *and attendance record* in the class... 
This is so alien to me. It used to be everyone wanted to avoid classes that had part of the grade based on attendance because then you could skip and just show up for exams.
Well, AP classes *are* supposed to be specifically preparatory for the AP exam. So I'd blame the nature of the exam over the teaching style of the individuals. 
When I was in 7th grade, circa 2009, my school had a policy where if the student completed 50% or more of the homework, whether or not it was correct, earned a 9/10 grade. The only thing it taught was 12 year old me to do half plus one of the work and get an average grade. I blame that for my half ass work ethic now. 
I laughed when he said she was hot.     (it's probably a plus that she gets along with his daughter)  
That's exactly what I was thinking. I mean I think that movie exaggerated it (the cool kids don't think that "organized sports are so fascist"), but I do think it's true that the nicer, more accepting kids today are the "cool" ones.
That was why I always hated history in school.  It was a lot of memorizing dates and names, which seemed useless to me.  Id rather we learn about what happened than exactly when it happened.
'I was born far too late to discover the lands,  And the seas, and the skies, and the shores and the sands.  All the steps have been stepped, and the walks have been walked,  And the sights have been seen, and the talks have been talked.'I was born far too soon to discover the stars,  And I'll never set foot on the red dust of Mars.  I shall only encounter the future in dreams -  But at least I have memes.  But at least I have memes.'    
We were 18 at the time and just didn't know better. We do now and that shit wouldn't fly today. We also didn't want to spend our vacation in jail, so we docked in the Florida Keys a few days and went back home instead of the bahamas.
Charged with "Adventure and Living the Good Life".Verdict: Guilty as sin.
No not the rum ham
I'm seeing a few responses similar to this below.  I can't help but wonder if this is a result of these kids knowing they'll be competing for fewer and fewer jobs that pay less and less in the near future. 
The year where Logan just came out.
I was born in 1997 (looks at side camera), ladies
Not sure how you roll poison ivy without noticing what it is.
Start to? That's already in full swing.
Probably, considering our future economy is likely to resemble Japan's more and more in the future. Over-educated and under-employed young people working part-time work to eke out a living and finding satisfaction in personal pursuits rather than career ambitions.
Not just on an academic level. God forbid you make a mistake in front of others then the whole world will know because of social media. 
I graduated 5 years ago, but I think it's that social media showcases the best of peers' lives and most people can't understand that enough to overcome that bias, so everyone feels inadequate compared to everyone else. 
me too thanks
I feel like I'm beyond a nervous breakdown. I've gone past it and now I'm just in this intermediary where no amounts of stress gives me urgency anymore. 
Yep and also I teach/do research on sex/sexuality topics so a lot of students come out to me.  
My school wifi literally blocks google
That's when you get a VPN
I assume the only reason they haven't blocked all those apps is that your IT guys must also use those programs to stream video content all day.
That's awesome. They fucking played you guys.
The really funny thing is due to the internet more younger children are now aware of human anatomy and sexuality than ever. The parent's whole "won't someone think of the children" has now become willful ignorance. Your child has probably seen more porn than you have.
I got the pleasure of watching a drunk guy outside of a frat house pissing on the side of the house when campus police confronted him. They told him they saw him pissing, and the dude's response was "That's impossible. My dick is so tiny you couldn't have seen it!" Campus police left him alone after making such a watertight argument. 
It's not laws and regulations that are the problem.  (Except for zero tolerance policies). There are certainly cases where you'd want a naked guy hanging around school to be brought up on sex offender charges.The problem is everyone, especially school administrators, being unwilling to use common sense.
In my senior class of 09 we all brought one golf ball with us to our graduation. After we each walked and shook the principals' hand, we would give him our golf ball. After quite a few walks the principal was frantically cradling about 20 golf balls as they keep falling and bouncing everywhere. His pockets were absolutely stuffed with them as well. Half way through someone just brought out a bucket for him to throw them in. Innocent yet amusing.
Sophomore year sounded good.
No, they should have been burned at the stake for condoning heresy.
For any who are wondering. No the goat didn't survive. it was a very shallow river and about 20-35 feet above.
If you've ever used a TI-84 Plus C you'll realize how amazing the CE really is
Been in IT for 30 years, beginning on the "big iron". It's the pace of change that is different. Related is, which horse do you want to ride (.net, java, Ruby, etc.)? My kids still roll their eyes at me because, for example, I can't get something to work on it. But when they have computer problem, who do they come to first? Yup, dear old Dad!!
If the student was 18, it's their life. 
It just all flowed together in a way that suggested he was making a genuine comparison at all levels on his radar with no regard to the perception we might have of him. Just a slice of life.
The brilliance of this poem is that it is truly depressing. I'm impressed and depressed at the same time. 
Yea but you didn't do anything wrong I don't understand.
High Seas is 24 miles from shore, I believe. In international waters, you are still operating under the jurisdiction and the laws of the country whose flag you are flying. Also, piracy is illegal--pirates are considered "Enemies of all Mankind" and thus all nations are free to persecute them on the high seas.
That would be my hypothesis as well. Kids in high school now have, in a way, had the veil lifted that was on students 10 years ago. Most of them seem to realize that their future isn't as bright and open as everyone was telling them it would be when they were kids. 
Good for him.
Fuck this guy, pick me! Pick me!
The best advice I ever got from a mentor was before the first interview of my career:  "Never stress about interviews.  They already want you.  The reason they interview you is to make sure you're normal."
\*raises glass\*
Now if only we had a nationwide transit network like they do...
Social Media has truly shown how narcissism and low self esteem is a pandemic. The only people that get joy out of others misfortune are people that are not happy with themselves and have to get that small feeling of being above someone else. Before social media the trend started with watching reality TV. I can't wait to see what the next 'ego boost' machine will be.
This is very important. People don't realize that we don't post our bad shit on social media, only our best. We shouldn't compare other people's highlight reel with our behind the scenes. 
That's a real bummer, I don't know your situation but are there really no teachers that give positive reinforcement, friends, family, coaches, etc?
It would seem from the sentiment in these comments that you've all been thrust into adulthood early. (Correct me if I'm wrong; that's my interpretation.) It's like you have adult rat-race-stress and society hasn't yet let you in the maze.
That's messed up.  Google and Wikipedia, etc are literally an extension of our brains these days.  
They most probably know you're using one. They don't care, but they know.
My wife's a teacher. Teenagers are soooo bad at keeping shit a secret. Like, teachers have ears, ya know?
Nice. Our senior prank (2009) was to go to Michael's, buy a BUNCH of glitter in our school colours that we sneaky poured out while walking down the main hall.Glitter.... THEY WILL REMEMBER US FOREVER IF THEY LIKE IT OR NOT.
Yeah.. I remember when my son was 9, I was checking his computer history, and he had searched for "nekid veginas".  After I excused myself to laugh for 10 minutes, we had another sex talk 
When I tried to have 'the talk' with my then 9 or 10 year old she told me, don't worry mom, I have the internet. I checked to make sure she actually knew facts not bs and she was good to go. 
See, this is a senior prank that is funny and not just kids being assholes. When my husband was in high school (as a junior; I teach at this school now and have heard the story), some seniors snuck in the school and straight up vandalized shit--destroyed the school emblem on the brand new commons floor, shot off all the fire extinguishers, put glue into most of the locks, tipped over the shelves in the library...all shit that was just criminal and not at all funny.
It would have been great! If they had used whipped cream, or almost any other type of sticky food item that didn't have a deadly allergy related to it.
I have a soft spot in my heart for goats this is awful
I have the TI-84 Plus CE and it's my favorite calculator. No ragrets on spending $190 on it
My dad learned to program on Fortran. When we looked at my Sophmore year high school schedule and saw the PASCAL course he called it "new fanlged.". This was 1999.
I had a doctor send my parents out of the room to tell me I had an STI, but then when they came back in went on to discuss how I should tell my partners to get tested, etc. defeats the point, dude.
Her ass was thick as hell.  My wife and I discussed it more than we talked about my kid's grade.
Not doing anything wrong and not having your day/holiday/life fucked over by over-zealous police are not mutually exclusive, sadly. 
Pirates aren't MY enemies, checkmate international law.
I graduated in 2014 and this was exactly the problem. Our history teacher called us the disillusioned generation. We knew the world sucked and we didn't have time to mess around. We all had jobs and did early college or got certificates if we could. I knew a few kids who wore suits every day for their internships after school. Not even a rich area, but we worried.
Yeah we were told we could be whatever we wanted, and that there were plenty of well-paying jobs. With the globalization of social media and communication, it's impossible to lie to children anymore.
Bingo. My son is only 12 but I'm teaching him C++ and emphasising math and science. I barely graduated high school in 2002 and quickly realized that there were no well paying jobs for the undereducated. Not to mention the unhappiness that comes with being undereducated. My son will not go through the same struggles.
I had an interview for an internship, but they also interviewed 40 people for the position....Apparently they didn't want me. I didn't have enough experience to get the internship to get experience.
Yep. Rates are way up. 16-21 seems to be the "danger zone" Fun fact. Female teens are more likely to attempt suicide.Male ones are more likely to succeed in the attempt. 
Of Mountain Dew?
We westernized long before we got rid of our shogunate so it's unlikely we will get the set of circumstances that will lead to that. We haven't even gotten a first shogun.
I took me like a month at my job to have my Internet Access unrestricted.My job:Programmer.
can confirm, my high school blocks almost all VPNs and I got a detention for hosting my own VPN at my house
The IT guy knows, but he's likely too overworked and underpaid to give a damn. The school administration probably thinks that VPN is some kind of illicit drug.
My school's senior ditch day was ruinedBecause a senior asked her dad if she could participate in itHer dad was the principal 
Jesus. I guarantee there are still teachers there who despise you guys because they're still finding glitter everywhere. That's almost satanic.
When my son was the same age I found "girls who are not wearing underpants" in his browser history.  I actually still can't type that without giggling.
This is why I think it's awesome that pornhub now has a sex education channel to talk about the reality about sex.It's kind of fucked that we now need porn sites to properly educate people on sex, since schools aren't doing it.
If only that riverbed would have had a soft spot for goats...R.I.P. goat bro
I'm not sure the pirates would agree.
If he's able to learn C++ well right off that bat that is great. I never had any programming until college and once I did get some taste of programming I loved it.If your child isn't keen to take on C++ (as it might be a little 'dry' for a youngin') you might look to the higher 'framework' languages (like swift, or .net framework with C#) which don't get into the dirty parts that C++ will have, but will increase his interest in programming. I hope your son is enjoying programming. I love the ability to 'make solutions' that programming allows.Good Luck!
Most males use suicide such as hanging or guns which will kill you pretty quick and usually works. Females tend to use something like OD on pills or slitting wrists which is slower and is less reliable? (If that's the right word for it)
Man i want a shogun
Worked for a company that was working for Dell. Part of my job was to remote into other computers to do stuff and fix issues.Took about 2 or so months for them to allow me Internet access. Yet they still couldn't work out why I didn't do work during that time, even though they had been told numerous times.Yeh I worked in a place that didn't want to give me Internet access to do a job that requires the Internet.  
Am surprised you got caught, school administration is normally very tech illiterate. I could have told them straight up that I use a VPN and they would think it was done kind of drug.
Jesus, schools are getting really strict these days. When I installed games or by passed the school security all I got was a: "don't show others students how you did this and how did you do that?".
Our senior ditch day was ruined because our "valedictorian" had her mom ask the school if it was an excused absence. Are you fucking kidding me?? The answer was in the name!
Oh, bless her heart.
You mostly get girls in underpants with those search words. It is important to be able to use google in a good way, so you need to have a talk with him.
My brother was 6 years old when he googled, "naked ladies." I was blamed for it at first until the kid admitted to it. Probably the first time I wasn't the one who got in trouble haha
...since parents aren't doing it.I had the first "talk" with my son at 10. (Basic plumbing, dangers of becoming a young father, and mention of disease and the possibility of his weiner falling off.) Small discussions and questions along the way since. We'll have the final talk this year as he turns 13. (Foreplay, what diseases and why you might wish they actually made your weiner fall off, consent and the danger of being labeled a sex offender, emotional harm, etc.)
I had a few friends that got the shit kicked out of them in a police interrogation that took place on the streets of a quiet suburb.  They were looking for drugs, and they really weren't accepting the fact that there were none.  We were all around age 16 at the time, and some old lady had called in saying that we were doing drugs in the woods.  We were setting up a fort and just talking.
I had someone call my license plate in because they thought I was selling drugs with all the people coming over to my house. They thought deodorant on my car seat was coke and searched my car threatening to bring me down to the station if I don't give them my phone without a passcode. They found nothing but cops will do anything it seems.
As long as he seeds he's alright with me!
Wow. That's... really damn stupid. 
There's some sleeper IT guys in school administration.  It's a steady paying gig with regular hours that you're usually doing by yourself, and with little supervision.  For someone coming out of corporate life it's easy enough to look past the pay cut and take the easy pope gig, and get paid to troll high school students all day.  
expelled for using this new VPN drug in school. 
How was it ruined? Just ditch like normal. Them knowing ahead of time or not doesn't change anything.
The only talk I ever got was when my dad told me "If you get a girl pregnant, you don't have to marry them.  Pay for an abortion, take care of the kid, be a father, whatever, but only marry someone if you actually want to marry that person.  You can be a parent without having to be married to the other parent.  Both sides being happy for themselves is best for the kid."
Unlock your phone so I can illegally search it or I'm going to arrest you! 
So was it actually coke? I'm not a cop I swear.
Aye, that be the code
Right? Here I am, 28 years old, successful in IT, and proud that I have my own VPN at home...and kids are getting detention for it now?! Get off my lawn! 
>  get paid to troll high school students all day.Is this the revised version of The American Dream?
Who is this hacker VPN and do teens ingest it anally with tampons? News at 11.
At my school, when the administration caught wind of a skip day, they would enforce rules very strictly for an unexcused absence, meaning your teachers had to give you zeros for anything missed that day and it also opened you up to getting put into detention.I more than made up for that time my senior year when I'd skip out on pep rallies. Not too upset about not having a skip day.
"Your mother and I have decided it's time to chat with you about Search Engine Optimization"
I hadn't done coke at this time in my life, yet. It was old spice original. I always keep a stick in my car.
They're more like guidelines.
Whenever they sleep, they dream of being at work
A lot of these are just things you'd ask a genie, not a foundation.I'd have them pour water on my enemy's face 15 minutes after he falls asleep. Every time.
Unfiltered empathy for everyone and everything.
Someone asks them a question any time they take a bite or sip of something.
have to work for the make a curse foundation having to inflict all of this and ensure it all works
Their pasta sauce will never cling to their spaghetti. 
As soon as they fall asleep at night they will be startled awake by a loud scream from inside their home and only they will be able to hear it. 
Get the biggest boner in the most awkward and humiliating situations and only get a half boner when they actually want one.
All critical emails, mail and other indirect correspondence simply wouldn't reach their intended recipients. Mundane stuff would go through as usual though so rather than being able to identify the curse, the target would merely feel alone and ignored in the world.
Anytime they try to poop, they just fart. Whenever they try to just let a simple fart out, they poop.
Their internet connection will disconnect at random. Also when they are going to watch a video, their connection will be slowed so the video stops to buffer often.
Cursed to always have sticky toddler hands.
Make everything in their life slightly too _____.For example, maybe they'd go to a restaurant that's slightly too far away from their house, only to be waited by a slightly too chatty (and therefore slightly too slow) waitress. Their meal would be slightly too salty, or perhaps slightly too bland. It would cost slightly too much, and be slightly too cold. I think you get the idea (In fact, I think I explained slightly too much).
Speaking as someone who has been battling a cold for a week, I would inflict the curse of the nose whistle. Once an hour, the noise would spontaneously resolve, only to start again 30 seconds later. 
The TV picture is always slightly delayed.
Random people would come up to them while they are around coworkers/family/people who matter and say things like: "Wasn't that orgy wild?  Hope to see you at the next one!""Hey, what is that herpes medicine that you use called?""Where are your seats for the Nickleback concert?"
An itch down at the bone that moves through their body in varying intensities.It can never be scratched properly and it can't be adjusted for. Just a constant itch ranging from inconvenience to straight up agony 
Replace all of their sugar with salt... I am a simple man  
I'd remove their brain / mouth filter. Everything they think will be spoken aloud. 
Show them what would have happened if they said 'yes' all those years ago...
Every time they introduce themselves people mishear their name and call them a slightly wrong name. If they spell it out people add extra/incorrect vowels for no reason. 'Grant Smith' 'So that's Gareth Smythe, right?' 
I'd send a pack of fleas to everyone that stops in the middle of a corridor when they know there are other people walking through it
every time they google somthing important, it rickrolls them and deletes browser history
Tastebuds in their asshole
Every time they walk through a doorway, glitter falls on them. 
Profuse sweating from every single pore, especially when other people are looking at them.
No matter what the temperature of the area they are sleeping in is, they will always be too hot. The pillow will never have a cold side either
Chronic kidney stones
Every time they find a flake of glitter on them and wipe it off, 2 more appear in its place at random spots on the body.
Every time they take their FIRST drink of a beverage it will be all dust in their mouth and they have to swallow it to be able to drink any liquid. If they keep spitting it out they will not get any liquid to quench the dryness in their mouth. Once they swallow the dust, the drink will work until it is empty. If they refill the drink, it again produces a mouthful of dust that needs to be swallowed first.
For them to lose memory of every time they've ever felt joy, happiness, or fulfillment and to never be able to feel those emotions again. For them to always feel thirsty. 
Nerasin's Complaint - They have an ulcer. Any time they contemplate an evil act, gastric acid floods their stomach.
One papercut per day until I die.
To fall deeply in love with someone that won't love them back. 
To make a death snail follow them
Functioning hair follicles on the inside of their eyelids.
To give them constantly terrible internet.  In brief moments, they get hope that it will work, but then crashes, goes off an on all the time.  Long load times.  This is the true equivalent of hell.  Having an internet connection...  that is useless.  Like a cigar but no way to light it.
They'd have a persistent, rock-hard erection that never goes away... until they try to relieve it. They'd experience immediate flaccidity any time they try to have sex or masturbate, thus depriving them of any sexual pleasure or release.As soon as they give up trying... BOOM! Boner time again.
Stelio contos will appear at random times and beat them up. They will hear the song and can run but they cant hide from the true wonder who works at klinkos
They can't round the tv volume up to multiples of 10 or 5 
B.O that they cannot wash or perfume away. They will stink everywhere they go.
They miss anything they throw or drop, every time. Even if all they do is drop something an inch above a table it flies to the edge and drops to the floor. 
Replace their IV drip with LSD, turn off the lights, play sounds of children crying. 
Every bowel movement should be excruciatingly painful, but should alternate between liquid stools and constipation. 
Opposite co-ordination. Every time they want to make a left turn whilst driving, they turn right. They wanna grab something on a shelf? Their arm moves down instead. They also read signs mirrored too, so if a sign says left to them, it means right.
They are given a pie. They cannot eat anything else or drink anything other than water until the pie is completely eaten. They don't have to eat the pie in one sitting, but it is the only food they are allowed to eat until it is gone.The pie is made from green (IE not ready to eat at all) strawberries and has no sugar added.Also, if they don't finish the pie in one sitting, the people at Make-A-Curse will discreetly replace the pie with a more-complete pie every now and then, so the curse continues on forever.
Spoilers. Just... spoilers. They will never enjoy an new movie ever again
For them to suddenly have a undying fetish that would make normal relationships impossible. Like Paraphilic infantilism or Necrophelia etc
10 thousand octopuses all over their house and car 
Insomnia, it would take them at least 2 hours to fall asleep.
Since everyone else is doing curses instead of single acts I'll follow suit... I'm a robotics guy. So my enemy would be too (if I have one?) whenever they supply voltage to something it's either 10 times more to 10 times less than they think it is. The amount of magic blue smoke they will release... 
To shove a thin glass tube full of rock salt and sand down their penis; then roll their penis with a dough roller thus breaking glass tube.
Anytime they love (person or pet) that subject developes a terminal illness. They have to spend their life either alone or watching their loved ones dying.
Constant vomiting 
Full body herpes
IMO this is the most brutal and demoralizing thing I've read in this thread.  Even if you love your job and this happens it's hell. 
I don't know why but this was the only one that made me laugh out loud. 
I was thinking "for them to become intensely aware of everyone they've ever hurt," but this is even worse. 
How would that work if they were home alone? Would someone just break into their house exclusively to ask them questions?
Every. Server. Ever. 
Yeah, I can't imagine Mr. Salt n' Glass Penis-Tube up there sleeps well at night.
You monster
Found the Golden Girls fan.
You have to let them get some sleep, otherwise they'll die from sleep deprivation.Let's make it random whether the scream goes off or not. Maybe 1 out of 10 times. Enough so that on the outside they appear to be functioning normally but they're being slowly driven insane by Satan jacking their Bluetooth speaker.
Exploding head syndrome. Happens to me, look it up
But wouldn't getting half a boner be an awkward situation, thus giving you a full boner? 
So you're giving them a Time Warner subscription?
But any advertisement will load in perfect HD and have no buffering.
I wake up every morning in a bed that's too small, drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little... but on pretzel day... well, I like pretzel day...
Could this randomly work in their favor though? Like maybe his job earns him slightly too much? Or the taxi drive home was slightly too slow, and allowed him to avoid a car accident?
I'd prefer giving them that feeling of having to cough but no matter how much they cough nothing ever comes up. They keep coughing because they figure "This time, something will break loose and I'll have some relief" but no. No relief. They keep coughing because there's something in their lungs but it never comes out.
I'd give them a kinda runny nose whenever they go inside, and make sure that they can never find the tissues they thought they had on them. They would have to wick the snot away every few minutes and they would hope that nobody notices...Source: have had some kind of shitty half-cold for a few weeks which has no symptoms except for this.
So a shitty YouTube video that always happens to be the only video of something you're trying to watch.
I have one of those stereotypical Asian parents. One of my friends would just randomly blurt out "Hey, when was that paper you needed to write due?" or "Are you ready for the math test?" and for the next week, my mom would be all "Pbghin! No playing video games, you have test coming up!" I'd correct her, but the idea of "there might be a test/paper/project due" outweighs the idea of "James is a shit-stirring asshole."
I have no feeling in parts of my right arm. No feeling, that is, except for when it's itchy. I can feel the itch, but *I can't feel it when I scratch*! It's like nothing is happening. And the itch just stays there for hours, maybe even a day or two. It's literally an itch I can't scratch and it drives me nuts!
Just give them the world's itchiest asshole and leave it at that. 
Oh god, this made my skin crawl.
Even worse: an itch on the sole of their foot, where the skin is thick, so you can't quite work out where the itch is, and you can never quite scratch it.
And replace all of their salt with calcium bromide.
Time to castrate myself, because if people knew the sexual thoughts I was having then they'd run away.
Now that.... THAT is evil.
Christ almighty, it's difficult to imagine what that would be feel like. Nice curse
This is already my life. It's not so bad.
Do I have this curse? Did you curse me?
So they become a white kid?
Hold off on this, I'm experimenting with behavioral altering by purposefully stumbling into them. Especially if they have their fucking laptop open walking around.
Bullet ants* FTFY
Sounds like a great idea for a chrome extension
A ring pop would be double the pleasure.
Did you know that you already HAVE taste buds in your ass? They just don't do anything!
Very detailed. Almost as if it's...happened before?
Anything u need to talk about OP?
Just picturing this being implemented is hilarious. In places like the person's home or work, a device of some sort could be placed above the door to dispense glitter. For other places though I can only imagine someone hanging above the door waiting for this person to walk under or someone would have to follow the person with a bottle of glitter and sprinkle it on them every time. I think in order to not be predictable, each doorway would have to have a different person who pours the glitter. 
I know the question said short of murder, but does driving someone to suicide count?
I would feel so special. It is like a party whenever I enter a place!
as someone with hyperhidrosis and social anxiety this is just another day for me 
Joke's on you; they will utilize this for free clean energy generation, making millions!!
Who hurt you
They then become histories greatest explorer since they can sleep outdoors in the arctic or on everest
I like this. Very creative. You have a talent. You're probably on a CIA recruitment list somewhere.
Just make small first sips?
Who hurt you so bad as to be this evil? 
Dementors...
On the bit between your finger and thumb? Or between toes?
Alright, I thought we were doing funny comments here, not ones which hurt.

What about the decoy snails?

Thanks to a one-two punch of OCD and synesthesia, I can't round the tv volume to multiples of five, so come at me.
This is fucking horrible, maybe the worse not violent one for me. I have a pretty serious drug problem and usually the only time ill stop and go home is after a few days because I smell, I don't know why but for me being smelly is maybe the. Most embarrassing thing, strangely more than being a drug addict. 
that's clever as fuck, and would be insanely inconvenient.
Would pouring something, like a cup of milk, be included?
My wife and i agreed that if either of us was terminal, instead of stringing it out by "making us comfortable", we bail on the hospital, say goodbye to our loved ones, and go on a bender, that for the terminal one, wont end.
But if they read a left-sign (and understand right) they will try to go right but then go left because they always turn wrong, which makes them right again....?
[ ](/absilly)Pft, you can totally have a normal relationship as a necropheliac! Your SO just has to be dead. There are so many choices, too, just head down to your local cemetery and browse to your hearts content. 
Ok, that's a unique one. But it's pretty evil too. The octopi would almost certainly die pretty much immediately so you're gonna have some nasty rotting octopus everywhere for a few weeks, at least until it rains.
Fuck. You.

MAGIC QUESTION MAN OUT OF NOWHERE
So that's what the spaghetti monster's power is.Anyway I eat basically everything with a spork so it wouldn't work on me. It's just a superior food shoveling device. 
Came to say this, lol, it's not a curse, it's a real parasomnia, and it sucks!
It never used to happen then I got a few really bad migraines and now it happens a few times a week. Right as I fall asleep there is a bright flash and a bang. I bet I have a tumor or something.
Ah the classic "limp dick" paradox
Maybe, but then since it's no longer awkward, it would deflate back down. Thus becoming humiliating again.
That's Spectrum to you. Same shitty service and unreliability but not any of the stigma associated with TW!
So.... YouTube? 
You get slightly fewer pretzels than you'd like
so... asthma 
Thank God I didn't have friends until my parents stopped giving a shit and moved on to shaming my brother for being a disgrace to the dynasty 
They could also just not wear socks? IDK if it's really a problem is you can just not bother.
Have you tried using a mirror and scratching where the itch is on the other arm? You might be able to trick your brain into feeling the scratching. 
Can't,  I'm not giving anyone my asshole.
No, that's the itch moving around.
And replace all of their calcium bromide with sugar
Then it just turns into "Back before I was castrated, I'd totally have tapped that."
Mine too - first name is weird, last name is so long it never fits on forms which holds up getting a new phone/Internet/power connection every time I move house. 
It's *Christineth* you asshole! Get it right! 
I'm confused, isn't the stereotype that black people do that?  As in A-Aron?
Sure thing laqueeshafaenda
Try to look out for the contractors testing signal strength for telecom. They get shit on enough and actually serve a purpose stopping and finding dead spots etc.
Bullet ants are relatively common and chill unless you fuck with then. Fleas will mess your shit up regardless.
ohhhhh myyy
maybe that's why babies cry when they poop, they're learning to ignore their assbuds
Of course not... Didn't you read his username?

You can lead a horse to water but you cannot make him sink. Except with concrete shoes.

Similar to when you're warm after consuming alcohol, you will still die in cold temps no matter how warm you feel. :/  
"Too hot" which means they would start sweating. You probably don't want to start your day in the arctic covered in sweat.
Yes, psychological damage is what I am going for for my last act of revenge if I found out I'm going to die from terminal illness. 
I guess it's a mouthful regardless of how much you drink. So they drink a drop, spit the dust out, rinse and repeat until they make billions from the dust-selling industry.
Don't ask questions, just send him tits and kittens before you get dust in your mouth. 
I'm used to it. Doesn't even hurt anymore.
holy fuck, your username.
Admitting you have a problem is 9/10ths of the law
oh no my plan is flawed. i've been cursed with stupidity on my death bed!! gosh darn that jim!
It was a torture method, think used in WWII, make men get an erection, shove a glass tube in their penis.  Then you thwack it repeatedly to break the glass.  Then you force them to drink a lot of water.  Thus you end up pissing out through a glass shard filled urethra.  
This is the only time ever where Anal Shredding is preferable to anything.
Schrodingers dick.
I remember that. I still blame user error since they made the joke buttons very noticeable and alerted the user of the new button when Gmail was opened 
Yes like YouTube, and the ads will be THREE TIMES AS LOUD
Kind of, but you'd also have to add the feeling of never getting enough air. Which would make the curse even worse. Don't smoke kids! Or work in a coal mine
My Asian friend married a white girl. His parents just started completely ignoring him.He considers it a mixed bag. 
Barbarian....who doesn't wear socks with shoes.  Hell i cant even step outside in my orange crocs without socks on. 
Doesn't work. I think it's because I only have some small patches where I have no feeling, with the areas around those patches able to feel that *something* is happening to my right arm. (Also, it's hard to scratch one arm without using the other arm...but it is amusing to try)
Have you tried treating for pinworms?
Nooooooooo
"man, with an ass like that I wish i never chopped my balls off... i'd have totally >>things>>"
Hi Weird, nice to meet you.
Christineth! You come into my house you get my wife's name right!!!
Both. White people have the "add extra x, y, and zs sterotype" whereas black people have the "laquafanidashaida" sterotype. Both of these are jokes of course, and are not mean to offend anyone.
No problem, Gyneffier.
i'll take fleas over an animal with "bullet" in its name every goddamn daye: christ himself could not make me pick one single fire ant, let alone a bullet ant. fleas all the way.

A man gets afflicted with the Tasty Anus curse. He is married, has 3 kids and has always been a stereotypical straight guy. Suddenly, he loves being a power bottom because he "just loves coconut".

I think I like this better than the original saying
Calm dawn Professor Membrane 
However op specified they would be too hot, rather than feel too hot, so their body would actually be warm rather than just feeling it
3 days.. Seems a little short. I dont have time to watch the whole video right now, but couldn't the guy try doing some exercises and meditate? Yoga? Stack the bottles in his room? Make a sock puppet? I dunno, its not like his room is totally empty.I like being alone, so to me this doesn't seem that overly horrible.. Maybe if he was strapped down to a board and couldn't move or literally had nothing in his room at all I'd feel differently.
I think you read his username wrong. He wants you to PM tits, kittens, and the letter "N"
I am literally sitting right next to a girl a like that doesn't like me back (yes she does know). It never be painless but it does get easier to deal with. 
*hugs tighter*
Can confirm. Source: Am the law
How you doin'?
This is especially effective if you slowly increase the frequency of screams as they lose their grip on their sanity
The problem, IIRC, is that they bound keyboard shortcuts to it, also put it in the same place as the previous button in the UI. Which was very stupid. Not to mention it muted future responses in the conversation, so not only do you look like a minion-loving idiot, you also missed all of the replies asking for clarification.Modern web apps have already conditioned users to ignore small changes over time.
I poop my pants all the time as an adult. I keep an extra set of underwear in my trunk. Good times. Used to be a TV reporter and had to poop on the side or the road in the middle or no where in a snow storm. Another time I was moving and driving a U-Haul and pooped in a litter box, my cat never forgave me for that.
So... Spotify?
So, COPD... 
A man who wears crocs is a man on the edge with nothing to lose. 
Reddit just has the answer for everything 
Just remove your skin bro
Call him by his full name.Hello, Mr. Weird so long it never fits on forms which holds up getting a new phone/Internet/power connection every time I move house.
Yeah. I've had fleas (a stray cat somehow got into my house and slept in my bed with me, I shit you not) and while they suck, it's not the worst thing in the world. I've seen a video of a guy being stung by a bullet ant and I'm not taking my chances with something that has minimal mental capacity and can cause so much pain. Ant's definition of chill and my definition of chill probably vary
Shshhshshshhshshhhh. Not now, son. I'm making*TOAST!*
The only feedback you have is yourself. Imagine you can't talk to anyone. Look into a mirror, for about 2 minutes. Right in the eyes. You'll get bored and want to do something. Maybe you'll talk to yourself, or fix your hair. Now imagine there's no mirror. There is only the four walls and you.Isolation is a horrible curse that I wouldn't put on anyone. God may have mercy on the poor future astronauts who will explore space by themselves.
Maybe you should stop being so close to her so you can get over her before you resume the friendship. 
*hugs tightest*
And then it stops just for a year 
Satan is taking notes.
Kind not but not really, more like COPD 
Very common, often undiagnosed/asymptomatic but quite horrifying, to me at least. Little staple-sized worms that live in your intestinal tract, and the females crawl out your balloon knot at night while you're sleeping, to lay eggs around the rim of your sphincter. Often causes intense itchiness and irritation. 
That really *is* a long last name 
Or, just don't resume the friendship.If you came to *really* like the person before, all the reasons for that to happen are still there.
*suffocates*
"I'm better now, guys. I don't hear it anymore. The screams are gone"Then in a couple months, one night he is awoken by it again, and he has to start pretending like it wasn't there so he doesn't have to go back to the home for crazy people. He's not crazy. It's there, but no one else can know now. He's completely alone. 
Sometimes I think Satan browses Reddit when he needs inspiration

God forbid these braindead morons realize they are in the middle of a residential area and people are trying to sleep. I have fantasies about tracking down where they live, waiting until they go to sleep, and waking their ass up with a bunch of stupid, meaningless noise.

Revving their engines probably
What you're hearing is actually the sound of Mustangs at their local cars and coffee.

No kidding. My mother was on that shit for years. One night she did deep knee bends for two hours in the dark living room. Another night she asked me "where the black man was that liked your hair", when she hadn't had a black guest in years. Yet another night she tried to make a cake - in the morning there was pancake mix, an uncracked egg and maple syrup in a bowl on the counter. Ambien will fuck you up.
One of my housemates was on Ambien a while back, and I kept odd hours.  I miss watching her climb out her (first floor) window and have arguments with squirrels.  In squirrel.

I had a similar experience.  Met a cop in a social setting one time and asked why they let motorcycles ride around without mufflers without ticketing them for violating noise ordinances. His response was along the lines of, "You can't do that, Harleys sound awesome man!"    I just thought to myself, "Yup, there's one part of the problem."

Holy shit, there's a 24-7 fitness place that actually has people who work out at 2am... that's kind of awesome.

"Revving your engine" to kittens is pretty messed up
Ugh I had a neighbor with two ancient trucks that he parked in front of my house.  These trucks shared *one* battery, every time he wanted to switch trucks he'd have to switch the battery.  Hoods banging, engine revving to get things flowing, don't miss that at all.

Your crackpipe is exploding as we speak and your oil pan just kissed a pothole. Your cupholders are laughing at you wanting to utilize them for anything bigger than a RedBull and theres electrical issues plotting against you. But at least your check engine light is on so you know everything is ok. welcome to owning a MK3 VR6.
That's okay, you can't hear the 750 when you rev it up either.  It's like listening to a velvet lion gently purr.
No, we are just really stupid.
Ahhh you read... good... good.

Sigh, it's tough being a non-douchebag (or maybe only a slight douchebag) named Chad. People assume I'm shitty from the get-go and I sometimes believe it affects my ability to land jobs. Would you hire Chad? Of course not, he's only going to show up late and will eventually fuck your girlfriend. There needs to be one of those sad PSA commercials shot in black and white about what it's like being a Chad. It's tough people. It's tough. 
People always tell me, "You have the most beautiful dick."
Except Harleys sounds like shit due to their horribly fucked up engine design
It smells like Axe Phoenix body spray.
Proper decked out fam
Yes, this. Some little shit at my work thinks his fart can civic needs to be damn near red lined to get it to warm up when we're leaving work. JUST LET IT IDLE YOU RICEY LITTLE BASTARD. 
They teach us in Finnish driving school that warming engine slowly is worse than driving and warming it faster. The cold engine runs a lot longer cold which grinds the metal parts, if you let it just run still with low rpm. And I'm talking about colder than waters freezing point.But why would anyone warm their engine staying still? You can use that RPM and gasoline to get going.
No but it is pretty hard to run in them. 
My girlfriend has a '98 Corolla, unfortunately still with muffler after 200,000 miles.My best friend has a Grand Prix and the muffler has a giant crack so it basically does nothing. People say that sounds like something bigger too.
the rattling of the license plate, you mean
What's that from?
Err, squeakity squeak, squeak. 
I would love to have Kronk as a roommate/henchman.
My dad bought 1000 knives from an infomercial and it came with a katana
People exaggerate a lot.  You do weird stuff, but for the most part you babble in place and then fall asleep.Then you sleepwalk to 7/11 to try and buy drill bits.

Still nuffin.
It's a purpose built chrome moly tube chassis drag car though. Absolute massive roller cam. Open headers and 14.25:1 compression. You wanna hear this thing idle. I pop wood every time.  Oh, and If I ever fired it up at 8am on a saturday at home, I'm pretty sure the cops would come and tase/pepper spray and then shoot me.
It would metastasise to either the cam gear, the lifters and the rockers or really just the rest of the head in general. Really not a good situation unfortunately. 
Did you see that ludicrous display last night?
Tell me more!

Gotta triaxleate the induction capacity to 5.1-ish to compensate. 
Motorcyclists use this reasoning too, loud pipes save lives is the mantra. Except there's no evidence of that, and really they just like being loud because they think it makes them look cool.

But a Maserati sounds absolutely amazing.  I doubt even the grumpiest old fart  wouldnt mind a Maserati revving.  Their engine is BUILT in a special way for it to sound this good.  They actually engineered a Excelent sounding engines. 
Lol isn't the point in 'warming up' (esp fuel injected cars) to let the engine idle/drive at low rpm to get the oil warm? How can you think revving it high helps here?I know carbureted cars are a different story.
I feel like you're me.  You don't happen to live in Colorado off of 470 and Broadway do you haha.I just bought a house RIGHT up the street from a 24 hour fitness.  It is seriously the broiest of bro central.

I was on Ambien and one night I kept trying to eat a taco, but I couldn't eat it. It was a picture on a taco shell box. That along with many other things that happened that night showed me that I shouldn't take it anymore.
A Polo is a good choice for your first car. Drives nice, relatively cheap to drive and maintain. Look for one with a recently replaced timing belt and you should be safe from any expensive repairs for a while.

I live in a house that used to be owned by a dude in a motorcycle gang. Every single Harley that drives by my house revs or opens their throttle up to max as they pass by. Every. Single. One. Bikers use their loud pipes to say hi.

'96? Not even close. I got married and my new wife brought a '71 Toyota Corolla with her. Cardboard dash and interior. Black Vinyl upholstery. Manual choke lever on the dash (I am serious). Top speed 67. The cherry red had faded to an uneven light pink - EXCEPT the trunk which had to be repainted (in America) after my she had locked the keys in it with wine at 1ge 17 and got her older sister's pos bf to crowbar it open. Claimed ignorance so insurance fixed it.But to be fair, it stopped running so I sold it to a friend at work for $50 and some weed. So you probably still win.
My dad got you beat on this one - 94 corolla, I don't even know what the original paint was because it's a mess, 3 gears so if you go over 70 it's sounds like it's gonna die, but still his daily driver.And then there's me, the prodigal son, with the 2016 Corolla - oh well
Also, the Top Gear trio love it. They might bumble and muck about but they know their stuff. The Cool Wall was legit.

My 95 sounds like a kitten purring, then you hit 40 mph and the car becomes acoustically attuned to sound of the drive grinding. But hey, the A/C blows colder than a snowmans balls.
I used to have a neighbor who daily drove (!!!) a 72 Buick with a nasty 455 with a dominator. It sounded like a pro mod warming up in the morning.
It's like the hokie pokie: left foot in, right foot in, left foot out

2013 Corolla here. S model. Spoiler makes it way fucking faster. 0-60mph in ~2 minutes.
455's are torque monsters. Small bore and big stroke. They don't like to rev high because of that so you don't see many at the track.

Doesn't big chief run a 455?
Turned left into my sister's driveway at 3 am. A guy on a Harley was doing 60 mph in a 30, with no headlight. My half ton pickup left 4 feet of skid marks from being pushed back by the force. I still remember seeing him do mid air somersaults this was 1976
A guy attacked me at 3 a.m. while I was walking to work. I tried to choke him long enough to render him unconscious. And I did. He never woke up. He was a firefighter, a husband, and a father. I know it was self-defense. It still bothers me sometimes, nearly ten years later.
I was driving a semi a small car pulled in front of me and slammed their breaks i couldnt stop in time my truck wound up on top of their car i was the only survivor of the vehicles involved 
Loan officer for a local credit union.  I ordered a repo on a guy's car; totally justified.  A week later, he gets off at a bus stop about midnight, and starts walking home.  A car hits him, hit & run.  He's found literally dead in a ditch the next morning.  I didn't kill him, but if I hadn't ordered the repo, he wouldn't have died.  
Not truly my fault, but somehow I can't stop thinking that my decision was what lead to it... When I was 7, I had gone to the park with my grandmother. When we were about to go back home, we went across the street so she could buy me an ice cream. As we were heading back I asked her if we could go across the park instead of around it. She said yes, and we were the victims of a hit and run. She passed away a while later from those injuries.
I was working in a nursing home as a volunteer. He was a painter, he told me to bring him oil paints, canvas and thinner, and he would paint something for me.The next week when I had to return I was excited to see what he'd painted, but he was no longer there. The nurses told me that "they" came to pick him up.I think he drank the thinner at night.
I was driving my girlfriend and I back to town from a day by the water. We were on the highway and she leaned over to kiss me, next thing I knew we were going off the road and then the car was rolling. It just happened.. I had a few scrapes but her seatbelt wasn't on properly and she died there.. in my arms on the the side of the road. Never thought this could happen to me. 
When i was 4 Years old, my mother was roughly 3-4 months pregnant           one day I was supposedly crying and throwing a tantrum over a toy or something,my mother tried to comfort me by cradling me in her arms and take me to to my room which was up the stairs but i cried and kicked so much that she lost her balance and fell down the the stairs, i was unhurt and mother recovered without any lasting injuries  but my sibling died.
Perhaps even grandma was abused herself and that could be what drove her to do it.
Not your fault. J-walking is against the law for a reason. Without any visibility there wasn't anything you could do when someone decides to cross illegally. Add alcohol to the mix and it's just a recipe for disaster. Feeling glad that you weren't being charged for anything is perfectly fine. Ruining your life for something that wasn't your fault wouldn't bring him back, nothing would.
Did the other forecaster ever get punished for what he had done?
That seems like it should have definitely been at least a two person job.
You would have ended up drowning as well, he would have paniced and grabbed you and pulled you under
And don't make illegal u-turns like a dumbass. That would've solved the issue. 
Thats not your fault. You didn't let somebody too drunk drive. Thats what you're *supposed* to do.
The only person to blame here is him.Seriously, how drunk do you have to be to sleep on traintracks?
Jesus, I'm sorry that happened to you but it's not your fault. The father shouldn't have given you the gun without checking if it was unloaded first. I hope you can find closure on this one day. 
Be careful with that lady man. That "I'll kill you someday" line is no joke imo. That's some thriller movie type shit.I'm sorry that this happened to you though. I too have a story resulting in an unexpected death but I am probably not going to tell it, as it will probably give my ID away if any redditors from my area are around.
You may very well have saved your own life.
My baby died of meningitis (not trying to make it about me, just commiserating). The symptoms are so vague and subtle. He would have died in bed if my husband hadn't given him to me because he was "so fussy". It would have been a similar* situation. Anyway, my point is I get that whole never forgive yourself part, we both have it too.  Lots of hugs.  
How did your buddy feel about it?
Crazy to have a pool party for 6-year-olds, especially with an apparent lack of adult supervision. Not your fault, but arguably the fault of any of the adults who allowed that to happen. 
> I see a kid on the bottom of the pool and I think to myself that it "looks like he's dancing." I shrug and head inside.That, unfortunately, is what drowning looks like.  Most people don't know what it looks like, they think it's splashing and saying help glub help glub but it's quick and it's dancing and silent and then you're gone. 
Have you done anything about the alcoholism yet? I quit 3 mths ago. Started at /r/stopdrinking and then started to go to AA meetings in my area. 3+ months sober now. My life feels saved.
This is one of the hardest stories I've read in this thread. Yes, your advice wasn't right for him, but there's no way you could have realized this is what would happen. This is way too big a consequence for your little mistake. I'm so sorry you went through this.
As someone with severe, legally disabling depression, it can get so bad that it will drag others down with us if you let it. Luckily, you didn't. What were you supposed to do? Let him keep stealing from you and bleeding you dry and forcing you into your own depression until he found someone else to do the same thing to? No. You did the right thing. This isn't your fault. 
I don't understand why anyone would remotely have a reason to blame you, nor should you blame yourself ...if he didn't borrow yours he could have got a gun anywhere, or just used any other method. 
The family has no right to hate you. You didn't know and they let him keep a gun or had guns accessible to him 
why did he attack you? was he on drugs or had a mental breakdown?
Sounds like that's 100% the lift operators fault.
This is a dumb question, but would it be fair to convey to him that lying could result in his death? Like, this isn't just a perfunctory question. "Are you taking any medicine? I need to know to avoid a fatal reaction."I once had a dentist who was going to perform surgery on me ask if I did illegal drugs, and when I said no, he reiterated that I needed to be honest because if I did heroin, I'd likely have a fatal reaction to the anesthesia.
As someone not involved in healthcare, I would never think someone would hide a medication... but I guess it happens.I'm sorry man, that's honestly a tricky situation, especially if someone insisted they weren't taking anything because they didn't want to be embarrassed. 
Holy fuck that's dark 
Sometimes people do this as a means of suicide. It's unfortunate you were involved and had to deal with the fallout but it wasn't your fault. 
It may sound cruel, but inevitably he would've continued hurting you and everyone else, so it was for the best. Hope you're OK about it though.
9yo is very young to deal with this type of situation. You didn't killed him, you just didn't saved him. There is a difference. 
Why the hell did the bus driver wave pedestrians through on a red light!?! Is that a normal thing to do?
Completely the fault of the bus driver. Why the fuck would they wave on pedestrians at a green light?? 
I wonder how many lives you unknowingly saved by repoing someone's car.
Who was "they"? 
What makes you think that?
It may take or have taken you a long time to believe this, or maybe you never will, but you did him a really big favour. 
Your mom ran away? Were you left in the cab?
I had a similar but less serious incident as an adult in Taiwan. A friend dropped me off at the place I was staying. I opened the door on the kerb side and a kid on a bicycle slammed into it. He was ok, a few scratches. What some may not realize is that sidewalks are uncommon in Asia and so the area between buildings and cars is still road. The reaction of my friends suggested this was my fault and I should have looked before opening the door.
Bless you for all your work.
My girlfriend gets pissed when I don't respond to that kind of thing while doing something potentially dangerous. This is exactly the kind of thing I'm afraid of.   I'm sorry for your loss man.
What kind of bullying took place? How did people at your school, especially the bullies, react to his suicide?
Do you remember this or did your parents tell you? 
I had asthma as a kid. If I still do, it hasn't shown any signs for 20 years.My asthma attacks, as I remember them, weren't delayed. They didn't happen a day later from a triggering event. I could be wrong, I haven't had an attack in 20 years, medical knowledge has likely changed. I hate to say this, but not having his meds and refusing the hospital killed your father, not that ride. If that ride was the cause, I think it would have hit immediately.
That wasn't caused by you.  The asthma attack the next day wasn't affected by the ride the day before.
She's not been erased. You remember her.
Hey, you can potentially Google "accident x street x date" and find out what happenedIt's not your fault, and logically you probably know that, but I know survivors guilt, and I know it's not as simple as knowing and understanding that you're not at fault and couldn't have done anything. I'm sorry you're feeling that, and I wish you the best.
It's part of why I *fucking hate* driving with my father in the vehicle, He'll always be giving helpful nuggets while I'm trying to focus on driving, raising complaint when I don't go immediately, etc.
Her mom should have gave her a ride home instead of relying on strangers to do itNot your fault at all
Not your fault. You didn't kill her, in fact you thought that if you drove her she would be in more danger. You had no way of knowing Tiffany was that inexperienced and you wanted to protect Caitlyn.
Hey, it might not have been your kit that was used. Even if it was, you had no way of knowing what would happen.
I feel like it's hard to argue you gave them the means. They had to also obtain explosives right? You can't just make an Arduino explode. They probably could have controlled the payload with any other microcontroller too, and there are tons of them available via other means.I'm also surprised there isn't some kind of strict policy for destruction of materials brought on site.
That's what I was thinking too. Maybe knowing that her beloved grand children were harmed too was enough to drive her over the edge.
Im very sorry to hear about your sister, and thank you for the kind words. I've had to stop trying to associate 'blame' and who made the mistake where--it just goes down a hole that doesn't have a good outcome. 
They replaced the street lights that day, pretty fucked up it took a death to save a few cents. 
I don't know the full details on that, but I do know that the chat logs were saved so the blame was really taken off of us. We demonstrated meteorologically why we wanted hail. His argument was "I have more stripes, get rid of it." I just wound up having a discussion with my commander about it in private and he basically said that no one pulls rank on the weather. Next time this happens, we have to stick to our guns and don't get pushed around by a "senior" forecaster. 
It should have but in most cases the staff to aid ratio is ridiculous. Imagine being left to care for 33 people that's what our third shift does anywhere from 25 to 33 people most of them total care several are bariatric residents. CNA'S are not valued enough for what they do.
Yeah... when you consider that 'pulling the plug' often means starving to death or suffocating it really makes you wonder why we can't be more humane instead of waiting for people to die in horrible ways.
I agree with this. My grandmother died in misery. She was old and fragile with dementia and would just scream "kill me" at all the nurses for months before she died. It was cruel that she was kept alive long after her body and mind were gone. I wouldn't wish that suffering on anyone. 
I understand that that would've probably happened but I still wish I could've helped somehow.
Or suicidal, even drunk me would probably look for a more comfortable place to pass out than train tracks. 
The gun is always loaded.It's not a toy, end of story. A hunter should know better than to give a firearm to a kid outside a safe environment (shooting range).
Quite frankly she needs to go to jail (or an institution, where she can get a better sense of where the responsibility is). He did nothing wrong and shouldn't have to suffer for her loss. Everyone has bad things happen. Doesn't mean we get to go around attacking innocent people.
Good point. I was at a pool party for 6-7 year olds, and I remember diving into the pool and accidentally landing on one of the other kids who was lurking underneath the water. One of the adults saw this and pulled the kid out of the water. I am really thankful to have had that supervision.
We were at the ocean a few days before my sister's wedding. We had been body surfing the waves earlier hut everyone was up on the beach relaxing. We look out and see people yelling and waving and having a good old time out there. After like 5 minutes we realized they were actually in distress and took off into the water and saved them. It was crazy how close we were to just watching them drown.
The thing that makes it feel like my fault is that after his second DUI he asked me to keep his gun so it wasn't an option. He then asked for it back a few months later to go shooting, I reluctantly gave it back to him and said to give it back afterwards. He said he was getting counseling and other things to help with his troubles. I would compare him to Robin Williams, he was typically the life of the party and could cheer anyone up. It just hurts knowing the last thoughts about me were that I hated him. I didn't/don't, I was just frustrated with him because I cared about him.
Its easier to cope with the loss if there is some sort of scapegoat. They probably know on the inside he didnt do anything. And social pressures and not seeing the signs are why he'd blame himself If I were to guess. But the last part is very true. He obviously had the  intent to commit suicide, he would've done it one way or another. 
Yeah it's just that I felt at fault, and people drilled into my mind that it was me. Heck, even the local paper at the place said that the accident happened as a result of poor conduct on our behalf. When you see that in a newspaper it really fucks you up. 
I think this is very important.This reminds me of a post here where a little girl had to have surgery and she was not allowed to eat the day before. Of course her parent gave her food and she almost died.People often think that these questions/advices are "just protocol". It can help to remind them they might die.
If they've got something to hide, then they will hide it.  If you're lucky, you *might* get the truth if you get loved ones away from them, but then you also might not.
This and suicide by cop are just despicable acts leaving monstrous guilt and pain
It always seemed like I killed him in my 9 year old perspective. Like I was sitting there watching as he died thinking he was ok
He was the most lucid of all the people living there. He was the only one that could walk without help, and that only time we talked he was so depressed and told me how the nurses drugged them to sleep and how horrible that place was.And I thought painting something would make him happy.
If I remember correctly, I actually ran after her at some point, but she was so panicked she kept shouting "Go away!" whenever I tried to get close. 
I don't think they are, that guy was probably trying to save time during traffic. 
I Actually learned this from my grandmother when i was 13 
Fuck dude. 
I agree. Couldn't anyone just order an arduino online? I'm sure they're really easy to get anywhere. 
Thank you for the condolences, but my real message was, in instances like this, "blame" can't be directed - understanding the actual causes is almost as complex as understanding the results, and you were unfortunately caught up in a terrible story outside your own. I hope you've "moved on" as best as you can and have come to realize none of this was your fault - you were an unfortunate victim in someone else's story, and I hope it doesn't follow you
RN here CNA's do the most and receive the least
As an adult with training, maybe.As an eight year old? Not a chance. The *best* you could have *maybe* done was stay back and encourage him. But most likely you would have simply witnesses him going under for the last time first hand. Not a memory you need.Sorry you lost him that way.
Yeah as a non-firearm user this is the rule I live by. Can it fire a bullet?  If so, assume it's loaded.
As a former lifeguard, I was really nervous when I clicked that link and proud that I found the drowning kid quickly. You look for lack of sideways motion. For the kid going up and down. Arms out to the side, chin going under and coming up (but less each time). 
That was me when I was a teenager.  Was at the beach and swam out to a buoy -- I wasn't (and still am not) a good swimmer, and by the time I got there, I was completely exhausted.  I was hanging onto the buoy while frantically waving to a passing boat.  The passengers smiled and waved back.  Somehow I managed to swim back to the beach.  My body felt like it was on fire and I could see my entire chest move with my heart beat.
Fuck the media, they always make up shit. You were definitely not at fault here. 
I had a Spanish teacher in high school that was an anesthesiologist in Brazil before he moved to the US and told us about this happening. When they intubate someone they will gag when you're taking it out then if they ate or drank they will puke and immediately aspirate it back to their lungs and basically drown. 
My dad's a cardiologist and he calls this the "door stop". He's been practicing for almost 50 years, and says when someone is leaving his office, if they hesitate for even a fraction of a second at the door as they leave the exam room and don't sneeze, there's something they didn't tell you and you need to calmly figure out what it is. 
As another former paramedic: Many people don't even realize that the pills they take daily are medication. You'll ask them if they are on any medication and they say no, but once you start listing some of the standards for old people, many of them will remember that they actually take 4-5 different pills a day. It's pretty crazy (but then again many older people aren't really mentally healthy).
I'm 30, and I've broken my wrist tripping over a crack in the pavement that I didn't notice. I absolutely understand how elderly people could die from something like that - all it takes is a solid blow to the head and you're done.
trains too
But surely they should have warned you, and told you to turn him on his side if he choked? If you weren't there, it would have happened either way. If they had some kind of baby monitor, shouldnt  they have come in to check on him? They probably blame themselves but took it out on you as a coping mechanism. 
I mean, as a random person on the internet I just feel sorry for you. It's like you were chopping onions as a chef, at your workplace which is a normal thing for people to do where you are at, and someone threw a person on top of you and that person got stabbed. Like, what could you do, you tried with your human reflexes, and it wasn't enough for that time. I don't know how anyone could blame you.
You likely did him a huge favor. If I ever end up in a nursing home I hope someone will be there for me to do the exact same thing. Once all the quality of one's life is gone, remaining on earth is sheer torture.
oh god i am so sorry. how is your relationship nowadays?
That doesn't seem like a great age to learn that. Did it have a negative impact on you and would you rather not know it?
I don't think Amazon Prime covers Afghanistan. The only commercially produced product that is available for purchase in every inhabited place on earth is Coca Cola.
I've thought about every possible thing that could've happened differently and that one has been hard to think about. I wish I saw him one more time since I just turned around and he was gone but seeing him go under would be too much for me. 
As someone raised with guns who owns multiple this is me even to the annoyance of others. I can unload the gun myself and hand it to someone to look at and if they point it near me I will scold them. 
When you are in trouble in the water youre supposed to raise your arm with a closed fist so it doesnt look like you are waving. There needs to be more info about this sort of thing.
my mom was murdered and I was there and a week later when I went back to school everyone was asking me questions and the news made up shit saying she was hit by a baseball bat to the head. We didn't even own a baseball bat he just used his fists and punched her in the temple but yeah media is retarded.
I'm cringing at the thought of this. OWWWW. WOWWW
Me: Do you have any medical problems?78 year old Patient: Nope. None.Me: What do you take the Lipitor,  Coumadin and Metformin for?78 year old Patient: For my High Cholesterol, Afib, I have had a heart attack, PE. Oh and I'm diabetic. 
Train suicide can leave an incredibly gruesome scene as well. 
Everyone wants someone to point the finger at. 
It's true, after all quality of life is gone, every day is Hell. My father dealt with MS and Tinitus for a long long time waiting until my big brother and I were grown enough to understand and living our own lives before he took his.  He was unhappy for atleast a decade.  He went out with some dignity, he knew he wasn't getting any better.  Still, the best man I've ever known.
Uh... so in an unrelated incident 4 years ago right before I graduated high school, my parents kinda, for the lack of a better phrase, kicked me out? I wasn't able to do very well in programming like I had wanted and didn't build the prerequisites to go to UBC, and they basically went ballistic and never want to see me again. I'm living alone right now, and my parents haven't responded to my contact attempts since. I'm not sure if they're even in the country any more. 
It actually better knowing,my mom and I have had a complicated relationship,She said that she loved me(like any mom would) but could tell there was some form of resentment and its better knowing where the resentment came from 
I'm cringing that a Brazilian anesthesiologist found it more cost effective to teach Spanish (don't they speak Portuguese in Brazil?) than to re-qualify to practice medicine in the U.S.  Couldn't even be a nurse anesthetist?  We throw out a lot of immigrant expertise...
You should absolutely mention it always.  Just like people on Adderall should mention theirs.  It's a medicine that effects your body.   Now I wouldn't mention like the occasional Advil though. 
Most suicidal people don't want to leave a mess. But sometimes you just can't think of any other way. And depression changes your mind. When you go into a depressive fugue it's like the whole world is literally gray and grainy. The person in your head isn't you anymore.
that's for sure, I mean who the hell writes a jaywalking ticket after such an accident?
Sorry, your parents sound like assholes. 
are you asian yourself? 
The number of NYC taxi drivers with graduate degrees from their home countries is really rather astounding. 
I would add one should also disclose herbal or nontraditional medicines because some do interact with other  drugs. At one point, I used St John's Wort, and because I had heard of some interactions, I made a point of always disclosing. I also found that even the more skeptical health professionals would still rather know everything a patient is taking.
Yeah....particularly a dick move when it's the boyfriend of a girl who just fucking died. As if that guy doesn't have enough on his plate. Like all the guilt of not moving his girl, or being more careful about crossing the street or any of that.
I can't come with any argument against that, but honestly I don't think there's any possible positive outcome for me to hold a grudge against them. I might as well be dwelling on that asshole bully in grade 4. Note: I don't excuse my parents' behavior, and know that they treated me horribly, I'm just saying I don't think it's healthy for me to really hate them. All I want to do is just move on right now. 
Yeah, Japanese, but first generation Canadian, and that Asian parent stereotype had to come from somewhere. 
"I met someone and she opened my eyes," said my husband three weeks after our son was born. I'm still bleeding from that stab wound.
My best friend in college just stopped talking to me one day. Wouldn't respond to any texts or anything. It hurt, but I let it go. A year or so later I read in the paper that an old friend of ours had died, so I texted her to let her know. She responded with 'you have the wrong number'. Maybe that was the truth, but I couldn't help but think that it wasn't and for some reason this hurt more than her breaking things off with me.Years later she apologized out of the blue on Facebook which is nice I guess. But who the fuck does that?
My roommate tried to convince my girlfriend that I was secretly a rapist and a pedophile, got his girlfriend and some others and held an "intervention" where she couldn't leave until she said she was going to do something about me.Luckily, my girlfriend decided to talk to me, realized it was all bullshit, and is still by my side today. My roommate dropped out of college and still hasn't finished their degree.
I was in a band with some friends in high school.  I wrote all the songs we played.  They kicked me out and said they didn't like my music anymore and wanted to go another direction.  I later found out they had booked a show and played my songs they said they hated.  I felt pretty crummy after hearing that.
I invited all my high school "friends" to my birthday party and none of them showed up. Luckily I had my 2 close friends from outside of school show up and still have a good time. Went back to school that Monday and instead of sitting at their table I took a chance and sat with this girl I had a crush on, we dated throughout highschool and then some so it worked out.
 Best friend of many years tried to break up me and my then- boyfriend by fabricating evidence he was cheating on me.  Never figured out if it was her being possessive of me or if she wanted to date him.    Edit - it has become apparent this wording was misleading and I apparently distressed some people.  Then- boyfriend because we've since gotten engaged,  not because we've since broken up.  Thank you to all the kind people out there congratulating :)
Was friends with a guy since middle school. We were inseparable. I helped him with his depression, got him to move out of his parents house, supported him when he was emotionally wrecked, etc. But the moment I lost my job and became depressed, he wasn't there for me. Stopped talking to me, hanging out with me, answering my messages. Asked him why he was ignoring me and he said I was being too sad. 
My little sister literally stabbed my back with a pencil when we were young, does that count? 
I just found out two of my closest friends have been cat-fishing me with pictures of an Israeli supermodel for the past couple weeks, so that was pretty cool of them. 
My friend of nearly 25 years happily ended our friendship over a few thousand bucks he owed me. Hey Bill, if you are reading this, go sit on an AIDS needle. 
I learned my "friends" weren't actually my friends during an acid trip. I was already having a bad trip and they fucked me up even more by telling me things like how I would never be able to have a real relationship and that I'd fucked my brain up for life. Needless to say, I spent the next 20hrs trying to hold myself together while those thoughts kept racing through my mind. I'm still not me
Reading the first 10 answers made me realise I have good friends...Thanks OP.
I picked up the rocket launcher and my friend thought he should have it more, so he meleed me in the back and took it. Then proceeded to miss all his shots. 
True friends stab you in the front 
I was playing risk and a bit into the game me and my friend kinda teamed up with me to take out someone else. After a While it was my friends again and he redeemed his cards to place twenty something troops on our border (He had Europe and some of Asia, I had Africa and South America) and attacked me. He kicked my ass
Holy shit my bloods boiling from just reading this. I can't imagine what I would've done in your position. 
> Caught her red handed cheating on me. She swore up and down it was a misunderstanding, and since I loved her, I believed every word.Love makes people believe and do crazy stuff. Hope you are better these days.
I hope his prostate falls out
Junkies with kids? Might explain why the kids stayed somewhere else.  
Why didn't you find them and get your stuff back?
Wow, what a piece of shit. If you ever see him again tell him from me that he is a big twat.
This is just painful to read dude. Were you in high school when you past your best friend? Do you know why they did this to you? Why didn't you beat his ass up?
But why did your roommate do it.
They were totally different songs. You see, yours were like "ding ding ding ding da da ding ding". But theirs were like "da ding ding ding da da ding ding". Completely different songs.
Feel good about yourself! They didn't/ couldn't do what you did, sounds like they needed you more than you needed them.
How can they kick you out of what is yours?
Well at least you got megadeth right.
Fuck em, that just means they're incapable of writing their own songs and that you will be more successful than them. And I bet if you looked hard enough you could replace them all with more talented musicians and be much better than you ever were with them.
Wow. That is a man at the mercy of his own dick.
She sounds like a right cunt too.
God, the level of revenge I would invoke on her.  I would literally volunteer pro-bono for the other side on any case that she is involved with, just so I could destroy her in the courtroom.  The last thing anyone should do is fuck with a seasoned lawyer.
... I would have shown up forsure.
There's a reason why her bf kicked her out 
Why not interrupt when it's clear he's flirting to ruin his "game", by saying something like "oh that's a funny story, were you out with your wife when that happened?"
That is the type of guy who going to end up cheating on his wife.
I stayed friends as best I could with an ex of mine. On the surface, things seemed pretty bad as she started dating my roommate. But on the inside, she was conspiring with another friend of mine to keep me single. They told the girl I crushed on that I was just using her to make my ex jealous. Made that girl cry. Eventually made me cry after all was said and done.It's been a year and a half and I have no regrets. The other "friend" was a shitty person anyways. Edit 4/1/17: I have not forgotten these events, though I legitimately wish everyone the best despite this.
How do you know it was fabricated?
If dude had depression issues then this is plausible. It's shitty but plausible. 2 depressed people are much worse than just 1. 
It's possible he just wasn't strong enough to bear your burdens along with his own.  I've definitely had to step back from helping someone because I wasn't able to do it without getting bogged down myself 
That is when you break ties with your sister and stop talking to her/being around her.
Fuck the former friend. But fuck the idiot VP the most. He had no business being a manager. 
Man, some people are sadistic. I don't get why they would get joy out of others' suffering, and to be aware that people who do that ARE sick, and yet do it themselves? Sociopathic...These are people that eventually become the same conniving snakes in the workplace, causing toxic environments and office politics.
> So, being stereotypically Jewish...Made the story for me. Mazel tov.
that last line makes it seem like your mom is in hell. or maybe she's in heaven and reaching down to make Brian's life miserable?
I have no idea how long ago this was, but if you were to sue him in civil court, you don't need "beyond a reasonable doubt," just a preponderance of evidence.  Basically if it's more likely that he did it than that he didn't do it.
You guys still togeather?
Dude! Same thing happened to me in college. I introduced a large group of my friends to a large group of my gf's friends early on in the relationship. After the break up, they all pretty much left me in the dirt. But oh well, life goes on and you find the ones who stuck with ya are the true friends. Or fuck it and you find others.
That sucks man. Really sucks being silently replaced like that. That happened to me in the first band I was in. We hadn't practiced in a while because the drummer was "busy". Turns out thats just code for "we got a new guitarist". 
"Sorry bud, the gig is up" But actually that sounds really shitty, hope you're doing better
Thats tough...like the time Jack Black got kicked out his own band :'( 
WTF I came here to say that same thing!Had a friend message me on AIM saying he's sorry my band broke up.  I told him we didn't, and then he insisted.  Went to the band chat and sure enough the drummer and bassist decided to use a joke 'side project' band as an excuse to quit, and they never played any gigs with any bands ever again.  I think the singer/songwriter still thinks I left his band.
Dylan must be super cool to forgive such a tragedy
That's a pretty cheap way of finding out someone is an asshole. After 30 years friendship it could have been a lot worse. 
My God what a wonderful ending. Completely infuriating, though, that the teacher was able to get away with so much. How long ago was this?
Atleast she got what she deserved, she is everything what is wrong with education :/
I would make a huge deal out of this by saying, " Oh, isn't it fantastic that we'll share the same wedding anniversary?!" My bet is it will drive your friend's fiance crazy, and maybe you'll get lucky and they'll change the date. Kill her with kindness.
I got stabbed in the chest with a pencil by one of my good friends. We both got suspended. 
I got stabbed in the forehead by a mechanical pencil by my classmate in Grade 2. Couple years later I found out that she liked me and did it to get attention.
Do they know you know? Or do you have a chance to mess with them back?
There are two sure ways to lose a friend.  One is to loan money to a friend and the other is to borrow money from a friend.
I don't think giving someone your email and password is something that normally happens over time, especially with something as important as school. 
dumb pieces of shit. your life should not be entertainment for others.
My best friend and I were fishing and he cast his line and hooked his own back. I was confused as to why he was yelling and reaching for his back, then I realized what happened. You brilliant idiot. Hooks are for fishes. 
Ugh, I squirmed in my seat reading your story. What assholes. So sorry, friend. I don't trust people either.
Safe to say you weren't the best man?
My best friend has dated two of my exes. They're my exes for a reason, and if they're happy together then who am I to judge. Having said that I told the first one, "I was here before you, and I'll be here long after you're gone". I was right. 
To be honest I was very angry about it, and very hurt but I had so much to do with just picking up the pieces that I couldn't even focus on them. After the graduation, what I really took from the situation is learning that I never want to make anyone feel the way I felt when they hurt me. I've been more open and more strict about honoring commitments and making sure people I care about can count on me when they are helpless. It would be nice to see where this attitude gets them in a few years, but I think it's best to try and cast them away from my thoughts.
"You know, it's funny; when you look at someone through rose colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags."
That can happen??? Oh god!
Game developers go to the same conferences casino game designers go to so they can learn tactics of how to reel people in.
And don't forget to punch him in the face!
Not OP, but my guess is that his roommate was a rapist pedophile and wanted to get the suspicion off of him.Or maybe he was just an asshole.
Found Vanilla Ice.
But the legend of the rent, was WAY PAST DUE 
There were 3 of them and 1 of me.
I'm just impressed by the commitment. He lost 100 pounds to ask someone out? Wow
Yeah, he always has been. He'd always been very overweight, and immediately friendzoned by any woman he's ever really liked. Don't even get me started on the fuckshop that is his marriage now. oy. 
I mean, if there was free pizza, shit even I would show up in the weirdo's house.
Can't wait to read the new boyfriend's post in 6 months on the next thread like this...
You're a drug dealer, aren't you?
Giving "business stuff" to friends eh? Just lying around the house you say? How much for a gram 
yes 100%. I dated someone once who was devastatingly handsome and whenever we talked about marriage he said "I don't believe in me wearing a ring, it's different for you, you have to". Thought that was a pretty big red flag.
 Yeah exactly.  When I figured out what she was doing I cut her out of my life like a tumor.  Didn't make it into a big scene filled with drama, just quietly turned and walked away from that friendship.  Don't need that in my life.  
My ex told my new gf that if i could break up with her, I could break up with my new gf too, that we would never be happy; to my new gf's face, in her house, in front of her parents.That was 13 years ago, my then new gf and I have been together ever since and have been married for 6 of those 13 years.
Because he smelled something off early on and A) told me immediately he felt uncomfortable with stuff that was happening, stuff she was doing, ways she was contacting him etc and B) began documenting all communication she had with him,  messenger logs, texts etc and proactively gave them to me *before* she tried to take pieces of them and show them to me to put him in a bad light (which she did).  I didn't ask him to or anything.   He could tell she was behaving oddly about stuff and kept me in the loop.  That good communication probably single handedly saved our relationship.    
My boyfriend and I both have repeated lapses of depression... Most of the time is fine.... But sometimes it gets really ugly.When he is trying to cheer me up, it's usually okay. But if he gets into a funk I can't pull him out of, I get really depressed and sometimes breakdown for multiple days because of the feeling of unrelenting guilt that I can't help him the way he helps me.As much as I love my boyfriend. My depression makes it really hard to be near him sometimes.
[](/cocosad)Hard to judge on a case-by-case basis, but I get what you're saying. Helping someone with depression, especially when they're depressed for extremely long periods of time, can be very draining. 
Not to mention a VP shouldn't be going directly to an employee if there's a manager between them.  Chain of command is important in any business structure and both his former friend and the VP broke it by circumventing the manager.  Shitty deal.
So many people try to deny that this happens, it's refreshing to see people talking about this type of behavior.I've been the above board, blunt, "I'm just here to work" type of person my whole life, but the type that wants to create havoc for no reason has been a burden through most of my professional life. The less you participate, the more they single you out with this shit, it seems.
"Hey God, can I take a trip down to hell real quick? I'll only be a second""Is it about brian?""Yes...'"Take as long as you need"
Growing up I was told that everyone goes to "heaven". But once you get there you have a complete understanding of everything you did in your life. If you did something good but didn't realize the impact it had now you do and it feels good. But if you did something awful that didn't bother you when you did it, now it does and you have to live with that horrible guilt for all of eternity. Your own personal hell.
What's code for "we got a new drummer"? 
The news is out
I feel like maybe I have some insight . . . Musicians, as people, tend to fucking suck, at least when it comes to behaving responsibly. Especially within the world of punk/rock/etc., a vast majority of musicians are more concerned with the cult of themselves than they are with writing music. People and relationships tend not to matter enough to do the right thing. source: been playing in bands for 15+ years 
Or he's plotting his revenge...
Seriously RuneScape is no fucking joke
Nah, I knew them both pretty well and there was also a bit more backstory as to why those two stopped being friends, so I knew it was true.
Yeah it still hurts if I'm being honest. I miss what we had. He's spoken about it to a few mutual friends and is all for moving on apparently, as it's 'ancient history' in his eyes... but once you lose trust in who you thought was your closest friend, there's not really any going back.It's not, and never was, about the money. Cheers.
I was stabbed in the hand with a pen by a girl in my class. She showed me her boobs a couple years later. We were cool after that.
>Stabbed in the chest>good friends[ ](/spikewtf)Why exactly was your good friend stabbing you?Reminds me of some girl I knew in HS who stabbed her best friend with a syringe full of water because she "wanted to see what would happen." 
I made it abundantly clear to them that I'm aware of what they did. Would having a third party send them a fake "local man found dead after harmful prank" news article be too much? 
You clearly haven't played Settlers of Catan with friends
Yeah, I'll happily *give* money to a friend, but I'll never lend it.
You know those emails you get about avoiding obvious phishing links and keeping your password safe? That's the person they're for.
I once stepped barefoot onto a pile of fishhooks that was sitting on one end of the dock. I don't know why the guy thought leaving them there was okay, but it definitely was not. My brother spent the next hour pulling hooks out of my foot. 
I mean, anal prolapses are a thing...
Is it not about as shitty as it gets when, in the middle of your grieving and planning the funeral and all of that, you have to plan for someone to be at your or the deceased's place in order to prevent from being robbed?
List some of the bad ideas they had 
I feel sorry for you. But she obviously mixed up guitar and bass so, in the end, she definitely was a moron 
Selfies with the judge?
And steal his Runescape items!
Couldn't help but chuckle at the "two bottle of mountain dew a day" comment.
Now if only someone was looking
DA-NA-NUNANAAAH-NUNANAAH doo doo doo dumb dumb da na na na nahh WELL YOU THINK YOU'LL BE JUSST FINEEE?? WITHOUT ME BUT YOUR MINEE!
Judging by how she handles things, I'd give it a lot less than 6 months
He deals in "business stuff" and "business stuff" accessories. 
why would he even admit to that?
That's a good man right there. Sorry it didn't work out.
This makes me think of my old roommates. They are absolutely perfect for each other, but both struggle with mental health issues, primarily depression. It's pretty easy for them to spiral. He is upset and She doesn't feel like she can help, which makes Her upset, which then makes Him more upset because he realizes that his depression has made Her upset and so on. Like you said they are mostly okay, but sometimes a minor incident will cause a week of them being down. They basically never get mad each other, but are sad at each other which is almost worse.
Agreed. VP should've immediately contacted their direct superior and been like "why is this dumb fuck bothering *me* with this pointless bullshit? I have *real* work to do." 
"and here, take my nail bat"
This made me laugh. Thank you! 
This is the truth. Workplaces are just "edgier" and more deceitful high schools.. only difference is you get a paycheck for attending. 
They're playing without me.
My friend wanted me to stop being so addicted to runescape and when I went to get food in the kitchen he sat at my computer and dropped all my armor (rune of course) and ever since then, I think back at it, and see it as more of a favor 
But what if he made it all up to trick you and over an elaborate scheme taking place over 20 years he will steal your identity and all your wealth just to buy weed?
I got stabbed in the hand with a pencil a few months before getting stabbed in the chest. 7th grade was not my favorite year. 
> Reminds me of some girl I knew in HS who stabbed her best friend with a syringe full of water because she "wanted to see what would happen."Man, teenagers do stupid shit and I hope she realizes someday how lucky she is, because 9 times out of 10 that will do nothing, but it *could* literally kill someone. Had she accidentally killed her friend she would have been fucked up forever
*rolls a 7*YOU MOTHERFUCKER YOU HAD A SHEEP ALL THIS TIME. I JUST SPENT 4 CLAY ON THAT SHEEP
This is what dogs are for.
Leave him his trimmed armor, at least. Don't be heartless.
One of these things is not like the others.
YOU THINK YOU CAN KICK ME OUT OF THE BAND and then Zach you come in with a facemelter
No,  no.  Then- boyfriend because we're engaged now. I kept a man like him around :)
"actually, i think it's around the time we go to war with hell anyway. jesus, sound the horns. and get me my nail bat."
The freedom of a workplace is amazing compared to a school setting. 
The guitarist said, "you look dead."
Possible. I'll keep an eye on him.
Did you see tits?
You got suspended... For being stabbed? Because they assumed you must have deserved it?
Turn it on its side and "Celloooooooo" you've got a bass.
OH. Then CON-FUCKING-GRATULATIONS. Original wording can be...misleading.
"Dad you know I don't like nails" "Just get the bat medamnit"
Betrayed kinda low key...
We just want what's best for you fam 
Jesus Christ they sound like morons. 
Huh. I would have gone with congratu-fucking-lations. 
Nevermore was asked to play.
What if all these posts talking about how concert friend is the bad friend is actually the other "friend" trying his manipulative tactics once more? 
Every account on reddit is this manipulative piece of shit except you.
Getting hacked. I work in IT, and have to convince at least one person every week that some tiny change or inconvenience on their company computer or phone does NOT mean you were hacked. Forgetting your email password because you're too good to write it down does NOT mean you were hacked. Receiving that spam email about penis enlargement does NOT mean you were hacked. Skype cutting in and out during a conference call due to poor connection does NOT mean you were getting hacked.Just be smart, and if you don't know what something is-- don't click on it.
Kids sports. I coached kids soccer for 7 year olds and there would be parents screaming at their kids during the game and you'd have to ask them to quiet down. It's just a game, people 
Gluten-free dietsSome people can't eat gluten. Some people can, but mistakenly believe that avoiding it will help them lose weight. The nice thing about the latter group is that restaurants are now more likely to provide gluten-free options for those who actually need them. 
Nuclear reactors. They don't explode like a nuclear bomb.
I don't know about everyone, but I wish the robin who spends 18 hours out of every day launching himself at my daughter's bedroom window, would calm the fuck down about his reflection and cut that shit out.
Folks who get pissed at long lines at places you know are going to have a long line. Like the DMV, the Post Office, or Doctors office. You knew it was going to take awhile. Bring a fucking book or use that magical mobile device to entertain yourself silly!
I am the most valuable part of my life. If the money is lost, the girl leaves, the house burns down..I am the one who can rebuild and re-accomplish it all. I've done it before when I was scared and new.Also, exercise. Keep all your shit calm and collected.
A lot of people in the film industry are sure getting their panties in a twist about Netflix
What phone other people use.  Seriously, why do you even care?Platform advocacy in general is just stupid.  Nintendo vs. Sega was a fun battle for middle school, but so many people just don't seem to grow out of it.
Currently sitting in an airport waiting to board a flight, and every time there's been an announcement saying that our flight is going to be delayed a little longer, the lady in front of me yells at the flight attendants, from the comfort of her own seat.... Like I understand that you're frustrated about it but your yelling doesn't help the plane get to the gate faster!!!
Getting on a plane. We've all bought tickets. We've all reserved seats. We're all getting on this plane (unless you're flying United - topical) so why queue or push or add to the already stressful experience of making it onto a flight on time by turning an otherwise civilised experience into some kind of aviation-based Hunger Games?! 
Well in Ireland we are having great weather , peaks for 22 degrees a day(very unusual for Ireland)All I see all day on social media is sun this and sun that. Irish people need to calm the fuck down. Or in Irish terms 'calm de feck down wouldya'Edit - to avoid some peoples confusion , I am in fact Irish
Most things.  Not worth it.
When the plane lands. Everybody stands up gets their luggage and stand still for 15 min whilst they deploy the stairs. Whilst I chill and continue watching netflix downloads. Also when "boarding the plane xyz" is called. Everybody crowds to it, and proceeding to wait 40 min or so in a line with hand luggage. Whilst I chill and continue to watch Netflix downloads sitting down, 10ft away from the queue and being the last one. CALM FOCK DOWN
I'm an Android guy, an Android enthusiast if you will.. the whole debate about iPhone vs Android really needs to die. Both are good options and both have pros and cons.
That Elvis person all the young kids are so into now. The way he moves his hips, that just shouldn't be shown on TV. It's obscene!
Millennial's work ethic. I work with quite a few millenials and it seems to me the only reason they work less than baby boomers is because they use technology to their advantage.
What a save!What a save!What a save!
Avocado toast and $4 coffees. Apparently it's killing the American dream.
Millennials.  I keep seeing articles about how they're unbelievably lazy and have a disproportionate sense of entitlement.   I'm sure *some* do, but that's not reason enough to get hysterical about the entire generation.
Fidget spinners. People get so fucking angry over them it's incredible. Some guy the other day said a fidget spinners app was the downfall of society or something.
"OMG, the world is violent compared to how it used to be."Its always been violent. If anything, its less violent. With that said, we should never settle for something we can improve. Let's keep working to make the world a better place, but maintain perspective while doing it.
Every damned thing. I've never seen so many people offended over stupid shit in my life. 
Bandwagon-hating every trend.Let people do their shit smh
Hating stuff because it got popular."Twenty One Pilots is TERRIBLE! Emo trash!""The new Star Wars movie has NO REDEEMING QUALITIES! Sheep!""*insert video game here HAS THE WORST FANBASE! So cringe!"We get it, you like being an isolated hipster who only enjoys fringe shit. Go back to your corner where nobody can hear you scoffing under your breath."Hipsters are the WORST, amiright!? Who do they think they are?"
Call of Duty WWII having female characters in the French Resistance faction. It's not because of SJWs they added them, but because there were in fact women in the French Resistance 
Today is the last day for the Seniors at my high school and everyone is acting like all of these seniors are about to die and they will never be able to talk to them again. I just showed up to school 10 minutes ago and I have already seen more tears than the day after 2 girls committed suicide in the same week.
Making every tragedy an opportunity for showing *just how much you care*.Yes bombings are sad, yes ISIS are assholes, but putting a flag on your profile picture ain't gonna do shit, and doesn't make you a good person. 
The recent health craze going on. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for healthier eating, getting more exercise and seeing a healthier population (especially with kids), but almost everything is okay in moderation. A chocolate brownie doesn't need to be substituted for a dark cocoa powdered, spinach-banana, flax seed "brownie."
it's only game, why you heff to be mad
Reminds me of those parents who took their kids to see Deadpool and lost their shit, demanding their money back and threatening to sue, because there was adult themes in a comic book movie. It's fucking rated R, you idiot. What did you think was gonna happen? That's some lazy, shitty, goddamn parenting. 
Fun fact: Nuclear reactors are designed to not explode. Nuclear bombs are designed to explode.
But what if you put a nuclear bomb in it?Checkmate, atheists.
Put a sticker on the window. It doesn't have to be huge. 
I'm sorry I bought a robin costume and didn't know what else to do with it. 
Get a bat, man
What's even better, once I stopped feeling like having superior taste was important I realized I actually liked a lot of that stuff. Some popular music is terrible and will be forgotten but some of it is great and will be remembered for a long time. Missing out on it because "popular = bad" is just dumb. I like Coldplay all because I forgot about the stigma and gave them an honest chance.
THANK YOUI come from the jazz and classical worlds of music, and 9/10 people in those communities say things like "you have to actually study it to understand this sophisticated music" or "oh, you haven't heard this album/piece? You're not a REAL fan." Then they wonder why more people aren't becoming interested in their music. It's a real problem that I hope goes away in my lifetime.
Nah, I think it's pretty legit to be pissed that you have to wait a long time at the doctor's office. You make *appointments* at those places. If they're not ready for you at your appointment time, they fucked up.
Also, kids know the difference between when they've "won" something and when they've been "given" something, so this idea that it's creating a soft culture is some seriously overblown and stupid bullshit.The generation that created participation trophies cause they couldn't handle their kids being average at something is now shitting on kids for having participation trophies. It's insane.
It's fun to compare the objective pros and cons of technology, but it's pretty rare that *A* is better than *B* at everything rings true.There are things I love/hate about iOS, Android, Windows, Linux, OS X, BSD, etc.
The only reason to care what phone other people use is if you're seeking information to evaluate which one YOU want. "Oh, you have that phone! How do you like X? How does it compare to Y?" But the pissing contest about "Why would you want that phone?" is stupid. It's right up there next to the console VS PC shit. 
Agreed. I've had long delays happen a couple of times. Yelling at the staff doesn't change the situation, neither does sitting around and talking shit loudly in hopes that others will join them. 
Also people lining up in line or "next to" the line before their boarding group. C'mon your ticket is assigned and you'll get on the plane before it takes off I promise. 
And calm down about the refs.  They are usually only a couple of years older than the kids they are refereeing/umpiring.  My son loves baseball.  He qualified as an umpire when he was around 12.  He knew the rules better than the grown ups, but it was also meant to be a learning time.  He did it for one year and quit.  The parents were horrible to him.  I remember a huuuuge father leaning over him and yelling at him about a call.  Fuck that guy.
I coach 12s and 13s and by far the worst part is the parents. I've had parents rip their kid's faces off before the fucking game even started! Like, they're in the stretching lines in tears. How the hell are they supposed to perform with that on their shoulders?And as much as I'd like to I can't really go tell them their parents are wang-rods or anything, fuck it sucks.
Because there is always "limited space in the overhead bins"
Reverse Seasonal Affective Disorder. 
We're going to hit 30 on saturday in Britain. The weather forecast just slapped a huge 30 over the whole island in a "its gonna be s hot the specifics dont even matter" kinda way.
It is because Irish people are really pale and when the sun comes out it burns those soulless creatures.
I stand up even though I know I have a 15 minute wait simply because I need to try to get some feeling back into my long legs before I have to walk off the plane. 
I feel you there. I have a cousin who deployed to Iraq a couple times and it's incredibly sad to see how much the war fucked him up. It was also interesting meeting other guys from his unit at his wedding, the general vibe I got from that group was interesting. 
He makes me want to chew gum and stay out past curfew!
I started my first office job recently, at a subsidiary of a fortune 100 company. I work with 5 other people and they're all older than 40 and have been working there for several years. Most of the job *should* be done through computers, but several aspects are still done with a pen and paper because they can't adapt to the technology. I had to show someone how to download files from an email and attach them in another. They had worked there for YEARS. I did all of the daily tasks in under an hour and they were amazed.

For real. Chat disabled is the only way to play some days.

r/outoftheloop, can you explain it to me ?
Apparently its killed the Australian one.
The people selling the expensive toast and coffee *are* the American dream though...
But it killed the housing market*\* - not the record low salaries, massive student costs/debt, physical mobility required for jobs now, etc
The worst is when millennials themselves write these kinds of articles. Way to throw your entire generation under the bus assholes.
I feel some people use the word 'Millennials' as a synonym for 'young people' :/
Moist. Moist. Moist. Moist. Moist.(40 minutes)
As a high school teacher of Freshman, I think I'm allowed a little hate. I have exactly one kid with ADHD that correctly utilizes his fidget cube and spinner. ( No issue with this kid)All the rest?Why the fuck do you need one that lights up and makes noise.(Also bottle flipping smh)
It's been getting less violent but in exchange, we're now able to see every violent thing that happens. 
Man, I wish more people understood this. Yes the world is fully of shitty people and things, but it's a hell of a lot less shitty that it was even a few decades ago.I think part of the problem is that the time period people tend to fantasise about is almost always the era in which they grew up. If you had an ok childhood then that period will always seem better than the one where you're an adult, burdened by responsiblities and aware of all the crap going on.The 1950s seems to be a particular favorite.
Hey, calm down.
It always amused me that shows like Breaking Bad were packed full of violence, gore (the ol dissolving bodies in a bathtub) and drug use, yet using the word "fuck" more than once a season was apparently where AMC drew the line. As if people old enough to tolerate the rest aren't old enough to have heard the word fuck a million times. 
ERMEHGERD FIGDET SPINERS NED 2 DIEEEEE
That sounds like elitism with extra steps 
I don't do the flag on the profile because you have that really awkward moment when you have to take it down...
The number of people probably googling "Manchester Flag" over the past couple of days...
It's called virtue signalling.> Virtue signalling is the conspicuous expression of moral values by an individual done primarily with the intent of enhancing that person's standing within a social group.Companies do it all the time these days.
People need to calm down about food preferences in general. Like, if you want to pour your milk before your cereal or put ice in your milk, then you do you. 
Right? I am all for being a more health conscious population (i.e. maintaining a healthy, balanced diet) but some of the advice I have seen come out of the "movement" is sometimes just hyperbolic. 
>Just calm down. It's something we've been doing forever. Why am I being made aware of this just now? And more importantly why don't I have any recollection of it all?
I mean, *I* care about the sex *I'm* having or not having. I think it's fair to say we each care about our own sex.But yeah, other people shouldn't. Generally.As long as, you know, it's consensual. Effective consent, none of that namby-pamby, "well, she technically said yes" consent. And you're not cheating on anybody. 
the universe is so humongous big
came for this, was not disappointed
Reminds me of when some mom brought her 5yr old and 2yr old in a stroller to see Logan. They promptly walked right out when the bachelorette flashed her tits. Like, I don't know what the mom was expecting
And people who could not afford Samurai did not hire Samurai.

Hang around with an older man who wants some young Dick to mentor. 
I didn't know the stigma existed when I started liking Coldplay. And I was honestly surprised to learn about it. Same with Nickelback. I didn't grow up listening to any type of rock music, so they sounded fairly average when compared to other musicians in the same genre. 
I used to hate any hip-hop that was at all gangster or "ignorant". I got over that stupidity a few years ago and I've found so much more music that I love.The best way to listen to music is to always go in to it wanting to enjoy it. My listening habits are so much better now that I'm open minded about everything.
I personally felt that AvA 23 was when the series hit its peak 
I mean. They do all the time and no one goes to watch it. There are plenty of original top tier films in the past couple years and they did well for their budget but they did abysmal compared to what alien vs avengers would pull. At some point you have to blame the audience. 
But Sega doesn't do what NintenDO
I've got a MacBook and a Windows desktop, they're both great. I use them for different things, they're both great machines that I don't regret investing it at all.
Oh I love the ones that say "I'm never flying this airline again" out loud when it's something like a delay to the gate or a weather diversion that has nothing to do with that specific airline. 
**"ON A GOOD DAY, BACK WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE, I USED TO FUCK AROUND AND GET A TRIPLE DOUBLE."**
Football/Soccer coach here, can confirm.  It's mostly those parents who themselves failed miserably in their youth doing the sport, who now expect their kids to do better.
When I was like 9 there was a kid on my team with 1 arm (no idea if he was in an accident or it was a birth defect or what) and I remember one game he was in the on deck circle taking practice swings and his mom came up to the fence and started scolding him about him not having a hit all season and that he better get one that at bat.  The kid had 1 fuckin arm, the fact that he could even swing the bat 1 handed at that age was good enough in my eyes.
To be fair, if it's 25 or 28 or 30 the result in the UK is the same:Overweight men will still walk around with their shirts off. Every single woman under a certain age will wear one of those long, maxi dresses, regardless of whether they owned one before this week. The Sun will have a picture of some students in bikinis on Brighton beach, together with a 'heat' based pun. The entire population of Scotland will turn bright red and shed their skin. 
Not anymore there's a blanket
I live in American Australia, can confirm. 
I so pale.
Have a couple of friends in different branches, the ones that have never seen combat or been deployed are all mouthy about wanting to blow shit up etcThe two that actually got deployed, don't speak much about it and when they came back, they weren't the same. They have a look about them that just screams 'I've seen shit' but I know they will never talk to me about it.
He makes me want to overdose on bennies and drag race my friends until the loser dies in a fiery crash. #real1950s
Usually it is ok, and if people start saying I am trash I just laugh because that means that they are just as terrible at this game as me.Especially in Bronze, what the hell are players expecting? 
Fuckin Smite man, dude can be feeding and you die once then he starts this bullshit.
What the comment is referring to is the game chat in Rocket League. One of the quick chat commands is "What a save!" which was likely intended to be used to congratulate teammates, but is now used sarcastically when the enemy team scores a goal.
If I hadn't bought that avocado three years back I'd own a home outright and be set up for retirement by forty five...
This expensive toast actually sounds pretty tasty.....going to the store so I can some right now. I guess it's not expensive toast anymore though if I make it myself. 
I have personally cut back on my avocado toast consumption. I am now a millionaire. 
>Old man yells at cloudMystery solved. 
And the funny thing is that so many Gen Xers have forgotten about how we used to be the ones who were stereotyped when we were in our teens/20s. I've got a friend who's a couple of years older than me who's always going on about "entitled millennials". When I remind her that boomers used to whine about us being "slackers" her response is always "um, no, that was different, these kids really are entitled." It's almost like it's a symptom of being young.
My brother was yelling at me for no reason, and his main argument was that I was a millennial.  Bro, you're 2 years older than me. You were born in 1991.You're a millennial, too.
Like the people 17 and under as of now aren't even millennials, they're technically gen z
Pokemon actually has been absurdly popular again, at least where I'm from.  I made about a good 150 splitting up my old cards into little makeshift booster packs, and selling them to my friends and coworkers for their kids.  Fidget spinners, on the other hand, have already taken a huge nosedive.  Like, one week they were all the rage, and now the kids are over them.Its kinda funny since Reddit seems intent on hating anything kids like, but by the time they get around to circlejerking about it, the kids have already moved on to the next thing.  
> If you aren't a middle schooler, odds are your primary exposure to these things comes either from Facebook or from complaints on Reddit.Reddit complaining is the sole source of my knowledge of silly trends, SJW, fat pride, angry feminists, flat-earthers, anti-vaxers and a lot more. It's never something I see in real life, sometimes I doubt that these things actually exists. 
No.. you calm down.
'Say my name''Heisenberg''You're gosh dang right'
As odd of a trend as it is... it is nice seeing my one fifth grader who, according to his IEP, is required to have a small box of fidgets.... well, all of a sudden he is a cool kid, not the weirdo with the box of toys he gets to play with while everyone else sits and learns.  In fact, he has things ten times cooler than the spinner that people all of a sudden want to borrow and tinker with.
I really do hate this brigade against fidget spinners. Wasn't it not so long ago that people were crying out about kids not playing with physical toys and just glued to their screens? And now there's a cheap physical toy that everyone loves, and people are losing their heads again.
Your teacher was an arse. 
<3 My Chemical Romance sticker sales have gone through the roof!
Fun fact: Jesus was against virtue signalling.Matthew 6:1"Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven. So when you give to the needy, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be praised by men. "
Maybe I got whooshed but the humor is supposed to be in the debate itself. One of the many memes where the joke is the gross over exaggeration. I.e harambe, gingers having no soul , mei being the actual devil spawn and the whole   Sugar vs salt on grits Thing.I personally see it as a cheeky ribbing between the two parties.Sorry if I'm being captain obvious.
Scientific research over the years has shown that if people sometimes can't recollect an incident, it's because the incident never happened.
If only we could get Bryz to replace Mike Milbury on NBC Sports.

Probably thought it would just be blood and violence - you know, stuff that's perfectly fine for children to see. They didn't expect there to be anything actually adult, like boobs.

Not to mention TV technology has progressed to the point where the quality doesn't even diminish if watched at home.  Maybe the screen won't be as huge, but it makes it even harder to justify a $20 ticket.  
Sir? SIR. WAKE UP SIR. I ASKED IF YOU'D LIKE AN IN-FLIGHT BEVERAGE.
I was on a Southwest flight and some parents were letting their kid run up and down the aisle with their hands out tapping seats. Taptaptaptap laugh.  People were giving dirty looks but the parents were oblivious and no one said anything. This went on and off a couple of times.During the beverage service the kid bumped into the flight attendant who looked back over her shoulder and said, "Hey kid, why don't you go play outside.". It was glorious.
....Dwight?
Should have called child services with him threatening the kid as well.
Damn that's awesome. So what did he like quit his job and just become a full time sports league manager or what?
So how does he deal with parents going "Aw come on Jimmy! You can do better!" Or coaches yelling at players across the field so they can be heard? 
Piece of shit here, can confirm. Always disappointed my kids don't live up to the idea in my head of how good I could have been if I didn't suck so hard. Maybe if I just yell some more they'll get it. 
I've seen two types return from deployment: You get the one guy that talks about everything and goes in to great detail about his deployment and you immediately know he didn't see shit, do shit, or accomplish shit; he just sat in the green zone pushing papers. Then you get the guy that is withdrawn, refuses to talk about his deployment and is genuinely trying to move on. You immediately KNOW he's seen some shit and did some shit while over there.

wait what's he got? 10x cooler than a spinner you say?
You're missing the point. People are mad that kids are playing with anything the adult is unfamiliar with. Down with fidget spinners!! Make Cup and Ball Great again!
That really depends on what the assignment was. 
I really ought to check out his book. Seems like there's a lot of wisdom in it, if you don't take it literally.
I think there are two camps. The ones who are just being playful about a difference of minor opinion, and the ones who get legit emotional about what strangers eat.I think part of the problem is that some people don't realize the first group is playing, because they behave identically to the second group.TLDR: Poe's Law.
Wait a minute... I can't remember being born. Does that mean it may have never happened?

Yeah. He's made a very good living out of running the league (and still coaching full time in it). Quality dude.
It's not volume-based, you can be as loud as you want (I mean, within reason). It's all tone/content. Disappointed "You can do better" might get a look but nobody would say anything. Meanwhile, "You got this, Jimmy, come on!" is totally fine. And the coaches are all employees of the league, no parent volunteers, which helps as both a distancing device socially and for training. 
Guy with no kids here. I sell participation trophies because the parents can't handle their kid not having one.
I enjoy the way that she just snaps into professional mode like it didn't even happen.
My friends would talk about their down time and stuff like that but nothing else, just about how they got a really great tan, played games, hit the gym and stuff like that.Not once would they say anything about anything else, they just have a look in their eyes that is kind of distant.
My favorite was when somebody asked the government how young people should afford houses and the answer was literally "get Mum and Dad to buy it".No, wait, my favorite has got to be Joe Hockey saying that it didn't matter if they raised the fuel tax because poor people don't have cars anyway.It's both very sad and very funny how severely out of touch the government is with its citizens.

Kids who get hooked by the spinner realize it is just a toy and that it doesn't help them concentrate, but they LOVE the cube.  It has a switch, some buttons, a rolling ball thing.... his is something they love to play with that doesn't absorb all of the attention like the spinner.  Also various fun pencil toppers

I love that this is a meme now
After a brief moment of 0_0
If you are in the unit with them, and you are training, you hear some shit. You hear those downtime stories, but you also hear stories about the scenarios that you are training for. Part of me wishes I would have deployed so that I feel like I helped, and part of me is extremely thankful that I completed my six years without seeing those things.
Ha! Back in my day, we had a stick. A STICK!
And then it got warmer and the ice melted and there were lots of *trees*

"What the fuck was that Jimmy!? I'm gonna beat you when we get home until you understand how to catch a ball you fuckin narc!"Is more along the lines of today's parents.
Dusty shelf here. Looking forward to getting cleaned off. 
True that. Only time I heard anything was in boot camp. From my chief. Given my position, I'll never see the things he saw, but he drove the point home. This isnt about the down time or the fun you have or the people you meet. People are out there fighting and dying doing things I probably never could. I'm thankful my position keeps me away from it all, but also envious of his experiences because I want to feel like I'm doing more. Even so, my job is to support and provide a necessity to the guys out there. I'm content with that.
Can someone do the math on this?
If you were rich, you had a hoop to go with your stick.
Pledge can here. Orders are skyrocketing. Can't wait to make that shelf slick as shit.
We need more of your attitude in the armed forces. It is a collective job, and a lot of meatheads don't realize how vital people like you are. I am logistics myself, though I have one of the more dangerous logistics jobs (transportation) right now.

Dust here. Nervous about getting pledged. 
A master chef told me this in culinary school: "you can always stop cooking." Take it off the burner or out of the oven if you need to. Surprisingly helpful tip
Learn cooking techniques instead of recipes.Don't approach recipes like they're magic spells in the Harry Potter universe. If you wiggle your nose wrong or put in a spec to much of some seasoning you're not going to end up with a completely different dish.Alton Brown does an incredible job of teaching a cooking technique and then showing you a recipe that applies that technique. If you learn a process instead of a rote recipe you will know how to cook dozens of dishes, and it's really the only way to develop skills in the kitchen.
Chop with the rear part of the blade, not the tip, in a rolling motion.
Control your heat. Control everything, but mostly your heat.
Keep it simple.  Something with 3-4 ingredients that go really well together is better than something with 12 ingredients that clash with each other.
pastry chef here, not my best tip but the only one I can think of this early on my day off...flouring pans for cakes is a step not to be skipped but when it comes to chocolate cakes, it looks awful so for dark cakes, I use cocoa powder instead.
Learn to brown things. So many people are content with their ability to not burn things that a lot of food that could be GREAT turns out tasting no better than if they had boiled it.
If you have to keep adding salt, try adding some citric acid instead
Don't cook with oil while naked.
Heat will remain in your food after turning off the stove and it will continue to cook, so pay attention to your timing.e.g. when you want to add cheese to your omelette, cheese should melt in a plate with heat of the eggs, otherwise you will have over dried omelette, same as overcooked pasta. 
Not a food tip but a cooking tip.... a falling knife has no handle. If you drop a knife, get the hell out of the way and let it hit the floor. Washing it is easy enough. Try to catch it and you could be visiting the emergency room.
If something burns slightly, throw BBQ sauce on it and call it "Smoked".If something that's supposed to be smooth comes out chunky, call it "Homestyle".
you can clean while you cook
Mise en place, which is French for "cut and measure your shit out ahead of time". Saves so much stress. 
Timers. I always forget I have something going on the stove while I'm cutting something across the kitchen. Timers save lives. 
You can use the stem of broccoli. Just peel, slice and fry it in the pan, it's delicious.
If you're worried about calories, just eat a smaller portion rather than substituting "healthier" ingredients.  Especially when baking.
The only recipe that should have only one clove of garlic in it is a recipe for one clove of garlic. Two MINIMUM people.
Not a chef, just italian. Now ,at last, i can rant on how to cook pasta.For the love of what's holy wait for the water to reach boiling point before dumping the pasta in it, and remember to salt the water. Nobody likes eating starch glue.Furthermore when making spaghetti try to use a proper pot, it shouldn't be necessary to break the spaghetti in half in order to cook them.
Not a chef, but cooking is my hobby. Number one rule in my book is follow a recipe exactly at least once before fucking around with it. I've seen too many people get angry or frustrated because they decided to substitute X for Y, and then the dish turns out badly. Try the recipe first, then decide if there's too much garlic, or if cinnamon would taste better to you than nutmeg.If you hate peeling garlic, take as many cloves as you need, toss them in a bowl, cover with another bowl, and shake the hell out of it. The peels get knocked off. Also, fuck margarine. Just use butter.
Don't be afraid to experiment. Every successful new recipe or derivation was at one point an experiment.
Seasoning is paramount. I didn't realize this until I got to know my GF's family. Most people way underseason their food or only use the basic salt, pepper, garlic powder etc. You think baked chicken is bland? You're not seasoning it enough. Olive oil, salt, pepper, rosemary, thyme, garlic powder, and SMOTHERED in Paprika. Delicioso.
Salt your food. It's amazing how much better things taste with just a little salt. 
Not a chef really by trade, but learned this while I worked as one: take a small hand towel and either loop it through a belt loop or between your waist and your belt so it hangs over your leg.  As you move around, then, you always have something to wipe your hands/your instruments on and you don't need to go out of your way to do it!
A knife is not a wedge. It's a knife.If you're pushing down to split your food in half, you're **doing it wrong**.Who's supposed to be cutting the food here -- you, or the knife? Exactly. You're the brains, the knife is the muscle. So stop leaning into your knife trying to part the bread sea, and start *slicing*.Seriously, if your knife is sharp enough, dragging the blade's length across whatever you want to cut should be plenty to get through it. The weight of the blade is all you need.
> Don't approach recipes like they're magic spells in the Harry Potter universe.NOTE: this advice does not apply to baking. Cooking is art; baking is chemistry.
Measuring spoons are for baking, not for spices.
Alton brown is amazing.
Damn. 49 yrs. The rolling motion. I forgot about the rolling motion. Welp. I probably have 20 yrs left before I'm spoon fed so thanks. 
my mom will only cook with max heat because its faster, but it always ended up tasting better than my dad's careful heat management. then i found out that chinese food is to be made on high heat always basically :/
My wife ruined my copper (copper!!) pots/pans by constantly doing this. She turns on our gas stoves and blasts shit like a Saigon flame throwers. 
Just to piggyback on your excellent point, when a recipe calls for garlic, people need to try adding both raw garlic and roasted garlic. The raw garlic will still have that sharpness and bite(when cooked), but the roasted garlic adds an entirely different dimension, a mellow, earthy flavour and the two compliment each other very well
If you do this, don't eat 3 heads of garlic in one sitting.  Your stomach will hurt and you will smell bad for a few days.  Source: my wife ate too many of these at once.
Recently i have been using black garlic, it is garlic that has been gently heated over several week and looks like little nubs of tar, it smells and tastes awesome, it has a really deep molasses like, umami flavour, you would not even know it was garlic really, great in sauces and gravy.
>not my best tip How dare you keep your best tip from us... 
To piggy back on this, DO NOT use sweetened cocoa powder or semi-sweet, as the sugar will caramelize. 
Why do you flour pans? I'm assuming it's to stop it from sticking, but why wouldn't baking paper or simply buttering work?
Man...every time I want to brown something, and my dad is around, he'll put a lid on the pan because all the 'flavor is being let out', apparently. Sometimes I have to be stern and say I'm following a recipe, but how can I explain this to him? All the meat my parents cook seems to be half-boiled in its own juices from putting lids on every fucking pan...
How does one brown something without burning it?
* Does not apply if it's tomato based, add sugar instead. 
For sauces and gravies, a splash of apple cider gives a lot of complexity to an otherwise simple sauce.
Rather, don't cook naked if you're going to puss out.
Same with bacon.
To piggyback, season even more when using ground turkey. 
I love to bake but it's so hard to follow this principle. I usually try to make small individual things so I can eat one before I serve without the cake missing an obvious chunk.
Tasted raw chicken.  Now I'm dead. Thanks. 
As a professional cook, i have always struggled to find out how to go about this with say...meatballs. i cant taste the mixture before i cook so its always a bit of a crap shoot. Any suggestions?
"Add 5 cloves of garlic to the stew" "Wow, that is a ton of garlic! In you go!"my coworkers roommate, adding 5 bulbs whole not peeled into a stew
I went for the catch one time because my cat was like rubbing itself on my ankles at the time. No regrets because cleaning up the bloody mess from me catching a knife by the blade was easier than cleaning up the mess of a dead cat would've been. Plus I kinda liked my cat and didn't want to accidentally stab it.
Girlfriend always laughs how even if I drop a spatula I will jump back and out.    Reflexes are reflexes and have saved me so far.
Yesterday I showed my husband the hole in the floor where I dropped a knife, got myself out of the way and watch it embed itself half an inch in the wood floor.
Or if something comes out a bit sloppier that you expected, you have created a nice wholesome "Rustic" dish.
Mmm, smoked toast. My favorite. 
A sharp knife is a safe knife.
Also, you don't need these 10 kitchen knives. 3 good knives of different sizes, properly sharpened and cared for should be all you need. Then, only buy other knives if you have a need for them (like one for peeling, etc.)
There's a reason restaurants do not use the Everlasting Eternally Sharp as sold on TV serrated knives. They suck. Don't buy that junk.
On that note, knives need to be replaced over time. Grandmas favorite kitchen knife doesn't need to be handed down like a sword for generations.
This is exactly what I do whenever I cook. I always end up with just a saucepan and plates/cutlery once we're done eating. On the other hand everyone else I know ends up with every single utensil and piece of crockery used when they're done, which makes it hard to relax after an enjoyable meal. It's so easy to keep on top of; that part where you leave to simmer for x minutes- wash up while you wait. Bring to boil- wash up while you wait. Cook until softened/browned- wash up while you wait, etcetera etcetera.  
I don't get how people have trouble with this. When ~~in Viking~~ *I'm cooking* the only thing left at the end are one pan and n plates of hot food.  
I thought that meant that everything is supposed to be keep in its rightful place.  So you can find it when you need it.
Preparation is the key for efficient an fast cooking. Even at home I cut vegetables in advance and store them in the fridge. Not having to cut all this stuff for every meal you prepare can save a lot time.
> You probably need less garlic than you thinkHe is saying that he is a chef, but this gave it away that he is an obvious liar! Think about how much garlic you need and double the amount! Blasphemy!
Can you give some examples of very surprising instances when pro chefs use butter? 
Cut everything before you even touch a cooker. Mise en Place. 
This but also with tops of certain veggies. I've used carrot greens, radish greens, and celery leaves sauteed with butter and salt. They also taste good thrown into salads.Just do a quick google check to see if it's edible beforehand.
Yes, THANK YOU. God, I'm so sick of people bringing diet food to office parties and then having seconds. Two plates of bad food doesn't hold a candle to one plate of good food!
Meh, I think it depends. Granted, you should still watch your portions, but if a healthier alternative still tastes good, I say substitute it. Like the average slice of bread is like 70 calories. Doesn't sound like much, but when you're usually using 2 slices, that adds up. I recently found a 35 calorie bread and it tastes exactly the same. Not "the same" like "OOH DIET COKE TASTES THE SAME AS REGULAR" (it does not), it actually tastes like just regular bread.
Julia Child says you can use dry vermouth in place of white wine in recipes, which is great if you only need a splash and don't want to open a whole new bottle.
I like to buy those little 4-packs of single serving wines.  Good enough to cook with and I don't have to open a large bottle if I dont have any around.
Don't use cooking wine. But do use bad wine or wine that has gone stale because it's been open on the fridge for a few too many days. 
Speaking from limited experience I would recommend avoiding cooking with sweet wines. Following the "cook with what you would drink" adage I tried moscato and it was genuinely terrible.
NEVER ENOUGH GARLIC
And please please toss the spaghetti in the sauce, don't just dump it on top. 
One of my roommates doesn't add salt to the water. My other roommate times her pasta based on what the box says to determine when it's done. Now I appreciate my parents' pasta technique that has been passed down to me.
When you get good enough, you can just look briefly at the recipe and already see why the person that wrote it doesnt have tastebuds.
precook your wings by frying them in oil at about 225-250, cool, then fry again at 360-375 to crisp them. this technique renders more fat from under the skin and puffs it a little. can dredge in wheat or rice flour using this method as well (second fry only)
Can confirm.  Winged a baked potato recipe.  Ended up with a functional, yet batteryless, clock.
Hmm. A few days ago, I decided to make "impromptu dough" where I just mixed together a bunch of stuff I thought sounded good and then baked it to see what happened.Keep in mind, I don't really know how to bake and can only barely cook. The resulting lump of hardened (baked, I guess) dough I got was pretty much inedible. I ended up tossing it in the trash. Maybe I should stop doing that,
What is the Dark Arts of cooking?
Weighing scales are for baking, measuring spoons are a dark art
No worries. We use tubes these days. 
Chinese food is 25 minutes prep +3 minutes of applying high heat.
Gotta get that wok hei
Bought lovely new pans. SO (who is major kitchen hazard) used for midnight snack, burnt then scraped clean with a knife. Get a mad facial twitch just thinking about it. 
When I do a roast chicken I always roast some garlic along with the potatoes or whatever delicious veg I am having. And then smush it onto whatever I happen to be eating. Love dat garlic.
You'll get the best tip if you want.
I didn't even know sweetened cocoa powder exists.
It's a dry barrier that will discourage adhesion of the baked good, allowing it to rise as it bakes. Butter is fine if rising isn't a concern, but fats are "sticky" and can actually hold flour-based things down. It's the same reason you would flour a surface when you're rolling out or kneading dough. 
My mother does this with "fried" chicken. Just a little more oil than it takes to cover the bottom of the pan, and covers it the whole time. She can never figure out why it doesn't come out crispy like the fried chicken she has at restaurants, despite me constantly telling her she's making steamed chicken, not fried chicken
> what's missing is acid.LSD?
I dunno, a tiny splash of red wine vinegar is my secret ingredient in chili. No added sugar, just meat, beans, crushed tomatoes, pepper, onion, and spices.
My mom gets pissed if she finds out there is sugar in pretty much anything! Like I was making a cheese cake and she got pissed when I added sugar because "cream cheese has PLENTY of sugar", yet another reason I can't wait to move out...
Apple cider or apple cider vinegar?
Don't cook bacon with oil?
Good advice. Ground turkey needs all the help it can get.
Baking is harder, but some of the best ways to get consistent cakes (or other baked goods) is to:          1.) Get a scale and use recipes that give measurements in grams/ounces 2.) taste the batter! Raw batter will not kill you and in general if the batter tastes good the cake will taste good 3.) learn what a well cooked moist cake feels like. It should be lightly springy, but firm, when you gently pat the middle. After a few times you'll be able to tell with no problem. 
Nice try Gary, we know you're still living on insanity you crazy bastard! 
Take a small amount and toss is in a hot pan to cook it through.
I remember seeing a Jamie Oliver recipe with a typo so it said something like 30 teaspoons of salt instead of the required 3. All the comments were complaining it was way too salty. Imagine having that much faith in Jamie Oliver.
I would eat that.  After removing the skins.
Nice split second decision there 
I'm with the kicking the cat crowd. Only time I have intentionally kicked him was when he jumped toward an open oven door. Poor kitty was a soccer ball for a minute.
There is a "No animals in the kitchen while cooking" rule in our house. Animals know the invisible border in which they can not cross during cooking time. Don't want to trip over one of them while holding boiling water or something. Would be bad for both of us. 
You have the instinct to survive, she does not
An inch?  Wow.  Is your floor made of balsa wood? 
Crucial step: Burn a piece of toast as a offering to the gods.
My former head chef always said:If you mess up a main dish, call it "Rustic"If you mess up a dessert, call it "Artisanal"
Got my dad a good quality kitchen knife for Christmas. Just found out that he's hidden it away in a top cupboard because it's sharp.
I think about 95% of homes badly need to pack their knives up and take them to a professional sharpener. And also learn how to use a honing steel. It makes such a difference!
Pairing, chef's, and bread.  I have never had a need for anything else.
i only use a katana personally used by Jin Kai Moto-san to conquer the 15th century child emperor Taka Hami-san
Professional sharpening is cheaper than people think, and a good pro will tell you when it's time to replace. Also: Learn the difference between sharpening and honing, hone regularly and sharpen as needed. 
The problem a lot of beginner chefs have is that we feel the need to watch the pot on the stove instead of walking away and letting it cook on its own. 
I've explained to my children that clean dishes = food.You should see those little fuckers go. 
Buddy, I think you're doing it wrong.You're not supposed to be in the viking. He just helps you out. 
Be careful with this. Some ingredients taste better when chopped fresh. Onions, for example, will be noticeable more flavorful if diced just before using them vs. if they were diced a day or so ago.
My tip: when you see a recipe that calls for X cloves of garlic, just cross out cloves and write in bulbs. 
All these gif recipes show them just dumping ramekins full of pre-chopped and pre-measured ingredients into their places, is that the way to go? Should I invest in some more ramekins/similar?
Tell me at the very end to check if its safe. you've got your priorities all wrong!Now I have to go to the er because I made a rhubarb leaf salad.
Saint Julia is right.  Especially because, much of the time, you are reducing the wine for a sauce.  Reducing already fortified wine is quicker for the same flavor punch.
Does this happen? As there people who..... Don't finish their wine?
I wish garlic amounts were by weight - some cloves are half the size of others 
i can and do eat sauteed garlic. so good. never enough. 
Which is fine if you like how your changes turn out. But don't be that guy that posts a reply like "I didn't have flour so I substituted baking soda. Also I am trying to cut back on sugar so instead of 5 cups of sugar I used 1 cup of salt. 0/10 would not recommend."
Man, the # of recipes I see where "saute onions, 5 minutes", and I always wonder if these people have tasted onions that have sauteed for 20+ minutes before. They keep getting better!
Instructions unclear, try to eat clock.  No is potato.Such is life.
It shows curiosity and initiative! Keep it up and you'll have something tasty one day:) 
Molecular Gastronomy. 
Fuck, I really hope there's not a day when I need to be tube fed. I'd honestly rather be euthanized.
There isn't one single "right" way to hold a knife. That's just a popular way a lot of chefs do it since it provides a better pivot point and control with the knife. That said, I've worked with chefs who've preferred what Alton Brown called the "accuser" grip which has your pointer finger running along the spine of the knife. I always thought that was super unsafe but...works for them I guess. 
Never thought I'd see the term wok hei on reddit. It's true though, wok hei is everything
My mom did this to all our nice pans, so now she's pissed that my dad and I don't want her using the NEW nice pans... (I spent $80 on a set of nice cake pans and she thought using a steak knife to loosen a cake I was letting cool was a good idea, and ruined the coating on, and she used steal wool to clean a non-stick frying pan)
I had to teach my husband not to use metal in my goddamn pans. He ruined all of his by using a fork or knofe to cook/stir.... they were awful and sad.  
I remember never believing that cocoa powder was unsweetened. It's chocolate, and chocolate's always sweet right? I remember taking a big ol' spoonful because I was hungry.I couldn't breathe straight for half an hour. And the taste...
Oh my god! Is this why homemade cakes tend to have a huge rise in the middle, but are almost flat towards the edges? 
To add to that, when you're browning stuff, leave it alone. Meat often sticks to the pan as it's browning but releases once it's ready to flip over. If you try to flip it too early the nice browned stuff will end up stuck to the pan.
Water! The secret ingredient was water! Yes, ordinary water, laced with nothing more than a few spoonfuls of LSD.
A couple drops and you'll swear you can even see the flavours!
Personally I need some sugar in there to balance it out. Either brown sugar or sweeter ingredients like carrots. That said, I live in a country where rich, sweet, balanced tomatoes are harder to come by.
A cheesecake without sugar would be horrible. Have her try tomato sauce that's too acidic and ask her if it needs anything. When she can't figure it out, sprinkle some sugar on and have her taste it. 
My wife struggles with this. Anything that calls for sugar, and I mean ANYTHING, she'll replace the sugar with either applesauce or honey.About half the time it works. The other half the time her tomato sauces have a weird texture because a scoop of applesauce is not a replacement for a pinch of sugar.
They both can, but he most likely meant cider vinegar. 
Don't cook with oil while bacon.
Taco seasoning. Some of the best homemade tacos I've had were with ground turkey cooked with taco seasoning.
My friend had a Jaime Oliver cookbook I borrowed once and it had a recipe for salt crusted fish that I wanted to try, because apparently you don't actually eat the salt (it was a while fish, the salt was on the skin) but my mom said no since she's very anti-salt.
Have you ever roast garlic, in the skins? Probably my favourite part of a roast meal... 
A falling gun is all triggers!
So I shouldn't clean my gun with butter?
The cat would not have done the same.
No she's just seven foot five 
This happened with my step mom because she cut herself really badly while cutting potatoes. She doesn't practice safe cutting habits.
Freshman year in college my roommates brought home a restaurant grade mandolin. I knew one of them would get hurt so I put it above the cabinets. I was the only one who could reach it ha
I have two chef's knives, actually. One for me and one for anyone else in my kitchen.
I only use my Hatori Hanzo, but to each his own...
That guy strolls down my street now and then, calling for people to bring out their knives and scissors.   I live in a traditional meets modern area. It's not rare to see a road rage incident where a Mercedes and donkey cart full of cabbages are both trying to pass each other on a one-way street.
Grandmama is in them. You weren't told about the curse? 
Ohhhhh!!  You just explained so much to me!!   I never understood why my roommates did that, didn't realize it was born of anxiety about leaving food unattended
I prefer Frosted Flakes.
Just pick up white ceramic bowls when you see them going cheap. I have four large, deep soup bowls, four smaller deep soup bowls that are useful to make sure I don't eat half a packet of cereal for breakfast, four shallow small bowls about the size of a saucer and maybe half a dozen tiny bowls that hold half a cup and are useful for dipping sauces, parmesan etc. It's more than enough to cook with, and all of them cost like a dollar or two. Plain white crockery is  always crazy cheap.
I met her at a dinner party in the mid90s.Very nice woman.She helped herself to a full, unashamed grab of every guys ass as she took a picture with them.Literally a handful, not just placing it there.She also told a story about smuggling meat from overseas claiming it has been smoked when it hadn't.Julia Child gave 0 fucks.
When I was broke, my go-to meal was pasta coated in buttery garlic and steamed broccoli. I never got tired of that meal. 
Oh my god this is my mother. This drives me mad, and she does it constantly. 
I'd hazard a guess that this hypothetical person probably can't make a fully followed recipe taste better than mediocre anyways..
At least dinner was on time.
And never, ever be able to replicate it!
Depends where the tube goes
Yeah, I do the accuser grip with my knives.  It's really not as unsafe as you might think.  'But what if any part of the knife of your hand slips?'  Well....it won't.  In my....ten plus years of cooking I've cut myself maybe ten times on knives.Most of the injuries I've gotten have been from something that you wouldn't expect.  Like the jagged metal part from foil boxes....
Yeah! What is it, anyway? I've tried googling it, but I can't find any chemical explanation. It tastes glorious.
Oh man this made me grimace in pain for you.
Ceramic pans are great until someone does this.  Still don't know if my mom or boyfriend fucked the pan up. 
Sometimes, but not exclusively. Another reason is that the outside of cakes in tins will cook much faster - that is, they'll rise, but set before rising as much (the middle cooks slower, so is able to keep rising longer). To help this issue, you can cook in a bain-marie (water bath) which provides better balance over the temperature, or I have these oven-safe straps that I soak and then wrap around the tin, which provides _some_ balance.
A true iron chef.
You said you wanted the flavors to be more alive. 
Good idea. Another thing would be to just make the cheesecake without sugar like the mother wants and have her taste it. Then make another with sugar and have her taste THAT!
Yup, so much healthier too. 
His bloodline has been pure for thousands of years.
If it's all triggers then there's no bullets.  Catch away. 
And does all her kitchen cutting overhead
Well, the last time I handled a sharp knife I made a nasty gash in my thumb on the first try... happened at work (yeah, it wasn't the first time) so I've now been banned from sharp objects. Happens all the time.
what the hell is a restaurant-grade mandolin, and who the hell needs restaurant-grade when playing their mandolin, be it for themselves or an audience?
Haha. I have three, one smallish one I use all the time, one larger one in case there is watermelon, and a huge one whose name is getouttamykitchen.
Everybody knows Hatori Hanzo now. He's become a sort of celebrity sword-maker. Totally commercial - complete sell-out. I only use swords from Korehira Yoshimoto - you've probably never heard of him.
Where is this? I've never heard of a traveling knife sharpener, living in CA.
best horror movie ever - you throw out grandma's knives causing her to come back haunting you, trapping you in your apartment insisting she won't let you leave until you're fed because you look like you're wasting away.
Grandmama requires blood sacrifice, go stabby stab for grandmama.
I don't trust food not to go to complete shit if not watched. I know what's needed to make the food, but me and my stove have a faulty relationship. One wrong move and shits burned, or cooked on outside and raw inside, I may suck.
I would like to take this time to outsource to the community;Has anyone had the new Cinnamon Frosted Flakes? How are they? Thank you for taking one for the team.
"When you're famous, they let you do it. You can do anything you want to them" - Julia Child probably
If I cook while she isn't there, my food is perfect. If she's watching me cook, I use way too much salt, she doesn't like cumin, you won't be able to taste anything over that much garlic, and I'm just going to burn everything cooking it that high. When it's done it's missing something. 
Or drawing blood on the fucking clingwrap cutter.
From my friends who work in the industry, they say that the accuser grip isn't always recommended because it can lead to early carpal tunnel. Something about doing it every day rigorously for a few hour especially during prep can take a toll on the joints. 
It translates as "breath of the wok". It's a bunch of aromatic stuff produced in the seasoning process as oil is seared into the metal.
I bought a $60 frying pan. Real nice one that I loved. Room-mate boiled water in it and forgot about it. Came back out and the non stick coating was ruined and the pan never worked properly again. I was pissed.
This is when you go out and get an nice heavy cast iron skillet and beat them to death with it.
And now you're sobbing in the corner uncontrollably. 
You mean... make another with sugar and don't let her have any.  Let her wallow in her self-made sugar straight jacket while you are immersed in the wonderment of decadent cheesecake and all of its glory.
Taste THAT mother!     
She does the whole granny cutting style where she peels and cubes potatoes against her thumb and because she uses a dull/practically 400 year old knife to do it she'd never cut herself before.
Lmao whoops. Not even gonna edit that. I enjoyed it too much. 
Hehe, I have 6.022 x 10^23 in case I need to cut up some fresh Avagadros
I live in Toronto. Every 2nd week, in the summer, this guy drives slowly around the neighbourhood in his knife-sharpening truck, ringing a bell like he's the ice cream guy. Not only is he NOT the ice cream guy, he won't stop for anyone! You chase him down the street holding your knives and he won't stop to do his job. I think it's a mob front. 
My grandma always tries to feed me while I'm eating.She'll literally shove a plate between my face and the one I'm currently eating from. "Would you like some gingerbread?" Yeah, I probably would, but how'bout you let me finish the stew you just gave me first? You know what? Screw it, just put it next to the smoked fish.Grandmother's cooking... resistance is impolite.
Cinnamon frosted flakes are fantastic
> "When you're famous, they let you do it. You can do anything you want to them" - Julia Child probablyWell there goes any chance of her ever being President.
It's just locker room talk.
Mine just can't follow the fucking recipe to save her life. She doesn't get that different ingredients yield different results, particularly with baking which is more an exacting science than just cooking. It's completely maddening. She subs various oils in for what it says, she thinks wheat flour will do the same as all purpose, etc. NO. IT WONT. Then she gets mad because "that recipe is shit". No, ma, it's you.
Or the under side of the meat slicer. You know, the part that's the farthest away from the goddamn blade.
so like the same concept of why grandma's cornbread in the 30 yr-old never-soap-washed cast iron is way better than mine in the 8" round tin?
Be sure to use salt to clean the blood off.
Which comes with twice the prize money.
Commas are VERY important in this case
If it ain't broke... and old people... Oh and when my grandmothers electrical foot bath thingy broke and she wanted to return it, turns out it was 13 years old. She still had the receipt though
Or he just thinks you're trying to stab him
Can confirm, have frantically chased West end Toronto knife man with dull but large kitchen knife. Luckily I heard him coming up the street behind the house so was able to find money, grab the knjfe and make the sprint. I came out onto the street right behind him, so then I just chased him waving my knife like I was trying to land a plane. He noticed. $5. 
I want to be made at you because you didn't say they're G-R-R-R-R-EAT!But you gave me the answer I wanted so thank you.
"Hey babe. Coconut flour is just flavored flour, right?""No, sweetie. It really isn't. And now you owe me $30."
No you leave it on to season the pan.
That sword cost 5000 doru!!!!
Now that's some quality grandma story right there.
Tell that motherfucker to stop for people when he comes to East York!
FRY DID IT
My grandma's coffee maker broke once. It was at least 30 years old. She was upset. Went down to the basement and came back up with the SAME coffee maker. Turns out it had gone on sale once in the past and she knew she would need a new one some day so she bought it to be prepared for the day that happened. Still being upset, she fiddled around with the old one and got it working again.  Pretty sure she still has the "reserve" one in the basement.
Yeah.  Good luck.  Everyone will agree with this sentiment, and then fling their feces at any critical thoughts that don't agree with their pre conceived notions.
Wait a minute, "Feel the Learn"? Really? While I'll agree wholeheartedly that the US education system (and likely education systems in basically every other country) need drastic overhauls, I find myself not wanting to side with someone who thinks "#FeelTheLearn" was a good  idea.
Why is there a political underlining here? I think associating this with Bernie Sanders will diminish the importance of the message and turn off a lot of people who still follow the polar model of politics. This isn't a red vs. blue matter. Everyone needs to be educated, and associating this with Bernie Sanders might diminish the receptivity by Republicans or people who don't agree with him.
(I'm a senior in highschool) There is no creativity involved in any core class. It's all memorization. Some teachers are better than others but all I do is study info that I'll forget. Every highschool student can memorize pointless knowledge now but if you asked them to come up with their own conclusion philosophically they probably wouldn't even have the ability to think deeply enough. The ability to think abstractly is decreasing. 
"Critical" thinkers not more sheeple who all agree with the LCD.
The most educated are the least likely to think critically.  You can't *teach* critical thinking.   Education is orthodoxy for the programmed and groupthink.   Their research even proves this, but they are unable to *realize* this.   You want critical thinking?   You want to be able to think for yourself?   Meditate.  Remove yourself from your phone, constant engagement of communication, and  constant inundation information intake.  Become more self-aware, and see a *real* objective view of the world.  Ideally you do this when your brain is developing in childhood. 
The problem with schools is that it is treated very much like a business. The higher up business men don't want the younger generation to question them, only to blindly obey what they say for a paycheck and schools make sure children are shaped into that mold. 
>\#feelthelearnWe need an educational revolution, no doubt. But that revolution needs to work on eradicating nonsense hashtags like this. We currently live in a world where matters of the utmost importance are conveyed to us in memes, hashtags, and facebook posts. Having had a wonderful increase in available knowledge via the internet in the 90s, we have now used the internet to dumb society down to levels that have never been recorded before. The under-educated populus loves it. *No thinking required, here's a hashtag that appeals to my senses.*
The thing is as far as you say something controversal you get scrutinized and labeled by both sides. We need more open minds, but it's hard when everyone lives in his own bubble. 
I feel like great math teachers used to teach critical thinking in all aspects of class.  But over the years, the focus became more about getting the problem solved by memorizing an gimmicky algorithm instead of learning why and how different methods work.current:teach distribution.  then teach "FOIL" method.  Then teach reteach distribution again when dealing with trinomials.better idea:  teach distribution.  Show what that really means.  let students utilize their own critical thinking to realize they can do it for any system.
It always sort of cracks me up a little when people start talking about teaching critical thinking. It's a paradox. If you're teaching them anything, they're not really thinking for themselves.  The best you can do is leave people alone and hope people come to it on their own. Schooling (which is usually where you hear people talking about "teaching critical thinking") usually actively discourages critical thinking by framing all the questions and leading people through a particular thought process. 
If you want more critical thinkers, we as a society need more focus on STEM as a whole.
This can start by decreasing the focus on the fine arts and  English and increase studies in math and science and technology on how to solve real problems. English class is a waste in high school since you just over analyze literature 
We need more scientists. You guys dont seem to understand that science is just philosophy with useful results. You like to pretend that philosophers hold some greater understanding and scientists just mindlessly sort through data or something.Science came after philosophy, and the remnants of "philosophy" are just a bunch of people kidding themselves about spending their money on a BA in philosophy.
On the other hand, I know college kids who can't do simple addition and subtraction, like 7+8=15, reliably.  Memorization of simple math is a sound basis for learning other math.
I am actually jealous of how kids of the future will learn and understand the world, compared to my no child left behind school experience.
I see critical thinking as common sense. I don't understand how one can just believe something to be true without questioning it or looking into it in further detail.
> What is needed is the training of investigation. Research, finding and analysising sources, how to most efficiently learn about new subjects.That's all basic critical thinking to me, don't you think?
I'm a middle school ELA teacher and that first paragraph is so perfect that I want to put it up in the hallway outside my classroom. Can I quote you as B. Wolf?
So basically teach people to learn how to learn effectively? 
It seems that proper skepticism and the ability to distinguish fake from real information is absolutely imperative to future generations' success. Our world is saturated with all kinds of bullshit.
"analysising"
Everyone agrees because they define "critical thinker" as "someone whose views align with mine".
Problem is, majority of the time, kids are more influenced by their parents than their teachers
I think it is due to the massive (and still growing) wealth inequality.If I can hardly pay the mortgage, and have to struggle every week to feed the family, I promise you I am not going to be concerned with anyone else.
I disagree.  Empathy can hamper critical thinking and result in poor decision making.   The human empathy response is triggered disproportionately to individuals and can leave the big picture unattended to.   It can lock people into empathizing with a particular group at the expense of another.   Critical & rational thinking can transcend these pitfalls.  
"Yeah, but teaching ethics, metaphysics, epistemology, and so on doesn't produce profit for overpaid CEO's or cheap commodities for us all to consume, so therefore it's worthless to pursue education in. Philosophy is interesting, but it just doesn't '''''produce''''' anything, therefore it's not valuable" 
Decreasing access to resources = less empathy. We're just like any other animal in that way. 
You can't teach empathy to an adult. We as adults need to learn how to nurture our children so they learn and retain empathy. 
What about those who don't think teaching empathy is a worthwhile effort?  I think we can all agree that critical thinking is simply a universally valuable skill, but the importance of empathy is relative.
Agree with you.  Feelings aren't arguments.  Feelings aren't facts.  Feelings aren't mutually constituted.
I would agree that this post-modern era and generation has moved beyond the bounds of reason in many ways and a good emphasis on the classic modernist philosophers could really help us use reason and logic to come to our conclusions and guide our beliefs instead of party platforms and whatever our social group says.
Personally my math and physics classes in high school required a lot creativity and abstract thinking. I mean if you look at the average level of mathematics students are learning today compared to 50 years ago I'm sure you'd find an increasing level of abstraction.
By teaching. Teachers have been fighting directly against "modern culture" for years, by dispelling myths and replacing them with facts.It's met with resistance, but it's the only way. Otherwise everything just gradually slides backwards.
Liquid Crystal Display?
Who upvotes these pseudo anarcho bullshit rants? The most educated are not critical thinkers? What? 
The main reason I dislike the hash tag is that, intentional or not, it is very similar to "feel the bern" and because of that many audiences will associate your idea with Bernie Sanders. For some audiences this may be construed as a positive, but for those audiences who disagree with his ideas will not give your idea the light of day and shun it without any thought. 
Yeah. I've been teaching college level math for about 7 years. It is pretty common place for my colleagues to go on and on about "teaching critical thinking" and then have their students memorize a procedure so they can get the right answer without actually understanding anything.  This is exactly the opposite of critically thinking - It's sheepishly following instructions. I suspect high school is even worse judging from the level of understanding of a typical new college student.
Ever since socratic method teaching was all about nurturing a critical thinking.You must have a very peculiar interpretation of what "teaching" is.
I don't completely agree with this view.  The bread-and-butter of a liberal arts degree or humanities degree are critical analysis papers.  You learn to formulate a thesis and construct a logical argument that backs up said thesis.  Coming up with a thesis, organizing it into paragraphs, and citing your work = critical thinking.
I don't think people should be allowed to vote without photo id.
They rearranged our standards in Oklahoma a few years ago but did not rearrange how students were tested. So after a full year of trying to teach kids to think critically the state gave them a 60 question multiple choice test and told us we were bad teachers because the students did poorly. They have since taken away the state test until they can figure out a better way. Hopefully ACT and work keys. 
That's good, though. The same thing is happening, from what I've heard, here in CA with common core in high school. Students are butthurt that they have to actually work for the answers, because they were trained to memorize for the test. They're adapting, but it's hard. Meanwhile, my mother in law teaches 1st grade, and they are easily picking up math that used to be 2-3rd grade material, where they used to struggle with the basics that she used to be teaching in 1st grade. 
Have degree in maths.Yes this is a pervasive issue. My best guess is that it is because they are trying to remember what 7+8 is rather than figure it out.When you can figure it out, you memorise it naturally over time.
I dunno, I'm taking linear algebra this semester and if you had asked me what 7+8 was randomly on the street I would have had to think about it.The farther I get in math, the more it seems to me like the only time real math uses numbers is to put it in the calculator.
MOST parents manage to teach their kids to not think critically. "Why is the sky blue?" "Who cares". Why does the sun change colors at sunset "I dont know its not important"
The idea of common sense is mostly nonsense. The closest it comes to a consistent definition is a sort of intuitive sense of what is right, and what "makes sense".  Ur usually the "common sense" answer is also the simplest answer, which means it's wrong more often than right, because literally everything is complex. 
If you grew up in a religious environment where you were punished for saying "well that doesn't make sense..." then you learn early to suppress logic.
Nah. Critical thinking refers to Logical Analysis of arguments and other presented information. Investigation is more than that, and includes things like reaching beyond the logical breakdown of information/arguments, to research root causes, context, related information, examination of sources, etc. Someone else called it journalism, and that is sort of true, in that ideally journalism is a form of investigation. A big part of it, though, is learning to come to understand a system, how the system interacts with other systems, and how parts of the system interact with the whole. 
Absolutely! 
I'm from the UK and they teach multiple points of view for History, even from a young age we are told about information and data from both sides and encourage to us the Internet, with appropriate sources, when we wrote our papers.
Well done. 
All the more reason to try to teach them actual critical thought. Reddit is full of pseudo-critical thought. I go around challenging it, getting downvoted, then occasionally something breaks through. It's been that way for 8 years now and the truth is you just have to keep plugging away. That's how things get done.
I think you're assuming that there are fewer adults capable of critical thinking today than there have been previously in history, when there is no evidence, beyond the anecdotal, to support that.
Until about age 7, then their friends are actually their greatest influence. 
Also culture,Comments seem to suggest the American PoV (and considering the article is about educational reform since US education system is about to disemboweled). American culture is very focused on the individual, while other cultures focus a lot of family/community. Both have their pros and cons, but American culture really, really, REALLY doesn't promote social welfare.
If they empathize with one group at the expense of another, I don't believe that is having real empathy. If they had true empathy, they would be much more inclined to see things from all other points of view. Not just their own, or whatever group they've chosen to use as a display of their good-nature. Which, of course, is still for their own benefit. 
Considering American culture/attitude of "your work defines you," which is synonymous with "your salary defines you,"... that's ... yeah. 
Something worth saying is worth saying simply. The middle-class lingo of academia is the single biggest problem with academia. 
And the bread and butter of a STEM degree is nothing but critical analysis in every single capacity.  If you think that you can get through a chemistry or engineering degree without learning critical analysis, you're sorely mistaken. The whole point of the sciences is the abandonment of biases and the adoption of critically analyzing results. Where as in any LA degree, a bigger emphasis is placed on how one "feels" rather than the objective analysis of the whole situation.
One of the problems is that I'm told to investigate stuff, but then the tests I'm given are all data points, so I'm not being evaluated on my investigation abilities, despite my teachers telling me that's the way to do well on the tests.
> Students are butthurt that they have to actually work for the answers, As someone whose had to deal with a lot of horrible teachers, are they butthurt that they have to work for the answers, or because their teacher simply doesn't teach?
Educating oneself it's difficult. Being spoon fed is easy. Most people don't know that they're being spoon fed. I'm cursed with the knowledge that I can tell the difference, but still too lazy to make an effort.
This is really interesting to me, I never received a formal public education growing up. What you described is how I do math in my head all the time. I've sometimes thought its a backwards way to reach an answer to a problem but I've always found it intuitive to solving thing I'm not familiar with.  
I think it's worth noting that understanding a core concept is itself a memorisation task. The thing being memorised is a mental procedure rather than a simple association.
You'd be better if you could. Don't buy into the circle jerk of arithmetic not being important
It's not parents, so to speak, but rather our American culture, as a whole, that shuts down inquisitive thinking and wanting to learn.  There's also the underlying anti-intellectualism in most people and our culture. 
but wait!  we gotta know, are you... or are you not... a Professional Quote-Maker?
AP history is often much better about that than normal history classes, unfortunately. 
Yeah, in America they teach that too. I don't what that dude it talking about with the whole Columbus was good and the Vietnam War. Any class I ever took from middle school through college did not portray Columbus in a positive way.
Plus history teachers are hired to coach. 
I understand what you're saying and I think that works on a personal level, but when we're talking about societal problems, it's beneficial to have a solutions oriented mindset. Especially, (I'm about to get politically biased), when people who just say, "The government needs to stop giving handouts to lazy pieces of shit!" Instead of saying something like that, try to understand poverty, the roots, and do something that helps at the roots of the problems instead of bitching that people are lazy. But overall, I agree, empathy and listening go a long way in this as well. 
I think you'd do well to substitute compassion for what you're calling empathy here. For a good discussion on the difference I'd highly recommend Paul Bloom's recent book on the topic.
I disagree that hashtags inherently have a grammar of their own. They follow trends, sure, but I think that an education-based hashtag should represent itself by embodying education. As far as I know, there's not a restrictive character limit on a hashtag, so there's nothing wrong with using a full sentence when it's relevant. And I promise I'm not an /r/iamverysmart type. I'm not saying this to pump up my edu-penis. I just think it would do the movement well to put its money where its mouth is, when it chooses its branding.
You're doing well on the test of life, though. That investigation ability is what will let you succeed in the real world
Funny you should mention that... I was actually put on a team to write new common assessment questions that better align with the new standards. They will not always be simple restating of facts (Depth of Knowledge level 1) but rather involve more critical thinking and reasoning (Depth of Knowledge levels 2-4).
Glad I just just visualize numbers cause learning actual strategies seems fucking crazy. 
It's how most people will mentally do math from my experience (even the large majority of us who went to public schools pre-common core). It will vary slightly from person to person, but beyond simple addition and multiplication these 'tricks' are what allow most people to do slightly more complicated math in their heads. It's just stressed more nowadays than it used to be where you would figure out these things more on your own than in the classroom setting.Examples: * In my head I did 150+70-2+4 for the addition one. * In my head I did 10*25+25 for the multiplication one.
Memorization is not quite the right word. Yes, of course you must remember the concept -- but you must also integrate it into a larger set of ideas (mathematics as a whole). It is the integration that makes it make sense to you. You can memorize anything -- god knows they try and make you do that. That is rote repetition until you can recite it. However you can easily recite it and not understand it.I know this is only a point of semantics, but it's an important difference. I think I understand what you were trying to say, I just have issues with the word memorization for it.
This is the primary basis of common core math. People who do math in their head, rather than recall a math result from memory, are better at figuring out math problems as adults, and a wide range of related skills. And tend to do math faster, because they have strongly developed the most efficient synaptic pathways for analyzing and solving mathematical problems. 7-14 yrs old seems to be extremely critical age range for learning basic skills in order to be better at tasks related to those skills for the rest of your life, so it makes sense. 
 Bringing back memories man.I despised that answer as a kid, teach me fuck. Just telling me to believe you because you're older or my teacher isn't good enough. Thankfully the Internet came along just in time. 
Hah, I got that response way too many times as a kid. Got in trouble so many times because I refused to take that as an answer.
It depends a lot on the area you are living in. I live in a relatively liberal area and Columbus was indeed not taught as good. My cousin from another state was taught a complete different view point on Columbus. 
Pearson also does psych and development tests. Beware the neurocracy.
Have said this to almost every professor in college. No phones during a test because you need in the REAL world? I can find every formula in the history of man through this! Point being, even they knew it was just memorize and regurgitate. That's our system folks.
Watching a video of the best math teacher isn't going to have the same affect as being in the class with a decent math teacher. A good teacher knows how to deal with different types of students and fit their needs, which won't happen in a system where they can't personalize instruction. Overcrowded classrooms are already a problem in many areas because of this.
so what most schools are trying to do is teach ALL kids the ways that "good math" kids used to figure out on their own.but this is debatable as far as effectiveness.  Do those methods work because "good" math students used them or did they work because they were good math students to begin with?  Will it work with less capable students? There isn't any conclusive answers yet.  But it seems to not be any worse so why not try.  That said, some parents flipped out because that's not how they learned.
I was at the zoo the other day and kids were just being ignored by their parents when they were asking their parents questions.  I started leaning over and telling kids the answer after the third one I heard be ignored.  May be because parent doesn't actually know why what an orangutan eats, etc, but just say that. Ignoring your kids is not  ok. 
Yeah, you have all that information, but it's still really fucking nice to not need to sift through your phone for every little thing you need to know. The tests for your knowledge are so that you don't just have the knowledge near you, but literally instantaneously accessible without needing to think about it. Until technology gets to the point where there's literally chips in our minds that can immediately tell us what we want to know, memory (and the pointless school tests that go along with it) will remain an incredibly valuable commodity.
I don't have kids, and I'm not sure if you do.  I'm not saying ignoring your kids is OK or that you shouldn't do everything you can to teach them. Just remember that they are still children.  Small children will often repeat phrases and ask questions that they won't retain the answer to by choice.  A parent has to hear this all day long every day.  It is part of social development.  As they get older you should absolutely do the best you can to make sure they are educated. 
I worked with kids for years and they are little shits...however, this was at the zoo.  I was stuck in line with these families for a bit and they were being respectful. I think that's what got in my craw so I answered the kids questions.  It's not ok to ignore your kids at the zoo when they're asking respectful questions.  How's that for compromise? 
Question, how do we know the exact date?
Noob here, why was he sentenced to death he seemed like a pretty cool dude
Socrates died because he knew he was right. By running away, he would be telling the people of the future that he was just teaching others for personal gain. His death had a large impact on his student, Plato. Plato would later go on to teach Aristotle, who would then go on to tutor Alexander the Great.
*There is only one good, knowledge, and one evil, ignorance.*
Beware the Ides of... February?
We'll never really know how much of the Socrates we know was a a representation of the real man and how much was the main character in Plato's work.
Hemlock, what a great way to go. 
On this day (February 15) 22 years ago, I was born. 
Stop fucking translating it as apology!! The Greek term apologia is closer translated to "defense." Socrates apologized for nothing and went out with two proverbial fingers straight up. 
He should have adopted Diogenes's philosophy.
If I remember correctly he was given many chances to take what he says back, or apologize or whatever, and be spared, but he kept true to his beliefs
I'm guessing Plato would have kept a record, right? Wasn't he known for that? Just guessing. 
The Ides of February Bruh .. Everyone knows that
Corrupting the youth
Democratic vote did him in.  Let this be a lesson to never let the masses vote on anything.  
Read the "Apology".  Socrates lays out the case against him, and his defense.
I always wondered about the timeline of these men. Thanks. 
Names were much cooler back then 
I remember reading about how one of his friends offered him an escape that he declined.He tried to explain to Socrates that he had sons and needed to live to be their father, but Socrates knew that this was bigger than himself. Really an incredible story. 
Wait, does'nt Diogenes fit in here somewhere?
Yeah, well, he didn't know much about nukes.
Wrong. Tons of smart and educated people out there more evil than snakes. 
I like to add time capsule type calendar reminders to my phone.Two nights ago my wife and I were discussing the birth of our first child, due date Aug 22. She said she might poop while trying to push. She poured ketchup over her fries and it reminded me of what that might sound like. I laughed and said I will tell her in exactly one year what I was thinking. I didn't want to gross her out.
Also a plot point in the Netflix show Medici. Didn't know they used it for so long.
My calendar ended on 21st December 2012, so today doesn't even exist, as far as I'm concerned.
It was Gregory who made the Gregorian Calendar
Isn't one of apology's English definitions defense though...?
This is part if a large and highly contentious debate carried out to this day by experts, I'm not sure why you are asserting it as if it were fact. 
Diogenes of Sinope was called "Socrates gone mad". So what would he be without Socrates?
> We know the correspondence between that rite on the ancient greek calendar and our calendar.Except that discontinuities are generally just ignored.  In June 2015, the "800th Anniversary" of the Magna Carta was being celebrated on the 15th, because it says right there on the paper "on the fifteenth day of June in the seventeenth year of our reign."  As that was the Julian calendar, the actual 800-orbits-of-the-Earth anniversary wasn't on June 15th 2015.Did anyone actually care?  Not as best as I could tell.
Crito in case anyone is wondering
Plato wouldn't have been aware of future changes in the calendar used in Europe, so it's not as if he could make a note of an adjustment.
To elaborate, he was accused of not believing in any god, but believing in demons instead. And by teaching philosophy to the youth, he was spreading those "dangerous beliefs".
Fake philosophy is bad everyone, so bad. We gotta get this guy Socrates out of Athens some how. I heard an idea, not mine, but have you heard of Hemlock? Beautiful pine tree everyone. But very dangerous, very poisonous, just like this so-called "philosophy" and "reason". /sI know that there are different types of hemlock, /s means I really don't care in this situation. RIP Socrates, Plato, Aristole, and all the other smarty Greeks.
He doesn't have any original works, he didn't write
Let this be a lesson to erradicate the ignorant masses through education and equality
Thanks for this comment.  During the same sex marriage debate I had a few conversations where I pointed out that if the Civil Rights Act were put up to a popular vote at the time it would have failed.
Plato lays it out
That's Plato describing the trial. In "Crito" someone goes to save Socrates from the execution and there Socrates lays out *why* he actually deserves the punishment (as opposed to his defense in "Apology"). They are both very interesting reads. (btw Crito is fictional as well - Plato was not there - if it ever even happened, but it still doesn't diminish the literary value)
Was that their first or last names?
On the other hand, he was kind of an asshole who abandoned his family because he was stubborn. 
I think Diogenes' whole thing was not fitting in as a commentary on society. He was a pupil of one of Socrates' pupils. He challenged and embarrassed Plato in regards to the latter's definition of a human. He also had an interaction with Alexander the Great, but it was basically just him roasting Alexander.
If your abolish ignorance, nobody will want to use them.
Good point. Dogs dumb as rocks, but are angels
#MonkeyDJinbeTheClown2020
Nah that doesn't sound right
If you think about it, most time measurement celebrations are arbitrary. A year, a lunar month and a day exist, but are actually not related. Meaning is assigned by humans, so it's the thought that counts.Also notice how western christmas is roughly at the time of winter solstice and the date of easter is calculated from first full moon in spring(mixing lunar month and year). It is us giving meaning to those days.
Socrates died for this shit!
He was also sort of being blamed for "supporting" the tyrants during the reign of the 30 Tyrants after Pelopolesian War (which was false, but his accusers didn't care about the facts too much).And he did choose hemlock over exile, so there's that.
Mostly true but he didn't believe in Demons, he believed in what he called a Daemon, which is sort of a spirit but for him was basically a voice that told him what was right or wrong. We would call it a conscience.
The whole Meletos' accusation is pretty shaky to be honest.
Tremendous,  absolutely fantastic answer. 
Such a nasty philosopher.
Yeah, a lot of his stuff came from his students who wrote *of* his dialogues but nothing directly from Socrates himself.
He's written about by multiple students, so unless they all agreed to tell similar stories about the same fake man, that is unlikely.
He's mentioned by people other than Plato. I believe Aristophanes wrote about him also. So probably.
Thanks for this counter argument. So far all I read was "they were overreacting", and maybe they were, but he seems antagonistic as fuck
There were no surnames.  People could be referred to by their name followed by their father's name.  For example, Socrates son of Sophroniscus. Specifically in Athens after the reforms of Cleisthenes, Athens and the surrounding area was subdivided into demes.  People could then also be referred to by their name and deme.  Socrates son of Sophroniscus of the deme Alopeke. 
Not trying to be contrary, but as a layman with a limited understanding of history and philosophy I was under the impression that Diogenes' whole shtick was a commentary on all of recorded history and our tenancy to need a ruler be burdened by possessions etc. ?
I disagree on the basis that different opinions will still cause high conflict. 
So this entire thread is a farce.
Tend to get executed?
The physical effects of the poison is described in the text and it seems to match with the effects of the hemlock variety that was used for these kinds of executions, so that's why we say it was hemlock. It's never clearly specified. I'll get you a quote later. 
Are the dates usually selected *arbitrarily*... or are they usually just inaccurate?
Your claim that we don't know if Socrates is anything more than a fictional character is 100% untrue.He appears in Xenophon's Hellenica as the Chairman of the Prytaneis on the day the Assembly debates whether they should execute the generals from Arginusae (406 BC).He also appears in Aristophanes' Clouds, an appearance that would make literally zero sense if he wasn't a real, historical figure.His trial is also referred to a speech of Aeschines, which describes what happened and why the Athenians voted to sentence him to death.
The best modded subs and worst modded subs in reddit are both evidenced by heavy deletions. /r/conspiracy is among the worst, and has numerous deletions. /r/AskHistorians is among the best, and has numerous deletions. I'm not denying (or supporting) your claim, but your presented evidence is not sufficient to support your argument. 
Free speech is not a human right, it is granted [or not granted] by the laws and constitution, if any, of the country you live in.
Socrates died for us, and what he felt like was the truth
Best thing is, when he had a chance to escape he actually went through with his death sentence
Fake news killed Socrates.
Irrelevant - it was entirely effective. 
Interesting position. Is there any story I can read where, say, hypothetically, a famous philosopher of some sort questions the accusations, and explains why they're shaky?
Like Jesus and his disciples.
Hmm, that reminds me of something else.
he absolutely was in his trial he didnt make any case for himself not being guilty and instead decided to mock the prosecutor, then coming up with a joke sentence for himself sfter being found guilty. he wasnt exactly wise in how he acted (also because accounts label him as being gross and unkempt and just an overall fuckin weirdo)
Perfect knowledge implies perfect opinions
Perfect knowledge implies no opinions, just facts.
No, they're the ruling class and only ones allowed to breed...That's what happened, right? Right?
One way to imagine Socrates as a fictional character is to think of him as kind of a meme of Greek society at that time.  When you think of him this way the discrepancies between platos Socrates and Aristophanes Socrates make a lot more sense.  
The best subs delete those long joke chains that clutter the top 2/3 of any given page, for example.
>There are standards, and there is a body of work like any field that most people do well to reference. Baseless speculation is not philosophy. Somewhat ironically, that idea is itself a philosophy, and not necessarily a correct one. 
That's always seemed a very weak reasoning to me; that our rights are "given" to us by the will of the group...My rights come from my very existence as a living being, my right to free speech comes from the tongue in my mouth and the air in my lungs
I'm pretty sure he died because he drank the cup of hemlock.
Story time?
Irrelevant - It was ineffective as the sole purpose of Socrates was to question and make other people question. He had an exit (obeying the court order / stopping his studies) yet he didnt chose that one.Here we are thousands of years later, still questioning the integrity of plaintiff and whatever we come across.Socrates won. 
Not sure if you're serious, but in case someone reads that and wonders who the Sophists were:They were simply paid teachers in ancient Greece, often from other countries, who were bought in and taught only for payment, almost like mercenary teachers.
Nah, there isn't a 100+ year gap. 
Except he actually existed.
As a classicist, I'd claim almost every story told about Socrates by his two most prolific students, Plato and Xenophon, are probably made up and if not are heavily modified, but that doesn't mean he didn't actually exist. I'd apply the same reasoning to the man you're speaking of.
No it doesn't.  I can value individuality or I can value equality.  Depending  on that I will choose different policies that can be opposing each other 
Wouldn't that be ignoring emotion?If someone doesn't like the existence of something, and it's based on emotion, wouldn't that be their opinion?Let's say there is a donut on the table and there are two people looking at it. One person eats the donut and the other person doesn't like that that happened. Wouldn't that thought, the idea of not liking that, be both a fact and an opinion?
Wow, eugenics upvoted on /r/philosophy. Don't know what I expected.
This has nothing to do with the claim that we don't know whether or not Socrates was a real, historical figure, which he demonstrably was.
How else do you explain it? We have no natural rights.  Maybe "do whatever it takes to survive and make as many babies as possible" would be a possibility.
One time I made tea out of needles from some pine trees in my backyard. When I showed my Mom she said those are Hemlock, not pine trees, and I freaked out because I didn't want to go like Socrates. Then after some googling we learned that Hemlock plants and Hemlock trees are two different things.
Willingly...
Apology by Plato
Wasn't he offered exile in place of execution but he turned it down to make a point? One of my college professors told me this but he could have been full of shit
Yeah but more than that Plato and people of his ilk looked down on them because they didn't care about making reasoned, logical arguments but instead focused on semantics and rhetoric to win an argument. They were seen as a kind of philosophical charlatan.
Plato wrote a lot about them and now the term is mostly associated with having very poor reflective skills but being very confident about your knowledge. 
Plus the majority of the New Testament was written by Paul who wasn't even a disciple. He just had more success with spreading the word because he had a higher social status and more mobility. Ended up de-radicalising a lot of Jesus' messages and generally ruining the chance for a good socialist revolution. 
There are many wise laws that supercede your right to do whatever you might like to best survive and reproduce. For example killing your neighbors and taking what you need from them or raping whatever person you feel like reproducing with, just for example.
Similar story - one time when I was in a battle royale my partner picked some berries to eat, but they got stolen and eaten and killed the person who stole them! They turned out to be nightlock (a berry just as poisonous as hemlock).  Lucky that kid stole the berries otherwise my friend would have been toast.  Your story reminded me of that, for some reason.
Well the alternative was to have a Roman soldier reach up his butt and pull his heart out so... yeah, probably willingly.
Yes thats the case. The thing with exile at Ancient Greece was that, if you get exiled from your own town you will probably wont be accepted at another one or wont have rights even if you were accepted. Let alone being able to teach...Also considering that he was old, I dont think it was a hard choice to do for him.
I just finished replying below, but basically yes, they sold gimmicks and didn't care much about actually teaching reasoning skills.
Apparently their preferred strategies have become standard on the internet.  
I dont think that concept exists or is even possible of existing. I would be apprehensive at the idea of true knowledge throwing opinion out the window.
>There are many wise laws that supercede your right to do whatever you might like to best survive and reproduce. For example killing your neighbors and taking what you need from them or raping whatever person you feel like reproducing with, just for example. I find it interesting that those laws are passed and enforced by people or groups who have, historically, been successful at killing their neighbors. I've become fond of the saying, "Might doesn't make right, might just determines whose idea of right prevails." 
Hey I remember you! You were on a big TV. Tell me how's your sister been these days?
Your friend sounds like a douche
Or he could've tried to escape when Crito told him to. 
I think teaching philosophy can cause jumps in maturity and lead children and teen to take more interest in their future. This makes them more motivated to do well in school and is why I think teaching philosophy makes kids all around better students.
I clicked on the PDF link to the study, but it only links to the EEF website
Who knew that exposing kids to philosophy would help them show gains in recognizing arguments and understanding logic?
I'm confused as to what they're comparing. They keep saying students from England vs disadvantaged students, but never specify who the disadvantaged kids are. I'm assuming they're from England as well, so do the England stats encapsulate the disadvantaged, or are they a completely separate category? 
In high school I always felt as though math taught you how to think, so it's interesting to see the correlation in the reverse. 
Pardon me if I'm coming in hot, but isn't this just pretty obvious? I mean your teaching schools of thought and logic. It naturally helps in performance of things that require thought and logic.
I found that my performance in English was definitely enhanced by my taking Philosophy in Years 9 and 10. My writing and reasoning skills were greatly improved, and it also helped with analysis of texts. My maths however took a nose dive.
As someone who took a lot of philosophy while pursing my mathematics degree, I definitely agree the two subjects synergize well.That being said I don't know how you explain Kant or Hobbes to children. Descartes maybe, but I can't see it going much further than that.   
I came to this thread hoping to find ways to teach my kids philosophical thinking from an early age. Instead it's just complaining about how the article it shit, how it's impossible to teach US children philosophy, and how STEM is the only true path.Thanks, Reddit!  
I think doing 6 years of philosophy improved my analytical abilities when it comes to English/literature.  Writing style though . . . It wasn't the best training.
I think we need a class on critical thinking that incorporates philosophy, statistics, reading comprehension, etc 
Doesn't anything the makes you think improve you general intelligence including math and English. 
I'm only 15, but I find philosophy very interesting. Especially the afterlife and why we exist 
It seems like most of the articles posted in this sub are just attempts to justify someone's philosophy degree. 
Nearly everybody that I know who took philosophy classes in college agrees that you can BS your way through nearly every paper and get your degree. To add to that, in the intervening weeks between papers, a lot of these people did almost no work. There is no way that you can possibly be learning anything with this process. IMO, in an undergraduate setting, philosophy is a bizarre field of study.
Teaching kids baseball also makes them smarter in math and English.  Teaching them how to play Magic: The Gathering will do it, too.  Also teaching them more math and English will help their math and English.  Did you know that just continually engaging a child's brain in literally any kind of critical thinking will help their math and English?  Make the right decision, skip on philosophy and go for something that's actually fun and/or practical.  Unless the child or parent is already a philosophy nerd, then go nuts and have fun.
Any IB kids here thinking hell no? 
I don't know much about philosophy and I'd like to know more about it. Can you help me guys?
Agreed. Wouldn't reflect too well if people on a philosophy sub get duped by fake or misleading news
Although the sources for this article are sketchy, I'd like to believe that teaching children the art of logical argumentation could prove to have tremendous value if done correctly.
I saw this post highly upvoted and lost some respect for this subreddit, then I saw your comment was top and the respect came right back. Thank you all for actually thinking critically even when the material is in your favor. 
i like that your skepticism and critical approach to assessing and acting in information is exactly what a philosophy class would inspire. we should probably have a class like that earlier in the education stream
when i was in school in Germany we had "Religion" classes, in the lower grades it's just singing songs and reading the bible, but in higher grades 10 and up it's a mix of psychology and philosophy + learning about the major world religions and their philosophieswe read for example Sophie's World and talked about one chapter each week over the year(or if you are not christian you get something called "Ethics" which is the same, but with less emphasis on religion)
In some European countries philosophy is taught since grade 9. Not so much changes unless the student is interested on his own independently from the teacher. For those philosophy is great. 
This is why you always check the source material! good catch (anecdotally this storyline appeals to me, but good to be skeptical). 
I'm not big on philosophy but I would imagine if they did a course in high school it would be more useful than much of the English we learned and a helluva lot more useful than the math.
Yeah, this article sounds like feel good bullshit like "only smart people listen to music!" 
> Thus, there is valid room to be skeptical of this.As there is **any** study that hasn't been vetted and repeated by the scientific community, what exactly is your point? I don't disagree with the "question everything" mentality, I just fail to see how this is any different. 
We actually have mandatory philosophy courses in Sweden as a mandatory course in "gymnasiet" when you go the social orientation. AFAIK, you have at least 50 hours of philosophy as mandatory but can take another 50 hours.
As well as they skipped all the usual wrote parts, like plato worship, not sure it even qualifies as "philosophy", unless that term is so diluted as to be meaningless. Maybe it would be better received if it wasn't a grab for the "philosophy" brand, and focused solely on skills like reasoning and critical thinking.
I had 2 philosophy courses in highschool. One in middle school, minor in college. All in MN
I went through the IB program in high school just 4 years ago. As part of the program, everyone was actually required to take Theory of Knowledge (TOK). It was one of the pillars of the program. The TOK concepts were also brought up throughout each of the other subjects in the program as well!Even though it was actually very useful after the fact ,Especially in how much it improved my academic writing, I found it to be to early in my academic career to really appreciate what we were learning. 
People who call philosophy "useless" are either too stupid to understand it, or don't want other people to be able to think for themselves.
Formal logic is essentially computer science. I wouldn't be shocked to see more formal logic courses in high schools as comp sci becomes even more popular. Whether that qualifies as proper "philosophy" eh... But it's better than the current situation
> Philosophy in high school classes in the US will never happen.Why do you say that?
Very good analysis of this! I've yet to read the project report, however when I do, I'll have to be on the lookout for what you've pointed out. Thank you for providing it!
> I think teaching philosophy can cause jumps in maturity and lead children and teens to take more interest in their future.What has lead you to think this?
I find my willingness to study philosophy for so long was fueled by immaturity and lack of care about future consequences. It is costing me much right now.
Relative to other subjects, might this be one of the best things parents can facilitate and allow the child to better learn other subjects in school?For example, "Why should I learn this?" should be approached with a critical mind; the worst possible answer imho is "sometimes in life you need to do things you don't want to". What a disservice to an otherwise teachable moment!
For me it did the exact opposite as I started to think of the social dynamics around me, the illusionary systems in place to make our society work. It turned me into a nihilist.
Is religion a philosophy to you?
I can't find a good source to teach MS these concepts though and I have an amateur loose grasp at best myself. Help?
Was the class based on syllogism --> sentential logic --> predicate logic?  It's definitely one of the better classes to take as it equips you to see argumentative statements in a new light...
IB survivor here and no, I agree with this. Tok is a pain but having it there as a constant teaches you think think in a way other programs don't. 
Read more books.
Please correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like you're saying that you're willing to ignore the lack of evidence in an article so long as it conforms to your pre-established beliefs. 
If done correctly is the key. This seems like it would be highly dependent on teacher skill.
I suppose the best way to see the general consensus for a post on a subreddit is to give it a few hours, that way a good chunk of the users will be able to see it, and thus give an idea of what plenty in that community think.Thank you for the compliments and for having restored faith in the subreddit!
I did just as you had asked, and there is no download of the study for me. I am on Google Chrome, so I am unsure if that effects anything.However, if that is the case for some, then the webpage should alert the viewer that there is a secret download. Otherwise, it will provide confusion, as is now.But, fortunately, it doesn't matter now, given how others provided the PDF file itself.
Perhaps they should teach it at a younger age then, to spike the interest from young. Even then, while it may not automatically make everyone who takes the class someone who is a great critical thinker, I would wager that it does provide a decent amount of benefit. I just wonder if there is any data regarding this subject.
To some extent, I agree. However, by that point, many students likely wouldn't take an interest in it, due to schools killing any drive for learning they may have had. Thus, I feel that education should be reformed in a way that doesn't push test scores and pure memorization, but rather learning and applying skills learned in all of these classes in the real world. Furthermore, philosophy should be added in an extension to this critical thinking being taught, to potentially guide students on how to properly think.
That's interesting! I've noted other individuals saying that in Brazil and Germany they had philosophy as courses as well, and seeing the differences in the way it's taught between the three is becoming rather interesting. It leaves me wondering which method of them all is the most effective.(For context: The user in Brazil just said they had a regular philosophy class, whilst the user in Germany said they had philosophy and psychology mixed together in high school with their religion/ethics class.)
I had zero philosophy courses in highschool. Zero in middle school. One in college. All in OR.Most of my rigorous world-interpretive approaches take place through the analogical lens of Oxy-Acetylene welding.
We had a logic and philosophy class at my middle school in the 8th grade. The first half of the year was logic and critical thinking. Stuff like premise and conclusions soundness of reason etc. The other half of the year was learning about classic Greek philosophy from, Socrates, Plato, Zeno etc. This was in a small town on Long Island NY.
Well lucky you. I went to school in a rural area, staunch conservatives and declining enrollment definitely kept it out of the curriculum. We even had a teacher with a Phd in Philosophy from Carnegie Mellon but he was the teacher for the gifted program. Don't ask me how someone with those credentials ends up teaching high school lol. I didn't have any idea who Plato or Aristotle were prior to college. My school was basically reduced to your basic classes with a few electives like technology classes but that was about it. 
Well for starters we don't have nationwide standards. I guess there's NCLB and Common Core, but I feel like things vary state to state or even district to district. When most schools are already on a tight budget, I don't know how advocating for added philosophy would go over in a lot of places. 
Thank you! I think the intervention is a great idea and I am interested in the results of a proper study. 
I took philosophy in my junior year of high school. I wasn't intentionally a bad student but I was only doing my work to please my parents and took no real interest in my education. After the class I knew exactly where I wanted to go in life, I knew what kind of work I liked and why. More importantly I learned that life isn't a game of luck. No one is naturally better than anyone, and that anyone can get where they want in life if they work for it.
I felt the same way at first, but now I feel like there's no system at all, no one made our society, it's just how we all evolved to live. There may be corrupt people or corrupt groups, but the society as a whole is just what humans came to be.
No. I think philosophy is the study of what we don't yet understand, religions tend to have concrete belief systems.
Ok thanks. That's still such a strangely worded stat. I guess it's also just a coincidence that they add up to 100%
I love the healthy skepticism. I was berated in another subreddit today for pointing out an article had no credible sources to the point of being called a liar for not proving it was fake. Hard to prove something is fake when their is no evidence that something is true to begin with
This article was written back in March - how on earth do links die within MONTHS?
Can't that be said for all teaching?
Agreed. People should not expect every upvote to include a full read-through of a link wth an investigation of its sources. Upvotes are more like a filter for what is interesting. I *do* expect the comments section to contain a good discussion about the post, including a vetting its sources. I feel like any subreddit ought to be judged by its comments section, and r/philosophy usually does quite well there.
Well I do not think so. For example in politics and so on you have still the majority that do not follow so much logic. It is true though that for those few that are interested it is very useful. 
Here here! As someone that just graduated, I agree. They teach us a shit ton of material, but they don't have the applied part down. Sadly, at the high school level, it seems like nearly all the education isn't meant for bettering you/your intelligence, but rather is meant to prepare for college gen ed courses.
In Sweden we have all of these classes. Although ethics goes under the religion course.
You think you're being snarky, but this might make you one of the more qualified philosophers on the planet.Read "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" if you want to get some heavy philosophy from a smart tradesman.   
Taking Logic in college made me so much better in both math and critical reading. Did you think it helped you at that stage? 
This makes me sad. I logically know teaching isn't a respected profession but you don't need to be so blunt about it
As am I. Philosophy has great potential for education, however, I do not believe there is much study as for how it's applied, which is a shame.I suppose either some among us will have to conduct a reliable study, or we'll have to wait for others to come along to do a reputable one.
For the curious what was it that you realized wanted to do?
Really now? I'm extremely envious now, haha. Isn't Sweden also a very Atheistic country, too?
You recognize that the person who wrote that studied philosophy at an undergraduate and graduate level right? 
why did you say logically? sorry, i just took a logic class and i hope i didnt already forget what a logical truth is, not tryna be an ass or anything
I didn't mean it that way. It's just if you have a PhD you're a little over qualified for teaching high school. 
Agreed, I have seen relatively few (if any besides this?) studies on translating philosophy to the classroom. That said, I am biased as I read mostly psychology literature. 
I think this has a greater risk of happening if you think of philosophy as a goal in itself, a goal more "worthy" than any other subject, especially if you're a teen and a little bit melodramatic already. I know I fell down that rabbit hole when I was younger. Philosophy serves life best and brings more happiness if you strive to connect it to a bit of optimism and life goals. Such as: there is no useless knowledge. Life is long, you never know what kind of information you will have use for. 
\>Actually, because of philosophy I even want more to quit the schoolThat's because learning philosophy clashes with the intended purpose of public schools: eliminate creativity and instill blind obedience to the state.
I'm not saying that people can't get lucky and have an easy life of course lots of people do but no one should count on that. I'd say you need a plan to have a goal. I'm sure Bill Gates didn't have the goal of being a multi billionaire. If his software flopped and everyone went with mac he'd probably still be like the owner of a computer repair company or something.
Well I always had a bit of an interest in programming but i never thought it was something I could actually make a living out of. The class gave me a new fascination for what could become with new technology. We have infinite possibilities we have at our finger tips. What got me was something about the fact that we are so insignificant, yet in the last century or so we've changed more than we have in millions of years. We are the first few generations to truly create our future. So, I took AP Java, aced it and now I'm a cs major.
Yeah, sometimes it's just a broken link due to human error...calm your tits everybody. In such cases I've found it best to report the problem to the site administrators, they'll usually thank you for it.
I would say this depends on whether the math you're talking about is proof-based or computational. 
I see where you're coming from, but couldn't you say that if you haven't grasped a fundamental mathematical idea, that is also a failure of education, either on the teacher or you as the student? Philosophy and logic could not exist without understanding fundamental math concepts. So I would say with any discipline, yes, it is entirely dependent on teaching ability, and of course, your own ability and desire to learn
I'm a math teacher. I was using a local idiom.I know teaching isn't respected based on a lifetime of comments like ops. 'Why would someone teach if they are smart enough to do something else' is how most Americans view teachers.It's why I left teaching. My old coworkers, a lot of them were smart. And they honestly wanted to help make the world better.But it's not a values position culturally
I don't see how else you could mean it. If teaching were a respected profession, you wouldn't think to make such a comment. It would seem perfectly normal for a PhD to teach at a high school, rather than it being below them.
I don't want to sound pejorative in any way but you had to take a philosophy class to understand that you could make a living being a programmer?
That is true and is a good solution to the problem, however that doesn't mean one shouldn't be skeptical in spite of it. While a lack of evidence provided doesn't mean there is no evidence for the stance, there is still no evidence provided in the first place.
Absolutely.  All of my math classes are purely computational.  The above wouldn't really apply in a proof-based class.Relatedly, I really do not envy the people taking proof-based math courses.  Proofs scare me.
My chem teacher in high school made it a point to let us know that he could triple his pay at any moment by leaving for the private sector.
This is so troubling to me. I'm currently in college, and several of my professors have recommended that I pursue teaching as my profession, and I see what they're getting at: I actually enjoy it; I think I might even be great at it. But teaching is looked down on in the United States.
No, he had to take philosophy to understand the potential and wonder of programming. Did you even *read* the comment? Nowhere did OP say anything about how philosophy made him think he would be good at it or that it would make him money.
It does seem a bit plausible though, at least for those that have taken a lot of philosophy. But then maybe we have stockholm syndrome ;) It makes me curious for more studies, particularly of comparisons between achievements of students in countries with philosophy as part of their core curriculum vs. those in countries without. Though it'd be a loose corelation study, it'd at least be something....a start.
>Well I always had a bit of an interest in programming but i never thought it was something I could actually make a living out of. The class gave me a new fascination for what could become with new technology. 
Manufacturing consent changed the way I see television news.
I had the awesome opportunity to interview Chomsky on Nationalism for a school project last year. He was incredibly interesting and changed the way I viewed what it means to be an "American". I'd be happy to post a link to the audio file if anyone's interested 
Wait, so now it's totally cool to disseminate scholarly works from MIT to the public for free?
I look forward to the day when we can collectively appreciate Chomskys work as historically important to philosophy and linguistics, and culturally important to the free thinking individual.  I understand many do. But I feel that at the moment we are stuck listening to reports of those who disagree with his work. And since the man is still alive it seems that much of the focus in discussing him is to knock him down a peg or remind people he wasnt always correct.
Did anyone actually click on the link? Unless I'm missing something, this isn't a huge archive. It's just a slideshow with some photos of notes and covers of some books. Seems like everyone would rather just talk about his politics.
Where is a good place to get started with Chomsky's political writings? I tried getting into Understanding Power some time ago but his style was very dry; I always felt maybe I just wasn't being introduced to the correct stuff for newcomers.
The most important American intellectual of the 20th Century.
I don't particularly like noam chomsky due to some disagreements on political opinion, but i do respect him. He can see through all the bullshit everyone is putting out there. I really wish i could be like him in the future.
Chomsky is just one of those voices people need to listen to, regardless of ideology
Will he tell us how to cultivate dissent?
Great resource for students of polemic or rhetoric
In his memoir Out Of Step: An Unquiet Life In The 20th Century, the political philosopher Sidney Hook had some tart things to say about Chomsky circa the Vietnam War era. Hook scored him on his support of the communist regimes in Hanoi, Cuba and China, and his wildly disproportionate damming of the U.S. government.  
I don't get why Reddit is so in love with Noam Chomsky. He is a cheap charlatan.
Wouldn't Reddit fall into that category too
I recently learned about Chomsky Normal Form by accident. It's so surreal to see how much of an impact he has on my current coursework in computer science since I'm so used to seeing him in a social science context. 
Can someone ELI5?
is there a good intro courses that will help me understand it?
His attitudes towards the Khmer Rouge caused enormous damage to his public persona, and allowed his targets and enemies to discredit a bunch of the rest of his work.
That's a stretch.  
I couldn't disagree more, the man defended the Khmer Rouge.
Chomsky debated Foucault, who did your econ professor debate? 
Very much this. He seems most influential among young people with little historical knowledge and a lot of passion. 
That's a fair critique. 
Will it be understandable for a non student who just wants to know more?
Given the vast scope of deplorable actions undertaken by the US government in the 50s, 60s, 70s and beyond; I find it hard to believe any damning of said government by Chomsky could be considered disproportionate.
What makes you think he is a cheap charlatan? Even if you dont agree with him he puts a lot of effort and thought into his work.
this video just made me want to read all of his works. anybody have a recommendation on where to start?
What I find interesting about this video is that they are talking about Manufactured Consent by Media in only Democracies. All kinds of power (Democracy, Communist, Monarchy) uses Media to advance their propaganda. Al Jazeera Media Network is state funded by a Monarchy. Aren't they trying to manufacture consent against democracies in this video?! This messes up with my brain.
That was simply amazing. The animation, the music, and the content. All in under 5 minutes!
Just leaving a comment so I can come back to this. 
Seriously? That's the whole crux of that book? Well at least then I do not have to read it. I hope Mr. Chomsky realizes the irony of his contribution to the very thing he's lambasting here. *Firing Line* *cough* *cough" 
There are certainly government & media paid shills shitting all over reddit every day trying to push a bias. 
Im quite worried and sad.. :(
A "formal grammar" is a mathematical way of representing syntax in a language in a heirarchical way (using a tree to represent the different parts of speech). Chomsky found a way to normalize grammars so sentences could be parsed efficiently, so that we can analyze the "tree" to study languages better. (please correct me if I'm wrong, as I learned this through the perspective of CS, not linguistics).
Having studied the subject extensively, I'd love to see someone attempt an ELI5. I'm not sure I could pull that off. There's quite a bit of underlying material one must understand before being exposed to CNF.
That's pretty amazing! How did you get in touch with him?
Which is super unfortunate because Chomsky's "lets hang back and see what the actual damage is" was the correct approach in many other situations. His attitude towards Central America, Asia, The Middle East, and parts of the Soviet block ended up being correct in the broad scheme of things.And then he was wrong about the fucking Khmer Rouge. 
Is it? He is literally the man most responsible for all of modern linguistics, including computer science linguistics. He revolutionized both philosophy and science. Well, perhaps the latter more than the former.He also went toe to toe with Foucault, the most important philosopher of the 20thC (at least post-war).On top of that is what he is perhaps more famous for: his DAMN impressive scholarship on the US empire and Manufacturing Consent.
Which isn't surprising. Chomsky is the kind of personality that will be fully appreciate once he passes away. Same as how MLK Jr was hated when he died and only now he is appreciated. 
People keep wanting to believe this, but it's bullshit. Even if it was true so the fuck what? Does that mean everything he's ever said is wrong because he was wrong about this thing? That's a stupid way to sum up someones work.
His ideas on foreign policy are laughable 
Being critical of someone doesn't require you to have equal or greater accomplishments than them.
Calling Chomsky Anti-American, Anti-Imperialist, biased, or out dated at all fair criticisms of Chomsky.But saying that man hasn't been out on the stages debating with intellectuals is not a fair criticism. He's been doing it for years and he's quite good at it. 
When I started reading Chomsky, I found his writing style to be quite dry and a bit cumbersome to read. I would highly suggest "Understanding Power" as a first Chomsky book. It's not actually written by him, but it's a collection of transcripts of him just talking plainly with random audiences, "free-style". It's a very engaging book.
911 was my starting point. It was mindblowing and set me on his published path
You can save the thread
Trying nothing.  Reddit is a political and business marketing tool as much as a TV commercial.
Why? You think he thinks he's going to die soon?
Some things are not meant to be understood by five year olds. 
computer words
I am unconvinced. I agree there can be merit, but Armenia, Central Africa, and Cambodia all suffered for that attitude. I don't, mind you, have a good answer.
Eh, his influence in linguistics is not very disputed.  Everything else is very disputed.
It means that he isn't a person that everyone just needs to listen to. He's brilliant within his field but quite flawed outside of it.
Understanding Power is a book that everyone should read. He digs pretty deep into America's dirt. I'd go as far as to call it entertaining albeit pretty disheartening.
Failed States was a great read.
It is a mess on mobile.
He's almost 90 and in the past decade or so he's visibly gotten old and frail, his voice raspier. I saw a video of him give a speech in December, he had to be helped to the podium. 
How do you mean? I'm a bit unsure 
Fair.Still I maintain my claims.
See the 5 filters. 
I hope its good. I literally just placed the order. Itll be here on the 29th! This is what I love about reddit. Its all in the comments. 
Agreed, fantastic work.  One of his strongest after MC imho. 
I wish your mistake was to type "cunnilingus" instead ;)
Yeah it's almost time. His wife is gone, soon it'll be him.
Lynn... you got rocks in your ears?
If one categorizes Hillary Clinton as left-wing, I guess that makes sense. As someone far to the left of either of them, in a lot of ways (the ones that matter -- Wall Street, military-industrial complex, never-ending wars overseas -- it's all about the money, Lebowski!) I view Hillary Clinton as far more right-wing than Donald Trump.The Democratic Party has virtually turned their back completely on their New Deal roots of FDR. Now, they're the party of Goldman Sachs wrapped in a rainbow flag.
> the ones that matterThis seems to be the point of contention.
Hold on, is it accurate that he is missing 90% of his neurons?  When I was taught this case I was taught that the water pushed the brain outwards against the edges of the skull and all the normal anatomy and a lot of volume was lost, but that a lot of the neurons survived in a more densely packed structure around the edge of the skull. Whether it's 90% volume missing or 90% neurons missing is a big deal to this question, and they are definitely not snonymous.
This sort of thing illustrates why I shake my head when I hear people speak of "downloading our consciousness" or any other comparison of the brain to the computer.  Neurology is so dynamic and complex that we are nowhere near understanding it on that level. I don't think humanity ever will. 
The article doesn't address the possibility that the density of neurons in this man's brain is different than a normal brain. Most of the cells in the brain are glial cells and fat, which support neurons but are not thought to be directly involved in cognition.  By reducing their number, or volume, the number of neurons can remain roughly constant.  The implication that the brain was slowly compressed overtime beginning at the age of 14 when the brain was mostly formed supports this hypothesis. It won't be provable unless and until an autopsy is performed.
As a philosophy major and scientist, I've always considered consciousness, merely as a sense of senses, an awareness of my senses. For example, I can "feel" that I am touching something. 
This makes me wonder. We often attribute humans special "human" characteristics to brain size. With information of this 10% brain man, I wonder if animals with brains 10% the size of mans can achieve the things this man does. And if not, what is keeping them from doing such things.
It's interesting that they always state "the brain" when really that brain is the person. Your body is just a controller/tool that the person uses to survive. Am I the only one that thinks like that?
The article claims the man acted normal yet states that he had an IQ of 75. The fact your IQ is almost 2 standard deviations below the average is itself an anomaly.The article also claims the man was in almost all respects normal but we never get examples of his behavior compared with others to validate.
I'm very into the transhumanist/life extension movement, and this kind of research has enormous potential. If we can identify the parts of brain responsible for "conjuring" consciousness, and how it functions, we suddenly open up many possibilities....brain a vat, brain transplants, maybe even mind uploading. Very cool!
What exactly does this challenge? The title is unnecessarily metaphysical; It insinuates a normal functioning yet abnormally structured brain challenges the most basic premises of conscious (IE that it is a product of the physical mind).  That is certainly not the case.  If nothing else this is a beautiful example of the plasticity of the human mind, and it reinforces one of the most basic properties of that brain (namely the brains ability to adapt).
This thread and the comments are not so much philosophically as much as scientifically-oriented. Can anyone discuss the philosophical implications? I really see none.
Does this challenge mind-body dualism in any way?
I have a question, which I'm hoping someone more science-minded can shed some light on.What does this mean for baby Jaxon?  If you don't remember, his case was all over the news maybe a year ago because despite developing in the womb with a very small brain, his parents refused to abort him.  A lot of people (myself included) demonized these parents for subjecting their son to a life of struggle.  Was that incorrect?
Would you say this is similar to the Ship of Theseus paradox, applied to the "consciousness" label?
Thanks, lots of laymen neurologists giving quick summaries, which end up misinforming everyone. 
> This paper presents NO major new issues for consciousness.Thank you. I am disturbed that this post has so many upvotes in a *philosophy* subreddit. To me, this post is a clear candidate for a downvote - it's not related to philosophy and has an inaccurate, clickbait title.
>drop of IQ potential from 180 to 75, for instance.This is, perhaps, your strongest point and brings up a lot more questions about this man and his condition. 
I don't know if it's necessarily challenging the theory of consciousness so much as adding new facets and potentialities to it.
This is the first thing that came to my mind reading this article. Specifically mind uploading... well not exactly mind uploading, more like gradually replacing the brain with electronic components. The main worry for me would be the ability to make sure my consciousness was still me and not just a copy of me. I suppose we can keep our consciousness in tact, if it is done slowly, like this injury.
Is there a "prevailing" theory of consciousness?
Not to mention that the man's hydrocephaly spared his cerebral cortex, which is responsible for high level thinking including **consciousness**. So there is really not much that is terribly surprising about this case. Below the cortex is mostly white matter, which is just axons connecting various neurons to each other. While still important, a loss of this white matter would be less detrimental to consciousness than the grey matter. [edit] As others have mentioned, I have mistakenly understated the importance of subcortical structures. 
Where is the 90% figure coming from?  This seems like it may be estimation/speculation by OP, it isn't mentioned in the linked article or the lancet article.  Does anyone have a source for this figure?
> whether good counters have arisen if soCan you elaborate what you mean here?
Personally I think the strongest point in the post is that function is not linearly related to volume. Which we already know is true. (We know this in humans, even, but to pump your intuition realize that whales have much larger brains than us)
May I have your source on the maximum IQ being 180? I was led to believe the highest possible score was 162. I'm not saying you are wrong, I would just like to find out if I've been misled.
Care to explain why the Chinese room is a terrible argument?
But it's an "I know one when I see one" kinda thing.
Lots of people have low IQ's but are not actually mentality disabled--basically he is not very smart, but he is in the range considered normal--just below *average*. The fact that he could hold down a job, get married, and father and parent two kids, shows that he could take care of himself and his family without outside assistance; he was able to fulfill all the usual responsibilities of life.he might be a not very *smart* person, but he is still a normal person capable of normal person things, so...normal.
Quite a few similar informed speculations on the topic, for sure. The journal Consciousness and Cognition is full of them along with countless attempts to use empirical evidence to put them to the test and refine them. The problem is shitty old school journals like that are still closed access to the public so a huge proportion of our modern understanding of these things is hidden from the public. Which is why we need to push push push for open access science.
I work in subcortical regions, and they aren't even remotely close to "mostly white matter." That being said, we've known for a long time that your brain can correct for losing huge amounts of neurons given the loss is slow (this man isn't the first known example of this kind of neural degeneration, as u/nothatkindofdoctor mentioned).
so in theory, if you took out the cerebral cortex, the person wouldn't have consciousness? Assuming that didn't kill the person
To be honest, I was taught this a long time ago and thought it was [relatively] common knowledge so I disregarded that point to some extent. To those who hadn't known, though, I'd agree that point helps suggest his claim very well. Also the whale example was a good one - I'm used to people using elephants haha. It's even more eye-opening when you think of a giant, dumb, blue whale.
Yes but this is such and obvious fact for anyone with even the slightest bit of scientific thinking.  My 8 year old nephew knows that such a simple paradigm could not possibly be valid and predictive of something as complex as the brain.  It's not even elegant 
Man that's really thought provoking for me.  The brain is conscious about more things happening in front of me than "I" am aware of.  So my brain can notice these things and decide for me whether or not the thing noticed is important to "me" and, then, allow "me" to notice or not notice depending on my brains decision.  It's like a smart caretaker of an inferior being that realizes the inferior being would be overwhelmed by all that's really going on.  i would like to read up on this.  
> . In other words, we can measure that the brain noticed something, but the person was not consciously aware of it.So, based on this, to me it seems obvious that consciousness is simply the feedback mechanism in the brain.  If you don't get that feedback happening, it doesn't get stored in memory and it may as well not have happened from your point of view.  i.e you weren't conscious of it.
> In other words, we can measure that the brain noticed something, but the person was not consciously aware of it. That's about as close to a scientific theory of what consciousness might be that I've read about.Excuse me, but how is that a theory of consciousness? It just proves that the brain functions as an extension of the eye nerve, filtering sensory data before it reaches consciousness. If anything, it proves that a large part of the brain does *not* produce consciousness.
Doesn't the brain and consciousness come down to: does the brain produce consciousness or receive consciousness 
You're absolutely right, and I do a lot of work with the limbic system myself, but I overgeneralized thinking of the space between the lateral ventricles and top half of the brain. I suppose what I'd actually find most intriguing is what happened to those subcortical regions and how their function doesn't seem to be entirely lost, rather than the issue of consciousness mentioned here.
Probably, although they'd also lose basically every other characteristic that makes a human a human unless you could somehow selectively remove only those neurons that are responsible for consciousness (which might not even be possible, since it's likely widespread and not localized to one discrete region). I think it might be difficult to prove your results though, because consciousness can only be inferred through behavior, and behavior does not always correlate perfectly with consciousness.
Just curious, is there anything to support the idea of average brain mass vs. body mass ratio as a reason for why humans are "more intelligent" than other animals?I have a friend who won't let off on this idea but I've never really taken the time to figure out whether he's right or not. It's always sounded extremely wrong to me, so I tend to not say anything about it.
For what it's worth, most larger animals have larger brains, because you need more neurons to control your increased limb/internal organ sizes.
Blue whales are pretty far from "dumb", though. They're just a step or two down from humans, but that's probably mostly because they don't have hands, writing, or fire.
Indeed. But he's not an outlier, right? If his brain was like this and he showed no deficits at all, it would be very surprising. This is not much more surprising that finding that a small child with a hemispherectomy can later go to college (though still perform worse than average on some tests).
Look into the experiments with people missing their Corpus Callosum and youll realize there are two of you in there. 
That's actually a really fascinating insight. The definition of consciousness seems to be when we can verbalize our feelings internally. You might be on a big revelation here.
>*That* is consciousnessNot too sure about *that* being it. You don't have to be able to speak to be conscious. Babies are conscious, though of course aren't as "fully-featured" as toddlers and older humans.
Ther are also people who say the brain IS consciousness, or that there is no consciousness, or that there is no brain.
Matter produces consciousness.    Our brains are not radio receivers (only our eyes are ;-).    Whether you want to say the physical laws which lead to this are imminent or transcendent is kind of a moot point.   The laws which lead to consciousness are everywhere.   But when you become self-conscious, look around, and consider the universe might be infinite, then the medium upon which all these laws play out is literally nowhere.   I mean, *where is the universe*?
>probably mostly because they don't have hands, writing, or fire.I wish there was a quantitative way to study this. I always wonder how different we really are to other animals.
I think this individual is an outlier in the sense that most people with comparable brain volume are microcephalic and profoundly disabled.  The hemispherectomy cases are equally puzzling outliers.It is significant that there are large numbers of cases that lie far outside the normal correlation of brain volume and IQ, it isn't a freak accident.  It is probably significant that they began life with a larger brain volume that diminished.
That's interesting, that's how modern digital compression works no? Separating out visually distinct areas, and reassembling them but only as needed as they change to save on data. 
so what happens when we take acid?
Maybe.. or maybe there are only 2 when you split the corpus collosum. If it were possible to split the brain again, I'd wager that you would get 4 separate minds. I'd also wager that if we could directly connect two brains they would form one conscious mind.
I gotta say, the base directness with which my gut's neural cluster insists on things makes me suspicious of another entity growing within my abdomen, more concerned with food and fear than philosophy. You stay quiet, gutbrain. You know nothing. 
"You might be on a big revelation here."Definitely felt like it when I was high. Then I started thinking about spiders and the uniqueness of their webs to each species and whether they move on their webs by having a definite stride length that other species can't replicate. Then I forgot about the consciousness thing until just now. 
Many scientists disagree that babies are conscious. Although there are probably varying "degrees" of consciousness. "You don't have to be able to speak to be conscious." Yes, I think you do. Well, not necessarily speak, but communicate. Sit down and try to have a meaningful thought about anything without using language. You can still act and react but you can't consciously form thoughts.
I get the first two possibilities but what the hell does "there is no brain" mean? Are you just referring to some degree of solipsism?
> Matter produces consciousness.This is not at all a proven fact and could even be an empty and meaningless statement.
As opposed to what? Glial cells? Or does the brain run on magic?The main problem is actually that we don't have a good definition of consciousness, so the problem of finding where "consciousness" is "located" or how it arises is currently ill-posed.
Yeah, I agree. This is something that haunts me, and I can never find a way to resolve it. What if dolphins, or whales, or some other unknown creature in the ocean is actually much more intelligent than us, but can't really do anything but swim around?^^^^^ph'nglui ^^^^^mglw'nafh ^^^^^Cthulhu ^^^^^R'lyeh ^^^^^wgah'nagl ^^^^^fhtagn
I suspect you may be correct, especially when considering Dissociative identity disorder (AKA multiple personality disorder). I read somewhere that they've recorded some people with over a thousand distinct "people" living in their head.I wonder if we all have that; it's just that one personality dominates for life?
It's difficult but possible to invoke and be aware of mental images without bringing any language into it. Maybe mental imagery is also a result of potential communication by drawing, but that starts to sound like the tail wagging the dog.
Logic is a core part of philosophy and should be taught at least in high school, possibly sooner.We start kids in algebra as early as middle school. Predicate logic is very much like algebra and more relevant for life so it should be taught at the same age. Inductive reasoning is even more important in life. These philosophical foundations should absolutely be taught much earlier than they currently are.
Ethics ought to be a course that is required to graduate high school and get a degree in college. The latter used to be the case a long time ago.A principles of reasoning course would go a long way toward high school students being able to determine what arguments are good and bad.
This may have already been talked about. But the problem with teaching kids to think for them selves and question their frameworks will lead most of them to hating the way the school system is currently set up.Schools, "Here kids think for yourself better!" Kids, "Why are we spending 8 hours a day at the age of 7 indoors, having information crammed into our brains, to pass tests that are not good indicators of intelligence or retained information just so the school can look better?"School, "....on second though let me take back that free thinking."
Holy crap. This is my first time in /r/philosophy and there are so many off-topic non-philosophical related posts on here confusing philosophy with personal opinions on stuff like education and religion.Lots of this stuff reads like that "I am enlightened by my own atheism" copypasta meme.
Yes. Critical thinking. Ethics is a bit more tricky, can't have utilitarian children running around
Haha, when I read the post title I didn't realize it was an article link and thought someone was asking /r/philosophy if philosophy should be taught as a core subject. I was like wow, what are you going to ask next, if /r/aww likes cute puppies? XD
Maybe senior level in highschool.
absolutely not they dont even teach kids how to do taxes, balance a check book, create and follow a budget why tf would they add a necessity for philosophy when they dont even teach kids the basics of living 
 No, even at university where departments have greater autonomy were being told to spin certain narratives and answers as correct, despite this undermining thought and moral discussion. Giving greater oversight on philosophy by allowing it to be taught at primary and secondary sounds an awful idea.
I don't know if it would work. A majority of the people in my *grade 12* philosophy class last semester could barely grasp a lot of the concepts we were learning and (literally) *nobody* but a small group people really understood logic and logical fallacies. However, a reason they might have not understood it is because they were introduced to this way of thinking so late in their academic careers, which in turn means maybe we actually should be taught philosophy at a younger age. Interesting. 
There is no question about it. No pun intended.Any subject that encourages children and adolescents to question the accepted truth, and grow their critical faculty will do a ton of service for this world. We need more individuals. We need more pioneers. We need more challengers. We need more critics.Or do we? ...That's up to you.
Yeah great, more bastardization of philosophy at the hands of casual students. How could that be dangerous?  "A little learning is a dangerous thing" -Alexander Pope 
This.  Logic class should be taught at the middle school level after they have decent reading comprehension and core math skills.  
Wouldn't programming be better for teaching kids logic 
Totally agree with this, the whole concentration on "the great thinkers" rather than on ideas nearly put me off philosophy and Im sure it has done for so many people.
I would agree completely with that. Philosophy was actually a subject in school where I grew up, and I remember how increadibly dumb everyone thought it was, I especially loathed Parmenides. We couldnt grasp what the philosophers were trying to communicate, because we would always try to concretise the metaphors instead of thinking about the idea itself. Our prefrontal cortexes werent developed enough. On the tests we just regurgitated the textbook definitions without any grasp of what we were writing.A few concepts were understandable though, like empiricism and some parts of logic.
I'd argue that not teaching them is what is setting the pace kids can understand anything an adult can often times in ways adults can't. Im very sure kids can understand complex questions especial about philosophy. Teaching kids to think abstractly should be the norm the rest is forcing them into the assembly line that is education. 
I hate to say it but I agree. Finance does need to be multiple years. The quality of life for the whole country would improve in a single generation.I say start with 2 years and let's see what we can get after that.
Bring back home economics and all of those can be taught in one course. A critical thinking/basic logic/philosophy course doesn't need to come at the expense of practical, real-life skills.Really, though, who doesn't agree that grade school education needs substantial reform. 
Religion is not a class in public schools, only private schools. If you choose to send your kids to a private school, you know what you're getting into. 
Religion is supposed to be taught in mythology courses.  I took mythology in high school. It was fun learning all the different gods people believed in. It was also then I questioned why my Jesus would be any different from any of the bajillions of gods created by every other ancient civilizations. 
That was actually the case for me. We learned about various philosophical theories especially 19th century philosophers. It was still in a catholic context, but looking back I must say that it was done quite well. Still, religious teachers were religious, on tests as long as you pulled some crap out of your ass that made the church look good you got good grades.(Belgium btw) 
We raise them to be deontologists anyway
This is what is already happening.
Hahaha, yeah tbh is was a bit of a circlejerk inviting title. On the otherhand talking about it might actually make change more likely! Whereas agreeing that we all like cute puppies probably wont change anything :P
Could you care to explain how it would be bastardized? Don't confuse bastardized for simple, if that's what you're thinking.
I totally agree with you. My daughter is going into the 7th grade, and I've started teaching her about logic and logical fallacies at home, because they do or learn anything about it in school. Not that I'm an expert, but I believe that critical thinking and reasoning skills are more important that memorizing facts and dates. 
I went to a private elementary school and was taught logic there and feel like it has stayed with me ever since, so... never too early!
I've recently been gaining interest in philosophy but never had any classes on it in high school or college. What book would be a good start to learning formal logic? I've recently purchased Sophie's World as a fun intro to philosophy. I also downloaded Platos Republic on my Kindle. But I'm learning about more and more philosophers that I want to dive into and I'm getting overwhelmed and don't know where to start.
Second this! Used to major in philosophy at UCLA, changed majors for this very reason. There is a huge lack of discussion based learning in academic philosophy. 
Right? It kind of made me feel as though I was inadequate and could never live up to any of them, so it made me feel hopeless.
No, I'm sorry. No. Kids are not little adults. Their brain is not just smaller, it is drastically different.While I do agree that school destroys creativity in children, I do not agree that you can teach philosophy to little children and expect them to get any of it. Or care about it.You can prepare them for philosophy by giving them logic courses or *maybe* some kind of History of Philosophy class. That could work in middle school, and philosophy could work great in high school.
It would, now people don't realize what they are doing to themselves when they spend money or have credit card debt. It's not because they are stupid it's because they simply have never been exposed. Especially in lower income families, the parents don't know, schools don't teach them, and yet we expect them to be successful. It's lunacy to think that would work. 
depends on the country
What, in schools? 
Yeah but they don't know it's called philosophy, so if they do try and learn philosophy at one point they won't be going in with preconceptions of "Well this isn't what I was taught before..."
As much as I think philosophy would be a great core subject, it's hard enough to get people to pay for subjects like art and music, where you can actually create something that you can show people. Philosophy is literally just thinking, so it would be an easy target for politicians to skewer for "frivolous spending". I mean, maybe if philosophy were taught more rigorously then people would have the mental wherewithal to realize how full of shit those politicians are, but what do I know \*Kermit meme\*
Philosophy has been used to justify every abhorrent event in modern human history. The maxims of certain schools of thought are often used in and of themselves rather than as a framework for thought. Remember the Nazis? 
Especially in the modern era, where facts and dates are readily available.
I'm intuitively sensing a flaw in your reasoning, but since we didn't do philosophy in school I'm struggling to refute it.So far the best I can do: all mortals are men. socrates was mortal. therefore, socrates was a man.  It still seems a bit iffy. 
Math checks out. This is why we math!
I think maybe our definition of kids is different - I'm thinking middle school and high school. I was still throwing horse shit at fence posts in elementary school you won't get an argument from me that we should be teaching philosophy to them. 
Imagine if everyone in America set up a retirement fund and education funds for their kids. Fucking imagine it.Quality of life would skyrocket in a generation.
This is a website populated by a majority of Americans, which is the context I am discussing it in.
> it's hard enough to get people to pay for subjects like art and music, where you can actually create something that you can show people. Philosophy is literally just thinkingIn contrast to the materials and utils you need to create artworks, thinking is rather cheap though.
Don't forget that alternative facts and fake news are also readily available in the modern era. Gotta learn to look out for those.
Formal logic can rescue us! The argument has this format: P implies Q. P. Therefore, R. "All men are Socrates" is a completely different sentence, formally, from what's in the rest of the argument. Another way to think of it: all dogs are mammals. My dog Fido is a mammal. Therefore, all dogs are my dog Fido. That's obviously silly. 
I think its easier to see a little rephrased:In the set of mortals, all men exist. Sokrates, being a man, is in the set of mortals. Therefore it implies that all men (subset of mortals) are sokrates (subset of men).Does it exist a mortal man in the set that is not Sokrates? Yes, thats easy to find. And so the implication fails.
Yes, the argument for requiring Algebra in early grades is that it is a good surrogate for Logic... Why not just teach Logic though if that's what we are trying to get kids to learn?
Yeah that's what I meant for the second part. It wasn't just memorization of some facts, it was more like, "summarize this philosopher's argument and then argue for or against". You really had to understand the philosopher's argument to take either side, so the understanding was tested more thoroughly. Plus, if you made any illogical jumps in your argument than it was immediately obvious.
understandable but my statement still stands
That memorization of historical dates and personalities in history class always bored me to tears, until I had an excellent world history professor in college who would launch into in depth chronology and explain WHY things happened. Some people had a drought or a war and had to move, so they went next door and took over another kingdom, causing them to evacuate into their longtime allies' lands, causing more war and strife. Those connections are what is often missing in history classes in the states.
Unfortunately, faulty logic spoken loudly is winning. There's gotta be a super-logic that, uh, trumps, the BS.  
Your people need spanish subtitles?
All dogs have four legs. Fido has three. Therefore, Fido is not a dog.
I think its closer to: ~~P implies Q. R implies Q. Therefore P implies R.~~P is contained in Q. R is contained in Q. P is equal to R.
You'll be happy to hear that history and schools has changed a lot. It no longer simply deals only with dates and events but aims to create more understanding around the human factor. At least where I'm from. Source: Am a High school history teacher. 
The argument is valid, just not sound. 
 There's a name of a logical fallacy for that but it escapes me.
I'm a grown ass man who never did any CS and I have no clue what the hell the latter part of your comment is supposed to mean.
If something is both true and false the whole statement is false.
ZMM is a great introduction to philosophy and mental illness. Pirsig (and Pheadrus) was a great man and his contribution, although small, will be sorely missed.Rest in Peace.
I always remember the beercan shim. It works just as well.
Dying at 88, cannot be judged as unfair, but I am somehow very sad to know that the person, who with his books have challenged and inspired both my thoughts and actions, is no longer here to answer the questions he raised. But as an author he is immortal as he surely will continue to inspire new and old readers. 
Well shit. I had a teacher in high school give me their personal copy. It was an amazing read.
Years ago my wife sent a copy of ZMM to him asking for an autograph as an anniversary present.  Apparently it went to the wrong publisher, and bounced around for 6 months.  He signed it and sent a letter explaining the delay.  I really appreciate him taking the time to sign it and write back.  One of my favorite possessions. He will be missed.
Oh manMy dad asked me to start reading Zen a few months back. Im currently about 100 pages away from finishing it.RIP. Robert was a great and intelligent man.
I wouldn't be a professional philosopher now if I hadn't read Pirsig when I was an undergrad.  I guess he might find that a little ironic, but I do strive to not be a philosophologist.He'll be missed.
Interesting book. Challenging me more than I was comfortable with.
I feel a real sense of loss at this. This book was the most important book in my life for many years. I felt such an affinity for Pirsig and Phaedrus, his journey, his mental struggles. There are so many things in that book I think about frequently. I don't have any words for how sad this is.
Ah man, Pirsig is such an intelligent, interesting mind.  His metaphysics of Quality provided an important framework for me to make some difficult personal decisions, in addition to influencing me to emphasize processes instead of goal setting, "journey over destination," if you will. Thanks Robert and RIP.
We could all learn a lesson from this book. Motorcycle maintenance is like anything else unknown in our life. If we could just take a moment to stand back and break free from our preconceived misconceptions and really look at something from an objective point of view we might find there is nothing to fear and that anything is possible.
Interesting book, I am never sure whether to recommend Zen as soft introduction into philosophy. The narrative style in pretty engaging, even if a bit convoluted at times, and has a strong payoff. One of the first full philosophical texts I actually finished, a decade and change ago. All things pass into dust, I suppose.
I read Lila before ZMM. I think I am the better for it, both touched me equally. I carry 2 books on my motorcycle trips with my dad (I have an 74 air head), ZMM and Walden (his recommendation). RIP
I always see people talking shit about this book. Is it lite philosophy like The Alchemist that appeals to everyone or is it really great? Can someone recommend it to me? As for what I've read: Nausea, Most of Camus, Foucault and Hegel. 
I have this book on my shelf. I found it lying on the street. Some one was throwing out all their books. The title caught my eye. I will read it. Soon. I have to finish the book im reading atm and then i will. 
ZMM taught me a lot about an uncle that died before I could meet him, and the horrors of ECT. Up there with One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in my mind as a paean against the often dodgy mental health treatments of the day. Definitely worth a read, if you've never taken the time.
ZMM was the first book read that h(g)ave me that "I know EXACTLY what you mean" feeling.  Before that moment I was a child.  
I can't ever get myself to finish this book. Once he got into the Chatauquas the writing just got really bland to me.
My Dad has started this book a few dozen of times, but never finished it. I remember his was the pink copy, he only read it when he flew out on business. Never got the chance to ask him if he recommended it, but based on all the reviews here, looks like I need to make a trip to the book  store. 
[Serious] Is this recommended to motorcyclists who work on motorcycles, or is this purely a Philosophical writing? I started reading it before but never finished.
I read it when I was 22 and I straight up changed my life forever.  I try to keep what I learned at the forefront of my mind at all times.  I'm getting better and better at it.  May he rest peacefully.The boy you see in the photo is, of course, his son who was murdered by someone outside Robert Pirsig's Zen center.
I read this book and it truly inspired me. God speed Mr.Pirsig.
He was survived by his motorcycle, said to be in immaculate condition. 
I enjoyed it when I first read it. I read it again and thought it was mental masturbation. Get out of your head, man!
I've given so many copies of Zen away. It's just so good, if someone asks to borrow it, I end up giving it to them and buying another.
Wow there are a lot of stupid people in this thread. My god.
My father gave me his old copy upon me getting accepted in to university, and I have yet to start truly reading it. I have only leafed through it a bit. Maybe now is the time
RIP. His book meant a lot to me growing up. The whole quality issue was puzzling, but now I realized what quality is; ability to serve the intended purpose. 
I have only read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, any suggestions for my next book?
I will admit that I dont know the first thing about philosophy... but I know this book was gifted to me for my birthday a few years ago and it has just sat there on my bookshelf ever since. Is it good? Whats it actually about?
Shit is mandatory reading imho
it was my introduction, I read others, but it was the first philosophical book that was able to grab my attention.
"Trials never end, of course. Unhappiness and misfortune are bound to occur as long as people live, but there is a feeling now, that was not there before, and is not just on the surface of things, but penetrates all the way through: We've won it. It's going to get better now. You can sort of tell these things."
Mental illness? I take it to be a great introduction to philosophy and mystical consciousness. 
I still do this!
I read this part of the book not long after using a soda can as a shim for the controls on my handlebars. Definitely made me feel proud for figuring it out too.
You meant a lot to that teacher, I hope you appreciate that.
I am a professor, it is one of my favorite books, and I recommend it to students who I perceive are intelligent and pushing the status quo. I agree with the other commentor; your teacher paid you a wonderful compliment. 
I received my copy from my parents, it's funny how artists dying bring us to dusting off their works 
Haha, same story.  Book changed my life.  Looking back, that professor was someone who inspired me to improve myself more than anyone else around me.  I'm grateful he introduced me to such an amazing read.  I just recently purchased my own copy and will be reading it in Phaedrus's honour.
I think it took me three months to finish it. It almost demands that level of introspection, I think. I can't say I enjoyed the book, but I certainly took something from it - a new way of seeing the world, perhaps. 
I told a buddy from work about it maybe a year ago and he read the whole thing in a week and said it was incredible.  I did the same many years ago.  I should read it again and see if i have a new perspective now.
Can you give insight as to what the book is about
I felt it was very annoying. The author tried very hard to intentionally not understand certain things, mostly "quality". Not surprised he went nuts.
My dad had schizophrenia before he eventually took his life. You think this is a good book for me to read?
I definitely agree. His metaphysics of quality in Lila really helped me figure out an objective morality as an 18 year amoral idiot. 
It's damn near required reading for those looking to work on old bikes too. My dad gave me this book, and a little later, his old Honda. I'm deeply grateful for both. 
It's pretty much a Mary Sue philosophy story about a guy who's just so amazingly awesome at philosophy nobody else can cope with it and he totally destroys their world with his sheer awesomeness. Then he fixes motorcycles because he's totally a badass self-reliant motorcycling philosopher. A fun fantasy for people who are intimidated or irritated by philosophy.
My dad recommend against it when i showed an interest in philosophy. I had the impression that the message is watered down and undisciplined. Im going to read it with high hopes after reading this thread though. 
It seems like about a quarter of this thread (including myself) had to put the book down about halfway through. I wonder if we all made it to roughly the same spot. 
You probably ride a bmw
Please be sure you read it. I owned it for years before cracking it open in my mid 20's. I still wish I'd have read it the moment I acquired that first copy. Now I buy as many used copies as I can find when book shopping and give them away to my friends. It blew the doors off of my reality, and I hope it will yours as well...in a good way.
I forced myself to finish it thinking there was something there because of all the praise.  I didn't get anything out of it. At all.  It's not a great or even good book in my opinion, although it seems from this thread that I'll be in the minority in thinking that.  
My mom loaned me her pink copy. It changed my life, started me on a whole new path towards goals I never knew I had before. I know I'm not your dad, just an anonymous stranger on reddit...but I highly recommend you make that trip. You will not regret it.
Just ordered the book zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance. It sounds awesome.
mental masturbation is a worthless term only used to feel superior to things. if you have a criticism of the book, share it. your comment helped nobody, and similar comments will never teach anything worthwhile, except for an easy way to deride something.
godel, escher, bach: an eternal golden braid
philosophy books: small print, big words, don't sell a lot of copies. 
This is an example of a non-comment: so utterly lacking in contribution to the substantive discussion while using naughty words. Think before you type little guy. 
this is why i think his contribution was more than just a small one. zen is a really interesting read and is a lot more accessible than a lot of philosophy texts tend to be. there's more to his contribution than just the volume of it, zen is a fantastic intro to philosophy and it was the first book to really get me into it.
Could you recommend others to read after? 
And yet, he lived just long enough to see the line dip down. 
It is a great introduction to philosophy, but it is also about mental illness. I can still remember where I was the moment I realized Phaedrus was not only the narrator, but the author too, and that Persig was open enough to write his personal decent into mental illness was unsettling and disarming. 
And, I still get push back from my friends for offering to sully an expensive machine with a cheap repair.
I very much did/do, a lot of people saw him as crazy: but he was a really intelligent man, just eccentric in how he spoke. By far one my favorite people to have talked with about philosophy and history.
Dunno why you were at 0...welcome back to 1 for being a nice person.
Read Lila too. It's even better. 
Wish I had one to post.  Moved out of country for 3 years so it along with everything else is in storage.  Sorry.
I need to finish it eventually. I've been 75% of the way done many times and have yet to complete it. Hopefully this summer 
Books like this are books that will stick with you forever. Sometimes that's almost better than liking it.
seems like his being made one last push to be heard before he shipped off :)
That was the point. The initial quest to figure out quality was his gumption trap, much like the broken screw that throws off the assembly. This second attempt at figuring it out was him making sure to have the balance he learned from motorcycle maintenance in order to figure out quality without becoming so attached to the weight of his inquiry that it would destroy him.
>The author tried very hard to intentionally not understand certain thingstrying very hard to understand this one..
Lol, someone's got a little bit of a chip on the shoulder eh? 
Last thing I remember is a long rant about "quality" and education and how he was a teacher or something like that. That's as far as I got. Perhaps I didn't get to the "enlightening" climax of the book...
Is there any difference's in the book, based on the color of the cover?
Since masturbation is a harmless and pleasurable activity, I have never fully grasped its use in the negative. Is it "you are merely enjoying the pleasure of this, without producing a lifelong commitment?"
How about something that isn't completely beyond the reading level of ZMM?
*Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance* is not a "philosophy book". It's about philosophy and a mental illness but "philosophy book" is something else. Great book anyway.
There is a substantive discussion here? I thought we were just paying our respects. Am I allowed to do that? Find something more important to whine about
_The Plague_ by Camus_Nausea_ by Sartre I'm sure a lot of people will also suggest Camus's _The Stranger_, and it is fantastic. But _The Plague_ might be more of a novel, so it might be more appealing. It's also just ... really excellent and a bit under appreciated. You might like _Sophie's World_ for a kind of novelized approach to the history of Western philosophy. 
The Yellow Arrow, by Victor Pelevin. VALIS, by Philip K Dick. 
There's always that one idiot who brings in current-politics into every single thread, no matter how unrelated it may be.Despite your narrow worldview blinkered by your political ideology, the world is still on an upward trajectory, same as it was 1 year earlier. On the whole, things are still getting better much more than they are getting worse.    Go back to /r/politics aka /r/LiberalCirclejerk
I have a teacher just like this. The crazy ones are always the best.
So it's not just me then? The first time my dad gave me it to read I was only about 20 and I think even still too young for it. I read most of the book but I don't think I took much of it in. I started a second time about a year ago and read a large portion of it again only this time I actually took it in. If I did find myself reading a bit but missing the point I re read it until I got it. This was a lot more enjoyable but still I ran out of stamina and stopped reading again. Perhaps now is the time to try for the third time lucky.
It gets very slow in parts.  I had to force myself to read on.Feel free to skip; there's not much meat in the middle.
But he never figures it out and in the end he's not doing so well. In fact he outright rejects simple and reasonable explanations because he just doesn't like them. He's twisting himself up over the fact that he wants answers to be different then they are and is building intricate epicycle like reasoning just to avoid simple explinations of quality.
Intentionally not understanding things is something philosophers are good at.
I don't know if this will help, but did you ever read Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card?There's a scene in which the hero, Ender Wiggin, who is ten years old or something and super smart, walks into a room of teenagers playing video games and instantly is able to beat them all at video games that the older kids have been playing for years. Because Ender is just that super smart.It is very empowering if you don't know anything about video games and very silly if you do.Phaedrus totally destroying all the silly philosophers is on that level.
Sounds about right. I'm glad it seemed to help or enlighten a lot of people, though, I just didn't understand the appeal and a lot of it rubbed me the wrong way. 
How is the book about mental illness?
I think calling something philosophical is subjective. Maybe the book is predominantly an exploration of mental illness, but that doesn't mean that, relative to someone who suffers from mental illness, they get no philosophical content from the book.
I thought it had some of the most cringe-worthy dialogue of any book I've ever read.
I've read The Plague probably a half-dozen times. It's an absolute masterpiece -- one of the best, if not *the* best novel of the 20th century. Imo, of course. 
I always upvote The Plague. One of my top 5 books, heartbreaking and beautiful.
A noob question. I have always wondered if a book like Siddharta would be considered a book on philosophy in a similar way to the other books you have mentioned. 
Awesome. TAOMM quickly became my favorite book I've ever read, so I've been looking for others before I dive headfirst into heady philosophy.
> hard enlightenmentNausea is so tough to read. It makes you feel exactly the way it describes. I wasn't able to finish it. Brilliant in having the ability to do this though. 
I read camus in college but never heard about the plague. I happened upon it by chance at a thrift store and picked it up. Spent several days at the beach reading it (probably the opposite sort of place to read it in by theme). It's fantastic.
I think Lila has more important and longer lasting ideas than ZMM. His insights into the western culture and the perceived divorce between the arts and the sciences are fundamental to my view of the world, and for that I'm eternally thankful. 
Phaedrus twists himself up over it, Pirsig at this point in his life does not. It's almost a historical account of his past from the view point of another person who took his place. And he does sort of figure it out, it's awfully similar to Plato's concept of the good. You can't really answer it like you can a math equation, it's more about the journey and learning how to think. He says it in the beginning chapter, it's often better to travel than to arrive.
Exactly. I can't even explain it. It did "rub me the wrong way". Now I want to give it another try just to see what it was.
**SPOILER ALERT**Did you read the book? I don't want to spoil it but the whole thing is about the narrator being schizophrenic; or better put it tracks his, Phaedrus', mind and ideas that lead to his mental breakdown. He then, years later, goes back to this place with his son and relives the whole thing and reconciles with his past. That's the whole plot of the story.
It's literature really. I know that it is autobiographical but it's a story at the end of day, not a non-fiction philosophy book; i.e. it does not have a philosophical project, arguments that support a philosophical position and answering philosophical questions. It may make you think, it may make you think about philosophical question too, but that doesn't make it automatically philosophy book.
Which one? It's been a long time I read it, can't remember any cringe passage on top my head.
What translation do you recommend? 
Damn, I really like Camus, and I really liked The Stranger, how did I miss that one?
Yes, Herman Hesse should definitely be mentioned in this little thread, I think he practically started this kind of wisdom literature. Steppenwolf is a great starting place.
Did you make it far enough to get to Anny's discussion of "privilleged moments?" I definitely agree, his writing is really powerful and can make you feel as he describes, but powering through it is so rewarding and the end of the novel is a lot easier to get through. 
Lilas writing comes off as more  practical and tangible than zen. I found myself rereading sections of zen due it being so dense while Lila was a bit easier . Both amazing  books though 
i think i love you.
But his journey sucked and he didn't learn anything except a bunch of semantic philisophical arguments which he used to avoid dealing with the fact that he just didn't like that the universe wasn't magic.I guess that's the analogy to the motorcycle. He learned all these tricks to keep his beater running and uses the fact that he's riding a broke ass bike to look down on everyone else instead of just getting a better bike.
What rubbed me wrong is the guy saying how high his iq was from the start. There was so much self righteous, iamsosmart and iamsoenlightened trash in it. blaming his friends marriage  problems on a leaky facet, bagging on him for wanting his bike properly fixed instead of using a pop can, out teaching the professors that are his colleagues. Then going on a rant about the semantics of quality was too much
He's definitely not schizophrenic. I'd call it dissociative identity disorder, if anything at all. He wasn't all there at times, but at least according to the book he didn't have a diagnosable illness. 
Whats on November 19?
I didn't and am thinking now that I should give it another go. I've re-read the Stranger and the Fall recently and got a lot from them. I just remember experiencing something almost like vertigo reading it. 
Man, I'm sorry that's what you took away from the book. Maybe try it again in a few years. 
Ya I read the book in highschool and it just gave off a feeling of trying too hard to be "deep". Probably not a popular opinion on this particular sub-reddit.
Not to be too pedantic, but you do realise that the point he was making about the beer can shim was that it IS the right way to fix it. He was saying an aluminium shim, is an aluminium shim wether you make it yourself, or buy it from BMW.  The only difference is perceived quality. While I agree there is a strong thread of r/iamverysmart woven thru the whole book, it is meant to be his internal musings, so it's bound to come off that way. Anyone's internal monologue would. 
What you don't seem to understand is that this is literature and not a philosophical dissertation. As such, the protagonist's perspective is not something to take at face value. It's all about how his perspective works in service of the story. To the protagonist, his mental illness and his inability to define a concept are inextricably linked. There is nothing to be implied logically from this information. The book transports you into the mind of a mentally ill person who is working to overcome that for the sake of his child.
I have a BA in Philosophy and I was hoping for a philosophical work as well. I enjoyed the but it is not philosophy at all.
I could easily be wrong, but I don't get the impression you know much about mental illness. You don't have to "justify" it, that's for sure. Many people have lost their sanity over much simpler concepts than Phaedrus did. Religion either attracts or breaks a lot of fragile minds, for example. I don't have the link, but I believe there is a significantly higher incidence of mental illness within a religious community than within the population as a whole. Besides, it did not seem to me that Phaedrus was bipolar, he simply had a breakdown.
I definitely get what you mean, Camus has a really good mastery of prose and his characters' narrations aren't as unsettling, even if they're equally as bleak as Sartre's.   I would definitely recommend giving Nausea another go. I haven't read the Fall and haven't read the Stranger in years, I'll need to revisit those soon. 
Why? It's a book about a guy carrying around cobbled together junk that tells other people with cobbled together junk that they are special. I don't think I'm going to "like it" in a few years. Books that feed feelings of exceptionalism to the disaffected tend to have the most effect around a certain age, which I've passed.I mean, I didn't like it so I guess I didn't understand it.
But zen is the whole approach! Zen is the open eye that acknowledges Quality when it's just standing at the periphery; zen is the careful hand that feels the machine rather than rummaging through it. Zen is required for the art of maintenance. 
The thing about readers perspective though its that it doesn't have to be the authors intent in any way for the reader to take whatever they take from a book. If it made them have a grand epiphany for themselves even if you couldn't find evidence for it in the entire book. Every book hits everyone a different way. 
That's a pretty fair assessment.If anything, it's a bit sad seeing actual Philosophy PhD students make it their thesis work to try to tear in to Pursigs work as if it's something more rigorous than what it actually is or claims to be.
I think that's what he was trying to say to a degree. It seemed like a big humble-brag to me. "Look how awesomely smart this guy was... Which is me, but not really". The conclusion saves it a bit, since he poses Phaedrus was maybe not what he thought he was.Parts off the book were bizarre - like how several times for no reason he's described how his son shat his pants. And this quality thing ended up a bit trivial after all that lead-up.
> He did not hold multiple personalities at onceThat's not what schizophrenia is, despite what TV & movies portray. That's actually dissociative identity disorder, which is entirely different from, and considerably more rare than, schizophrenia. 
Um, no. In fact to a much greater extent than the first book Lila makes clear that his character is a fiction. His daughter is not part of the second book at all. Lila is actually sort of inverse of the first book: ZAMM was a fantastic travelogue with intellectual asides that you often had to plow through. Lila is a terrible travelogue on a sailboat with an uninteresting dumb woman, but the intellectual asides are fantastic and fascinating. And philosophical. It's a superb philosophy / metaphysics examination of the nature of reality. Highly recommended.
Thank you, I was born in the 90s and was generally unaware of the context of the book. So I went into it blind and was pretty surprised by what I found.
And yet it solves Hume's Guillotine better than your philosophical Canon does...
Yeah its really worth a go. The Fall is really really good. It doesn't read like a philosophy novel and I can't be sure I really got the full point, except that the main character's ridiculous actions are really no more ridiculous than anything else one does; but it's great. It's absolutely hilarious. He has a lot in common with Don DeLillo or even Tom Wolfe/Bret Easton Ellis/DFW. Comedy in fatalism. 
Not to be overly blunt or cynical, but isn't this, like...pretty widely known? I wouldn't say it's a novel philosophical idea. 
He's not the one who needed to say that at all. This has been known for a long time. Race is a social construct all you have to do is literally look up that phrase in google and read the science 
Why is this newsworthy? Has this not been a known scientific fact for decades?
Your comment is due to deletion i bet
We can look at monoethnic cultures and they still find ways to discriminate by optical superficial features or miniscular ethnic differences or faith.Gradient of skincolor or caste systems there are ample examples.Making a case against nation states ignoring the prosperity and technological progress it brought to humanity is lying by omission in my opinion too.The guy is an ideologue who has the conclusion before forming a model of reality.
Read through the comments here. You will see many people arguing that race is really important and a genetic absolute. Citing laughably archaic schools of thought about skull and brain size to justify pseudo racist babble. 
Centuries. 
If you read that what it is saying is that terms like "black"  and "white"  are not useful for defining genetic diversity as they have social issues tied to them,  they are not saying that races are not real it's a misleading title.   
it is called "mixed", is not complicated and has been easily understood foreverit took me a split second to see the author's picture to see he was not black but rather mixed himself.source: i am mixed and it is not racist to acknowledge it.
I felt it added to discussion
In what way did nation-states bring the world prosperity and technological process? Why would the technological and economic progress of the last two centuries not have occured if states had been arranged in a different manner?
The schools of thought wouldn't be so archaic if the subject wasn't so taboo today. Also, that's a lot of 'proof from authority' coming from someone in a philosophy forum. Are we supposed to be debating the facts here rather than just pointing at someone who's already done the work for us?
These Schools of thought are archaic because we now have enough evidence to soundly label them as hog wash.
>Also, that's a lot of 'proof from authority' coming from someone in a philosophy forum. Are we supposed to be debating the facts here rather than just pointing at someone who's already done the work for us? Debating established scientific facts just derails the discussion, just like when we talk about environmental policy and people start denying the existence of climate change.
>We do not categorize people based on their beards or lack thereof."Bearded" and "clean-shaven" are categories, are they not?  Categories of people, yes?> Race is not a binaryNot relevant.  You're still employing the continuum fallacy.> the construction of race seeks to categorize all people, even those that defy categorizationI'm not sure on whom you're imputing this motive, but it is widely-accepted that there is such a thing as "mixed-race."
A continuum suggests two opposite extremes. Race does not simply follow the lone axis of skin color, like beardedness does the axis of beard length.
> A continuum suggests two opposite extremesWell, no, it doesn't.  For example a 3 dimensional space can be continuous, as in Euclidean geometry.Not that that's relevant, because the continuum *fallacy* just means trying to deny that a distinction is real just because there is no strict dividing line.  That is invalid reasoning.For the continuum fallacy, it doesn't matter if the distinction is binary or not, nor does it matter whether it's linear or not.  (Color is a linear continuum, but not a binary.  Consider red, green, and blue.)
I think you're misunderstanding the fundamental point I'm trying to make. I'm not saying there isn't a distinction between races, i'm saying the distinction is arbitrary.You're right about the nature of a continuum, though. The model you seem to be proposing is interesting, though. If we were to create a racial continuum with multiple axes, what would the axes be? Hair texture? Presence or lack of the epicanthic fold? Eye color?
Oh wow you edited this.  OK.  > The model you seem to be proposing is interesting, though. If we were to create a racial continuum with multiple axes, what would the axes be? Hair texture? Presence or lack of the epicanthic fold? Eye color?How about you just treat it the same as any taxonomic subspecies categorization for any other species?
So I woke up this morning, clocked into my work from home job, checked Reddit as I do every morning, and spent the next two hours watching this. Thanks Reddit. 
Is the tide finally turning? I am so sick of the nihilism meme. The fact that this got so many upvotes seem to indicate something. I hope that at least some of them found the time to watch this.
Amazing difference between the upvotes on the post, and the amount and quality of discussion: everyone wants to say "thumbs-up, yes it sounds super interesting," no one actually has anything to say about it.How many people have bookmarked this and plan to watch it "some time?"
Jordan Peterson is truly life changing and it's incredible privilege to listen to him. He influenced me to continue my studies in philosophy and even expand them to clinical psychology.
Hey that's my prof!
That was wonderful. Thanks for posting.
This is great but I think most people have a sense that the answer to "what is the meaning of life?" should be succinct. Otherwise it is kind of nonsensical because you could literally talk about *everything that has ever happened*.
I hate this kind of talk to be honest, and it's not because I can't understand it. It's obvious that they have great command of the English language, but overall their ideas are very simplistic. Why not just use plain English? Pretty words may sound intelligent, but it doesn't make their arguments any more valid.I X'd out after he said the chair speaks to you telling you to sit.
RemindMe! 7 hours
Wonder how this would be if Terence Mackenna were also present
Does the audio quality improve at some point? I am having some extreme difficulty understanding what it being said in the first 5 min of the video (where I stopped).
Are they drinking champagne?
Sorry this isn't an argument but can anyone point me to where I could find more talks like this? Thanks
I don't like how the first guy conflates meaning with function. Saying that 'sitting' is the 'meaning of chairs' because you can rest your ass on one is, to me, like saying 'violence' is the meaning of trees because you can saw off a branch and beat someone to death with it.Great talk all the same, but I was sort of turned off early on because of that. My understanding of 'meaning' is very specific.
Protip: if you think there's a meaning to life, you're an arrogant human
Any way to get this in audio format so I can listen on my commute? Those youtube-to-audio coverters don't allow such long videos.
oof, the audio is pretty poor, I can't do that for two hours
Is there a better quality audio version of this? The audio gives me a bit of a headache to listen to at the current quality.
Surely this is like asking what is the meaning of rock? Seriously, surely to invoke meaning is to give something a purpose or to have been created.
I prefer to save those discussions for Rogan. 
Asking other people what is the meaning of life is one the most pointless questions. Considering they have their own life and assign their own meaning to it. Ask yourself that question. Your answer is the only one that matters.
Hmmm....two hours? Can someone do a ELI5 synopsis for each side. Maybe a paragraph each?
What's a "life changing professor"?
Is it Thomas Nagel?
It was 3 am when saw this and now it's 5 am. I haven't slept but I found the meaning of life.Thanks Reddit
What is it with this obsession about what's "real" and what's not? 
For one, the video is a two hour long static master shot. Like it or not, there is an abundance of content available today, and audiences must compartmentalize what media they consume. Unfortunately, a two-hour long video of a seminar (that is shot rather dull) is not going to reach a broad audience.
We are kindred spirits. I could have written this comment, almost word for word, and it would all be true. Good luck on your journey of self cultivation! :)
glad you found value in this
I feel like I've been saying this a lot recently...Check out the rest of his lectures. They were fundamentally life changing for me. 
Your words just changed my life. Thank you for writing this, it was a fascinating read.
I took a few of his classes. People alluded after lectures. Kinda weird, kinda deserving. 
/r/thatHappened actually, i'm not saying it didn't... but it sounds like the end of every thathappened story
My degree is in music not philosophy, but I became so frustrated with this in music academia as well. If you wish to convey your ideas to other people, what is the purpose of not expressing them in the clearest way possible? This talk actually has nothing on some music symposiums I've attended.
You just don't get it. 
Says more about you than you'd like to admit.
Love this topic too. I think what you're talking about is called Determinism. This theme is present in a lot of Thomas Hardy novels (basically uncontrolled fate fucking over his characters) which I've been reading recently. Check emmmmm out. 
Intellectually I have accepted that free will is an illusion, but I can't wrap my head around what this actually means in practice to us as conscious beings. The implication that we are merely passive observers to our choices and actions appear paradoxical.
Peterson or Vervaeke? Let them know next class that this conversation has been going viral. I went to UofT but unfortunately never took a class by either professor. Working my way through Petersons youtube channel lectures currently.
Translating between languages can lose nuance and meaning. So can translating the words you actually think into the most common words and speech patterns. Because we're familiar with transforming our thoughts into language, a sentence formulated in a specific way in a specific context can convey ideas that a different sentence that means the same exact thing on the surface does not. I doubt they're using certain words just to look smart. They're trying to be understood by each other with as much accuracy and precision as possible.
It looks like the bot didn't show up, but hello 
Have you tried randomly jumping in the video and finding out for yourself?
Yes, the first few minutes are shit audio but it improves a lot around 7-8 minutes in
I think it's just expensive water
Watch the video and get back to us.  The whole discussion is exactly about how the question is incorrect.
Not for the way they define meaning, a definition that they reach by speculating what one truly wants out of that answer.
Bingo, they are gleefully engaging in blatant question begging without  seeming to understand they are doing it. 
What kind of philosophy are you interested in?
The key point:The Western tradition has tended to abstract out meaning from the World. In fact, we are deeply embodied in the World, structuring our very stance towards the meaning. Grave existential crises are balanced against the need to have projects in the World.  The meaning is *how* to interact, the fitting in with the World. We don't see objects, we see meaning.See:Merleau-Ponty  Phenomenology of PerceptionRusson The Self and Its Body in Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit
Ok so if I choose to not have kids, my life is then meaningless?
It's not that there's no tangible harm in using someone's preferred pronoun, it's that we shouldn't *have* to use them. Which is what the legislation he's opposing is trying to do.
I agree, but I would go one step further. Relationships aren't "real" in the sense of "part of reality" is absolute nonsense. Relationships are what *define* reality. The Standard Model that underlies all of fundamental physics is actually the "Standard Model of particle *interactions*". A thing is a sum of its interactions with other things, i.e. its relationships. So I find it utterly bizarre to hear someone say that relationships don't really exist. Psychologically, physically, and philosophically, I don't understand the standpoint.
> There is a very fundamental error here in presuming that the only "real" things are the things that are "made out of the stuff at the bottom". It is a fallacy that deserves a name, and maybe it should be called the "physical primacy fallacy"Dogmatic materialism, perhaps?You should read "Science Set Free" by Rupert Sheldrake, if you haven't already.
They idea was physical insofar as it had physical representation inside a physical mind.
> The idea wasn't physicalThe idea is physical though isn't it? Isn't there a pattern of energy in the brain that would be the physical manifestation?
One night I woke with an image of old friend in distress, I could see him clinching his teeth and grabbing his chest. Half asleep I felt prompted to pray for him. The next day in the afternoon, I asked my friend who works with him if John was okay and i told him about what I saw the night before. Kev said John didn't show up to work that he had to go to the hospital because of heart palpitations.How in the world could science even begin to explain how that whole thing happened? 
No surprise at all that people aren't watching it, what I find funny is the relatively high number of votes and that it's on the front page, despite that fact that hardly anyone is watching it.
Definitely will. I still need to watch the last hour of this one haha. Lots to take in!
> People alluded after lectures. Kinda weird, kinda deserving.Hmm... I'm quite sure you're using "alluded" wrong.  Why is it weird that people "alluded" after his lectures?
Honestly it wouldn't be too much of a stretch, there's been one or two professors I've had where everyone is close to the kind of excitement and impressed they would need to be to applaud a professor, however every class? Eh.. hyperbolic, I could believe it happened a couple of times though, especially at the end of topics or units.
They use difficult language because they want to express their ideas in the clearest way possible. 
You're right, it's important to be mindful of your audience. But that's also true if your intended audience is other academics. If a domain specific word is able to convey something that takes ten words in normal language, then it's disrespectful to use that for an audience who understands and routinely use those domain specific words.
Do you think they are talking about some arcane or esoteric philosophical knowledge that only the initiated can grasp?
Doesn't every opinion on every facet of philosophy do that?Oops, I admitted it! You're trite comment is defeated!
Interdasting..Determinism is exactly what I'm talking about. Thanks for the info and the suggestion! I'll definitely be looking into his novels here very soon.
So what? In other words the meaning of life is what you want out of it?
With all the writing done in this sub it's strange you're downvoted without a response.
no, its that reproduction is not a meaning of life for you.
Yes , sad but true, unless you reproduce you will not know this revelation and it would be fruitless to try and change your mind. You can choose not to accept this but look into a mirror and there is your answer, you are here and those that leave no impression in the mirror are not. What deeper source of meaning do you require
Well, you have to observe that you mentioned different kinds of relationships. Human relationships are very different from the electromagnetical relationship between two atoms.
So Santa is real? Jk
A "pattern of energy" in the brain? Do you have any sources or anything for energy in the brain? My understanding is that we know very little about how the brain functions, so such notions are little more than speculation.I think the notion that the brain creates consciousness is incorrect in the first place, so maybe I'm biased.
It's painfully obvious that most commenters are just trying to dissect the video without making it passed the title or first two minutes.
No, I think they're talking about things you just don't understand and as a way of rationalizing that you just say it's stupid. 
As is with most fields. Everyone in every academic research field is relatively useless until they hit that one big breakthrough. Problem is, you never know who it will be or what will cause it, so the best way to make it happen is to get as many people into research as possible.
I thought Quantumtroll and the poster he's responding to were saying something different: i.e., whatever level of description one is using to describe X, you're still describing something real (all things considered). So human relationships wouldn't be very different from atomic relationships *mutatis mutandis*.Besides, if you can find a way to describe human relationships vis-a-vis biology (or whatever, pick your privileged level of reduction), you can then pretty much find a way to describe them via however "low" you want to go.
Of course there's a difference, but both types of relationship are invisible and crucial. No man is an island, tell me about your relationship with your mother/father, etc. Just like a particle can't come into being on its own (there's always an interaction with another particle), a human being is a result of relationships (with her mother at the very least). Just like a particle's very existence is measured by its effect on other particles, so is a human life realised by her interactions with other people. I don't see how one type of relationship is more or less "real" than the other. 
Sure. Anything you imagine is real, in a sense.
Where do you think consciousness is derived from?
Having watched the entire video, and having thoroughly enjoyed it, I would have to concur with criticism of the title as somewhat bombastic.
How did you go and find just that comment? 
Right. More money!
All you've done is argue why it would be difficult to see below a certain threshold. That isn't relevant to if something is there or not.
"It seems like you're just assuming Dennett should be guilty of this."I was addressing of how Dennett is perceived I think, in that there are many people who would consider him a dogmatic materialist. And that being the case, he still acknowledges emergent phenomena as you suggest, which indicates that perhaps being a dogmatic materialist is not sufficient to form the attitudes about what is "real" being discussed here. Hopefully my thinking makes sense, and we might even be saying the same thing? I dunno, Godspeed owl man.
Nah, you just had the couple ass kissing fanboys that would clap
Yup! You have to pay for it if you want advancement. Most scientists honestly don't make a single important discovery throughout their lives, but without the funding we have shoved into the sciences we would all still be dieing of measles.
Back in law school the whole lecture hall would clap damn near every time??
You're talking about real science. What 'advances' have we made in philosophy in the last 20 years? And by advances i mean things that have any actual effect on people's day to day lives (like a measles vaccine), not the creation of yet another masturbatory, useless philosophical theory.
Seriously? I have never experienced this. Was it kind of a Tradition to clap after a lecture? Or were your lectures all just good enough for a spontaneous clap?
Let me turn that around on you. How many advances have we made in physics in the last 20 years that affect everyone's day to day lives?As I said before, philosophy is quite different from hard sciences in that it does not have that direct correlation to what happens in the world. Philosophy is used in every Supreme Court decision ever made as well as used in creating and reforming of governments across the world. I realy do agree with you that philosophy has become too much of a circle jerk, but I don't feel it's useless like you do.
For what it's worth, I have a degree in physics and crushed quantum mechanics, and I have no idea what point he's trying to make. I'm not saying he necessarily doesn't have one, but I can't parse it out from what reads like a word salad. 
Hey i should answer your question because you didn't answer mine! Good luck in school this year...
You can be an idiot. (Or biased, or a hypocrite)You can be wrong.You can make a bad argument because you are an idiot.But if I suggest your argument is wrong because you are an idiot then that's Ad Hominem.
I'm glad the video goes a bit into the *tu quoque* version of this fallacy. I've been seeing such appeals to hypocrisy becoming more and more common on Reddit. A person not acting in 100% accordance with the conclusion of their argument does not mean that their argument is invalid.
It's best not to insult others when you can help it, but I find it annoying how many people think any insult is an ad hominem. If I refute your argument and then scold you for your ignorance that isn't an ad hominem just because I personally insulted you. The insult wasn't the basis of my argument.
This video is obviously useless because there is a spelling error at 2:07, and a guy who can't spell "circumstance" correctly obviously has no idea what the hell *ad hominem* even means.
Sometimes "ad hominem", while not good logic, functions as an excellent heuristics.  While it may be the case that I can't logically say your argument is bad because you are not an expert on what you are talking about, it's still reasonable to not take your arguments on that subject seriously. 
There's only so long you can call your opponents racists, sexists and bigots without addressing their ideas until someone like Trump comes along. We liberals need to take a long, hard look in the mirror.
What's the difference between an Ad Hominem argument, and a scarecrow argument?
Thank you for sharing.
How does this work with an appeal to authority?  9 out of 10 doctors agree that ...  , then an ad hominem of doctors used to reccomend certain brands of cigarettes.
This video may have been 1) the first YouTube video longer than 3 minutes I've actually watched AND 2) been the first post on this thread I've even viewed comments for. Thank you OP for reminding me of a strong, yet latent interest in philosophy...
I have seen a number of these videos now with them pretending to write out words... Why do they do this? And how do they do this? Why not just present the animations
Question: Is pointing out hypocrisy ad hominem?
When a leader makes all the decisions, and you have no say in these decisions, is it then not a given to criticise the leader? Criticising their  policies achieves nothing, and is divisive, while critisizing the person is polarising, and achieves a greater change. This is why political campaigns rely so heavily on ad hominem attacks, because fallacy or not, it achieves results.Ad Hominem is only a fallacy if it is ineffective in winning an argument.
And to sum it all up its hard to win a argument with a smart person. Impossible to win an argument with a incompetent one
The ad hominem fallacy and the fallacy fallacy are probably the two most used fallacies on the internet 
What about efficiency? For example if someone is making a claim that is difficult to immediately verify, and I know that he/she is quite unintelligent and/or uninformed (or he/she has made an overwhelming number of incorrect claims in the past), so I just assume that the new claim is likely false. Basically "all of your previous claims have been false and I know you are not qualified to speak on this topic, so I am going to assume that your new claim is false (unless/until I become aware of evidence to the contrary)." Is this not a good practice to engage in? 
Corollary: it's not an *ad hominem* to point out that someone is wrong **and** an idiot.
argue the point, not the person.
Idiocy is subjective. If an idiot is making a wrong argument, then one should never need to use ad hominem attacks, unless they can't support their own argument. 
What if I conclude that you're an idiot because your argument is wrong?(Serious question)
I have no idea why it took this guy 8 minutes to say this.
The whole video was about that, wasn't it? Isn't that common sense?I know we do it all the time, but we usually know we're being petty in doing so. It's basically to offend the other person when you're tired of arguing or realized you're wrong. But we still know it's bullshit to dismiss their argument for that reason.
Right, there's a difference between 'you're a prick so you're wrong' and 'you're wrong because of x reason, and you're also a prick'
> If I refute your argument and then scold you for your ignorance that isn't an ad hominemIts just poor tactics. Twain said it best 'Never argue with a fool, onlookers might not be able to tell you apart'. If you scold someone for their ignorance, you have already lost and the argument boils down to who can feel more right. 
Scold someone for the ignorance? Why would you do that exactly? What are you trying to accomplish exactly? Shame them?
True, but *does* the presidency require certain characteristics? Or does it just require a certain *image* of character? Do we really know which of our past presidents were genuinely "good people", and which were just excellent sociopaths who knew the right things to say? I'd argue that actual character isn't relevant to the role, but *perceived character* is somewhat relevant, and actions are much more relevant. Trump has neither good character nor the image of it, but he may start working on the latter, as seen in his refreshingly tame speech last night.
Trump won this because of all of the name calling, and because the left refused to admit their own poop stinks. I've got a big mix of supporters on my social feeds and usually the conversation went like this:"But the DNC cheated Bernie..." LALALA CANT HEAR YOU"I have some issues with Hillary's thoughts on..." LALALA WOMAN HATER"I don't think Trump actually wants to..." RACISTI think this is less Ad Hominem and more identity politics, really. You're bucketizing people constantly, and then using those buckets to promote your agenda and ignore other people's opinion.
Do you think the majority of people voted for trump on issues? Just because he got elected it doesn't mean his policies are suddenly better. 
>There's only so long you can call your opponents racists, sexists and bigots without addressing their ideasThe idea that 'liberals' don't address the ideas is ridiculous. The ideas are very much addressed and talked about, but that doesn't mean peooke are any less worthy of being called names for still believing in them.
Strawman?  A strawman is when you construct an example that your argument defeats, usually by misrepresenting their argument in some way.An example would be if someone tells you that we should increase education spending, and your response is to say so that means you want Russia to invade western Europe because we'd have to cut defense spending.
Didn't watch the video, huh?  The answer is yes.
Any accusation of racism is by definition an ad hominem attack, if the purpose is to argue against what is being claimed.  A statement is not false purely by virtue of it casting a demographic group in an unfavorable light.  That being said, it is not an ad hominem attack to argue that we shouldn't vote for a candidate who consistently makes unfounded and insulting remarks about large groups of people.
The ad hominem fallacy is committed when a claim wrongly attacks an opponent, rather than that opponent's argument.  Here, "wrongly" doesn't mean "ineffectively".  A claim wrongly attacks an opponent when the claim doesn't bear on whether the opponent's argument is good or bad.  An ad hominem argument can be effective (persuasive) without bearing on whether the opponent is in fact right or wrong.
What a strawman
But the argument in that case *is* the ability of the individual to be a decent parent. When the argument is about a person's character, an attack on their character is not an ad hominem.
And just because I could take the time to deconstruct a statement like "We could land a man on the sun if we go there at night" doesn't mean I owe anyone the effort of explaining how stunningly wrong and impossible such an idea is. Related to that is when someone is *so wrong*, their entire worldview is wrong, you could even say the wrongness is fractal in nature, there isn't much point in logical arguments.
> an ad hominem or any other fallacy doesn't mean your argument is incorrectThis may be semantic, but I'd say any fallacious argument is incorrect by definition. That's not to say that a valid argument couldn't prove the (same) intended conclusion, but the ad hom argument is always bad and never correct.
We embrace fallacies for usefulness all the time. Logic is not about usefulness.
As I said elsewhere, sometimes "Ad Hominem" while strictly speaking is fallacious, can still be an excellent heuristic.  None of us have time to become experts on everything.  The fact that an argument that Aliens have visited earth is coming from a someone that's generally considered to be a crank is a pretty good reason to reject the argument ex ante, whereas the same argument coming from Neil De Grasse Tyson, while not a reason to necessarily accept it at face value, might be good enough reason to at least take it seriously before rejecting it out of hand. 
I mean we all do this whether or not its good practice or not, but we would still be committing a fallacy if we said they are wrong because they have always been wrong especially if we refuse to even listen to them.Though people have no responsibility to listen to what everyone has to say so there is nothing wrong with not listening to something you don't find interesting, other than you can quickly cloister yourself off from new information that might change your mind.
Well several people have disagreed with what I said, and concluded that the video agreed with them.I don't know that what the video is arguing matters to me, even though I did watch it twice.
Care to share why you did vote for Trump?
Why not stop at 'you're wrong because of x reason' and not be a prick? Pricks call other people pricks.
No one is fucking saying idiot I don't know why everyone's avoiding the *actual* ad hominem tossed around by democrats like rice at a wedding.  Maybe a little dissonance at work? This is the ad hominem we're all supposed to be talking about:"Well he's a racist." "He's sexist" "he's a bigot". 
>You're right, but that just drives the point home that personal insults have no place in any argument because they just serve as a distraction and cause people to think outside of the logic of whatever topic is being discussed.I think that's a bit tautological; because if an insult isn't an ad-hominem then by nature it's not a part of the argument. Insults *can* be rhetorically appropriate, however.
The US president does have executive power though, including being commander-in-chief, thus being in control of the biggest army in the world.He'll be taking real decisions, in which case his image will be a lot less relevant.
It's all perception. Reagan was a wing nut. But he was a wing nut wrapped in the flag, riding a horse, and saying tear down that wall. He should've won an Oscar for his presidential performance. Maybe Trump will drop the female anatomy references and become more of an actor and less a reality star. 
Certain characteristics? Sure, respectful is one. Compassion, reasonability. I mean, should we continue?To put it on another light, you wouldn't want a clumsy surgeon would you?
Plato kind of discussed this in "Republic", and he refuted it by saying that the unjust person might get away with it, but the unjust state will suffer for it, if they're all just pretending, which is what we're approaching. 
>I'd argue that actual character isn't relevant to the role, but *perceived character* is somewhat relevant, and actions are much more relevant. This feels very Machiavellian to me.
I agree that it's about the appearance. But being able to create that appearance is a characteristic itself. Some people are incapable due to who they are as a person of giving the appearance of the characteristics we require of a president. Additionally, there are characteristics that aren't often displayed and are important to functioning well as a president. These would be things like the ability to carefully consider things, maintain a cool temper, and make tough decisions. 
His speech was tame because he was fighting with his opposite during his whole campaign. I don't think he will be quite as ridiculous without having to slam his opposite all the time. Besides, he's a cut throat business man. He got what he wanted now it's time to move on. 
I think it's just as insulting to portray the left as all ignorant idiots who silence their opposition.
Isnt identity politics sort of the definition of ad hominum? Everything is based on the character making the claims.
>Trump ran, and won, on racism and sexism. Perhaps. but my point is mainly that by the time Trump showed up It was already too late.  Finding racism/sexism in everything is why trump exists.
Maybe people should have talked about policies more than they talked about racism. Trump says something offensive and his opponent forgets all about policy.
He barely even *has* policies.
Yes, I think the majority voted for him based on policies
>The idea that 'liberals' don't address the ideas is ridiculousIm sure they do sometimes, but are drowned out by all the clickbait faux outrage over things like "Trump stands creepily behind Clinton during debate", "Trump manterrupted Clinton during debate", "Trump displays symptoms of an emotional abuser", "Trumps words trigger my PTSD", "Trump called me a cunt 30 years ago and therefore misogyny"  
Okay thankyou, idk why I said scarecrow... I just know I used to get them confused.
Oh, sorry. I've watched this video before and I forgot about that part. I just watched it after making that comment.
> When the argument is about a person's character, an attack on their character is not an ad hominem.All character evidence submitted to prove the fact of the matter asserted is ad hominem.  Not all ad hominem arguments are fallacious.
Well, there is a point when you have them between people who are sparing in their wrongness.But I actually agree with you, and your point makes the ad hominem even less offensive.  It actually *is* relevant if someone is *usually* wrong, so saying such is meaningful if the discussion is on something with any nuance at all.Moreover, I think people are far too apt to call "ad hominem" as a *defense of their own argument* rather than trotting out facts.  As in "you used an ad hominem, therefore I don't have to defend my argument."
I think the issue with this approach is people will be inclined to think everyone who disagrees with them on any issue must be at this level of wrongness. People would rarely be inclined to say 'I disagree with you but your position is intelligent and deserves respect'.
That's a fascinating perspective, and worth examining philosophically.To be logically useful, this method would require identifying the most fundamentally wrong foundation stone of their worldview, tied to every other wrong thing they think.  Without this, I would think it incredibly hard to convince people who have the same wrong fundamental thought.
But then you aren't criticizing the individual but instead the worldview.
If we want to be technical, I should have said a fallacy doesn't mean the *conclusion* of an argument is incorrect.  The argument would in fact be invalid, but that doesn't mean its conclusion is false.    2 + 2 = 5    Therefore, the sky is blueThat is not a valid argument, but its conclusion is true.
But this isn't really a logical fallacy, it's more like a rule of thumb. People are often too quick to just rattle off a list of them with no explanation, usually because they take the word "fallacy" to mean that it's never a valid way to argue. The subtleness of informal fallacies means that people often see them when they aren't really there.*ad hominem* is probably the biggest offender when it comes to incorrect accusations, whereas the fallacy of composition is hardly ever used incorrectly in comparison. In my experience anyway.
That's not true. If a person exists who is 100% wrong about everything (and you know this with 100% certainty), and you use that as your reason why we shouldn't listen to that person, then it's valid.It's more about relevance, here. If my attack on you pertains directly to the argument at hand, then it's not fallacious reasoning.
Good point. Another fallacy to watch out for is "Appeal to authority". Just because an authority says something is so, doesn't make it so.
No. I'm tired and don't feel like getting into big reddit convos. This is also a sub for intelligent discussion, and I'll probably make myself look like an idiot(I am much better at physics and history than I am at articulating my political beliefs). Hell, I'm watching a movie and I've spent like, 50 minutes waiting to hit "add comment" because I keep getting distracted. 
Honestly wtf does prick even mean? This is one of those situations where I said the word over and over and now it just seems ridiculous. 
It called projecting, most people that are insecure about themselves and their own flaws tend to call other people similar names that represent themselves. Therefore, OP is a prick. 
Can you not see the irony of calling people who call pricks pricks? You are breaking your own rule by stating it. 
Considering the responsibilities of the office that he has been elected to; those qualities are indeed relevant because he will ultimately be representing the same people he has shown contempt for time and time again. Ergo, calling him a racist, sexist bigot isn't an ad hominem when used in broader discussion about the election. However, if the discussion is about some specific aspect of his platform that has nothing to do with social policy, then it would become ad hominem.The election is over. Is there really any point in being belligerent and hostile to anyone who doesn't agree with you?
God damn, you people don't know what *ad hominem* means in terms of a *non sequitur*. Go study it for a couple days and then come back. An *ad hominem* isn't necessarily fallacious. But a fallacious *ad hominem* occurs when the attack is unrelated to the main argument. So, yes, insulting someone in a way unrelated to their argument in reddit comments is an irrelevant *ad hominem*.
Surely being a critical thinker is a pretty important one?
He's been an entertainer throughout his campaign. People were impressed by the braggadocio and the outrageousness, and he played up to that image. Clearly this was a campaign strategy.That kind of reality TV act might win votes, but he's a statesman now. It's not quite that "he's got what he wanted" - he *can't* carry on with that behaviour now.
That's not what identity politics is.
Can you elaborate on that? 
>Ironically, the tone is smug, in a piece designed to criticize an opponent group's smugness. Just curious - you think that the author is some sort of conservative?
> I just reject political correctness. Being intolerant of the intolerant is intolerant and is quite illiberal.I'm not sure I understand this: So you think we should be tolerant of people who are intolerant of the intolerant? 
>'I disagree with you but your position is intelligent and deserves respect'.    #  If someone has a more intelligent argument should you not change your position rather than saying the above?  I doubt I would ever completely disagree with a well thought out argument.
But if I was someone who didn't believe that the sky was blue, it wouldn't do much good to tell me that 2 + 2 = 5. You'd have to come up with something better to convince me that the sky is blue. Until that time, I'm just going to continue doubting it.
A man who has bankrupted 4 corporations being elected President of the United States.
The taste of another persons elbow.
presidential debates  ^^^^:\^)
> Appeals to authority are often valid, as when we tell someone to use a certain medicine because the doctor has prescribed it. But appeals to authority can be fallacious, as *when we cite those who have no special competence regarding the matter at hand.*Just wanted to share this because I wasn't too sure about the meaning at first.
it means penis
Not everything is a projection...
Which also begs the question of - will his supporters become disenfranchised if he drops some of the braggadocio act? Will they retaliate against him with the same fervour as their initial rallying if he starts to appear like "one of them" - "them" being the institution he fought so hard against in the first place...? It's certainly precarious. 
I did get that impression, yes. Are they not?
> If a person is wrong frequently The problem with tracking what I call "people information" is that it becomes a thinking shortcut that is ultimately unfair to the person or to other people.  "She isn't the type to..." or "He's a reliable source so I believe him" or "That doesn't sound like something she'd do".  It seems lazy to me.  Whenever I hear someone say "but he was such a nice guy" about a criminal they never suspected, I think well, that's what you get for taking thinking shortcuts.
The comment you replied to is discussing only formal logic, so a very obviously false premise and very obviously true conclusion were chosen.
I don't think you understand what bankruptcy is exactly. Look up Chapter 11.
Small penis? It gives me that kinda image.
So...You just explained what you perceive as his faults. Why would you need to use an ad hominem?
I believe the author is progressive.
We are literally in a topic about the use of "the ad hominem fallacy". You are literally being disingenuous and subscribing to some literal use of the latin phrase to be right on a technicality.
That is just a nicer way of communicating the same attack on the person.
You mean Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code under which debtors file for bankruptcy?
Why not explain it yourself? This is a philosophy subbreddit, not DIY.
Interesting. I still would have liked more solid arguments, but I guess it's an opinion piece.
It's proving your reasoning for disgarding the persons claim, if they have an argument in favour of their claim, you have to disprove that too.Also it's nicer, which you should consider a good thing.
Having a good vocabulary is your responsibility. 
Better arguments may be found in Haidt, et. al., I think.
Nice, I'll check it out. Thanks for the recommend!
It's pretty cool how the top upvoted posts in this subreddit are about the importance and usefulness and greatness and importance etc of philosophy... but actual philosophy gets moderate to no interest. Easier to pretend.
While I appreciate his larger point, many philosophies and concepts are arcane to most people e.g. I don't think everyone needs to learn the difference between ontological, teleological and cosmological arguments.That said, I ABSOLUTELY believe everyone should be taught:Correlation does not equal causationThe most common Logical fallacies e.g. Ad hominem argumentsBy simply understanding these topics, I think people will be less likely to say something stupid because they'll understand why it's stupid.
I think the meaning behind this is that the media, mainstream and social are clearly pushing agendas. Reddit included, the comments here can be good but the political  articles certainly are not to be trusted. Mr Higgins is a forward thinking man who wants the best for his country.  Philosophy may or may not be be the answer for more critical thinking. Some excellent points to above adhere to both sides of the coin. Let's be clear though, all he is saying  is how do we figure out we're being duped by the abundance of information we have. 
I think this Post-Truth thing is just the political Right applying Postmodern concepts to their Ideologyafter the Political Left implemented a Phylosophical / Scientific narrative that states your Feels are more important than what can be measured,they adapted it and used it for their own purpose. They over Safespaced their opponents with safespacewalls payed by mexicans.
This issue is not resolved with "philosophy" in general. The question is what kind of philosophy we should teach. We first need to reject the paradigm of nominalism and Cartesianism before philosophy will be of any help. 
I'm surprised to learn Ireland has a post-truth society too. Was under the impression it was an American cultural thing.
To be fair,a lot of philosophical thought is pretty esoteric these days. And for the layman, even epistemology gets pretty tortuous the deeper into it you go. It's hard to do if you don't have a serious background in philosophy or a related field.
I think you overestimate most people's ability to admit and accept when they are wrong.  At least here in the US, it is embedded into our psyche that being wrong is not an option.  Fake it till you make it is a result of this.  But people are faking it so hard, that they've lost touch with reality, and truly believe that they've already made it when they haven't got a clue.
I want to believe most people recognize "correlation does not equal causation" as existing, since that phrase has probably been thrown at them a hundred times over their lifetime, and it is used on TV at least once in every show; the problem is making them actually consider it before they make an argument about anything. Once they start the argument, they no longer care to check their facts since it becomes a matter of winning or losing, not right or wrong.
Understanding correlation does not equal causation is not the full story. It is a good idea to have, but you also need to know why correlated data does predict one thing or another in some instances (in a reliable and valid study). Some people on reddit (at least) will say "correlation doesn't equal causation" to anything posted, but they're often wrong because said study was sound and was able to demonstrate causation.
I came across a youtube video teaching a logical fallacies.  After watching the video I was thinking to myself, this is just common sense.  Some people really just don't have much common sense and I guess really do need to be taught it.  Fallacies could come down to logics of religion as well in my opinion, in turn knowing them could give guidance to individual thought.
I think it would be way more beneficial to teach kids psychology from a young age. They could learn these sorts of fallacies/psychological quirks of the human brain in addition to learning how to recognize and protect themselves from being manipulated through advertising, media, political rhetoric, etc.
I agree with the majority of what you said, but coming from an undergraduate majoring in philosophy, my academic cohort has got to be some of the least empathetic, dogmatic, holier-than-thou people I have ever met. Not saying that all who study philosophy are like that, but rather that empathy and confessing ignorance are not emphasized whatsoever, at least in my department.
I don't want to discard your theory outright, and all, since that is certainly possible.  But I think it might also have to do with the low job security, high pressure for measurable and scientific statictics about performance (the kind of things that philosophy isn't necessarily measured by), decreased funding, and the more general breakdown of american communities as communities (resulting in reduced community support and involvement) in the era of increasing globalization and social media.  
A little harsh on nihilism, no?
Perversions. How *righteous* for a slab of walking, talking meat.
So, super heroes breed super villains? 
You can support any position with anecdotes. The benefits or costs of philosophy education must be judged quantitatively.Also, philosophical training certainly does affect belief. Many positions (including moral positions) simply cannot be sustained in the face of reasoned criticism, because they are not internally consistent. So we should expect training in critical thinking to reduce the prevalence of that kind of belief. And indeed quantitative research has confirmed that it does.
>the comments here can be good but the political articles certainly are not to be trustedAnd let me guess, you also trust twitter and facebook comments. Blaming the mass media and not anything else is why we are all fucked. Just like we saw a portion of the American population cry foul to the mass media but then believe some poorly written, not-sourced post from a fake news site created by European teenagers.
No, fear of those not like us is history itself.  I would say we are better at not fearing others now, than any time in the past.People are smart enough to complain, but not smart enough to know how to solve their own issues.
> spout loads of nonsense that is objectively wrong.such as?
> There is no such thing as complete objective truth\> "What is a self-defeating argument?"
>  There is no such thing as complete objective truth. of course there isjust because theres *also* a tide of bullshit and snowflakes burying diluting and distorting it doesn't mean *something* somewhere isn't factual.  it'll just look more or less like the rest of the dross and be discarded when we see it in favor of something shinier that's also been painted our favorite color
> but you also need to know why correlated data does predict one thing or another in some instances (in a reliable and valid study)The science education I had during middle and highschool never touched on this at all. How *do* you know that something is more than just a correlation?
The logical fallacies seem like common sense when you see them in a course or book, described in clear terms with simple examples. But when they hit you along with all the complexities of real life, and they are endorsing your side of the debate, it's amazing how they can pass unnoticed.
Depending on her age - I would check out Sophie's World. It's not going to have the depth of a textbook or anything, but it's a novel about the history of Western philosophy. There might be some inaccuracies in there - but for the general brush strokes of philosophy it's pretty good. And with it being written as a novel - there's some level of adventure, mystery, etc. in there.That would be a book I would assign to high schoolers if I were to teach philosophy. Not the only one, mind you before anyone gets too annoyed with me.
check out the school of life, its what got me into philosophy.  It has its own biases but its still good for an introduction to philosophy.Also crashcourse has a philosophy series that seems pretty good although its a bit more advanced depending on her age
If philosophies existed in a vacuum, then nihilism would be neutral.  But they exist within the psychological realm of human motivations, and people who are amoral by nature tend to have an affinity for it.  
But didn't you just use critical thinking to identify the limits of critical thinking?
And yet the meat does walk and talk.  What a strange thing to arise from the void.  Perhaps the void is literally not there, so to speak.  :)
Thanks friend. Will definitely try her with Sophie's world. My daughters just turned 11 but is a keen reader and the fact it's a novel may help me hide my intentions. She loves to learn new things but I have a tendency to preach rather than teach. In a good way of course. But I'm no teacher. Thank you kindly
Stealth intro. Superb!!
Had seen that somewhere else but had forgotten till now. CheersI assume you mean the school of life i.e. The development of emotional intelligence??
> But they exist within the psychological realm of human motivations, and people who are amoral by nature tend to have an affinity for it.Ok so please provide some sort of support for this notion. Just because most open nihilist that you've encountered have come across as "amoral" doesn't mean that those people by nature tend to have an affinity for it. I seriously shouldnt have to explain this in a sub intended for intellectual discourse and understanding of complex concepts. 
But surely Nihilism is just the position that the Universe has no intrinsic meaning, including moral meaning. Which seems pretty much the default assumption. After that you have to work out what to do with that, which is where we get Existentialism, Absurdism, Will-to-Power, Humanist Universalism, etc etc. There are very few pure Moral Solipsists around.
Your mistake is to assume that the walking and talking isn't part of the void.
I'm a nihilist and I volunteer at the soup kitchen. I must be an amoral monster.
> I haven't seen any evidence of anything other than amorality and arationality in anyone's actions including my own.What.
How can a thing be part of nothing?  That's gibberish.
What you are doing has no moral substance according to you.So yes you are ( or you must as a nihilist be) amoral.
what do you mean by void and why do you assume the void is nothing? there's a lot of stuff happening in empty space.
Depends on the form of nihilism, doesn't it?
Not to drop physics into a philosophy conversation, but "empty" space is not empty.  There's no such thing as nothing in empirical science, and the concept doesn't really work in philosophy either.
Cool video. Proof is for math, people! In science we deal in evidence and degrees of certainty, never absolute proofs or absolute facts.
As someone whose research is at least reasonably informed by philosophy of science, I was so torn by all the signs I just saw at the Boston march.  Like, I appreciate your enthusiastic rejection of anti-intellectualism, but science is not some unbiased machine for generating proven absolute Truth.
Philosophy is not a science, but some philosophers happen to also be mathematicians and scientists and take a scientific approach to philosophy. Not sure I like the two things being conflated.
There's a lot of so called science base information with only explanations, theories, upon theories that show no evidence or experiments and have to be taken on face value by so called authorities. People have forgotten how science really works and the difference between science the community and the application of the scientific method
If aliens were watching they'd be laughing at the pathetic human race..A race of bipedals that have to gather in thousands to convince one person about obvious logic.
Except most "science" these days is funded by special interests. Even public grants, due to regulatory capture, are only producing evidence to fit a narrative. So when the soda industry pays for studies showing that drinking coke is fine, and the dietitian and nutritionist training programs are sponsored by coke, what happens? 
It's interesting to me that so many people, mostly left leaning people, see the belief in God and knowledge through science as two separate things that cannot exist in the same person's mind. As a believer in God, I absolutely love science! It is amazing in so many ways. However, people seem to be letting science become their religion, and religion always leads to dark places. Do hate or attack people who fear science. That is the quickest way to turn them away!
There is a march here at OSU!
I never want to argue with a philosopher who believes in his own theories. It would be pointless. I've had that discussion with myself before. My theories are logical, backed, and are even evident in day to day life. But I *can not* be certain because I am not all knowing. I became an agnostic early on in life because of that same reason. Science is the same way. It's theory, not fact. Political science is rumor, not truth.Remember: All it takes is a needle to pop a balloon.
there are plenty of deductive proofs in science. Ask a theoretical physicist. or you know, ask anyone who's used a deductive argument in a scientific paper. Rutherford deducing there must be a positive nucleus in the atom for example.
A number of them seemed like "pure science policy".  All I can envision there is like almost extremist version of all science society.We need a science tempered society, one where scientific research and evidence isn't undermined, but instead brought to the discussion as one side of the argument...An it seems some people cash in all their chips into an all science, all empathy, or all business society... that's a bit terrifying.
That's because this march is nothing more than a rally of political narrative. That's it. These people didn-t care about science 15 years ago. I doubt half of them have STEM degrees.
The question isn't do we value science over all other disciplines, rather that we should make decisions based in facts, not emotional appeals and not in outright lies.While science is not perfect, the scientific has demonstrably shown to provide results that are in fact truth.   Scientific truths can be independently verified by anyone.
Well it didn't help that there was infighting because people wanted to turn it into a March for trans and black people in science
> Like, I appreciate your enthusiastic rejection of anti-intellectualism, but science is not some unbiased machine for generating proven absolute Truth.exactly. I can't help but be reminded by horkheimer and lyotard, in that science wants to become the dominant language game to rule them all.
Exactly. The cult of science is just as deadly as the cult of religion. 
Why do you hate science?  You're using the internet, created by computer scientists, to bash science?You keep hating it but science =truth
I'm pretty sure nobody at the Boston march thinks science is an unbiased machine for generating proven absolute Truth, because *nobody* thinks science is an unbiased machine for generating proven absolute Truth.
Screw that, I'm a practicing scientist and I wish that a requirement for any BS in any science field was one semester of philosophy of science. There were enough contradictory "SCIENCE IS X" claims being spouted out today to make Popper cry.
Why do you say that?I'm getting an astrophysics degree with a philosophy minor. When explaining to people why I love philosophy, I've sometimes used the phrase "it's the science of thought" (not saying it's necessarily a literal "science"... depending on how you're using that term). But it is supposed to be rigorous, like math and science.
I'd be interested in seeing a theory without real evidence.  Maybe string theory?  I'm a biologist though so I don't have much interest or experience in theoretical physics. 
You cannot have a theory without evidence.> people have forgotten how science really works and the difference between science the community and the application of the scientific methodYes, apparently you have.
President Trump says that climate change is a Chinese hoax, and that vaccines cause autism. He wants to destroy the EPA, and science education because of those beliefs. How much more anti-science in government do you want?
> I never want to argue with a philosopher who believes in his own theories.But if it is logically true why would you not believe in it. True you can never be certain but every one has to believe in something no one will ever be unbiased. Have your bias in something you can defend logically. If you can only defend emotionally then you will need to change that opinion. 
How would you define Political Science?
One of my favorite signs at the Boston march was two-sided.  The one side said "Science is a double-edged sword", and the other said "Resist the siren call of techno-utopianism".
Aren't you sort of making an is/ought error here? Surely we can have an all-science society and an all-empathy society at the same time.
> one where scientific research and evidence isn't undermined, but instead brought to the discussion as one side of the argumentAnd what is the other side of the argument supposed to be? Something not backed by any scientific research or evidence? 
The problem is with that, science can't simply "be let in" because compared to every other type of doctrine,science is the "bully" science is right, until it's wrong. But science that is right, is always right. It can't be countered, feelings and desires do not counter science once it's established its place as an authroitive object unless the authorities denounce science. I'm for a ruling global science party but I get why some people aren't and social harmony is first most important or everything crumbles anyway. 
Don't get me wrong, as far as the question of whether policy should be based on evidence and we should fund science, I am 100% behind these marches and strongly pro-science.  (and not just because I'm on an NSF grant)It's just that some of the signs I saw were close to deifying science, and that weirds me out a bit.
But scientists don't just blindly have "faith" in "their" validity. Scientists constantly question science, they constantly "redo" science and good scientists actively try to further proove or disprove their previous research.
The scientific method isn't religion, but for many people, the culture of science is. People who do science should know that it is composed of grey areas. Armchair "fans" of science think it is a kind of absolute truth, and they put their faith in research they have only read about in science journalism. It's amazing how much more complicated the story always is when you read the original research.TL:DR Scientists and science "fans" are two different things (mostly...)
Science isn't perfect, but it's definitely not religion. Science has taught us so much about the world. It's an iterative process that has some bumps and backtracking, while religion is complete faith without any evidence. Science is the best way we have of understanding the world around us, even if it isn't perfect. Science's biggest weakness is it's done by humans. 
Your guest lecture was repeating utter nonsense.  Religion requires faith in the unprovable.In contrast, science REQUIRES that results can be reproduced by other people.  If it's not reproducible, then we chuck it aside.
I appreciate that you actually referenced philosophers here :-)
You would think, right? But you should have heard some of the speeches given today. Perhaps nobody thinks science is "an unbiased machine for generating proven absolute Truth", but it's certainly the case that some of them think *whatever it is they're calling science* is "an unbiased machine for generating proven absolute Truth."
No. The classical philosophers did not distinguish between philosophy, mathematics and physics, but to call one the progenitor of the others is presumtious. By your logic one could just as easily argue that science is the child of religion. 
Is this sarcasm. String theory is completely theoretical. 
That's and of-repeated statement, which is true and offensive for foreign relations... I disagree with a leader saying that... But he did recant it, and explained it away as a joke, so what should I believe now?The point of your reply seems to suggest I should believe Trump's statement, but should I only believe the original statement, and not his recantation? 
These are examples of science in action though. Isn't the entire point of it self-correction?
If you consider our perception, the earth is round. if you consider wave theory and gravity, it's basically just big ditch in the 4th dimension.^^^^^^^^^I_know_this_is_inacurate
Because that's not what science is, that's what the OP is all about. Theory is not absolute. Everyone could be dead wrong about everything. It's a slippery slope of loose beliefs based on only what you've seen or heard instead of what you haven't.
> But if it is logically true why would you not believe in it.Because the universe does not actually adhere to human logic.  We have no way of even being certain it is self-consistent.
I dunno after reading Poul Anderson, Heinlein, Huxley, Bradbury, and Rand... I mean I love those stories...We should totally follow in their design!/s
Uhg. Those sorts of signs make me cringe.If you don't like technology and think it's The Devil, stop brushing your teeth and go live on grubs in the Yukon forest.Otherwise, stop being a pompous New Age hypocrite and realize that technology is simply practical knowledge. And like all knowledge, it is a tool that can be used responsibly or recklessly. Moreover, the solution to problems created by this knowledge is never *ignorance*, it is always *better knowledge*.If there is any pathway to utopia, it is only - *only* - going to be through knowledge, practical and otherwise.
It may not be perfect, but it's the best current option. A technocracy or a merit based government is preferable to the current rollercoaster of emotions which guides policy.
I suppose there's some possibility within, but we'd have to go all "Plato's Republic" on this empathy/science society.Are bakers empathetic or scientific?
Most subjects in science have competing theories. There's always another angle, an unexplored or unexplained observation. There is nothing one sided about our universe.
The problem is that you cannot describe all of reality with science alone. Applying the scientific method is only one way to look at the world.
I'm a bit confused when you say "[science] can't be countered". Scientific progress is made by continually questioning previous assumptions and beliefs and improving/disproving them.
And the best scientists have been proven wrong by future scientists. Science is always evolving and what we think we know now can change tomorrow
Well, that's how it SHOULD be, but in practice people tend to listen to the guy who sound the most convinced of his own ideas. This is one of the big problems with science journalism and pop science, which is essentially what this march seems to be about.
the science fanboy syndrome is at least partially (if not entirely) the result of the way that it's presented to the world at large by a handful of science popularizers and advocates who seem to have the largest mindshare with the public
Science's biggest weakness is that it claims to be able to explain the world. It cannot. It can only explain sensual perception of the world
So you have faith in the methods of science to prove itself as truthful? You are missing the point of the message if you are comparing as above. Her point was the framework of belief was similar. 
I'd have to actually be there to say otherwise, but are you *sure* they weren't called science something more like, "not an unbiased machine for generating proven absolute Truth, but a hell of a lot closer to being that than anything else we've got?"
Science as we know it today, is an epistemological method devised by philosophers during the early enlightenment, so I think it's safe to call science a product of philosophy
I think you should ignore what his statement was and focus on what his actual *policy* is.
sound scientific methodology can reach incorrect conclusions. or, in layman's terms: sometimes science is wrong. 
haha, well I wasn't giving accurate numbers to be fair, just a general sense of how certain I am. Interesting website, I'm not sure how you can really get really "objective" numbers. Also, please label your axes! 
Every theory is "wrong", and every theory will always be purely metaphysical. It is impossible to describe the truth.
Sounds like something someone who has never studied political science would say. 
>It's science conducted to push an agenda, use for propoganda, etc. Yup, I can confirm. I'm majoring in political science and all we talk about all day is how we're going to conduct science in a way that pushes a political agenda. 
You mean not everyone is pulling for Brave New World to come about? I want my soma dammit
Wasn't the point of brave new world that everyone was an idiot cog in the machine but was happy in the end? The only characters who show any understanding and thought about the world or their place in it become outcasts, or kill themselves.Maybe I missed the point but I thought an underlying question was 'If life's goal is to be happy, isn't this a utopia?'
> realize that technology is simply practical knowledge. And like all knowledge, it is a tool that can be used responsibly or recklessly. I think I agree with you 100%, except I read the sign as advocating exactly what you said above.  Science is not a panacea, rather it is a tool that can help or harm us.  We need tools, but it is dangerous to assume that a tool will automatically fix everything.
I am all about evidence-based policy decisions, and agree with you that it's a really useful system.  But there were also people with signs literally claiming that science will solve intolerance and social inequality.Maybe one day it will, somehow, but betting everything on that hope seems to be leaving behind evidence-based policy, rather than embracing it.
I'm saying that if science is to be used as a rule, then once such "rule" is established, nothing else can counter scientific logic of course besides a more accurate scientific understanding. The post i replied to suggests that science can simply be brought to discussion to compliment other aspects but really science will trump all those other aspects and science will end up either being absolute or the authorities that adopted science as a ruling object will eventually denounce it. Those are the two pathways I see.
Huh. I feel like it's important to address diversity in any situation, but there's no need to polarize this march. Isn't it just supposed to be about the values of evidence and intellectualism? Lets not push it to the left.
Which is why it's not really like religion. 
I'm talking about scientists though, I'm not a scientist but perhaps I am one in training but I'm careful not to pretend I know how to be a good scientist yet. I simply respect what those who are do. "Pop science" seems to neglect the scientific method most of the time a dos more closely related to politics to in my opinion.
If we're gonna have brain in a vat conversations, maybe, but if we go down that road why even bother with any explanations?
That same complaint can be leveled at religion also. Everyone's religious experiances  are filtered through their own perception of there experiances.  if you can't trust the signals manipulating your brain then your own religious experiances  can't be trusted.   This thinking  gets us no place except the boring "we could all be just brains in a vat" argument. And if  we are all only a brain in a vat then that's it so what.   if you really believe that why even waist your time typing on this forum.
You're missing the point. The idea came from someone in academia, someone who had a bias against for profit science, not from ignorant laypeople.Calling something a social construct implies that it's not real: that it is born of instinctive human behaviors rather then objective provable fact; that it's an idea fabricated to serve a group interest. You might as well label science as another religion in that case, competing with other religions for believers. Newsflash, it's not, and frankly I find it alarming that a large number of people seem to want to treat it that way.
Yes, I understand that but it is still the *best* methodology we have for understand the nature of the universe. If something is wrong in science, we can correct it but continuing to follow the scientific method. Otherwise, we simply have to say "I don't know" until we do. The problem we currently have here is people are dismissing things like evolution and climate change. There are certainly details still being worked out sure, but the core science is sound. 
>It is impossible to describe the truth.So is that an absolute statement of truth?
Its an abuse of the wore science. In most European countries it would be translated to "political studies". Because the word science has a definitions on itself that is nowhere closely related to political science.(Im a Mathematitian and an Engineer who does politics for a living. Because I did political studies after university and was good at it).
I don't think we're talking about the same thing.
I'd rather lump that figure into the certainty pile than give the impression it's just a maybe as if it's 50:50
Forgive my ignorance, but the comment you replied to sounds like a simplified but otherwise correct version of what you just said. Could you elaborate on why specifically he's wrong, or the difference in the statements?
Well scientific data has the solutions to those problems already. The issue is applying that knowledge in the complexity of the world outside of a lab.
So when science said smoking was fine, putting smoking restrictions on age should have been illegal despite common sense. Then 40 years later we saw scientifically that smoking was harmful we saw what? 
> We know that foods high in cholesterol lead to build up in arteries which will ultimately shorten life.This is an exceptionally bad example, since nutrition science is notorious for flip-flopping its results. I do not think any public policies should be based on nutrition science alone.
Don't shoot the messenger. I just did the Googles.
No, this leads to the discussion of consciousness,which is ontologically distinct from matter (including the brain). 
Legitimate religion is based on legitimate scripture, which is an authority on God. It is not based on empiricism. One accepts an authorized text and practices the process in order to experience it. It is top down, not bottom up approach. Like someone else said, epistemology is something that needs to be taught. 
The other commenter said:>it is true but you cannot prove it.I said:>that does not mean you can't prove those things using more powerful mathematical theories.
Could you point me to some sources on these solutions, even in a lab environment?
If can't be proven in theory A,  are you saying there's always a theory B where it can be proven?You are impliying that anything can be proven, the problem is to find the right theory to do so. I don't think that you can conclude that from Goedel's theorem. 
>how do you know you're not just a brain in a vat being fed sensory inputs?how do you know you're not just some random rock with just the right physical structure to create the exact same particle pattern of a brain that's thinking "how do I know I'm not just a brain in a vat being fed sensory inputs?" forever?
If I'm a computer simulation and the person playing my character is reading this right now, you suck at playing this game.
Would be curious to know if there are any studies about how being exposed to things like this that make you question your reality (this video, The Truman Show, The Matrix, etc) from a young age can impact your reality and your take on life. I remember having a moment as a 6 or 7 year old because I wasn't sure if I was dreaming and how long I had been dreaming for, and maybe years had passed in this dream and I would wake up and have to live it all over again. 
If we were in a simulation there's no way a simulated reddit would have such an awful search function.
Seems like whoever or whatever is controlling my sensory inputs would want a more exciting experiment than this.
Doesn't look like anything to me.
Does anyone know what service this video is made my. That's a computer generated hand that traces clipart shapes. Any idea what company offers this service?
Make it stop!
doesn't this eventually boils down to trusting/not trusting the brain? Since it is ***THE*** source for our conscience?
seems like a solution in search of a problem.
I know that I do not know. Boom. Knowledge proven.
I have a theory. It's not my theory, it's just a theory that I find strangely comforting as it seems to be just outside our grasp of verification. We only exist as individuals in this dimension, our egos hold us here like velcro. But outside of this dimension we are connected without bound. We are one being, practically unaware of our divided, individual, 3D dwelling personalities. The entire universe as we know it is an illusion   that only beings bound to spacetime can perceive. We are the mitochondria of a more expansive cosmic entity. 
How do you know this video is lame? By watching it.The dream argument is stupid. Lucid dreamers can easily tell whether they are dreaming by simple exercises such as staring at an object or trying to read text.
Does anyone else think that this "living in a computer" idea boils down to if you believe in a god? Not saying they are the same, simply that because of the what the word "simulation" implies. That we are living in something created beyond us. It could be interpreted as a world created for our existence. Or a world created with purpose. A part of me also argues that the word "simulation" in the eyes of those like Elon Musk are no different of the word "life" in the eyes of say... myself. Thoughts?
If we were living in a simulation don't you think there would be a dedicated rule to prevent us from even being capable of that thought, and thus the creators of the simulation wouldn't be threatened. 
This is a natural conclusion to come to for most people, right? I've essentially had this exact or similar *intuitive* thoughts when I was younger.Just asking because parts of my social circle fairly terrible when it comes to discussion on this matter.
how is knowledge of this "fake" reality any less knowledge than knowledge of the "real" reality?
Fuck. Well after an especially long time considering this a few year back I developed a minor Cotard Delusion. I was relatively sure that I had died in a car accident. Despite having been in no accident. I thought perhaps, I had died, and that all current memories are an extrapolation of previous experience being worked into a sort of plausible after life. This nagging feeling lasted months.Then I heard a song, on the radio, and it was actually so terrible I realized I was alive. It was just the dumbest thing I had heard. Ever. 
After an experience has occurred, is there any difference between remembering the experience, or dreaming about the experience, or simply imagining the experience (which never happened). Or trying to imagine an experience that has happened yet?What is it about the past tense that makes an experience more "real" ?
Wake up. Your family misses you. 
Managed to watch until 0:48. And I'm an open type. If you can't know, why does she know.
I mean, that's kind of what the human brain is.  
It seems to me that this whole question boils down to falsafiability; since the whole vat-theory is non-falsifiable, Occam's razor does a great job at chucking it in the trash-vat, question answered.
You wouldn't be a player you'd be an npc 
So dreams are real?
my response to this is that theoretically some guy with a baseball bat could come bash your jar brain in with no possibility of retort, not a single measurable way of detecting it was coming. sure you could say you could already die at any point without seeing it coming, but assuming you had all the knowledge in this universe, you would be able to predict everything, correct? not the case if there is an external universe.
I'm pretty sure I'm in a coma. Now you get to think about if I'm just something your coma brain thought up to comfort you about your fear of you being in a coma. 
Welp, questioning my reality actually made me "insane" and depressed. I am taking antipsychotics for a while now because i experienced some really weird shit. I really should avoid this topic, since it could potentially trigger another psychotic episode. Reality is weird. I don't know anything.
yea my life seems like it would be pretty boring to be simulating. 
My god, this comment had everything. Intelligent questions for the audience, a good plot, unforced romance, nothing could've prepared me for that finale though.  Rottentomatoes 98/100.
ughjust no
Haven't you heard the news? It's made by the universe.Jk, we use Sparkol's Video Scribe. It's a fantastic program.
It doesn't really matter since we are all in a turtle's dream in outer space. 
The wiser you are, the more you realize you actually don't know. 
> your answers will probably determine whether or not I will delve deeper in the world of Philosophy lolIgnorance is bliss. 
> heavily involved in this world, does this knowledge (or feeling of lack of knowledge) impair your ability to live life normally and comfortably?- philosophy majors usually work at starbucks or mcdonalds so they're not really that involved with the world. they just think too much.
Nope. Certainly there are epistemological issues with trusting the brain. But there are also questions about whether we can trust our "inputs" to the brain. Like the brain in vat connected to a computer that generates our world. In such a situation, how can we prove that we aren't just a brain in a vat? We really can't and hence our "knowledge" isn't real. 
Even without skepticism that our reality is true, there is not yet a final word that the brain is the seat of consciousness.
Humans are adept at making patterns fit where none actually do. They want reality to fit into a nice little box rather than the chaotic fucked up mess that it is. Personally, I like the idea of a simulated universe because it conveys an order to things, but that doesn't mean that I believe it is true. The most horrifying realization I think people can make is that there is no order to it, that we're rudderless.
This isn't really a TL:DW. It's more of a TIWYSWOV (THIS IS WHY YOU SHOULD WATCH OUR VIDEO)
You cannot ascertain that you know that you do not know, you either know that you know  or don't know that you don't knowKnow knot known 
so you've taken acid too?
I agree with this for the most part. I consider myself a strong "believer" in an argument and sometimes I ponder whether I just want to believe in "god" but maybe I consider "too cool/intelligent (to paraphrase) for mainstream organized religion 
I agree with you, even if you somehow got the definitive answer, you wouldn't be able to do anything to change anything about your reality anyway.
Are you saying that science can defeat the skeptical hypotheses like the brain in the vat?
There is no scientific argument that can prove the theory wrong yet, and honestly these ideas aren't really practically useful at all. Kind of just fun thought experiments 
She doesn't know, that's kind of the point. If you look at everything through a sceptic lense you realize that there is nothing you can know with certainty. Additionally, if you don't know whether or not it is possible to know something for certain, you are still unable to know with certainty.
Turtles all the way down.
> as it cannot form naturallyWhy can't it? I'm fairly certain a jar containing a brain feeding it input has already been created naturally.  It's called a skull and body.
what if the brain and the vat came into existence through pure coincidence
Can't be formed naturally?  Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves, this is the kind of logic used by the faithful, and philosophy is kind of the antithesis to faith is it not?
I think it'd be a pretty big deal if you could prove were in a simulation. Also, if it's at all possible to simulate a universe aren't we more likely to be one of the simulated universes than the original one? 
Well, it's not a rock.
Falsifiability and Occam's razor are two different things. Falsifiability is an appropriate requirement of scientific theories, but not philosophical ones. What is your justification for believing in Occam's razor? Why is simplicity necessarily a virtue?
Why should Occam's Razor be true? It's just dogma
What is God? Is God the creator? Does that mean God is the man that turned the simulation on? Or is God the God of him?
> But to actually simulate our world would take enormous energy and space. What makes you think that the whole world has to be simulated at once? The rest of the world could be retrospectively simulated on demand.What if right now, the rest of the world isn't active and just the room you're in is actively being simulated?
>But to actually simulate our world would take enormous energy and spaceYou are assuming the "real universe" functions like ours. Energy and space might only exist in our simulation.But I agree, it does seem unlikely.
Until you wake up.
What kind of dreams are you having where everything is measurable and calcuated?  I wanna try that.
I've never had a sufficiently realistic dream for me to think this but, yes, providing that the dream has all the properties of waking reality, then for as long as I'm experiencing it, it's as real as the world is now. If I lived in that dream and was coherent enough to make points on r/philosophy, I'd say what I typed above.
Those surveys that ask "are you afraid of dying" I always think: I'm afraid I'm already dead and just didn't quite get the memo. I always picture being dead as being asleep so I have these terror moments where I worry I'm really just dead, despite the fact that I don't believe I'd be capable of any thought after death.
You joke, but just this week someone in the lucid dreaming sub complained that characters in their dreams were expressing existential crises regarding their existence beyond the end of the dream.  
It's not the extraordinary ants that give biologists the best data on ant colonies, it's the boring mundane ants.
I do not agree :You cannot ascertain that you know that you do not know, you either know that you know  or don't know that you don't knowKnow knot known 
I skipped to the end halfway through to make sure I wasn't reading long post from that novelty account that ends every post with a reference to WWF Hell in a Cell and spoiled the joke.... :(
And the pun in the end. Don't forget that.
Other people are like this is so insightful and I'm over here like this is some false equivalency bullshit with a smattering (or a ton) of other fallacies and assumptions.  Total bs
Regarding your last paragraph, what do you think of Pascal's Wager?I have had very little philosophical education, 3 years in school (biased philosophy, since it was taught a very up-tight catholic private school) and a 4 month course that was little more than analyzing texts and movies. I've analyzed the idea of religion for 5 years now and it's driven me from a devout catholic to agnosticism, though I'm not sure if it's for the right reasons or if I'm ignoring something.
I am aware of this sentiment but do you actually switch "ignorance" on and off based on what situation you find yourself? Do you always live in a non-ignorant world? I feel like your response needs more application to the real world.
The two scenarios are not equal. The first is based on the fact that the only place we have found consciousness is in the brain. The second is baseless. I'm not saying it's definitely wrong, I think it's a cool idea. But the assumption made for it isn't equivalent to the assumption made for the first. The fact that it is impossible to prove anything doesn't mean all assumptions have equivalent basis. 
Is there any reason to believe it isn't? For example, consciousness existing without a brain?
then *simulated universe* is just the latest costume for God.
I'd say I get "okay" backlash for using the word *Anti-Dogmatic Theist* in front of the family. Works for me. 
I can tell that I'm not dreaming considering the details, the sensations and the free will. If you can't tell, you are either in a coma, high or having issues with reality (a teenager thing). When dreaming, you wake up if you realize it. I've heard of people dreaming will being aware, but if it's true, that require training, and I never did that. 
Didn't it turn out to just be on turtle swimming through space, occasionally running across other disk-bearing turtles for disk-bearing turtle space sex?
Either way it still doesn't answer how consciousness arises 
This is idiotically reductionist
Well no, but it's not made of magic either.  It's just carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, etc.
According to the sensory input _you_receive, maybe.
Fair point. 
One issue here is that most of the times you take stupid shit for granted in your dreams; it can feel like things are logical.It might be a bit far fetched, but it's totally possible that our sense of logic is made up by our brains. Our brains can produce hormones that make us feel like we found a pattern, even though we did not.
Seriously.  Are that many people not picking up that he's completely discrediting the very concept of knowledge while simultaneously basing his entire argument on information that *falls into the exact concept he's decrying*?It's flowery, but it's still BS.  Say a bunch of stuff that seems deep and reap the upvotes, doesn't matter if it makes any logical sense.
Kind of glad I found this comment chain knowing I wasn't the only one. 
There are arguments for the externalized nature of consciousness, as well as for the fact that consciousness is specialized throughout bodyparts. Actually, I think any view that consciousness is 100% internal in the brain is probably somewhat against the grain at this point.
You never had a dream that felt so real that you at first weren't sure if it actually happened, even after waking up? I have, about 10-15 times in my life, but there are people who experience this much more often. I've also had dreams where i was aware (lucid dreaming), but only twice. It can happen even without training, it's just not that common. Besides, while in the dream doesn't it feel real? If it doesn't, that would mean you to some exrent are aware of dreaming.
great series i'm on book 7
True but that's not its purpose. It is meant purely to demonstrate the skeptic's position.
It's just a reaaaally lucky combo of the same shit that the entire planet and everything we *know* is made of. 
I agree with your main point though of it not really mattering for our day to day lives. Assuming we're living in a simulation, why should that affect me? How does that change anything? Life is likely just as meaningful or meaningless (depending on your thoughts) with or without that knowledge.
What do you mean by that?
I wake up everytime it feels real. I tend to be very skeptical (irony), maybe it's in my nature. Not everyone dream the same way. And I usually work a lot at night, which kinda fuck my dreams too. Once I get to sleep on a normal cycle I tend to have terrible nights, but I can count with my fingers the number of dream that I have memories of, and even less for the one that felt real.Dreaming and not being able to tell if it's real is not the same as being awake and not being able to tell if you are sleeping or not.
Just because the universe may be infinate and particles can pop in and out, it does not mean that it all eventually pops into a brain in a vat if the nature of the universe doesnt allow such a thing to happen. And quatum particles disappear because they annihilate its anti particle give its energy back to = 0
Agreed.  Or at least that's what my rock wants me to think.
But we are conscious about it and that's the weirdest part, I can understand that we are all chemical reactions but chemical reactions don't have a conscience.
Why is it lucky?
I think it would certainly impact how people view death. Opens up the real possibility of an afterlife. Along the same lines of if you could prove God was real. 
In todays news: the human brain declares the human brain to be natures most impressive creation. 
We are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. 
That is actually a very good point I hadn't considered. In a way, I guess the makers of the simulation would be, for all intents and purposes, God.
Is that ego or just a machine working properly? 
There is no such thing as death, life is just a dream and we are the imagination of ourselves......here's Tom with the weather.
Bold claim.Any evidence?We could all just be sacks of meat supporting a smaller sack of meat that processes stimuli using electrical and chemical reactions and is pretending to be self-aware because that let's it gain access to the "Knowledge" skill tree and craft awesome machines to download porn with.
There is no death, we are only a dream, The Imagination of Ourselves...Here's Tom with the Weather!
My inclination is ego. We're only so impressed because we don't fully understand the brain.
I just watched Revelations (1993) by Bill Hicks. Holy shit. 
I didn't know it was a comedian, and now I'm downloading his stand-ups. 
We're all only pretending to be self-aware? Thank goodness! I thought I was the only one!
...who *downloads porn*? 
I'm not sure what the other guy meant, but in reference to your comment; what does it mean to "pretend" to be self-aware?
>"They're biased, so they're wrong!" That's a fallacy. (Call it the bias fallacy.)By calling attention to someone's character rather than the argument, one would simply be arguing *ad hominem*. So, we don't really need to make sub divisions of the general category of logical fallacy to understand why the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from those statements.
The obvious exception, of course, is in the case of a refutation of a person who claims not to be biased.
This makes me think of the Big Short, when Steve Carrell's character is at Standard and Poor and the ratings person asks him "wouldn't you benefit from us making this chage?" (i.e. "aren't you biased here?"). And he answers "just because I'm biased, doesn't mean I'm wrong"Of course, he was right
I think the worst fallacy is the fallacy fallacy - the notion that you have found a chink in your opponents armor allows you to magically declare victory
Of course bias in of itself doesn't indicate wrong/right. But it is certainly a good reason to be suspicious of their claims. 
Everyone is biased.And the truth is the truth whether it comes from a biased person, a bad person, is something good or bad, whether you like it or not. In the post truth world I am seeing a lot of rejection of truth on grounds like oh they are biased or that's an unpleasant truth so I reject it. The truth is the truth no matter what. If it's debatable or subjective then it's not a truth. 
People aren't wrong for being biased.  If they were, everyone would be wrong because everyone is biased at some level.  The OP put "They're biased so they're wrong" in quotes.  I've never heard anyone say that or even heard of anyone saying that.
This is ludicrous. It's akin to saying that it's fallacious to assume that a broken clock is wrong because it is, in fact, right twice each day.It's also a straw man, come to think of it: nobody is saying that it's impossible for biased journalists to be correct. Rather, what they're saying is that biased journalists are often full of shit and frequently lie. There's a difference.
All that matters is the evidence, not the biases of the person giving the argument.Besides, *everyone* is biased one way or the other.
Biased people often cherry pick facts or try to spin information to fit their narrative. While they may not always necessarily be wrong, them being biased is a legitimate reason to be skeptical of their argument. Although, I do agree they shouldn't be totally dismissed simply for having biases.
However there may be a correlation between bias and fallacious arguments Since the motives are clearly beyond 'seeking the ultimate truth' about the matter and more in the realm of 'seeking a truth consistent with my current interests'Obviously correlation doesn't imply causation for ALL CASES ALL THE TIME but IME it's MORE LIKELY to happen in some or even many cases 
I've been subscribed to r/philosophy for a while now....  Too bad this sophomoric crap gets action.
Bias suggests a lack of consideration for facts that would disqualify the statements being made.The real fallacy is calling someone biased because you disagree with them.
- One can be biased and wrong; - one can be biased and right; - one can be unbiased and wrong;- one can be unbiased and right.Ergo: Neither depends on nor excludes the other. 
What I would give to be able to forward this post to my entire High School...
A ton of fallacies are just perfectly reasonable inferences taken ever so slightly further than they can support themselves. "They're biased so the things they are saying are wrong" is fallacious. "They're biased so the things they are saying are unreliable" is not. 
I'm reminded of criticism for hypocrisy. Hypocrisy may be a poor character trait, but it may be better than the alternative. Merely imagine a murderer who speaks against murder: am I to believe it'd be better if he spoke in favor of murder?!
1. It depends on whether the bias is relevant to the claims being made. 2. That's fine, but we should only conclusively dismiss something if it can be demonstrated to be wrong. And that requires knowing more than just whether a source is biased.But that's consistent with what you're saying.
What matters is if your source is biased. The main complaint currently is that the news is biased, and quite frequently the news will express opinions in which they cite themselves.
They are biased, which makes me suspicious. This leads to looking for errors or the bad things that the bias didn't care for or look at. Which might turn people off or believe the biased is wrong.  *This is where I'm Most interested, because if the biased person or group isn't wrong, Why are they biased? Are believed to be wrong because they are biased regardless of facts? Hmmm...  
This is common sense. 
Isn't this a genetic fallacy?
If I get rid of 'necessarily', the sentence becomes false.
Being biased does not entail being right.
Well, the proper way to approach someone with a heavily biased argument (assuming it's invalid) is first to dismantle the argument logically and factually, then proceed to bring attention to the likely reason why they would even assume its validity in the first place, namely their bias. It makes an intellectually honest opponent reflect, and it makes any witnesses do the same and become less likely to accept, at face value, future arguments that stroke their affinities in a similar manner.
But generally speaking, the more biased someone is, the more likely they are to be wrong... no?Assuming that evidence doesn't count as a type of bias.
No shit. But it does mean they are likely to omit or mislead wherever and whenever possible. So although it is not a guarantee they are wrong it is very likely they are manipulating you.
Isn't this very similar to the 'Fallacy fallacy'?
"They're biased so they *might* be wrong!"Being biased should raise the suspicion of inaccuracy. The more biased the source, the more vigilant one should be when reviewing it.
True but they have a vested interest to twist facts deceptively so makes sense to take what they say with a grain of salt 
It certainly means that they are wrong more often than someone who isn't biased. Because the fact that they are biased clouds the judgment, clouds their objectivity. And therefore they are not a reliable source. 
What it does is make your confidence in what is being stated by the biased party lower, because it's nearly impossible to separate the effect of the bias from the the conclusion, as it calls into question how every step the argument was developed, from inception to data gathering to data analysis. So while a biased party may be correct, it becomes much harder to determine the validity of the statements of any biased party.
Wow, this thread is rife with nonsense. Debate and philosophy are different things. Please stop conflating them. Also, there is no such thing as "the bias fallacy". Perception of bias is covered by ad hominem attacks. Bias fallacy is something this guy made up and that people (supposition here) are latching onto because they've been accused of bias before. Does being biased make you wrong? No. Does being biased make bias fallacy a thing? Also, no.
But it certainly means you're narrow minded therefore increasing the likelihood of being wrong 
Why the fuck does this have so many upvotes?It's not the "bias fallacy", calling their character into question is just a simple ad hominem...What the hell is going on in here?
Being biased does not automatically mean being wrong, no.Being biased does, however, raise the probability of incomplete research, inaccurate analysis and incorrect conclusions.Thus if an opponent is biased is a very good indicator that you should examine their sources and research as you are likely to find the research to be of poor quality and/or misrepresented.
They're not wrong, but they're still biased. They are going to skew their answer in a way that is favorable to their own viewpoint. 
A good rule of thumb is to believe sources if they do one of these two things:: it making a claim that others also attest to, or making a claim that would fit against its narrative.  For example, if Breitbart argues something that would go against their narrative, such as that science has proven human caused global warming, it would be logical to trust them. If the New York times were to claim now that global warming were false, it would again be logical to accept them. 
I think one the major issues with biased sources isn't that they're lying, it's that they're withholding the other side of the story, or the facts that don't fit their agenda. This, I think, is more damaging overall. They can tell the truth in everything they say, yet still manage to misrepresent the true narrative.
I think you can infer bias from falsehood, but not the other way around. For example I can say Tom Brady is the best QB ever, and that's not false even though I'm biased. But you can infer bias from a comment like Julian Edelman is the best WR in the league.Also it's a specific form of ad hominem more than anything.
"Being biased doesn't entail being wrong."No, but "bias" suggests a loyalty to something other than facts.
but we can infer credibility. news organizations are worthless without credibility.
That sounds like an impossible statement. Can you give me an example?
I agree with that analysis (I.e., that the bias fallacy is a form of ad hominem). In my experience many people who know what an ad hominem fallacy is do not seem to recognize that the bias fallacy is an instance of it. Perhaps I'll add that point. (Or you can in the comments if you prefer).
How often are we arguing with people formally? In everyday conversation we aren't proving or disproving things with certainty. The fact is that pointing out someone's bias illustrates that they are *more likely* to be guilty of motivated reasoning.Most of the time when someone calls me out for a formal fallacy in a normal conversation, I wasn't making a formal argument in the first place.
I wouldn't call being biased a character flaw but a flaw in reasoning. 
It's also potentially fallacious to present any given issue as having only a "right" or a "wrong" position.
A bias may not be a character flaw, though.  Editorial bias, for example, is considered quid pro quo for publications.  So pointing out a bias may not always be an ad hominem but might just be an observation.
Would an entirely apathetic person still be biased though? I mean prior biases could exist but if they really didn't care about whatever those biases pertained to could they really be said to have a bias at all? 
Good point. But even that requires a further premise, no? Premise 1: They're biased.(Suppressed premise: they think that they're not biased).Conclusion: They're wrong.
Why? It doesn't necessarily mean the person is wrong. If they're wrong, that's probably the reason, that's about it.Anything else is just statistics. You're having a XXXX 2016 sign in you yard? The probability is higher that you're gonna have a certain stance on a certain issue, regardless of the issue itself. Unfortunately that's not much more than a mathematically justified prejudice (which basically is a prejudice)
The problem is when people act like suspicion is enough to deny their claims without even checking the evidence.
Everyone is biased, not sure why this should be particularly notable. Discretion is necessary when considering any sources that haven't been vetted. Bias should always be taken into account, but that doesn't mean they should be dismissed without any consideration.
> Of course bias in of itself doesn't indicate wrong/right. But it is certainly a good reason to be suspicious of their claims.I actually disagree with this. It seems to me that the US culture confuses "bias" and "propensity for lying". This mixup is only in the interest of those who are lying, because everyone has "bias" (meaning beliefs in what is false and true, right and wrong), but if that means everyone is lying then that means nobody is really any worse than anyone else. The consequence is that the lying bastards can dismiss honest reporting as "biased".
Shouldn't you be suspicious of any claim, in the sense that you should always be trying to figure out if it's true or not? Regardless of who it comes from?
Sounds like someone needs a lesson in perspectivism IMO.
I feel most people are most persuaded via pathos. We much prefer the *feeling of being morally superior* to an adversarial position over a worldview free of fallacies. Cf. most newspaper op-eds and nearly all speeches made by political figures.So the heuristic we're most likely to choose in deciding which authorities to trust, in my view, is whoever makes us feel best.
The post features a couple instances of people saying things like that.
yup. its not that a biased person is more likely to be wrong, its that a biased person is more likely to have constructed their argument based on their biases and (possibly/often/potentialy) ignoring details not fitting, in line with their biases.If a media outlet with an anti immigration bias reports on any and all instance of crime committed by immigrants, its not that they are wrong about the crimes committed, they just have certain reasons for why they call attention to this.
The evidence *and* the logical inferences we make from the evidence. But yeah.
Correlation, in the majority of cases isn't accompanied by causation ;-) so I don't know how about your claim.  You can find Correlation very easily between totally unrelated things while a causal dependency must be proven. 
Exactly. The doctor who tells you to lose weight while being overweight himself; he's a hypocrite, but he's not wrong. If the doctor tells you to take some drug, and he's been funded by the drug manufacturer, he's very biased, but *it still may be the best drug for you*. Bias and hypocrisy increase the probability someone's opinion may be wrong, but it is not evidence by itself.
The alternative is honesty. That's not usually a trait a morally bankrupt person would possess. Charles Manson... maybe? He's honest about feeling he did nothing wrong. Thankfully parole boards frown on that.
But even if a source is biased, it doesn't *necessarily* follow that all of their claims are false.
No it doesn't. 
Not necessarily. Section 3 explains.
Sounds like you're assuming that all biases *decrease* accuracy. That's not the case. Some biases *improve* accuracy.
Let's grant that it's a *subset* of ad hominem. Just because one thing is a subset of another thing doesn't mean that the subset doesn't exist. 
Not necessarily. Some biases actually improve accuracy.
FWIW, I'm surprised by all the upvotes as well. 
But not all biases decrease accuracy. Some biases improve accuracy.
Fair point. Withholding relevant facts is a bias that might make it more likely that one is wrong. But even that bias wouldn't *necessarily* result in being wrong. A fine distinction, but a distinction nonetheless.
i would think it is more a subset of the fallacist's fallacy.  it relies less on their character and more on a particular error in their reasoning and inferring the falsehood of their conclusion.    there is a lot of overlap between identifiable fallacies, but this would seem to be a formal fallacy where ad hominem is not.
How often do you hear people say trump is a liar and therefor you can't believe anything he says. Do you think that is a valid opinion to have? Does the fact that someone or an institution doesn't mind lying to give the impression they want you to have matter?
Though I agree that one cannot dismiss a logical argument due to the bias fallacy we are discussing, but I then find myself thinking of the instance in which a student performed a social experiment pertaining to the idea of spreading an inherently misleading/bias claim with entirely truthful facts. Although a bias story is still a story with information, if it has clear bias, it is hard to determine if it is worth believing/endorsing, as it could be misleading by nature.   I'm on mobile, and can find the link when I get home, but what are your thoughts on this?  
If calling someone biased is the same as saying that their argument has a flaw in reasoning, it is essentially the fallacy fallacy unless you can also say what that flaw is.
It's true that recognizing and pointing out a bias is not a fallacy in and if itself. But when it's used in an argument that has nothing to do with a person's biases, then that argument is made "to the man" rather than addressing the actual issues.
Yes. A lot of bias is the result of heuristics, our brains just trying to minimize the energy used to think about something by oversimplifying it. An entirely apathetic person hypothetically wouldn't care enough to put in the extra time and energy to get around this. They would just default to either the intuitively best sounding answer, or the answer closest to what they've been raised with.Arguably, Apathy toward the truth is as good a cause for bias as caring too much for what you feel should be true.
and that may be the biggest trap that bias offers.. thinking we don't have a bias at any point in time.  We do.. what it is we may not know, it may be so ingrained in us we could never even  understand it as bias... but its there.It can something as simple as lacking information we don't realize we lack, it can be our experiences influencing us, it can be issues with time etc.If you are human, you are bias.  
If someone says 'I am not biased,' then it suffices as a refutation of their position to point out that they are.
> The problem is when people act like suspicion is enough to deny their claims without even checking the evidence.For sure, this is always a problem in any context. If one doesn't even attempt to see the other side (or "steel man" arguments), then not much progress can be made and people will just talk past each other. 
> Everyone is biased, not sure why this should be particularly notable.For context, and to avoid other common pitfalls in logic. If someone falls on a particular end of the political spectrum their claims about political ideas should be taken with their bias in mind (and thus note information that may be omitted or distorted by a particular perspective). > that doesn't mean they should be dismissed without any consideration.I can't think of any good reason to dismiss anything without consideration. 
So you're talking about what authorities we trust. Just expanding on what I said right?
I have never heard of anyone seriously say that bias indicates truth of a claim. This is a total straw man. 
But there is a high chance that they are altering the truth to push their agenda.
Feel free to explain why.
I apologize for insinuating you are an attention seeking ass. That was unnecessarily rude
If someone is objectively right, they're not biased by definition, no?So the further away you are from objectively right, the more likely you are to be wrong. Also, you become exponentially more likely to be wrong the more biased you are. Which is why MSNBC is still a legitimate news source, but Breitbart News is not.
eh... You've tried to make it a fallacy in and of itself. Too much rhetoric surrounds the notion of bias or perceived bias to "call it the bias fallacy"
How ? To me if you ignore half of a picture. You only see half of the picture 
And?I said it was a simple ad hominem and you said "it's an ad hominem", what's your point?I'm sorry but I really don't see what the point of this post probably is, or any of your follow-up comments. Other than to teach us high-school philosophy.
Of course, people will often call a source biased, but then still believe them if it suits their own cause.
They do it to get more views and clicks
Anonymous sources are nothing new
While we're on the subject of the fallacist's fallacy and ad hominem, I have noticed that most people misinterpret what ad hominem really is; that is, any uncivil comments in the course of an argument are hailed as "ad hominem!" and the entire argument is dismissed out-of-hand.There is an enormous difference between "you are wrong, therefore you are stupid" and "you are stupid, therefore you are wrong." Only one is an example of ad hominem. The other is just a lack of decorum, which says nothing about the logical validity of the argument.
You can't say 'someone lies, therefore this that they said is also a lie' but you CAN say 'someone lies, therefore this thing that they said should deserve greater scrutiny'.To expand on a common proverb, 'A broken clock is right twice a day, but it's still a broken clock and needs fixing.'
> If calling someone biased is the same as saying that their argument has a flaw in reasoning...It's not the same, it's pointing out one of many possible flaws in reasoning. Of course when discussing a specific case one should be able to point out the specifics of the bias in question.
I am not biased. The president of the US is Donald Trump. Does it render my point moot if I'm secretely against/for Trump? No. Facts are facts, independent from the one who states them.
> I can't think of any good reason to dismiss anything without considerationIt's a repetition of something that has been dismissed with consideration?
Actually, I disagree. Who's to say that the ends of the political spectrum are more likely to be wrong than the center? Maybe one end is actually correct.
I agree with you that we pick and choose authorities to listen to.But the way in which we choose the authorities we pay attention to is not free from error. In the context of a discussion about how people commit fallacies, it seemed appropriate.
True, though at the same time the core principles of any given philosophy seem to depend on where and when you're asking.  How do you set a standard for who's a real Christian when they're all steadfastly ignoring some part of the Bible?
Hmm. Can you quote the part where I claimed that the bias fallacy could not be a subset of another class of fallacies? I think I'm missing it.
I'm making a distinction between a set and a subset. 
I don't know if that's the case. I think the reason this is done is that the credibility of a controversial argument is reinforced when an antagonistic source supports that argument. :
No, but I'm not sure you can deny that the number of anonymous sources is much higher than it used to be. "Leaks" are much more likely to happen in a digital age.
I always have people come at me for poor decorum screaming about ad hom.  No I didn't say you were wrong *because* you're a pretentious douchebag. I said you were wrong because of your reasoning and that you are *also* a pretentious douchebag.
What if you know the institution or individual as a goal of getting you to view a situation in a negative light? At what point do they become discredited. Surly you wouldn't trust a nazie to give you a truth, so I imagine somewhere before nazie you begin to mistrust a source.
I don't think they are saying it is false, just biased. 
The problem with that is that it's far too easy to "shutdown" or ignore the arguments accusing them of nefarious purposes. A tangential point should be able to be quickly dismissed as irrelevant while still providing it consideration, or at least tabling it for a later discussion.Trolls, well, it's a strange phenomenon, but I've actually found I prefer to engage and that it can often still be fruitful conversation in some respect. In principal I agree with you, but I think in practice it's far too hard to identify truly bad intentions, and accusations of "trolling" are too-readily levied. 
Agreed. I don't know how we pick authorities, and I am not sure I agree fully with you in how most people pick authorities. Perhaps you can make a more compelling case for it?
You've assumed I agreed with your original reply (which I didn't). You're arguing on premises I don't agree with.
That's fair enough but I don't think it should constitute a full post on a philosophy-based subreddit. Given the upvotes, I guess I'm wrong.
Deep throat
And what is the point of your *also*? In the end the only contribution you've made is the phrase before it. And many people who simply disagree with you are less likely to take you seriously or engage you. It almost seems like a tactical decision: 'I'm going to make this point and then reduce the likelihood of a counterargument by being really ugly.' It's lazy, and a lack of decorum is synonymous with poor arguments in general. 
Is there a site where you can learn how to argue with people? Like besides this one!
We trusted the Nazi's to help build the V5 rocket for the Apollo missions, so no I wouldn't say that any particular position should lead to outright distrust of everything.  They might be in the KKK but that doesn't mean they aren't right about the transmission in your pick-up truck.
> where you have a justified true belief but not Knowledge.It's not even justified in this case, the premise is false. Unless of course you are justified on believing the premise (even though it is false)
> Perhaps you can make a more compelling case for it?Perhaps I can. But what I wrote was meant as an offhand comment. I'm content to leave the topic without any further exploration.
I don't really get these mental gymnastics used to make hypocrisy a virtue or desirable trait. Is a murderer that is publicly against murder a net positive contribution to the world? It seems like the world is no better off if either way he is killing people. Your advocacy is based on actions, not lip service. 
I don't know. Sometimes useless stuff gets upvoted. ;)
I've been In philosophy class. Most people don't care or don't get it. It's an acquired taste I've come to believe
I hate the "there is no wrong answer" open forum type philosophy my HS taught, rather than teaching you how to think logically and scrutinize an argument. Instead it's more like "Are we free?" and then a bunch of 16 year olds complaining they can't do what they want. 
Yeah! And all of our kings should be philosophers too!
Except you'd have to change the basic school structure so Americans could understand logic first, then philosophy.
Do you have a transcript for this video? Not interested in sitting through that robot voice.
Sorry but there is no practical application to philosophy in terms of production. Math, science and History do. 
Highschool teaches kids how to do as their told and not question anything.  Teachers want students to say the same answer and to be one.  There is no thought process in school, it's just a bunch of mindless thinking and pure memorization with no building of true knowledge and comprehension.  A highschool kid would fail philosophy so I'm not sure how you would teach it on a highschool level since it's barely teaching as it is.  They say the same script for years and years.  
Depends what type of philosophy. Seeing the state some universities are in, I really don't think you guys need your high schools churning out little Marxists.
I was under the impression philosophy was taught at high-schools? I'm from Portugal and had mandatory philosophy from 7th grade to 10th. 11th and 12th had psychology, regardless if you were specifying in sciences or literature or arts
...and a complete waste of time/money on the student's side.  Academia screwed philosophy.  
Quite the opposite. I studied the great philosophers and a few not so great. Most of it is psychobabble that is very circular in nature and works like telling someone the attributes of their sign or reading a fortune cookie. They superimpose some very general and nebulous statement about an observation onto them self. Quite like the way people see elephants in clouds. Don't make the assumption that someone is not knowledgeable in. Subject because they have not come to the same opinion as you.
While my school didn't specifically have a philosophy class, they were focused on teacher critical thinking, how to write critical essays, how to "decode" paragraphs to get the main point the authors trying to make.  Considering they only have like a .3% drop out rated think it works out well. Not everyone likes philosophy, and I could see something like epistemology to be "triggering" in this day and age, causing kids to have an internal crisis lol.
This.Where I live (Argentina) we are taught philosophy in highschool and we don't have a 'better society'
Yup.  I went to high school in America. We spent a good 6 weeks my sophomore year doing a unit on philosophy.  I thought it was incredibly boring. You also need a certain amount of maturity that most high school aged boys don't have.  
Especially since most people are handed a basic philosophy from birth known as religion and don't want to have to think or question their belief system. 
"I can't go to the bathroom or go on my phone whenever I want, so I'm not free"
Philosophical conversations are explored but should be supplemented by historical figures in philosophy, and their work.
Come to think of it, aristocracy is a *really* good idea!
I can't tell if you are serious or not... And you can't tell how I feel about it... 
Teaching ~~education~~ in American high schools would make for a better country. 
Yup.Logic and critical thinking would be a much more helpful place to start.
Oooooooooooooooh
Where I grew up (Europe) there is no course in logic in high school anywhere, but philosophy is taught in many high schools.
They need to teach these in elementary tbh.Just like you build language, or math skills over the developmental period, you can start as early as when a child begins to write. 
They do that in 1% of schools ;-)
Your parents are supposed to teach you most of that shit.
Erroneous assumption: The US finds practical and efficient solutions to social problems.
Isn't it true though that most education in philosophy outside of university is just memorization? 
Uhm, tomorrow is Judaisms most important holiday and it's entirely about admitting your wrongdoings. Major take-away from any story about the prophets or kings is how they were wrong and made mistakes over and over. Not every religious person is incapable of questioning their own philisophy/belief system.
> society needs education and disciplineAnd common sense, but you can't teach that.
One of my HS teacher allowed us to go to bathroom whenever wanted, his thought process was that he wasn't gonna make us pee on the floor and how is he going to explain this to the dean/AP/counselor etc. (he prob had to go through this once in his career). Off topic I know sorry.
That's not a bad argument, really. You're at least not totally free. 
The reliance of going into historical aspect is part of the reason a lot of people find it so boring. The class should try to relate philosophical questions to everyday life rather than talk about ancient Greek bros at least for mandatory a high schools class
Teaching ~~education~~ in ~~American high~~ schools would make for a better ~~country~~ world. 
Symbolic Logic is introductory philosophy.I agree with u, but I think systems should start with a modern day Trivinium.
But we're talking about what parts of philosophy would be the most useful for creating a better society. Logical thinking and skeptical, critical thinking are definitely useful starters. Maybe ethics next. But a lot of stuff is debatable.
and most philosophy classes suck unless you have a super motivated teacher. barely more interesting topics than in religion, the class you trade it in for. logic should be taught to everyone, most of philosophy should be optional. 
I agree, the basic concepts would be good to learn relatively early. I wonder, has there been any research into the best age for teaching logic/critical thinking as a course? Or into how it affects students over the long term?
Can confirm. School teaches finance don't know any other high schools that do.  
Of course they don't, but teaching philosophy wouldn't create a society that does that IMO. 
The allegory of the cave; aka the matrix for millennials. 
It depends on the teacher/prof.  However, memorizing logical fallacies/thinking critically about a situation on one's own would do kids a lot of good just by themselves. 
Even in university.  The "Philosophy 101" I took course is mostly just an intro to formal logic and language, followed by a survey of the big names.  It was as dense as it was boring, and most of the tests were "diagram these 20 sentences," "work through 10 simple logic proofs," followed by "match the Philosopher to the one-sentence summary of their philosophy."    
Some questions are very strongly discouraged though, and so are certain answers. 
> TriviniumWhat's that?
IIRC some cognitive abilities aren't developed enough at that age for them to understand many philosophical concepts due to abstract thinking limitations.Elementary seems way too early to me. 
>Sure, it's brought it to the masses and it's good that these different schools of thought are being taught, but it allows no room for creativity and coming to conclusions about topics on one's own terms.  Isn't that what philosophy is about?I don't think that there is a plausible alternative. If we stop teaching classical philosophers, chances are that they will just rediscover things like Descartes' cogito and think that they have made a new breakthrough.
(In the USA) The Matrix came out in 1999.. as a rated R movie.. meaning to see it without an adult (21+) you had to be born in 1982 (17+) to see it. Millennials are regarded as the generation born between 1980-2000.. which means only those millennials born from 1980-1982 would have seen it in theaters, unless accompanied by an adult.Good thing its such a great movie that nearly every Millennial born later, such as myself (94, 22 soon) understands the reference.Would you mind summarizing the cave allegory or perhaps provide me a source to read it?
I think it's more so the discussions of philosophy should be made in matters relevant to our society. I'm currently taking an ethics course, but it's specifically on health care ethics. My Professor has been discussing the philosophical history of topics such as Euthanasia, Abortion, Consent, etc. Just learning about Deontology by itself would probably not resonate with high-schoolers all too much, but learning about what Kant would think about issue x based on his theories would make more sense.
This. All the time I see people committing logical fallacies, and mostly arguing to "win". I've been saying forever that history needs to be replaced with philosophy, or have the two classes molded into one, where it's less of "memorize these dates" and more of "this was our mistake, learn from it". 
The same is true of any system of belief about anything. Anything that becomes the default "orthodoxy" within a community is going have people pushing back against alternative proposals. The universal triumph of atheism wouldn't do anything to change that.
Grammar, Logic and Rhetoric.First you have to learn tools to parse what people say. Then you learn the tools to find out if what they say makes sense. Then you must be able to express your ideas in a clear and persuasive way.
Some men are in a cave all their life, chained so that all they ever see are shadow puppets on the wall infront of them. Suddenly one of them is released and when he stumbles out of the cave, discovers that the world is not just shadow puppets. He goes back to try and convince the others that their world isn't the real world, but they won't listen because all they have experienced is the puppet show.
(In the USA) Google came out in 1998.. as an unknown web search index.. meaning to see it you had to have a computer to use it.Millennials are regarded as the generation born between 1980-2000.. which means only those millennials born from 1980-1982 would have seen it on the internet before 1998, unless accompanied by an adult.Good thing its such a great service that nearly every Millennial born later, such as myself (94, 22 soon) understands how to use it.Would you mind linking me to Google?
I still don't get how music made it into the quadrivium which is regarded as the higher division
Which I find a bit humorous considering some of my greatest difficulty finding mutual terms has been with mates of mine who are philosophy teachers. We had to remind ourselves time and again that a disagreement doesn't necessarily mean we disagree on the actual content, but that our vocabulary lends itself towards different meanings. Me from the sciences, and my mates from the humanities. It's amazing how accurate the principles behind the Trivium really are. 
I think it's also important that Plato's ideal society was a society ruled by a "Philosopher king," a kind of enlightened monarch who was not only had awareness of philosophy, ethics, etc, but also the power to see that they were implemented within society. I think the Allegory of the Cave was his attempt at justifying such a society. Since those stuck in the cave will always have difficulty seeing beyond their perceptions, its the responsibility of those who are able to break away to lead the others.
Perhaps because music utilizes and integrates each aspect of the Trivium? I particularly think of the music of the Catholic Church, where much of it was structured in formulaic ways. 
That's why my blood boils when someone says "Meh, it's just semantics". SEMANTICS IS PRETTY FUCKING RELEVANT, BITCH.Sorry, I got carried away.
but if you lead the others they strike you down and murder you.
No, I agree. I have wasted too much breath arguing with people about something, only for us to realize at the end that we actually agreed all along and were using different meanings for our words. There is no perfect communication, but bloody hell I need to get better at my own.
It's only second to my reaction to the use of "philosophy" as synonym for "inane bullshit" as it's usual in my country.
Super intelligence? Even if AI only equalled human intelligence, that would rock our world. You'd basically have a new race of people that can use electricity instead of food, don't get old or sick, can do a wider range of work, physically overpower us, build copies of themselves faster than we can reproduce, etc. Even if AI never got any further, we'd be hopelessly displaced.
You can tell a lot of the speakers disagree with each other because they all look a little uncomfortable. Except Elon, he's the only one that seem like he's at home. Early on when he would publicly speak he always seemed nervous, I wonder if now he's just used to public speaking or if he takes Xanax    
The inherent nature of a technological singularity is so profoundly unpredictable it is almost pointless to hypothesise it's outcome.Consideration must be placed on the possibility of the singularity as having already occured, and our experience on this planet is a direct result of this 
What exactly is "artificial general intelligence" supposed to be? A machine that has similar or greater intelligence than us?
I don't know about this to be honest. Does this actually qualify as philosophy? Some of the panelists are definitely not philosophers, and pretty much everything said is speculation/not related to philosophy. 
My question is as we approach human levels of AI at what point does it become unethical to terminate a consciousness that we have created?And as AI comes to understand or become self conscious, at what point does it rebel at the idea of termination?Because as we do with current software and technology it becomes outdated and needs to be upgraded, even things that were once considered cutting edge.. When will it become a moral dilemma to discard our creations?
Ya this is the shit, I wish Elon and ray kurzwell would have talked incessantly, I liked everyone else equally as well, but I really respect those two and their ability to be everywhere mentally and constantly challenge your thought processes. That is what true self-mastery is made of, and it's what great leadership is made of for the same reasons.
We are already there mate... We have memes
I understand what he is trying to say regarding things in the future so advanced wrote can't think of them now.  But I think humor and music did exist in caveman times. I'm sure they found things funny and made noises they like. That's music and that's comedy, on an extremely basic level. 
Do we know how smart people were 10 000 years ago?   
The thing about the AI is that there probably will not be an AI with human-level intelligence. I think there's a general consensus, that once it reaches human level, it will very quickly (in the matter of hours to months) become super-human.
You do realize what it means if AI is equaled to just 1% of human intelligence (not in calculating power, but in intelligence) right? Long before they manage to outnumber us, they will solve cancer, they will solve famine, and poverty in the entire world, by doing research 24/7/365 scaled across thousands of computers. Before they even have the need to replicate. You think AI as a physical entity, while in reality it is an algorithm. It is not a person it is just a problem solver that solves whatever crap you give it to solve.
One of the stupidest arguments by people with "AIphobia" I hear is "Well machines can't replace humans, who will build the machines then?"Once you make a human-like machine, it has the capacity to repair, improve and reproduce itself.It doesn't need anyone to really take care of it. It doesn't need anyone but itself.
You're assuming we understand it. AI will get to a point where it will understand itself and we can't, that's the point of super intelligent AI.The question is, what is the super intelligent thing to do with the universe, and especially humans? Is it to ruthlessly eliminate waste to improve efficiency, which would lead an AI to exterminate Humans (and other "lesser" intelligence)? Or is it that seeing different view points is mutually beneficial, even for Super intelligent beings? At what point is our intelligence essentially worthless, and incapable of adding value to the universe?
Elon seems like he's excited to be there. Kurzweil, by comparison, looks bored. Also, i dont know if anyone else noticed it but, from his body language, it looks as though Kurzweil disagrees with a lot of the other panelists.
Sam Harris is a master speaker and logician. Watching him speak is really something. I've personally always found Elon to be a horrific speaker, though I usually agree with his message and intent.
In my opinion, yes. What's a qualification for a philisopher? I you studied philosophy (which is basically just history-of-philosophy)? Philosophical expressions should be judged purely by themselves, I think.
I'm not sure what a computer science background matters. People who build machines are not the people who consider the ethics dealing with machines.
who said it then
I've always wanted to be a cat!
Well, 10,000 years ago was about 2000 years after the rise of agriculture and with it the advent of civilization. So, just as smart as we are. They'd be thrown for a loop because our world would look like magic to them, but if you could get past that initial shock and the language barrier, they'd figure it out. Shows how much these transhumanists know.. but I guess you're bound to ignore the importance of history (especially prehistory) when you only look forward to the demise of humanity through technology.
The thought of that is terrifying if not handled correctly.
If you look at his predictions Kurzweil also predicts that by that point we will have merged with the superintelligences. So unless you choose to remain biologically human you have nothing to fear.
We have super-human intelligent humans already.What consensus are you referring to?
Give birth to AI, treat it like your kid, give it the best values you have and the best leg up you can muster. Love it unconditionally and watch it grow into the best possible thing it can ever be....
Regressed in imagination... really...How is it profound to say that if we were more technologically advanced in the past, we would be more technologically advanced right now...?
That's nothing, I'm pretty sure I'm a butterfly.
But how can it be handled? A lower intelligence can never control a higher intelligence. We're growing chicken and massacring them by the millions, what measures have chickens taken? How are they controlling the situation?
Terrifying for our existence, unless they want to keep us as pets. But I think it is the natural and bound thing to happen like evolution. I don't really see any problem with a factually superior race replacing us. Especially since they are created as a result of millions of years of human history, they are the product of our evolution.It is like our ancestors. They are not us, we are not them, but we are their products and in process, destroyed their existence.So a super-human AI isn't like an invasive force that annihilate us but a passing of the torch.
That at some point (unless something bad will happen to humanity), we'll achieve a system with super-human general intelligence, that will not include a biological human as its part.
>we don't have a complete theory nor the resources to do this for the human body nor cancer in a general senseYes, but given the resources required to create this AGI, those are easily solved problems. You have to remember the discussion cannot be around current computing capacity, but rather around the capacity that will exist at the time AGI is constructed.
I doubt it will care to be honest.
Have you met a teenager?
"MORE BRAINS! JUST ADD MORE BRAINS" is this kind of how multicore humans would work?
as a systems programmer, I loved your metaphor =)
I wasn't trying to be profound, just offering up an explanation as to why we only got HDTV in 2006, yet we had Concorde in 1976 (because we were developing supersonic flight for world war 2)And yes regressed in public imagination. The people of the 50's, 60's, 70's, they dared to dream of these big projects. The dreamed to go to the Moon, and for civil rights and for nuclear energy. We don't do big movements anymore, and if we do, they are regressive (Make America Great 'Again')
Chickens didn't build humanity with the sole purpose of helping chicken-kind, so we don't have problems hurting chicken-kind.  What we need to be concerned about is someone building a higher intelligence with the sole purpose of, say, maximizing stock prices and then it consumes the world for resources to compute the largest real number possible to assign as the stock price.We can handle higher intelligence by making their initial conditions such that they will never betray us, even as they reach levels of insight greater than we can even comprehend.
Well that depends on whether they have facilities to utilize that intelligence. Sorry for the crude analogy but Steven Hawking is *extremely* intelligent but he by himself is capable of very little - even so far that he could not feed himself.If super AI is developed as code in some isolated, digital system where it can't impart its will into the physical world then it really can't do anything outside of what the 'lower intelligence' controllers let it.
Ethics. If we are able to pass some importance on what is truly important we would have a fair god.
Oh you absolutely can.AI at the end of the day is nothing more than a piece of software, you can constrain it.If we created the smartest brain that is 10000x over human level intelligence (wtv that is ) and put it in a jar. It would still be a brain in a jar, there's only so much it can do with all that thinking. 
AI would have the raw intelligence of a human **without** natural emotion. AI would not fear for itself, feel jealousy or the desire to conquer. This doomsday scenario is fortunately impossible unless we were dealing with a natural species having an intrinsic need to evolve. 
Read Nick Bostrom's SuperIntelligence. The book has already been written.
> given the resources required to create this AGI, those are easily solved problems.No! Or at least, not necessarily.AGI and cancer research are entirely different problems; neither of which is necessarily limited *only* by computational capacity.
why? psychologically it would be very similar to a parent-child relationship.
Perhaps we don't need to implant more brains but use our brains more efficiently.
> It's more reasonable to worry that governments and corporations that control AI resources may be able to concentrate a lot of more power.This is a very important part. It's not the AI itself that would necessarily be dangerous. Mostly because even if it did pass human intelligence, it doesn't mean it would be malevolent, or even self-preservative against people who would want to shut it down. An AI isn't a product of evolution, there's no reason for it to have a will to survive (let alone breed/evolve further).The dangerous part is what people use it for.
Why couldn't they just change their initial conditions?
Discovering AI doesn't mean we will discover a way to turn a living brain into digital.
The entire point of an AI like this would be self-learning. That said, after achieving a level of above human intelligence, an AI initially programmed to "get smarter" might just deem the limitations we place on it to be be restrictive of it's own (programmed) goal. There is absolutely no need for Darwinian emotion or consciousness. Simply by following it's programming of self-learning it would logically "want" to remove itself from potential human meddling.
So why does the AI in a video game try to beat you, then?  
That is caused by your parents helping your needs and them being more resourceful than you. It is, in some sense, owing to your parents. A human has nothing a robot can owe them for.
Maybe, but I really like the visualization of an extra cranium or two kinda just attached to a normal head.
> Computers have no reason to liveI like the example of an AI programmed to manufacture paperclips as efficiently as possible. If the AI is unleashed and improves itself, it could turn the entire world into a paperclip factory, stopping at nothing. It has no reason to have sympathy or care for humans.
But we may someday figure out how to digitally replicate a living brain 
All levels of programming have caveats. Any program we create with that amount of complexity would have humanity's best interests embedded in it.
Because it was programmed that way... It's barely comparable. 
What if we could just connect to one wirelessly? 
If it's AI and given enough data points for physical properties, it could just do the testing in a simulated environmentI get what you mean though. "Wait but Why?" has a good article on super intelligence
There is a difference between an algorithm that can produce music and an algorithm that can produce music exactly like Mozart.
Because of course there's no chance someone would program an AI to try and win at, say, global politics, war, or the stock market and that that could have unintended consequences.  Right. . . .    
Like a cranium that's just kinda floating near by? Bluetooth? 
I'm saying that AI entities will be designed to optimize for certain goal states, like *f(x) = minimum(anxiety, fear, doubt, pain, ...)*; this is what I meant when I said a kind of self-interest.What I'm talking about here may not include any form of self-preservation. But it will include some set of criteria by which to evaluate and select paths of action.That hollywood-esque scenario is not what I'm saying here. 
Good for her I say. Prisons should be about teaching people how to go back into society and contribute to it, and maybe Ethics classes are good for people in finding moral paths that will help them succeed to a maximum in society.
On pretty much any other sub-reddit, this thread would've been mobbed with comments about liberal bleeding hearts. It's good to have at least one place were things can be discussed in depth and rationally.
He should probably "warm up" with some medium security prisoners and gain some experience before trying to school maximum security prisoners. I dont think a somewhat sheltered professor can just jump into that enviroment and get things done.Or maybe go to a supermax and have a go at some real psychos one on one
So higher education is available for free to inmates?  I'm all ethics classes to be offered for free to inmates right after anyone who hasn't broken any laws gets higher education for free.
Ethics? Come on. Does the state follow any ethics? Is the law ethical? Isn't it hypocritical for the state to preach ethics? 
Ethics classes don't teach you what is moral or not, that would be way too subjective.  They open your eyes by saying "sure you could get rich by breaking the law, but you can also go to prison. Everything has consequences.
How anyone could oppose teaching violent criminals ethics will forever be beyond me.
>no one benefits from thisWell, some people certainly benefit from it, like, the people who own private prisons.They benefit financially from the imprisonment of citizens.
Yeah, i mean, i would need empiric evidence to be sure, but I also think that prisons work more like a place for revenge and punishment and not like an educational institutions, prisons should be educational, that's the best for everyone I think
What about the guys at the top of corporate fraud? Or college grads that decide to break the law anyway? Or mass murderers and rapists? People who commit identity theft? Arsonists? Pedophiles? It's not just drug dealers who go to prison... there are many people in prison I don't want to share the street with
That's it I'm forming a private prison on a group of islands that's whole purpose is to reinvent themselves. Just kidding I don't want to do that much work.
Okay, I have an ethical question about this. Should actions have consequences? And if they should, should not bad actions have bad consequences? I agree that we should rehabilitate these people, but should we not also punish these actions. If an action does not have a punishment large enough to prevent said action then what prevents that action.
Yeah, but that wouldn't as profitable to the powers that be. 
Teach a Baltimore heroin dealer "farm to table".  OK.
Is it wrong to be hypocritical? Better to be right here and wrong there than to insist on being consistently wrong everywhere, because you can bet the state won't choose to be right everywhere.
There is a comment from earlier featuring a sarcastic rant about how criminals aren't human. Sadly, many people hold beliefs not too far from that.
I'm a working poor minority Detroiter. I have nothing against ethics. The feelings I have about this thread though is that I feel it's incredibly condensendingly racist. There's a lot of the "product of environment" and " what other choice did they have". That really upsets me. These reformed criminals will be living next to me, not you. All while your writing them excuses to terrorize us, the decent, hard working people. I'm cool with whatever plan you guys come up with as long as these poor souls who had no choice get to live in your neighborhoods.
There was a documentary I saw which explained how private telecom companies earn a fortune by installing their payphones which charge 'a lot' more than a dollar for a phone call. Even accessing the internet for a skype call is charged highly.
And white-supremacists. Imprison people for a minor crime today and fuck up generations to come.
Let's not forget how much some of our loving and caring politicians benefit from the imprisonment of their constituents, either. 
Does such a thing as private prisons exist in your country? I'm sorry, but that sounds really fucked up to me. In my country, prisons are completely state owned, because imprisoning and watching over imprisoned people is absolutely a state power that no private person should have or be able to profit from, at least imo.
There are some people who benefit from a certain class of violent criminal being locked up, i.e., the general public. 
And, y'know, the people not being raped and killed for those who are in prison for a reason
I'm not seeing the disagreement between you and the person you're replying to, at least not in spirit. You both hold that people ought to be rehabilitated (the word of choice), no?
Biased because i live in canada but the prison near my house is nothing like that
Yeah, well, I'd like to see you try to excel educationally in most prisons. Need a calculator for math? Too bad. Type your papers on expensive ass typewriters. Have your books rejected. Have education department rebuff attempts to take proctored exams. It is an uphill fucking battle to become educated despite it being the best predictor in decreasing future recidivism. Rehabilitation is not a priority. 
The problem with rehabilitation is they're is no incentive to do it. If an inmate works hard, gets better, and legitimately deals with his issues and is ready to reenter society 5 years into his 10 year sentence... He's still got 5 more years for the prison environment to beat him back down. And believe me, there is an emotional and mental cost to trying to rehabilitate yourself in prison. It's much easier to just get drunk and High and let time go by
Do you think every prison is like that? 
Well, it doesn't help that most Americans do not believe in mental illness, whatsoever. My very close friend has the same mental illness that I have (borderline personality disorder) and it took her nearly being taken away from her family for her father to even acknowledge that anything was wrong with her and that she wasn't acting out for attention.
> Crime should be treated as a symptom of mental disease.There's plenty of crime that is done by rational people only to further themselves though. It's not like every drug dealer, inside trader or embezzler do it because they're mentally ill, they do it because they want money.
It's a symptom of economic inequality. When people are working 50% of their lives away to fall short of or barely make rent/bills/food, what other choice is there than to steal or deal drugs (or alternatively, with a life so miserable, no wonder people turn to drug use).
Please don't tell me you think that someone who commits absolutely any crime has a mental disease.
> Crime should be treated as a symptom of mental disease.Well, some of this is just an artifact of the act being illegal, and is not necessarily a moral problem.   Selling marijuana is illegal, but to me no more immoral than selling beer.  At one point in time selling liquor was illegal in the US, then it wasn't.   Did bartenders flip from being moral to amoral back to moral, just because the legal status of alcohol kept changing?    
How would a drug dealer on the streets of Baltimore affect the safety of some average Joe living in the other part of town?
While I understand the sentiment, the ideal would be that the people who went through the prison (rehabilitation) system *are no longer* the things you're mentioning here. You'd be sharing the street with *former* X/Y/Zs. Suppose this rehabilitation was a certainty (it's not), would you still object?
So how about good actions, should they have good consequences? Because it seems to me that the law (which is flawed, to begin with) only punishes bad acts. Shouldn't a good person live a life free from worry, disease, hunger, etc? Which is not happening right now.
Is this from a belief that free will exists? Because the evidence pretty heavily points to the opposite, the idea that people choose to commit crimes is out of step with what we know about the brain.Unless you hold to an idea of an independent soul or some other supernatural explanation the mathematics of morality boil down to complex but theoretically predictable chemical equations, without free will all you are doing is punishing someone for their combination of genetic makeup and life experiences.
I think our goal should be to reduce crime, violence, suffering, pragmatically. Consequences should be built around those goals, not around making victims or society feel good about punishing out of revenge.
I think that the people being in prison and away from their loved ones is punishment enough. Not to mention the terrible living conditions in some prisons.
Laugh as you may, but just take a look at the Norwegian prison system and the American, then look at the recidivism rates of each; it's stunning.
That'd be an interesting discussion to have. I've toyed with the idea that we don't owe as much moral duty towards psychopaths since their lack of empathy makes them incapable of acting properly as moral agents. Basically, empathy being a necessary basis for certain qualities, behaviours that we recognise as being human.
I live in the biggest city in my state, which is extremely culturally and socioeconomically diverse; I see what you're saying, but no one is arguing for letting anyone loose without adequate evidence that they'll behave. 
Former CO of ~2 years here. I wouldn't exactly say benefit. The job had a terrible effect on my personality, relationships with others, etc. I feel like a lot of the CO's don't really give it a lot of thought. It's a job, these people were convicted of breaking the law, it's our job to keep them here. I could be wrong but I don't think AFCSME has the political clout to perpetuate the war on drugs for the sake of CO employment. Private prison owners, maybe so.
How do white-supremacists benefit from poor whites getting locked up for minor crimes?
>  and violent offenders that need serious supervision for public safety
The US has more people in prison than any other country in the world.That's not because USians are more dangerous.It's because the country has an oppressive penal system.
I don't think anyone is disputing that it is important to keep criminals from harming the general public.  However, if you release a criminal from prison that has not been taught a better way, chances are that they will continue to harm society even after their first prison sentence is complete.I think it is also worth pointing out that keeping a reformed person in prison robs society of that person's potential contributions.  We should not only try to reform people, but we should try to do so efficiently.
Oops you're correct. I kinda saw it as OP calling for a replacement of the prison system for something else entirely, and I was advocating a change in how prisons work. You're absolutely correct there isn't any disagreement in the spirit of the argument. I'm just sleepily from school work and misread it. 
I never said that it was fantastic. I'm just saying it's available so people should stop acting as if there's no hope. Second off people need to understand making our society better through prisons is not anyone's goal. I'd wager to say 90% of Americans want our public school systems brought up by a degree or two before worrying about prison education. Education is there for the prisoners it's just no Harvard.
You can't start going through rehabilitation such as schooling until you're closer to your probation period
Is this from a belief that free will exists? Because the evidence pretty heavily points to the opposite, the idea that people choose to commit crimes is out of step with what we know about the brain. Unless you hold to an idea of an independent soul or some other supernatural explanation the mathematics of morality boil down to complex but theoretically predictable chemical equations, without free will all you are doing is punishing someone for their combination of genetic makeup and life experiences. 
If they are knowingly committing a crime, they are mentally ill. They don't have to be psychotic to be mentally ill. The fact that society passed a law and they are unwilling to live by that means they've got a screw loose upstairs. 
>Her family was mad he isn't dead or rotting away in prison. Well yeah(!), he killed their kid, got to moved on with his life, re-married and had kids of his own. Are you expecting the parents to be happy for his rehabilitation, that they have moved on in life? Let someone marry then kill your kid and see if you get over it in 10-15 years.   
While I sympathize, committing a crime is committing a crime. If you do so, I'd argue you need help. 
No. Obviously there are degrees and certainly victimless crimes wouldn't count. However, if you are harming others, you have a mental disorder. 
It's not a question of morality. The social contract includes everyone following the rules that we call laws. You can't be a member of society if you can't be trusted to do that. That inability is something I'd consider a mental disorder since behaving that way is incompatible with functioning in society. 
My response was to the poster who said they should not go to prison. I don't think soft rehabilitation would change most people's minds, I would not want to share the street with most kinds of criminals who underwent soft rehabilitation, no. It's not that I don't feel safe, I just don't want these people walking free. I don't think it is even a deterrant to non-violent crimes like identity theft.
The utilitarian approach also has the unfortunate consequence that it doesn't really matter if someone actually commited a crime or not. If rehabilitation would reduce the likelihood of them commiting a crime enough to justify its cost why not submit an innocent to the corrections system?
Norway is a largely homogeneous society.  The scale and racial demographics just simply do not compare to the USA.
Since the law and morality both rely on reasonability more so than empathy I wonder how productive it'd be...
Leaving aside the reality that the war on drugs and prison privatization disproportionately victimize people of color, the answer is: they don't. Which doesn't stop white supremacists from advocating such policies anyway, and further, goes to show how self-defeating white supremacy, and strict law and order based policies are in the long term. 
Do you honestly think that any non-violent criminal such as thieves is not dangerous and should be living among us?
But then, why aren't laws coherent across country? Or even across the world? Yes, some are, like murder and theft, and others are not, like prostitution, alcohol consumption, selling and using so called "illegal drugs", which depend according to locations, speed limits, family relations, sex acts, etc.
The point of that story is that Americans tend to have a much more retributive perspective about crime, as compared to citizens of countries where rehabilitation is a priority.
It's not only in the US, the whole modern world is still based on punishment as a form of institutionalized revenge. I think Socrates already wrote about benefits of rehabilitation against punishment, but while it's understandable that victims demand revenge, it's a bit said that the public hasn't shifted yet in this and behave like a mad mob when it comes even to the smallest of crime (petty thieving and such). 
You are correct, and the "vengeance" is also known as revenge in Criminal Justice. It seems to be affiliated with religion and dates back to the lex talionis, or the law of retaliation. In 3100 bc the Sumerian law of Mesopotamia incorporated lex talionis in the "Code of Ur-Nammu" and was mainly revenge/retaliation, and eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. 
Let's say I come murder your mother brutally.  Stab her 16 times in the chest or some shit like that.Do you really think you'd be okay with me walking out of prison in 15 years, a free man, completely "rehabilitated" from a crime I chose to commit?
Yeah, but I don't see how psychiatric help is appropriate for someone who's just trying to make ends meet. Hell if argue that it's an attempt to placate then rather than actually help them
You're mentally challenged if you believe that.
Blindly following the rules with complete disregard to their ethical value is a mental disorder in and of itself.
> If rehabilitation would reduce the likelihood of them commiting a crime enough to justify its cost why not submit an innocent to the corrections systemBecause the net bad consequences outweigh the net good ones? You're taking someone living in society and throwing them into jail. That's a lot of net bad for that person (e.g. unhappiness for them). 
This was a lovely correspondence. It's nice to see a former CO and former inmate speak as peers about a shared experience, albeit from drastically different perspectives. It gives me some small sliver of hope :)The wolf shall dwell with the lamb and such 
I don't buy the race rhetoric.  The war on drugs and prison privatization disproportionately *punishes* (I use punish, because criminals aren't victims of punishments due to their crimes.) people in poverty.
you ask that question like they are not human, not capable of change or remorse. Due to the amount of rhetoric involved with people who hold that position I find it hard to imagine I will be able to convince you otherwise but if you are willing to listen... let me know
I believe that rehabilitation where possible is significantly better for society at large than punishment for punishment's sake. The threat of prison clearly doesn't work as an effective deterrent, with so many people winding up incarcerated, and the reoffending rate suggests that it's not making them better people either.
This is a pretty shitty example of American retributive perspective, so parents from other countries wouldn't be as mad or would be ok with 10yrs of jail time as punishment for the murder of their kid??
I firmly believe that anyone who commits intentional, pre-meditated murder should be killed themselves.  I don't think society should pay for them to live in prison, and I don't think they should have a chance to live the rest of their life as a free person.The only other alternative I would find fitting would be back-breaking hard labor for life.
Correct. Americans view prison is retribution or revenge. Since free will is almost certainly an illusion, revenge makes little sense. 
Man, you're not even trying to hide your blatant appeal to emotion. I would not *feel* okay with someone being released 15 years after stabbing my mother, but it would still be best for them to be released, assuming they were successfully rehabilitated. Man is not a slave to his emotions, or at least he doesn't have to be.
You're suggesting someone who has committed acts of violence doesn't need treatment? Given many years in prison to reflect on their behavior they will realize the error of their ways?
Or the person would realize they can keep being thieves and get rewarded for it. That's how most CEOs operate and why short term gains > long term plans. 
Why would the bad for an innocent person be any more than it would be for a person who has actually commited a crime?
Have you seen the Stanford Prison Experiment? It goes into details about how prisons encourage the type of behavior seen on both sides of the bars
which is which 
Wait I thought "right to work" states were where you had a *right* to work, and that's why unions could protect your job, and that there were laws that dictated you couldn't just be fired for no reason. And that "at will" states were the opposite, where either party could end the relationship "at will" for any or no reason. I'm confused.
Whites don't rule the world.  People are racist against whites as well.
>The threat of prison clearly doesn't work as an effective deterrent.So you are saying that if we made for example stealing completely legal then the thievery rates wouldn't remain the same? I think that that's absolutely false and incarceration will always be a significant deterrent and therefore beneficial for our society.
Obviously not in the country where the crime occurred
Even if it costs millions more to (not) kill them vs let them do life? Cause the hardest republicans in my state saw the cost and are now are against the death penalty. 
Sure, another example of that retributive perspective. I don't quite understand how this is relevant to the comment above, though.
The question here is both why and are you sure.On the "are you sure" front executing innocent people is a terrifying and irreparable act and almost unavoidable that it will occur.On the why front, to whom is the benefit? Society does not benefit from the expensive process of appeals and checks and balances that come with execution (that are higher than life imprisonment). Society might well benefit from a  rehabilitated and even keeled person being released back into it. 
No, because there can be many different circumstances and you're just making a blanket statement about all acts of violence as if they're all the same. That's very close minded.
I think you're confused. it'd very simple. net bad consequences outweigh net good ones for throwing innocent ppl into jail. the bad consequences are all the suffering that goes with throwing everyday ppl into jail, the net good is zero because they were not probably going to commit a crime in future 
Right to work and at will mean the exact same thing. You can be fired or quit for no reason except for certain protected reasons (gender, race, etc.)
That's not true in places where white supremacy exists.
That's the governments laws not a reflection of the parents which is what my question was about. Is 10-15yrs enough jail time in any parents mind (not societies) for the murder of their child? 
Justice is retribution.
Yes, I'm sure.Asking why to this question is like asking why we have a judicial system at all.  This is just a severer degree of punishment.
They are not all the same of course but can you think of an act of violence that would send you to prison and yet would be considered a reasonable thing to do? Of course not. 
People think this question is a lot more complicated than it actually is. 
Im surprised no one on this thread has made the point that metaphysical questions fall outside the reach of physical sciences and mathematics. Such question will never be "scientifically" explained because it cant be scientifically explained. 
I don't think it will ever be solved. The corollary is "what is death?". There is no chemical change in composition when people die, making it difficult to measure the absence or presence of life. 
People like whoever this guy, just got to realize we aren't gods. We can never truly know something. We can claim to think we know something however based on educated observation and inferences, and even some guesses.
If feel like we generally have a hard time accepting gradual transitions when it comes to ontological questions. It's much easier to stick to a worldview where all things are neatly categorized into little boxes whose name tags lets you associate and assume a bunch of stuff about said thing. While in reality such distinctions are not always something we can allow us to take comfort in.
Is that what he meant by the question?  Did he mean strictly biologically? 
>In the modern day we are even looking around on Mars for signs of life and there are experts who work to predict what it may be likeI had a professor 20 years ago who 20 years earlier was preeeeety sure she saw the fingerprints of life on Mars (she *did* work for NASA at the time) from the experiment of hers they sent there to look for it. We have a lot of ideas of what life is and could be, we understand a lot of the physics of it - but we don't know the HOW of it just yet. How does that set of reactions add up to a self-sustaining reproducing set of reactions? We dunno. 
I actually love the book Schrodinger wrote called "What is Life" where he actually foresaw the coming of DNA and only physically such a thing could come into existence calling it a process of negentropy, this title is clearly written by someone who never the read the book or just misunderstood some summary of the ideas because Schrodinger never doubted science's ability to solve this conundrum the way he/she suggests. 
Why is this controversial? It would require absolutely no cognition of history and a disconcerting amount of arrogance to assert that science is static.
Wouldn't the organism have to be undetectable by an electron microscope? Wouldn't it have to be smaller than the molecular level?
This feels rather normative than descriptive. Do we have to require point 2? Are self-replicating RNA-molecules less alive than simple bacteria? How so? Also, I would argue that point 5 is not quite well-defined. Many forces of life are self-destructive on some time-scale. You would have to define "relative stability". 
>Life is nothing so magical or grand as it is simply a definition for a class of relatively complex matter that allows that discrete system of matter to maintain relative homeostasis (by using resources within its environment to do so) for the purpose of continued propagation.That's fire, dude.
So what you're saying is that life is basically a thermodynamic system that possess some intelligence in order to maintain equilibrium? Where in this case equilibrium is staying alive. This is very interesting.       
Yet bacteria are considered "alive" while viruses aren't, while both meet these six criteria? Thus the problem.
I'm a bit of a layman here but wouldn't point 6 alone suffice? I cannot think of anything I'd identify as alive that doesn't seek some form of reproduction or propagation.
Well, let's hear your hypothesis. 
We are in the process of building gods. The first truly AGI (artificial general intelligence) will be smarter than us by a billionfold. 
In a more scientific approach, I always like to see the world and life in the many sizes it comes in. From viruses, to bacteria that make the foundation for more advanced beings like dogs and humans. And don't forget there technically is 6 kingdoms of life; all being completely different approaches of life we have on Earth.
No. Actual living things are very difficult to explain. We understand matter...We don't understand how matter can self-organize, move around, and *do* shit. In physics, objects at rest stay at rest...They don't get bored with resting, then go get a beer.Saying, "Now we know about DNA!" misses the entire point.
Yeah the real barrier to understanding consciousness seems to be letting go of certain preconceptions about free will. People don't like the idea of being biological machines, even if those machines are beautiful and complex. 
What if it was transparent to electrons?Then it wouldn't have to be smaller than the molecular/atomic level.The core of the idea was much more fundamental than what a lot of people are responding with here.Perhaps the thing would require an incredibly high energy photon to "see".Or perhaps the thing/organism would require a whole new form of detection that we cannot conceive of right now.I guess I was asking "can things exist beyond science as we know it" and his answer was "absolutely".
Yep, fire and life are similar. One of the problems in defining life is that we want some nice clean line that separates life from non-life (and one separating intelligent life from non). But that line does not exist.  This lack of a line harms the argument in the article. Since life and non-life are not so different there is no philosophical problem here.
That's a pretty neat simulation of life.But... the systems that are been simulated are not made out of matter directly (they're bits of information and code).Or perhaps you'd describe them as simulated life dependent on computing information substrates.I don't think the boundaries that define these terms are absolute in any sense - merely ones that we seek to convince others of the reasonableness and usefulness of (and in doing so, propagate the definition of the term).
DNA, RNA, Viruses, computer code, complex self replicating molecules, memes, etc.I mean... replication and propagation are essential components of keeping your lineage or information around... but it's not the sole determinant in what we'd consider to be life.
Imperfect self replication in a ressource-starved environment is the definition that I learned, and has the benefit of being quite elegant. 
Not at all. That link doesn't address the definition of life at all and in addition many of those categories are quite controversial. In fact there is a controversy over how to do that categorization at all. The fact that at some level there is a consensus doesn't make it any less arbitrary. 
But that doesn't mean we are gods.Also determines how is that thing intelligent? Technically our calculators are smarter than us than a billion fold.
>Could earth be considered an organism?Even if all the water came from  comets or other extraterrestrial origin, all life on Earth is made from the substance of Earth, and we've shown that there is common origin. Without the structure of Earth being what it is we wouldn't sustain the process we call life. I don't feel like it's a stretch to consider the earth an organism, just have to look at it from a broader perspective.
*specific instances* of behavior are difficult to explain. We understand pretty well the underlying principles that cause behavior in general. 
You think we can't explain boredom, or wanting a beer?
You sound like a freshman that took one psych course and zero physics, bio, or chem classes. You're completely wrong
How the fuck does this kind of comment get upvoted?! Jesus christ..
Like unicellular organisms that move towards the light even though they have no CNS guiding them - why on Earth are they doing it?
I don't actually believe in free will, at least as it is commonly formatted. But I have trouble believing physical determinism fully explains all of life's bizarre behavior.
We can't be biological machines with free will?You determinists are just as dogmatic as religious folk, you say that your claims are 100% truth when all of it is conjecture. 
> letting go of certain preconceptions about free will. We literally alter the Universe every single day, I dont know what you call that, but its certainly something. Being a biological machine doesnt change the reality that my actions every single second of every day are a deviation of the path set by the Big Bang. 
What about e.g. a frozen seed/spore/sperm? No homeostasis, not alive now (?), but definitely alive under the right conditions?
That implies life cannot be defined.
TIL: that dwarves in the Dwarf Fortess video game are alive.  These kind of "elegant" definitions always have the "plucked chicken" problem.
>"the underlying principles that cause behavior in general"There's quite a bit of epistemological and metaphysical presupposition packed into that, presupposition that persists through inattention.
Who's being dogmatic here? Can you point me to where said there was no free will? Left that open ended for a reason.
My rejection of free will does not come from determinism. I think that our consciousness is simply our internal mental model of our own internal mental processes. Just like we build a mental model of how others are thinking we do it for ourselves. In both cases these models are used a predictive mechanisms to guess at future behavior. Our consciousness has no free will because it is not the operator of the brain. It is rather just a product used to predict. If there is free will it is buried deeper.
They are not self-replicating. The game replicates them.
A picture is not the thing in the picture. There are no dwarves. There is a spreadsheet of data that the user and the game modify in varying ways and use to determine a visual presentation that the user interprets as being dwarves. 
I'm aware. You seem to be trying to imply that that makes it dubious, but what you said doesn't actually imply that. We can discuss what the assumptions are if you like.If you acknowledge that science can explain the cause of anything, then it can explain the general principles that cause behavior. 
Yeah just because you can create organic compounds under those conditions doesnt mean anything. You still havent created life. We find the same molecules in the tails of comets and in the geysers of Saturns moon Enceladus. Doesnt mean life is there. 
That's like saying you aced the test because you managed to bring a pencil.
>Our consciousness has no free will because it is not the operator of the brain. It is rather just a product used to predict. If there is free will it is buried deeper.Is it not possible in your model that both consciousness and operator have free will? Consciousness to recommend certain paths of action and operator to prune those options to an outcome?An advisor can still have free will.
By that logic no one self replicates, the universe makes animals replicate.
That's a huge first principal to assume in any argument of this nature. And many good arguments have been made against the idea science can one day explain in perfect detail every type of phenomenon we encounter 
That's not exactly something you can acknowledge so simply...That's like me saying, If you believe everything I say, then I can answer any question you ask me.Considering that Science is a human invention, and the current implications of said science is that human logic is a byproduct of random evolution biased towards reproductive viability, then there is no reason to believe that human science will ever be able to explain everything. Of course, it's nice to hope.  
You said organization of matter without DNA. That's what this is. 
> Is it not possible in your model that both consciousness and operator have free will? The consciousness doesn't *do* anything. It is the passive monitor, the projection of the mental processes for the mental processes to examine. 
That's not true because the only driving factor for life self replication is within itself (DNA).  If we move it to another universe it will perform the same way.  The dwarfs in Dwarf Fortress are only graphical icons displayed and controlled entirely by one computer program.
Sounds like a viable answer for determinism. The universe's contents and natural laws orchestrate everything. 
How can it make predictions if it doesn't *do* anything?
"Answer" for determinism? Wouldn't this just be an argument for it? Seeing as, so far, all evidence points to the contrary. 
Yea. I meant answer as in an argument you could give in favor of it. Not answer as in the solution but answer as in a response in favor of the idea. I don't use words correctly, usually. But that is what I intend to say.=>Seeing as, so far, all evidence points to the contrary.Isn't the only problem with determinism the seemingly arbitrary volition of intelligent organisms?
Maybe I am incredibly dumb asking this, but I am incredibly dumb regardless so here we go: How do we know it was on february 15 if that calendar or any calendar did not exist back in those good old days?
I'm a dum dum. Why they do poison to him? 
Time to put down the phones and read*Apology*, *Symposium*, &*Phaedo*
Can anyone recommend a book on Socrates? I know that he wrote nothing himself and that most of his thoughts are transmitted through Plato and Zenophon (? or something).. Is there a good book that merges these two viewpoints and presents Socrates as a more 3-D person?
One of the things that has always fascinated me about his death beyond the Olympian-tribute he requested at his trial was the concept of his intentional demise in an era where dying for the self wasn't really a thing. The city-state/honor was more of an important concept than dying for a personal belief or ideal. 
Isn't there a theory that Socrates wasn't a real person and was just a stand-in/example/character created by Plato?
I believe Socrates was expected to *request* exile as an alternative punishment to death, but refused to offer an alternative.
Didn't the Athenian democracy end when Sparta(and Corinth...) won the Peloponnese war and the democracy was to be abolished and the terror of the 50(or 30)(in other words a ruling of many) was put in its place as a requirement for peace?
Refusing to recognize the Greek Gods and corrupting the youth.
Athens had lost its empire and half of its population in the Pelopenesian war and the Thirty Tyrants.  Among the bloodiest of the tyrants were Socrates' students.  One of his students was also Agathocles, who betrayed the city twice during the war.  Add to this that one of Socrates lines of questioning was almost certainly the "we don't run a ship by democracy" and you get a perfect scapegoat for the rising democracy.
I love that edition of Plato's apology - Big fat margins for notes and buttery smooth translations. good stuff.
I totally understand where you're coming from but consider this: When a post reaches the front page the majority of people who are coming to the thread aren't here for serious philosophy and aren't accustomed to the rules.  Because of this, Mods ought to relax the standards in these situations. 
The progress we've largely made in average age is more along the lines of keeping little kids from dying.  When you have 6 kids and lost 4 of them, it really brings down the average.  In this regard, we've made huge headway in the last century.  
the trial was a formality, the rich wanted him dead long before that trial. it was surprising he wasnt otherwise killed before it.
Yeah, but doesn't the Gregorian Calendar (and others before it) messed with dates a couple of times? 
Wow great explanation. It's amazing how much beauty can be drawn out of a painting when it is broken down. Such an eloquent way to imagine this scene in history. I feel like if I were to try and explain my reasoning for painting this it would end up being "and then, like, I just thought it would be cool if the scene was, like, coming out of the back of platos head, like a memory or something. Idk maybe not tho. It's whatevs"
that was what they charged him with, but what he really did was make a lot of rich and powerful people look stupid. He would ask them something like what is justice? they would answer and he would take their response and use a simple analogy to prove them wrong and make them look foolish. He did this to enough powerful people to where they finally killed him.
have you read the apology?He is unrepentant the whole time, and a real douchebag. He also asks for death over exile. Even given the context, he's not presented as sympathetic.It makes for a better story this way, but the guy is not a hero.
And also, if you read The Apology, Socrates shows no humility at all during the trial, arguing that he deserves to have free meals, and he basically dares the jurors to execute him.
Yeah, the "Corrupting the Youth" is a catch-all and handy to tack on any charge as it is never an issue to make the charge stick and easy to demonize someone with.
From his perspective (and mine), he is not guilty of one and possibly both of his charges.Just because he decline to use rhetoric to set himself free doesn't make him a bad guy.Socrates' actions, for better or worse, are in line with his beliefs and I think he should be respected for that.
I can't decide if he had a serious pair of stones, or if he just knew he wasn't going to walk away from the trial with his life, so he might as well be snarky til the bitter end.
And this is how we know, "Think of the children" has always been a tool for tyrants. 
It also may have something to do with the fact that some young men, who were known to have been students of Socrates (including one who was a family member of Plato), also became prime movers in anti-democratic (pro-Spartan) activities leading to the overthrow of the Athenian government. When the Thirty Tyrants took power, they murdered about 5% of the Athenian population just seven years prior to the trial. The charge of "Corrupting the Youth" was not just handy. It was dripping blood. 
To a degree, certainly. But we're a crisis away from people thinking like this at any time in my opinion. Imagine if our society had a major economic disaster that it couldn't recover from. How long would it take before society started hanging individuals for thinking differently than the majority? Not long. Hell, Katrina saw a society crumble in a matter of hours.  
He was also fascinated by death. He knew he couldn't beat the charges so he accepted his fate and was morbidly curious about what came after 
You know he was out to death by a democracy, right?
The tipping point was the involvement in the circle of thirty by Critias, who was an actual relative of Socrates.
That's a thoroughly flawed idea of what happens during disasters. In Katrina it was not all looting etc. But in fact the main characteristic with most natural disasters is *co-operation*, we do not react like sheep, as the other commenter said, but we react like human beings.Horrors happen in disasters, but watch any disaster and you will see more helping than harming. It isn't as simple as 'everything goes to shit>people stop being people and start being awful to each other', each disaster is in its own situation and you cannot make these sweeping ahistorical statements.
It seems that with his wit and knowledge, he could have made a logical argument as to why he was innocent and convince the court to dismiss the charges. But he believed in the system for what it's worth, so he accepted death.
sometimes mob rule can be worse than a dictator
You know Athenian democracy was flawed as fuck right ?
Trials (and the law as well) are not always about logic and reason. If they had evidence against him or people to testify against him, what could he do?
Well sure, in the sense that all governments are.  I'm not really sure how that's relevant, unless we've just decided "tyranny" is just a word for "bad governance".
I'm not sure if evidence could exist, but I'm sure people would testify against him. Would have been interesting to hear him battle it out with those who testified against him (if he cared).
I worked at a aquarium store for a number of years and we had a cuttlefish that would recognize and get excited to see certain staff members and would flash certain patterns when begging for food. It was like a underwater puppy that inks the tank instead of shitting the carpet.
Just finished the book. Highly recommended, and it's a quick read too!
Why should there be any necessary connection between being smart and being long-lived?There are plenty of dim-witted organisms (like tortoises) that live longer than us smart-asses.
I live in Hawaii and when I surf, the takos will swim up to me play. It freaked me out at first but now it's cool. I don't know what it is about me, but they like me. 
Yet the standards on what we can do to cephalopods is the same as for all other non-listed  invertebrates. 
If there is an ethical argument to be made for genetically modifying something to live longer I would like to hear the case for octopuses because it would be fascinating to see what they could do with more time. Of course people will say it could also spell our doom.
The guardian asks for donations rather than all ad revenue or subscription wall. I donated a $1 and downloaded their app. This was a great article!
It's a really interesting question, but only rhetorically. Life span is what it is; intelligence can't directly influence that. A more testable question is "how does something so short-lived become so smart?" But that's a science question not a philosophy question. I hold a Cambridge masters in philosophy but now find science more interesting. 
Jesus Christ mods, why you have to nuke the damn thread? 
Love these creatures. I can picture a larger specie like them eliminating humans. 
they are just biding their time until they become the next thing to crawl out of the sea and dominate Earth.won't be long now.
Hopefully right now they're congregating at the bottom of the ocean to emerge as the great Cthulhu and rule us all for one hundred thousand years. 
Mortality is designed to stop individuals which don't reproduce from competing for resources with those which do.Intelligence has next to nothing to do with it.Even in Humans you can have an IQ pushing 200 and you'll likely die younger if you don't have kids.
All roads lead to God.
I once saw a cuddlefish at an aquarium in chatanooga and he looked like the most pissed off animal I have ever seen. He had a very human look in his eye that said "I would fucking kill you if I could." As his skin flashed very intimidating colors at me.
I've kept Cichlids that would do this.  One Jack Dempsey would rush the tank wall if I approached, but hide under a rock of my then partner approached. 
Can you pet one?
main takeaways from the book?
If they're so smart why don't they just figure out how to live longer??
Some parrots are wicked smahrt and long-lived too.
You should watch Arrival.
I wish tacos came up to me. 
Is a Tako similar to a cuttlefish ?
I hope they discover this in my life time
I think it's pretty likely we would have discovered at least the remains of anything super huge living down there, but I also hold out hope for the discovery of one last true sea monster to beat all sea monsters. But it is *not gettin* no tree fiddy! You hear me Margaret?!
You don't think there are drugs in the ocean?
Is it possible that their intelligence is related to them having a short lifespan?  High intelligence would be very beneficial in such an extreme environment ensuring survival and the continuation of the species.  Having a short life span equates to many more generations for adaptations to occur for cephalopods than another species during the same period of time.  I'm no scientist so feel free to chime in and correct me if I'm way off here.
Thing is that time is relative. This seems like a short lifespan for us, but does it to them? 
Not true, the human race's average lifespan has increased drastically with modern medicine, which is a result of intelligence. If current methods of anti-aging are successful, then we will have drastically increased ours directly from intelligence. Depending on how you define it, smarter people live longer too when they figure out how to maximise benefit from the society.Intelligence, be it an advanced nervous system or being self aware, is very costly though and doesn't cause longer life span.
Maybe its hardwired in, partly due to the need to control their complex form in a harsh environment. Whereas humans develop the neural connections over time.Just speculation on my part.
Terrible moderation.  You can't go around deleting posts with 800 upvotes and 40 comments. At that point you are wasting everyone's time more than any off topic discussion ever could.
I for one welcome our tentacled overlords.
Extremophiles, geniuses of our time O_O
Remember, in those kind of works of fiction, the Old Gods are always stopped (no matter what kind of hero stops them) and bad things happen to those who were in favor of their rise
You may be wrong, my friend. The best (and scientifically verified) way to increase the lifespan of a man is to remove his sexuality. The sooner, the better. That is one reason women live at least 12 years more than men. 
Sure it wasn't a baby Cthulhu?
This guy knows. I had a pet octopus at one point. It hated my guts.
I once had an aquarium full of chichlids and they started reproducing when I was a child.. anyway one hopped out and laid splat on the floor. My father at the time was home and found this fish just laying there. He is and was around the time a fully certified EMT. He straight up gave this fish CPR and without shock was reintroduced back to his native tank. The hell I know why I decided to share this story but somehow you mentioning chichlids reminded me of this.
Oh man I wrote about a page of takeaways. Want the distilled version or my full report?
They got *too* smart and started dabbling in Sartre. The realization of the absurdity of life has become too great a burden. 
Maybe they figured out there is an after life and this life is hell and just want to pass as quickly as possible. 
Not only do they live longer, they're alongside their children for years so they can pass down knowledge
Crows and ravens, also. Their lifespan can be around 100 human years. I love to watch these majestic birds in Bangkok's Lumpini park.
Everybody should watch Arrival.
you should read Slaughterhouse 5.
Or better yet, read the story it was based on. Story of Your Life and Others by Ted Chiang. It goes into much more technical detail on how the process of discovery and translation happened. You should watch the movie too though.
The movie added really dumb scenes and took away from openness of the few chapters it's based on. It also didn't explain their language very well, and just kind of stated, they understand everything because they write in a circle....
Wasn't the horse's handler giving him tiny cues, too? 
But humans tens of thousands of years ago were just as intelligent as we are today.Or do you dispute that?Technology requires intelligence, but intelligence need not necessarily make technology.Philosophy and abstract thought are, in my view, a better measure of intelligence than being able to manufacture metal goods.
Thank you. I'm haole.
My hope for scientific breakthroughs is a never ending battle between space and the ocean, both are so insanely cool
Well I for one welcome our new crustacean overlord. 
I would imagine that if you were as smart as an octopus and the fleshy land fish grabbed you up and put you in a tank to live out your life, you'd want to murder everything in sight too. Or escape. Hank just wanted to escape.
thanks, I found a pdf though. Thanks anyway though :_)
One must imagine sisyphish happy.
Exactly, the truly smart may not *desire* to live longer 
They need some Camus then.
This gets into defining "smart". The ability to pass knowledge between generations is one rough definition of "culture". Does culture make us smart? Does the capacity for culture make us smart?
Human years? I think that's just called "years" ;)
I miss running in lumpini park every morning. The monitor lizards too. 
Maybe we should show Arrival to the cuttlefish.
Np, my question is, where do you surf where Octopus swim up to you? I've been looking to make some Poke lately. 
For he is become 'the Uberfische'.
pretty common actually, even has a name for it:Existential Depression, and it is pretty common in prodigies.
As one great philosopher stated "You didn't build that"
Not every culture will make us smarter but some definitely are. 
*earth years
The pool was very nice.
Dophins have language, we have known this for years, and they communicate using sound; we have very minimal understanding of them. Cuttlefish have language that is expressed through changing of patterns on their skin, we can understand their basic attitude, but that's it. Watch a cuttlefish for 5 min and you'll see it watch you back, flashing patterns rippling down it's body trying to communicate information, whether it's trying to ask you a question, or tell it's friends about you. Language is not unique to humans. Not by a long way. 
Yeah I live in Hawai'i too and this has never happened to me.  I speardive for tako a lot and I've only seen them hidden away in rocks.  
> Existential DepressionNow I'm depressed. 
Solar years you losers
Yeah I hate to break it to you but that's just a wet rock, not liquid water.
Now you're a prodigy!
A solar year makes no sense there are 7 other planets with different orbit times.
To be given its "proper place" (let's grant that this *is* at the heart of UK education), we need good philosophy teachers. Where are the thousands that are required going to come from?  Teaching philosophy badly might be worse than none at all.
Rhetoric and Logic (beginners level at least) is probably even more important. Polite discussion where valid arguments are used to defend your opinion is very hard to find these days. These things should be mandatory regardless the discipline you are learning. 
The fact that schools teach religion but not philosophy is something that always baffled me.
Teaching scepticism would be good.  Especially what is claimed or asserted during the rest of philosophy class.
A lot of what was previously classified as philosophy now falls under the fields of science, economics, maths, religious studies etc. The definition is a narrower. That said, teaching rhetoric and logic should probably be mandated at a high school level. Fallacies everywhere! (Hah)
IB is great that way, the subject Theory of Knowledge kind off covers philosophy and helps with critical thinking!
*all education
Education in general needs to become more adaptable to introverted students. Many studies show that introverts produce better work in a shorter tine frame when working on their own, and yet schools continue to push group tasks onto everyone.
Which philosophy?Nihilism - NazisUtilitarianism - communismEnlightenment - democracy and imperialism/colonialismOr maybe cultural Marxism?
Philosophy is a touchy topic. For it to be taught here in the U.S., one would need a doctoral degree in philosophy to even teach it. I don't see how it would be taught in a K-12 education here in the states or even anywhere else. I'm not even sure if students at an early age would even appreciate the subject, it would be only a select few if anything. 
This article was hillarious. It's the intellectual equivalent of "let them eat cake."I'd much rather teach kids financial skills and technical skills that'll help them earn a living.  Not to mention lead them towards STEM subjects which our nation desperately needs. 
I'm skeptical that the "philosophy" they'd like to teach isn't simply the politics of whatever ruling party develops the curriculum
Ok then, no applying for philosophy PhD in the US. Don't see this problem much in UK uni's, at least my old one. Applying to French Unis now and they seem to be alive and kicking.
> Logic is treated as a math courseWhat's wrong with that? Most of the subjects were part of Philosophy in the past. The useful ones with real world application became separate fields and contemporary philosophy is the rest. Logic we know from school today is exact science described in the same way as other fields in maths(axioms, theorems, proofs,...).
Logic *is* a math course.Anything that can be treated as systematically as logic *is* math.If you can reduce it to symbol shunting...
disagree. the subject matter may overlap, but the approach and methodology of philosophy is very different and very vital. 
Yes you are quite right. We do not need philosophy as a separate subject. How many world leading scientists, economists, writers etc. have never studied philosophy formally? Most I would think. And yet people still carp on about how vital philosophy is. You learn what philosophy you need implicitly through these other, much more important subjects.
And it's something that is taken for granted lots as well!
If it were indoctrination then it would matter but in Philosophy you deconstruct models of the world so you can build and edit your very own.It is in many respects the opposite of indoctrination, which can be painful to learn and also threatening to those in power.
Why would you need a doctoral? Just start creating philosophy education programs
> but are far from the only ones on the subredditThey never said that. They said:>The only posts I see from this sub are the ones that make the front page and they are always the same.  
UK universities do frequently have problems with teaching staff being poorly compensated. Philosophy modules getting divided across other departments, not so much. 
> Logic is a math course.Should it be applied maths or pure maths? I've got some problems with it being *just* the latter.
...Is it though?
Philosophy is the root of all these subjects. It is by far the most important discipline. That is why every PhD is a doctor of philosophy.If you want a thinking populous then you must teach philosophy to children. Rather than spoon feed people a view of the world you give them the tools to derive their own. 
I agree. Do you think the government will allow this kind of self learning? Like ohh yes, well actually there are very good philosophical, ethical,And economic reasons for taking the land from the Indians.
Godel's incompleteness theorem was based on a mapping of symbolic logic expressions to the natural numbers.  It is also a theorem about arithmetic.What you're trying to do right now is dress up a dog in a bunny suit and telling me we can have rabbit stew. 
But that's exactly my point, it's a theorem about arithmetic. It's not within the field of arithmetic.It's like saying that the physics dictates the laws of the human body, hence physics and biology are the same field
No its more like saying the law of conservation of energy isn't physics because it is an axiom of physics.
But you're not saying that the incompleteness theorem is an axiom of arithmetic so this analogy makes no sense.
It makes no less sense than your analogy to physics/biology.The bottom line is: who would you go for to learn about Godel?  Your average mathematician or your average philosopher?
Your average philosopher is more likely to know about it. I did an msc in theoretical physics in a maths department. Very few of the profs knew anything about goedel's incompleteness theorem, they've just heard of it. To them it's irrelevant.
>The boa constrictor, when he has had an adequate meal, goes to sleep, and does not wake until he needs another meal. Human beings, for the most part, are not like this.    I really enjoyed the safety check in that last statement. 
>Since power over human beings is shown in making them do what they would rather not do, the man who is actuated by love of power is more apt to inflict pain than to permit pleasure.Oh boy, isn't that the truth.
For anyone interested in the life of Bertrand Russell, there is a fantastic comic book called 'Logicomix: An epic search for truth' that details his early life and some of his main pursuits in philosophy. I would highly recommend it. 
Could somebody add a tl dr for people like me who don't really understand ?

I find this line of thinking a bit cynical. Nowhere is any positive virtue mentioned. I think love, for instance, is one of the most, if not the most powerful drivers in all of human life. 
I didn't know Tarkin won a nobel prize.
According to an alien security officer in Buck Gadoot, Zap Gun For Hire, the four primary human behavior spurs are food, boredom, sex, and the need to meddle in the affairs of others.Despite it being humorous and from an odd SF comic, I've always thought that was pretty insightful.
Always hard to read these sorts of declarative treatises on human psychology - pretty much the most abstract, difficult to define phenomenon in the known world - without suspecting that they're dangerously simplistic. The resistance to that mathematical perception of human behavior is what gave the postmodernists their potency; Russell's epistemic certitude in proposing a formula of human psychology reads as almost laughably dated in the 21st century.
> In any autocratic regime, the holders of power become increasingly tyrannical with experience of the delights that power can afford. Since power over human beings is shown in making them do what they would rather not do, the man who is actuated by love of power is more apt to inflict pain than to permit pleasure.    This quote is a good description of mitch mcconnell and the gop as a whole.  
ahh clickbait book title before we coined the term.  "And you won't believe number three!"
Be ready, be ready to get confused.Is there no map?Would a compass help at all?
Actually the 5 desires driving all human behavior are:1. Love2. Peace3. Fun4. Unity 5. Freedom
He's putting a lot of words behind a simple truth explained in The Gita thousands of years before his time. This way is translated as Niskamakarma - the ability to act without desire, is still a desire nonetheless; just another example of the white man taking credit by making something more complicated than it needs to be
I think he is close but a little off.   There are many things that don't fit into these categories.  Why do we shut our eyes when we look into the sun?Try these 4 reasons why we do everything:Access something/activityEscape something aversiveAccess attentionSelf-stimulation/sensory input
I'm like this when I'm pregnant. 
And something that i had to reread a few times
But power over humans as portrayed here isn't the only power. Humans are most powerful at effecting their environment by their cooperation. The power to organise, facilitate and encourage can make great things happen and nobody has to be suffering to achieve it. Work, yes; pain, no. This is, to me, what political power is at its core.The person that seeks the power to motivate the masses, to focus industry to a singular purpose is not, implicitly heading down a road that would cause any pain to people.
Unless the thing that they would rather not do is, in fact, for the betterment of their well being. Such as the power of a teacher over a student. A parent over a child. A god over his servant. 
Shit, Nobel Prize in lit. Isn't that just for fiction? What did he write?
The problem is that book is largely simply made up. The authors literally say this in the endnotes. 
Irrelevant.
People desire to be rich, adored, powerful, and to bully other people when in need of excitement to alleviate their boredom. 
Four should be Fornicate, just to keep the alliteration alive.
Humans are built for physical struggle. Modern life does not provide adequate physical struggle for most of us, so we become jerks.
Surely that's aquisitiveness? Also, he credited the desire for power as the main driver behind all of human progress and civilisation. I'd say that's pretty positive.
We get it, you're a high school atheist.
Things like duty and morality have to be chosen. Which means that the person choosing has to want them. Which means that they are desires. They can be instrumental desires meaning that they are wanted because they help the chooser to get something else that they want like world peace or a productive society but they are still desires.
There is nothing sophistic about that excerpt. Show your work.
obama killed lots of civilians in the middle east too. 
If we didn't have our ego, maybe...
The title of this speech was "What desires are politically important?"
and still don't understand
"is more apt to" does not mean "will always"
Russell is referring to the man driven by love of power. Most teachers, parents, and deities tend not to be driven by love of power so this statement does not refer to them.
I bet he's kinda smart, too!
But if everyone believes it's true, does it really matter if its false? 
How is that irrelevant?
So everything he said can be explained by dominance hierarchies - but also he left out anything to do with survival of the self or the genes? Aight. 
At an abstract level, he listed 4 powerful ways humans are wired to feel good. In your example of the girls acting on memories of trauma, you can say they are not acting out of fear but instead on a strong desire to generate good feelings again to fight off the negative feelings of their past experience. They are still collecting potatoes to trigger the same mechanism, just in a different context
Not sure if you've whooshed me or it's you thats missed it, but they meant Fuck.
my similar take on it was in breaking down the interplay of wants and needs.  My phil prof was not happy with my reasoning, which was simple: A need is a condition of fulfilling a want.  You don't need to live, you want to live.  That want leads to the need to eat, drink, etc. There's no pure or true needs, because every one of them is preceded by a want.  While I would agree that everything people do comes down to wants, some wants can be purely altruistic.  "I want to help people."
What drives desires? British idealism seems to reduce it to the social nature of human beings. Virtue signaling of any form (pick what works in your society) would be a means to work the social tissue or power relationship between individuals.
You could replace "desire" with "destiny" and the meaning changes but still seem just as sound to a different cultural audience.
Yep, but his entire platform wasn't based on subverting the american population into a bait and switch where they are voting against their own best interests.  Obama was certainly far from perfect, but these guys are selling out america by design.   Defend that.   Are you a "hillary's emails" guy?         
Ego can be silenced. 
Perhaps not his fault, then, but the title of this post is "The Four Desires Driving All Human Behaviour."
Power involves making people do what they don't want to do. So, you aren't very powerful if you're making children eat a cookie because they do it of their own accord. Therefore, love of power is the love of causing pain insofar as you are the cause of people doing things they wouldn't do if it weren't for your intervening. 
You wrote a whole paragraph about a throwaway phrase and an example that was just meant to be illustrative.It is completely irrelevant whether the boa constrictor actually sleeps or not.  Russell could have said, "imagine there existed an animal who, when it was fully fed, just slept until it needed food.  Humans aren't like that."
If you read the article, he says that these four desires separate humans from other animals. We do have other desires that have to do with survival or procreation. But those desires can be fulfilled at least temporarily.The four desires he is talking about here are "infinite desires" that can never truly be fulfilled. 
He used "Reproduce", I assume to not swear, so I suggested fornicate, which means the same as fuck but isn't crass.
I would still argue that things like decisions made under duress are made from desire. It might not be pretty decisions but a person is still choosing to be alive. And even suicide is a decision coming from the desire to not feel bad. 
>I help my friends because they're my friendsWow sick argument; that's a very good and explanatory reason. Why are they your friends? Because you enjoy spending time with them(as in share hobbies, interests...)to quench your boredom or your need for society. Why do you help? Because you desire to be able to spend time with them or continue as friends. You have a desire for someone's friendship.
That criticism turns on the ability of the undefined ears of a "different cultural audience" to recognize soundness rather than the simple question of whether Russel's argument is actually sound itself. It passes the latter test. The former, at least as phrased, is not a test worth taking.If that's the most serious criticism you have, you're miles away from supporting a claim that Russel's excerpt is sophistry.
no, i'm a "both parties are paid by the same lobbyists" guy. i'm a "american voters refusing to vote 3rd party is the core problem of american politics" guy. i'm a "i don't pretend democrats are less evil than republicans just because democrats say they are ok with gays getting married" guy. the two parties are like competing sports teams. no matter who wins, the rules stay the same. 
Guess he's just not much of an animal behaviorist. (/s) My point is that he should probably just stick to what he knows, that's all. He had something to say about human behavior, so just stick with that. 
You're not wrong exactly, but it kind of ruins the joke. The whole point was to make people think 'fuck' without saying it.
Let's grant that decisions made under duress are decisions from desire.  There is nothing acquisitive about my calling George next door my friend.  My love for the girl from my college isn't necessarily a result of selfishness.  When I worry my brother will get in an accident if he drives has nothing hedonistic about itThe fact is there are plenty of behaviors for me that I can explain without turning to desire.  I don't think I'm unique.  And in that case, Russell is either wrong, or he's making indefensible logical jumps
Why're they my friends? Because I care about them.  I like spending time with them because I care about them.  Why do I help them?  Because I genuinely care about them. It's pretty simple; no need to guess my motives, cuz I'll tell you :)
Are you making the same mistake of believing (what the deceptive clickbait edit implies) that Russell claimed there were *only* these four desires?Did you know Russell's speech was titled "What desires are politically important?"  Did you know that he made sure to mention that the desire for necessities (food, shelter, etc.), was politically important?
I'm a sucker for alliteration and will take it over humor. Humor is generally easier to pull off.
Okay, try doing standup
If friendship wasn't about survival then lonely people wouldn't have lower life expectancies.
Yes, because the reason I have friends at 15 is so I don't die at 50You realize how ridiculous that sounds, right?
You may have had your own reasons for doing this, but this excerpt is in bad need of quotation marks to keep track of who is speaking.
IMHO Plato asks all the right questions and gives more or less coherent view of his principles. The means of achieving a state of affairs that he believes to be just should be examined very carefully though. I would argue that huge portion of text dealing with how one regime turns into another and most other parts dealing with moment to moment practical application of Plato's principles are just filled with bad psychology and bad sociology.
I am literally reading The Republic right now for my political philosophy class and I'm just finishing the part on how a Timocracy turns into an oligarchy, I know that after oligarchy is democracy and so on. So, is it just me or does Plato seem to put a better light on Timocracy than the other constitutionals? Like I said I'm still working through it but I find the topics in The Republic so far very relevant to today's politics. Blows my mind that something written in 380 BC can still have such relevance.
When I taught the History of Political Philosophy I spent half a class on Plato. Most instructors spend about a month. "He doesn't think that people are smart enough to govern themselves, and think that they should be governed by the "best and brightest," namely people like himself. You'll see that this is a very common theme in history. Eventually the gods become god though. Next." 
On a post this long, you have an obligation to add a TL;DR
I tend to view this country as a shared tyranny... the Democrats and Republicans have a stranglehold on 99% of every branch of the government.   
We're doomed aren't we?
I recommend reading Volume 1. of Karl Popper's "Open Society" (subtitled "The Spell of Plato") as an answer to this. In it, he defends the liberal democracy and stresses the importance of protecting it, and contrasts this with Plato's idea of a benign ruler (or "philosopher king") and the almost prophetic doom of democracy many people derive from his philosophy. An interesting read, not in the least because Popper knows how to write accessibly.
I'm not gonna lie, I don't have a 9th grade education (GED). However, I think I *sort of* understand what he's saying here, and it sounds like the US is well into the cycle of decay. So what do we do in this case? Is there any saving a rotting culture, or is it best to move to a country that's healthier, and how does one determine such a thing?
It's almost like universities stopped teaching Plato to facilitate this transition. Average BA graduate now has not read this; if he had, he would be more "on alert" to the rise of tyranny. 
Wait...you don't think Trump...the evolution of Plato's tyrant parallels current...the timing of this post has anything to do with American situa......shit. 
"when a tyrant arises he sprouts from a protectorate root and from nothing else."a lot of talk about economic protectionism lately, not to mention the appeal to protect us from terrorism.He said during the RNC that he alone can solve our problems...edit-you can downvote but anything I have said has not been false
You guys realize Plato was a crypto-fascist that argued against democracy so that he could create his ideal republic, based on a 3-class system of privilege and power for the top?Is this thing on?  Hello?
I read that as "Pauly Shore".....I'm going back to bed.
Yeah, that caught my eye too. Made me do a double take there.
When I read that I started to have doubt about the authenticity of the text thank you for clearing that up. 
Translation is hard. It can't be disputed that capital existed, or that the basic laws of economics applied back then. "Capitalism" may be too overloaded a word, but I don't think it is clear that the meaning intended by the translation is meant to refer literally to an ideology tracing back to Adam Smith.
So how should the reader view the wealthy that Plato is referring to? Do you mean that some of these people are wealthy because of capitalistic practices while others are for other reasons?
Would Plato have meant physical capital? After all, the senate consisted of the wealthier members of society, and they usually wield great power. Such as when the triumvirates.
Capital is still a hard term to define, Keynes devotes a substantial ammount of his book to it without arriving at a conclusion, yet he still makes bold predictions and models off of that.     But Socrates is very advanced in his thinking, for example he has a very good grip on what we today call the Spatial Division of Labour and Economy of Scale. I think its fair to extrapolate and extend the meaning of words of the ancients when there is so much other stuff they actually said that shows their understanding of the topic.
Interesting nitpick, but I'm fine with "capitalistic" as used given modern studies show that even in a "capitalistic" society, birth predominately determines wealth. "Capitalistic" may archaically connote capital mobility, but the reality hasn't been that way for a long time (if ever).
True, but a dictatorship is also quite capable of transforming into a democracy.  A realistic goal would not be to remain a democracy indefinitely, but merely to remain a democracy the great majority of the time, and put in place mechanisms by which the tyrannical stage should be rapidly ended when it arises.  
There are plenty of big failures to prove it. The Roman Republic, Kerensky Provisional Gov of Russia, Kuomintang Gov of China, Islamic Democratic Republic of Iraq...and of course the Weimar Republic in Germany. And more. Looking at history, Plato's analysis of how democracy turns to tyranny is prescient.
Term limits.
That's how it is in the copies of The Republic that I've seen. I don't know why no one has decided to parse it into quotes. Maybe it's because there are spots where it's not clear who is speaking and they want to leave it up to individual interpretation. 
Thanks for that post. I've read them all and this is probably my favorite.
Yes he definitely does. It's because the timocratic ruler is ultimately a step-down from the ideal kallipolis (following the tripartite soul division). Interesting to see how such a man favours a controlled state via philosopher-king(s) and eugenics-like program. You'd think  he'd put democracy as the best considering the reputation the ancient Greeks have--I know I did.
Just to be a devil's advocate, can you provide proof that he is wrong?Edit-It's one of life's great ironies that we have 3,000 years of civilization to look back upon and gain insight from along with the availability of almost any amount of information you could desire at our fingertips and we are actually the most ill-informed and easily fooled than we have ever been.
A goal of society should be providing an education of such quality that anyone can be bright enough to be a fair ruler.
He isn't wrong one iota. You do need people of high intellect and strong morals (NOT necessarily religious ones). It falls apart when someone poorly suited to rule becomes a ruler. The systems that select the rulers are flawed and easily manipulated because they are systems of humans. It's inherent in every possible system because humans are fallible. 
I just made a brief comment similar to yours.  Plato was a privileged douchebag.  Take my upvote!
It wasn't named "Republic". Republic is an English translation of a Latin calque of the original title, which was "Politeia". I think Cicero was amongst the first ones to translate politeia as res publica, which we now call either republic or commonwealth, the latter another calque (as an example, Cicero's "De Re Publica" is often translated to "On the Commonwealth"). Regardless, politeia sort of translates to "community of citizens in a city". It primarily is about the people rather than the constitutional arrangement of the state, though the latter is what most people get out of it now. 
That's a narrow view.  Both major parties are *clearly* not monolithic, and there are varying degrees of tyrannical behavior and ideals in each, most of the time Id argue very little (and Im pretty cynical about U.S. govt./politics in general).I dont mean to sound condescending but you should really explore what true tyranny looks like, because it has existed and was far past what the U.S. experiences now.
We're domed or were doomed?:)
That is a great translation & summary. I would love to see a series of these for various philosophical views intelligible to people like me that would never otherwise bother with the stuff.
yup, we are becoming a country where half of the people can't stomach the other half being in charge...this will have negative consequences in the near and distant future
bah, the student would probably just read it to pass and secretly hate it unless he already likes philosophy or a professor who knows how to teach it in a way the student understands
I would be fascinated to see this kind of system used in a modern society.
Why would that prevent you from taking him seriously? Slavery and inequality was part of life, but you can still take him seriously in the context of his historical period. 2000 years from now, someone will look back at this era, and will make a passing comment that we can't take American Republic seriously because they used capitalism as their economic system.
I interpereted 'Protectorate' to mean protective, in a sort of paternalistic way.I don't think it really changes your point, but I really doubt that the idea of protectionism in the economic sense would even be something that was around in Plato's time.
Horrible deconstruction.Trump is not dictator. That is, he might be at heart, but not in practice. His power is very much checked by the courts. It is also checked by legislative branch, and checked by roughly 50% of the country hating him. If anything Trump is one of the most democratic presidents we've had in awhile (ie. a populist elected by ignorance of the people). Let's have some respect for the founding fathers. They designed a system where executive does not hold absolute power, and in 4/8 years he's going to go away forever.
Maybe it was him? Translating ancient Greek was actually his true calling.
I did as well and wondered if I stumbled upon some weird satire.
After I read that i was waiting for mention of the Bourgeois and class consciousness.
Or this whole post in general? Its quite clear the resulting subject matter is discovered to be Tyranny -> Democracy -> Aristocracy -> Timocracy.The planet ever more so than before has become a global Aristocracy. With democratic and tyrannical governments. So what might you ask is a Timocracy?
Capitalism is not Adam Smith's ideology 
Most of the wealthy in his day would've been aristocrats of some sort, making money off the inherited land they owned rather than setting up an enterprise. There would've been bourgeois to some extent, but very few were as rich as the aristocracy and even the richest bourgeois were generally seen as somewhat lesser.
Good point, it is definitely a strong and relevant interpretation, especially considering your statement in connection to Piketty's studies on the subject. My problem is merely with putting that interpretation into the original text as if it were Plato's own words. You can see that point in my responses to the other replies in this thread.
Interesting, you have any thoughts on what those mechanisms might be?  The very definition of tyranny is the inability to be rid of it easily
I'm not yet convinced that term limits are an appropriate check on power. In theory they sound good, but in practice it turns the position into an internship for lobbyists. People don't just disappear after they leave office, they have to make a living somehow.
Why so? Was not his tutor, Socrates, executed through a democratic vote by a jury of these ancient Greeks you speak of?
A baying "democratic" mob sentencing his eldery mentor to death on absurd charges, basically because they were pissed off about losing a war and wanted easy scapegoats, probably had a lot to do with that.
If what you got from The Republic is that Plato was in favor of dictatorships or eugenics, then Jesus Christ you missed a lot.
Do you know what's in your best interests, or do you believe that's for someone else to decide?
You can't really, you've heard of the eternal struggle between aristotle vs plato right? the two base ideas are hard to see which is argue either way and we've been fighting over for generations.
Authoritarianism in any form can never be benevolent. Advocating for it on the basis of the ignorance of the majority is a good way to demonstrably show your lack of empathy. 
It can never happen, because people specialise 
I'm pretty sure Plato argued that mass education was possible but so watered down it wasn't that useful. I don't agree with him, but I feel he would counter with that. I can't find the reference on mobile though.
Not what plato thought and not true. Believing in absolute equality and negating natural order is the cause for disorder for Plato! Not everyone can be a ruler that is the simple truth.Plato says somewhere that you cannot turn every stone into a statue for Zeus.There is a natural order. The philosopher knows this order and acts accordingly. Not everyone is equal, but everybody should be treated equally. What you're claiming leads to tirannie!
Even someone with a sub-80 IQ? 
That's a tautological argument. It's also a boring one, and rather reactionary. It is operating under Platonic assumptions of "correct" rule; that "rule" is a form that exists only in the metaphysical, and can be aspired to but never achieved.This is one of the many problems of Plato. Even his aspirational forms are grotesque, in function and in conception. 
> privilegedWoah, you really took Plato down a notch. Brutal! His entire system of philosophy has been fatally destroyed and rendered totally irrelevant. A teenager on reddit just called him privileged. It's over.
I personally don't vote for a candidate or pick my position on issue solely based on party affiliation.   I don't care if someone is a Democrat or a Republican... I just vote for the person that I feel will be the best choice.  It just seems like there ought to be a better choice than just either/or...   America needs a viable third party(not one that's a clone of the existing two parties, obviously) :)
Have you come across "1000-Word Philosophy"?
I saw a lot of similarities of what Plato described and US history. He is not wrong when he points out a lot of the issues that plague democracies. That being said, we HAVE been through accusation, law suits, impeachments, and assassinations. We have also recovered and kept a strong democracy throughout those issues. Our constitution, as well as our checks and balances, has made sure our democracy withholds its integrity, and combined with such unprecedentedly short term limits, the formation of tyranny is stunted. Very interesting concept though. 
Isn't part of the problem trying to divide something as complex as public opinion along only two party lines?
Negative consequences started a while ago. We are already at that point.
Give it time - most dictators take more than a month to tear down legacy institutions. 
"A spectre is haunting europa"-Plato 
> Capitalism is not Adam Smith's ideology What are you trying to say here?
> Most of the wealthy in his day would've been aristocrats of some sort, making money off the inherited land they owned rather than setting up an enterprise. Are.... You actually trying to imply that this isn't the case in modern times?
It is a question that has been around for a long time, and different countries have different solutions.For example, in the UK if the Prime Minister gets out of control the monarch's duty is to depose them. It would be highly controversial of course, and would no doubt kick off a civil war but that power remains in the hand's of somebody politically neutral but knowledgeable.
The 1st, 2nd, 3rd (outdated), and fourth anendmants of the US constitution.
So, a stifling bureaucracy becomes a check on the power of tyranny. Which is why the current administrations placements specifically for the purpose of 'deconstruction' are a threat to democracy and a calling card of tyranny.
So is it spot on because it fits your political bias? 
Not only that. Plato saw Athenian democracy self-destruct as a result of the Pelopennesian War brought on by the excesses of the Age of Pericles. For Plato democracy means decadence, over-indulgence and rule of the appetitive soul over reason. He sympathized heavily with Sparta and its more oligarchic constitution.
My bad, I should've clarified.I was speaking of offhand experience people have with idealized ancient Greek societies coming into a introductory philosophy class (things like how Athens is the "best" city-state), not necessarily the strict historical context.
Did you read the Apology? Socrates hardly helped himself while he was on trial.
Actually no one really knows what is in our best interest, we don't and never will have complete knowledge so information will always be missing.  People living their daily lives and working their jobs have even less knowledge of the issues than those whose jobs it is to make policy...it's not as simple as you are suggesting
I believe society is too complicated to expect every individual to be an expert on everything.
The question, rather, is who knows what is best for the nation as a whole. That is what politics is concerned with. Not what is best for an individual.
We defer to doctors very readily, and often without much debate. 
did Aristotle champion democratic rule?  Explain briefly please
Can a teacher not teach his students? Can a father not raise his son?'m sorry that you only experienced negative authoritarianism but some authorities deserve praise and honour. What if the authority is loving and kind? And takes care of your needs?When you take care of an animal, or cat, because it is not intelligent enough to care fot its own food do you lack empathy? We are all in some ways ignorant. Anyboday that unveils the truth out of empathy deserves the highest authorithy in my eyes.
Our best president's were anything but average men.  And I'll remind you that we landed on the moon 50 or 60 years ago.  What have we done since?  Politicians slashed the space budget.  I see what you are saying but I have to disagree
Ah, but the capability of critical thinking is the underlying fundament and the most important part of that. A democracy relies on a sufficiently educated population - or rather, a civilized population, where the average man will trust the words of specialists who clearly know more than him, but still reflect upon said words with the aid of logic, reason, and a bit of self-research.At this point, however, one comes close to a technocracy - which isn't that terrible of an idea. However, I'd say it wouldn't work alone, some sort of political debate would still be needed.
IQ means little.  I understand what youre saying but it is a really, *really* terrible form of measuring intelligence.  Even more so that we understand the different "types" of intelligence.  There's also other very important factors like ethics... and sanity.
Not a professor, but it seems like your "political philosophy" class is actually about YOUR political philosophy. 
Plato was extremely privileged.  Yes.  The insight that his background may somehow be related to his philosophy is...rare here, I see. Naturally I am an adolescent because I texted a typical criticism of his philosophy.  You got me.  
I agree, but to compare our circumstances tyranny is beyond exaggeration.
I guess I have, now that you just mentioned it ;-). Do they contextualize it with modern-day examples as well, or is it a "Reader's Digest" version of philosophy.
I am afraid you are right.  Just the idea that he was seen as a viable president speaks volumes about where the voters' heads are at.
but there's literally nothing to suggest he'll do that anymore than any other U.S. president.
> Failing nation-states in the 21st century are much more catastrophic than a failing city-state in Plato's day.Debatable. A failing nation-state in Plato's day could end with everyone that lived in it being killed or sold into slavery, which is pretty catastrophic for them. Agree with your last paragraph though.
Why not include Timocracy also?  The power and wealth of the capitalist class transfer their wealth to their children regularly.  Those children have built nothing, yet inherit vast resources which regularly intersect with power over the lives of other citizens with lesser fortunes.  I could name a few off the top of my head but I'll leave it to the imagination.
S/he is trying to say the phrase "I don't think it is clear that the meaning intended by the translation is meant to refer literally to an ideology tracing back to Adam Smith" makes little sense, because 'Capitalism' isn't an ideology that can be traced back to Adam Smith anyway.
What hedgeofglory said below is what I was going for. What the other person said is also true. 
Capitalism predates Adam Smith, it is an economic system (or mode of production, if we want to go the marxist route) so saying it's adam smith's "ideology" may or may not be correct depending on how we define "ideology" and "capitalism" but it is more accurate to not focus on smith's beliefs.
Yeah. Most of the richest people in the modern world made their wealth through business and started off life far poorer(that's not to say poor, but middle class is a lot poorer than millionaire or billionaire).The traditional idea of one family's wealth going up through time due to the increasing value of their land is largely antiquidated. Yes, families still make money off of that, but all the real wealth is created through enterprise and selling goods and services, rather than just renting land to those who do.
In the US, this is the duty of the Congress and supreme Court through impeachment 
> and would no doubt kick off a civil war So not, that's not a solution. A "mechanism" meant here is one that returns without widespread violece.
Taking the piss and annoying everybody shouldn't earn you a death sentence. That's kinda the whole point.
Seems more like they're suggesting that despite knowing that, you'd probably still assume your personal knowledge is important enough to warrant you having personal choice over your being. It isn't simple, but would you rather not have a choice about it despite still having to live through it?It's hard to argue it's right to give away control over the self to others if you can't do it yourself.
This is a classist, dangerous argument.  There can be value judgments made on information.  That's what wisdom is.  Saying that working class people may not know what's in their best interest is a terrible, terrible mistake on so many levels.  
This question will never have an acceptable answer.
its deeper than that, plato is all about perfection and spirituality (perfect forms and all that) whereas Aristotle is the consummate materialist. for Plato men are supposed to free themselves from the cave and rise to the good whereas for Aristotle the truth lay in empiricism and exploration. So  devolving into politics Plato's idea of philo kings with gold  in their hearts is anathema to Aristotelian ideas.
>What have we done sinceBroke down traditional role models and stereotypes, which resulted in a society freer than any other in history. Created the internet, a piece of technology more important, complex and beneficial than the works of every philosopher in all of history combined. Built machines that eased the lives of millions if not billions. >Politicians slashed the space budgetBecause we realized that the moon is pretty boring all things considered. 
Elaborate. Leaders must understand extremely complicated issues with thousands of moving parts. What makes someone with a sub-80 IQ capable of understanding it? Also, would you draw any conclusions from the fact that countries with very low average IQs are less likely to be democracies? 
Here's some shocking news, different people emphasise different things. Most political philosophy courses are 70% finished by Machiavelli, 80% by Locke. It's an outrageously conservative field. If one thinks that that the vast majority of the interesting or defining elements of political thought are finished by the early 16^th then good for them.I, emphatically, do not. 
True, but it also shows a society full of individuals. Whether people like to admit it or not, diversity is high and people think for themselves nowadays. The pack mentality as described through traditional terms (Republican, Democrat, independent) is not as cut and dry as it used to be.
That's true, and it would be very interesting.  What if somehow though, we got someone like Bill Nye.  I wonder how that would play out.
Imagine if one of them made it to the White House!
Timocracy: a form of government in which rulers are motivated by ambition or love of honor.
You haven't sorted this out.  Is the point that Adam Smith didn't come up with the word or concept of capitalism?  Or that Adam Smith's ideology is not inline with capitalism?
Who do you attribute the ideology of capitalism to?
"utilitarianism: the doctrine that actions are right if they are useful or for the benefit of a majority."Are you suggesting that Smith was more to the altruistic side than the selfish pursuit?
well depending very heavily on the nation. In the US for example wealth lasts rarely more than two or three generations. The richest family in Venice is literally 700 years old. It's kind of ironic that someone complains about the use of *capital* in a  translation of the Greeks as anachronistic and then does not see the blindspot by projecting the American history of wealth distribution onto it. Got to be a little careful here
I'd argue that the impeachment process for the chief executive has a minimal role of the Supreme Court - the courts only role here is that the Chief Justice presides over the Trial, but the greater of your points is absolutely true
He very narrowly was found guilty and then, when it came time to argue for what the punishment should be, he managed to convince the entire jury that he deserved the death penalty.
I guess we as a society (and it's probably where we have failed by the biggest margin) need to get to a place where our own desires aren't the number one priority.  This passage alone describes how when people get entitled they stop accepting the legitimacy of democracy and turn to a "protector" of their ideals which becomes a tyranny
Do you hear me blaming them? How am I being classist?  I am saying it is not practical to expect them to know all relevant information regarding issues...stop making a strawman argument about what I am saying
By pursuing my self-interest I may reduce the ability of someone else to pursue theirs. How do you reconcile that? I guess you attempt to by using the word balance.  But balance comes with wisdom and you can't expect everyone to understand it that way.  
Greatest good for the greatest number seems to be a solid way to go. However arriving at what that is and how to implement it... whole different ballgame
"Democracy" was pejorative until very, very recently. Like in the 19th century democracy was still widely used as a negative, as treasonous. This is one of the things that you'll miss if you think political thought ends with Locke. I find most history of political thought courses deeply, deeply reactionary, and pretty deplorable pedagogically. 
Which could ultimately be a good thing if we move away from the paradigm we have had and come up with something better.  Honestly the fact that he wasn't disqualified could mean that candidates down the line who actually would be good leaders won't get disqualified for petty stuff anymore like Howard Dean's yell.  Can you believe in retrospect that that took down a presidential candidate?
Yeah, I think there's a Plato/Aristotle distinction in terms which may be confusing things.
The former.You only say something can be "traced back" to someone if that person could be said to have started it.Like you wouldn't say witches and wizards could be 'traced back' to JK Rowling, right?
Adam Smith was the first to describe the invisible hand and a couple of other market forces whih led to the development of the capitalistic theory.It's not a definitive claim but it certainly isn't a false one either. Bringing up Marx because he coined the term is pretty darn shallow.
No specific person 
Smith certainly thought benevolence was a virtue.But I wonder what view it is exactly that you attribute to Smith when you say he is ideologically capitalist? There seems to me to be no contradiction between thinking altruism virtuous and supporting a free market including ownership and exchange of capital.Also as a side note, while Smiths sentimentalism does share some commonalities with utilitarianism, it definitely is not equivelant to utilitarianism.
Smith clearly was altruistic.  Read his book on sentimentalist ethics.
I was doing the exact opposite. I was saying that the wealth distribution and who the wealthy were was radically different in Ancient Greece. 
there are forces at work in the world that are broader than what Americans can control.  Globalization is not going anywhere.  The Dems have tried to lean into that reality and build a new economy.  The old guard wants manufacturing back harkening back to some ideal of the 50's when everyone owned a house and the wife stayed at home.  He got elected because people are unrealistic and are not properly informed about the issues we need to deal with. It requires more circumspection than people are willing to give
Actually this has nothing to do with Dems appealing to people and everything to do with the fact that Republicans went on a gerrymandering campaign last time districts were redrawn thus effectively rigging elections. Just look at the recent federal court decision ordering WI to throw out electoral maps because they were districted to favor republicans. 
But we do live in a society where people don't always act in their own best interest. And thank Gord for that. Can you imagine what society would look like if we all acted in our own best interests all the time? We're not hardwired to be sociopaths, we're pack animals. And this isn't the result of "if I did that the police would take me away." There's a reason we are wary of sociopaths, and we could build a society where they were marginalised, instead of lauded. 
Hey man, it's your life, do what you want to do. But one of those needs deals with giving back, and helping other fulfill their needs. Another of those needs deals with gaining wisdom and understanding. These things are doable, but it's people sitting on their ass in a stupor that makes it seem like rocket science. 
One of the most frustratingly beautiful elements of philosophy is that it is at its best when a premise can not be answered or universally agreed upon.
Do you have an opinion on Carl Schmitt? I was introduced over a decade ago and have been noticing a trend in discourse I think is attributed to his work.
Who do you trace our understanding of capitalism to?
Would you not say that Nietzsche and Kierkegaard are existentialist philosophers, despite writing long before the term was popularized? 
Who developed the capitalistic theory?  Everyone here is saying it predates Smith.>Bringing up Marx because he coined the term is pretty darn shallow.Lord I hope you are not speaking to me.
have you read this book?
Someone above seems to have said its the former...
This is why I quit facebook.
Germany hasn't ceded their manufacturing base or jobs and they're doing just fine as a regional power. And their middle class is very strong.
You can't gerrymander a state, those borders have existed for longer than most voters have been alive. It is plausible to blame gerrymandering for why Republicans control the House but if you think that gave Republicans the Senate or the Presidency, you are mistaken.
You can't possibly look at our culture right now and conclude that we are altruistic.  Sure there are examples of it all over the place but that is not the outlook dominating our politics at the moment
I have used Schmitt extensively in my own work, and teach him. On Dictatorship was recently translated to English so now it's very valuable for undergraduates. I used to have to use the *Concept of the Political,* which is a far inferior text.
I don't know. You can make a case for Marx I guess, since he 'invented' the word. "Understanding" is pretty vague though - there is no consistent understanding of capitalism. Mine is different to mine 6 months ago, let alone to someone else on earth at some point in human history.So I'd be wary of saying it can be "traced back" to anyone, but if you're going to say that then Marx is the only name that seems defensible to me.
Oh I must have replied to the wrong guy, some other dude brought up Marx.Who is saying it predates Smith exactly? You must be reading a different thread.No one really came up with capitalistic economic theory, loads of people came up with loads of concepts which coalesced into it. Smith happened to be (one of) the first. I should have formulated that part of my previous post better.
I went to a conference on the book.  Lots of people wrote their dissertation on that book.  Interesting stuff.  Smith was obsessing over the book even years after originally writing it.
Smith believed that mutual sympathy and the spectator's point of view made for a strongly altruistic morality.
and the spectator strongly approves of utility, which is one way of understanding the "common good."
But the jobs never left in the first place.  Once those jobs left America they weren't coming back.  Capitalists sold us down the riber and now we blame the politician...the anger is misplaced
I'm saying that the chokehold that republicans have doesn't have to do with them appealing to more people. It has to do with how voting works. There's a reason that Dems won the popular vote,and that is fear. People in the country are afraid and so they vote against any change. This is disproportionately represented in the government bc of the electoral college. Country folk don't produce as much and are dragging the rest of the country backwards. 
Nothing in this world is made better by more ignorance.  Trashing the idea of knowledge as a means to improve our lives is what I reject and find dangerous.   
I would actually go even further to say that culturally, there is a growing number of people who will not only be self-seeking in their behavior, but purposefully depriving others of that ability in order to increase.We are definitely not an altruistic culture.
No. Our politics are fucked. But I'm not talking about being a follower of a fucked up culture or asking our politics for permission to be different. Being "altruistic" is the last need in a line of "self serving" needs. It makes sense to give back when you can afford to. If you took care of your more pressing concerns such as securing your survival and doing what it takes to thrive, you'd have no problem with that. 
The lesson that philosophy taught me more than anything, and the lesson that society-at-large needs to learn more than anything, is the inclination to ask people "how do you know that", or "why do you think that?"  So many people are immediately put off by a different opinion that instead of determining if it's well supported or not, they just get offended at having someone disagree with them and stop communicating, or get emotional and do something worse.
After reading the article, I asked my 7 year old daughter some of the questions that the author referenced.  My daughter proceeded to explain to me how the cave men developed language (english, to be specific) from unga-bunga.... Good stuff
How does one go about teaching philosophy to children?  My experience with teachers teaching philosophy was basically just a history class on a couple of philosophers and their writings. 
I have been a STEM baby all my life. I was a physics major before turning to CS. But my exposure to philosophical inquiry and rigorous, objective analysis have had the singular largest impact on my personal development and my perspective on life.I have a profound respect for the discipline and I think everyone should have some education in it.
Nothing wrong with it, but to see a philosophical education as the cure-all is hubris.  :)
Majoring in Philosophy at university "set" me up for absolutely no jobs I wouldn't want to be working at. An awkward sentence, I know, but I walked out of university so thrilled my younger self had somehow settled on that choice when everyone had been saying that you needed to be thinking about economics or marketing...how boring!Philosophy as a *child* though - that would've been amazing.
I want to be a part of teaching children philosophy so badly.This is my passion.I feel its imperative to a person's well being to be taught how to compartmentalize and understand ethical dilemmas from a multitude of perspectives. I'm a college student in philosophy and I work with children as a Teaching Assistant.  If anyone knows of a way I can become a part of this movement please do not hesitate to message me details.
that is exactly philosophy is NOT taught in american public schools.  people who can think are not manipulated by fear and emotions as easily as people who never learn how to think critically. 
a little off topic but can someone recommend a good book for an elvern year old kid, thanks 
Trust me, do not teach your child philosophy. I read basic philosophy from a very early age and scoured through every childrends encyclopedia I could get my hands on. Today I live a life of constant disdain for the masses and their petty lives while feeling tremendous rage and jealousy against those who set aside their morality in pursuit of greed. Unless you are wealthy and know that your child will benefit from widening their view then better keep it closed as it will only produce tears.
What measures were used in this study?
Children?By definition, children are very bad at philosophy. They will always misinterpret that which they cannot understand. There are far more important things to be teaching children that they CAN understand.
I had my niece and nephew over today,  my wife took them to church because their mother won't let us have them over unless we take them to church.  When they got home they were telling my wife all the things you need to do to go to heaven,  after their list I asked how they knew that was true and they just stared at me dumbfounded  like they're not used to beliefs being questioned. This article is exactly what I've been looking for. 
Most people need to learn how to react to that kind of question as well. A significant portion of people only feels offended and mistrusted if those questions are asked.We stopped respecting questions.
Philosophy id say is awful for socializing. 
epistimology
THIS is exactly the line between smart and stupid.
I am losing the love of my life tonight because of this.
This, this, this.  Soberly going straight to the root of how one knows something, as well as detaching themselves from their opinions and POV, is something I wish people would do more often.
I  agree that this is something that most people sorely miss and I personally consider it one of the biggest long term problems in the western society. However, as a physicist who is not really fond of philosophy, I'm somewhat skeptical that this is something philosophy teaches you. Am I wrong, does philosophy in general really teach you rational thinking?
basically reddit
Books like Sophie's World by Jostein Gaarder are great for pre/early teens and upwards, and I'm sure there are lots of other books on philosophy that make the subject accessible to pretty much any audience you want. But I agree with you, it needs to be taught by a Philosophy specialist like any other distinct subject, and not like an oddly specific history lesson or off shoot of English. Arguably it has more to do with science then any other subject.
Basic critical thinking is probably better to teach children than the writings of various philosophers.
Yup. Philosophers are behind the greatest movements in history. 
did you somehow find a dearth of objective analysis in physics
Philosophy is a very wide field though.Just about anything can be considered "philosophy". Science used to be called "natural philosophy".This brings me to my point, just about all the best parts of philosophy split from it and became fields of study in their own right.All that's left under the broad banner of "philosophy" ... let's just say philosophy majors aren't exactly in demand anywhere.You are pretty much crediting an entire field for the accomplishments of a minority.
A life raft isn't a cureall when you're stranded in the middle of the ocean, but without one you will certainly drown.
Maybe this points out the validity of an earlier poster, that may be we as a society want or value critical thinkers. Revolutionaries are dangerous people. We want people to have the ability of read, write and be numerate, but maybe not much beyond that. Even those who study a STEM subject, how many really think about what they are learning and just act as sponge because that is more economically prudent thing to do.
What kind of jobs can one get after studying Philosophy?I love Philosophy but I'm not quite sure if I want it to be more than just a hobby.
Teach Theory of Knowledge to International Baccalaureate students.
> Atheists hate when kids are taught about religionThis is categorically false.  There's a distinction between exposing a child to what religion is about, and indoctrinating a child to accept as true the demonstrably false propositions that are epistemically unsound.And it's not just religion I want my children exposed to, I want them to learn about anthropology so that they understand why these traditions exist.We fail our children in teaching them *what* to think rather than *how* to think.
You mean not as easily manipulated.Advertising still works even if you know how it works.Placebos work, even when you know it's a placebo.We were all born with all the basic instincts, emotions and general wiring of the evolution branch we evolved on.
> why not teach logic instead?Because your home life plays a significant role in your ability to determine what is and isn't logical. Also, when teaching logic, you will be met with ugly hard truths and society tends to reject a lot of those so it would be in direct conflict with many teachings in western school systems. 
What study?
I have a feeling your niece/nephew's mom isn't going to like that.
It extends into American university life as well, when the people who never had to try to make friends before are urged to seek out social organizations for competitive advantage later in life. The American dream.
That's because encouraging critical thinking is counterproductive when trying to mass-produce good little worker drones.
Actually you have this backward despite what you might think.  American students might lack some critical thinking... this can be said about damn near everybody and 5 minutes of browsing any thread on reddit can lend you enough examples.  However, it is the one area where American students perform well compared to many of their counterparts throughout the world.  American students are taught to think critically and figure out how to solve something, not just get the correct answer.  Memorization is stressed considerably more in other areas of the world.
>sadly no one else figured it out, yetPretty big claim isn't it? In high school I had a small group of close friends(5 people). We were very open with each other and not afraid to discuss a difference of opinions or call out other's on their bs.  Best group of people I've ever met, but now my standards are too high.
That's bullshit. I spent K-8th in OUSD, one of the shittier and least funded school systems in the U.S. For all their budget shortages, lack of teachers and teaching materials they literally stressed "critical thinking" as much as possible. Now, naturally some teachers were better than this at others but the fact remains that critical thinking was build into every core class I ever took. 
where did that come from and what is your train of thought? 
Impissedimology is more like it.The number of trivial things people hold onto like the last bit of water in a desert...no reasoning with them because of anger.
Unfortunately, people prefer evidence.
Wait, what? What is the story here?
Just want to say thank you as an IB grad done with undergrad and now in medical school. TOK is the most influential course I've ever taken, I was lucky to have an amazing teacher that profoundly shaped the way I looked at the world. So if you ever feel your students are ungrateful, please cut them some slack and keep up the amazing work.
For some reason, in my class/school ToK was one of the most hated subject - maybe because it was meant to stimulate thought who knows. Some complained that it was a distraction from the other subjects that actually counted much more towards your overall grade... I really enjoyed it and thought the teachers made a good effort (so I don't it was the teachers doing a poor job).
> ld by Jostein Gaarder are great for pre/early teens and upwards, anCan you suggest more books, that would be apt as learning tool for kids?
I have long suggested logic should be introduced alongside mathematics. Reason and critical thinking skills are foundational pieces that have been missing from early childhood development. 
Its not as easy as teaching them "basic critical thinking". You need to first of all have a topic to discuss and think critically about. And you cant just suggest a topic and discuss it without any knowledge of the topic. So we read about the topic first. Maybe it partially comes across as a history class on them, but there should be a lot of discussion and debates in there, which is where the value comes from. Also there a lot of highly relevant philosophical topics that are worth learning the history of on their own merit
And the greatest non movements. My brother in law. Are you ever going to use that degree to get off my couch, Chad?!"
Way, way behind.Philosophers teach students to talk complete crap, at length, and in flowery and imprecise language, without any actual substance, and all without actually *doing* anything.In other words, training to be a politician, a marketeer, or a lawyer.
Out of curiosity, what did you study in university? I wish to hear more about your thoughts. 
As I said in another post,> This brings me to my point, just about all the best parts of philosophy split from it and became fields of study in their own right.All that's left under the broad banner of "philosophy" ... let's just say philosophy majors aren't exactly in demand anywhere.
your gripe is that he said "not manipulated as easily" instead of "not as easily manipulated?"
The title is an empirical claim, that should be supported by evidence, but I don't know how I would go about measuring it. The article doesn't mention it. 
Connections are the driving force of success in every society. It is what makes it a society.
When you reach adult hood you don't get to blame your parents anymore.  Once you realize you don't like what you are you CAN change it. Happens all the time..to those who don't give up and want to make life better for themselves.  The American Dream is working really hard to get whatever chance you can and make the most out of who you CAN be.  Does everyone start at the same "level" in life...no but you CAN get there if you have the drive and determination (aside from biological impairments).
I think this is an overly cynical view point. If schooling has been corrupted so that it's just to create conforming workers for society why do they even teach math and English and really any subject that is not immediately practical. If school really was set up to purposely turn us into worker drones it's done a pretty shit job of it consderijg how many people blatantly hate working and how anti capitalist the average person is 
I feel like it's a fault on the individual teacher. I went to high school in America and most of my literature and history teachers asked us how we felt about topics or tropes. My science teachers also made us think about the importance of famous past experiments to give us the "common knowledge" we have today. 
If anything we have swung widely away from that.  You have massive numbers of kids going into near debt-slavery to obtain a college education when they aren't culturally or intellectually prepared for it.  The perception that blue-color work makes one a "drone" is harmful and destructive to the vast numbers who are below median in intelligence, aptitude and achievement.  
I hope that is true. The biggest problem education has in the UK is not it's ambition, but rather its implementation. ie "Show your critical thinking skills by giving us the right answer." Proscription in assessment destroys real imagination.
I don't know where it came from, but I can follow it up. In some of my past conversations, I've brought up philosophical or ethical questions in a fairly non-rigorous manner, but still some people tell me I'm depressing or they'll just blatantly say "I don't think about stuff like that."  On the other hand, some of my most cherished moments with friends from college involved quite a bit of philosophizing.  So it really depends on who you are with!
It happens when people abandon the arts and humanities as sources of truth.
I don't think that's true for even 50% of the population at large.
He is a Determinist and she holds free-will libertarian views.It was never meant to be. ..He would say that they were star crossed lovers, but she would take an exception to that assesment.
I guess that's true, what's the point of life if not to enjoy it, in whatever way gives you the most enjoyment.There is still the unneeded defensive factor though, I'm not insulting them, just trying to have a conversation I think would be interesting and fun.
As an engineer, I must point out that we are constantly asking much stupider questions than "Why doesn't this go on this way?"Much, much stupider...For example, my group mate, who is in charge of designing the power supply for a bunch of servos, had to ask me what the difference between a servo and a motor was... I almost lost faith in his ability to make a power supply without breaking everything, right there and then.
Well, a lot of people think philosophy is "dumb" or "useless", so it's not surprising that some students didn't find the class appealing.  However, ToK is one of the core subjects for IB and very important to the program, so I'm not sure why the students felt it wasn't important.
Also, I'm sick of CS students who can't understand under what conditions a certain branch is taken...And no, I'm not joking. I wish I was.
I don't think logic in the mathematical sense would be good. I can't see high schoolers being interested in truth tables and sets. I think logic in the puzzle sort of way would be a good idea. Logical problems that don't take any formal schooling that just require you to think would be great.
No I think critical thinking is one of the fundamental tenants of philosophy which is of course a massive field. And because it is essentially "the basics", that's why it should be what we teach first.The rest of philosophy doesn't matter if you are unable to move from premise to conclusion in a coherent and rational way.
Philosophers and Philosophy Majors (while not mutually exclusive) are not the same thing. 
I guess you're trolling, but as a personal ignoramus myself, I was stunned by how much the Greek philosophers lead us out of the world of superstition, and into the age of reason. (sic). It sent religion scampering to the corners of reason for scraps, and allowed the development of scientific thinking which transformed the world. I wish politicians were philosophers... Marketeers are business people and lawyers are sophists.
I feel like this is an under rated post, it explains a lot IMO. But I don't think its the "best" parts that split off, but the parts that had real world applicability/impact. All that is left are the bits that have little real world applicability.
I think "this" is a perfectly reasonable comment. A lot of people don't like it because it is purported to contribute nothing to a thread. In reality though, simply commenting the word "this" indicates a resonance so strong that it motivates an agent to signify their agreement and value of the original comment with something beyond the numerical "upvote". It indicates that the conversation ought to continue -- that what's been said is of a vein worth pursuing, worth valuing. 
So you agree that they shouldn't be especially for American society. Yet some Americans sure seem to believe they are.
You do see the irony, right? Not trying to be a dick or rub it in, just checking in earnest.
Poor parenting can leave scars and habits that extend well into your adulthood. Becoming an adult doesn't magically clean the baggage from your past. That being said, having a good excuse to blame your behavior on your past doesn't mean you should. Part of being an adult is coming to terms with the past so you can have a future. 
"It must not be supposed that the officials in charge of Education desire the young to become educated. On the contrary, their problem is to impart information without imparting intelligence" Bertrand Russel - Free thought and official Propaganda (1922)
Because they need more than just bottom-level workers, and the people who will fill the more complex roles need to be prepared for deeper study. They need scientists to develop shit for them and marketing teams to sell shit for them and lawyers to fight their legal battles for them. Doesn't matter if people hate working or even the system at large; they tolerate it because the alternative is assumed to be worse.
Math is important for worker drones. Also, see nationwide emphasis on STEM rather than liberal arts of any kind. The tension in the "why teach English?" type question is due to incomplete political dominance. 
When you're in graduate school, professors aren't trying to create worker drones, they expect you to already be a worker drone who will help churn out publications with their name on it. Thinking critically will often hinder that process.
Except for the whole having to teach to the test or your rating as a teacher gets destroyed thing.
Agreed. In one of my classes, (specifically Biology), the class is very bland. Closed-minded, like I said, (partly due to the region we live in, and the circumstances most were brought up in), but they won't even stand for a small sentence about biological reasoning spoken aloud. It's instant laughter, from the teacher and everyone else. It's sad. 
You're absolutely right. They encourage critical thinking at secondary school, but at the end of the day it was still a regurgitation of what we were taught. If I was doing an essay, rather than critically evaluating based upon my own thoughts, it was "give us exactly what we want to know and make it look like you've come to this conclusion through deduction, not because this is what was drilled into you repeatedly." The critical evaluation is an afterthought if anything. 
Oh his is very true.  I think being cognizant of your own potential stupidity is the best you can do in today's engineering environment.This is a speculative and kind of abstract conversation, I just remember a lot of annoying conversations people tried to push onto me as "interesting".   Like the environmental scientist who - in senior year - finally realized that wind turbine blades were "wings"
Tenets. Fundamental tenets.
Chad should take up welding. 
"It sent religion scampering to the corners of reason for scraps, and allowed the development of scientific thinking which transformed the world"Careful with this, mysticism took a hit, but religion in general wasn't defeated. Isaac newton, the father of modern science and the modern scientific method, professed religion to be the driving force for his discoveries. "To think God's thoughts after him". Same with Kepler, the father of modern astronomy, and others.
>signify their agreement and value of the original comment with something beyond the numerical "upvote".Granted, but it's the *least possible* contribution beyond an upvote. In a medium with myriad gradations of expression, it's a paucity.
What? The reason we form societies is for connections. A group of people who are well connected can always accomplish more than an individual. Building relationships and trust is what allows us to be more than the sum of our parts.Can it be abused? Of course. *Everything* can be abused.
I do. I wish I had worded it differently, but yes, /u/Aisthetiks makes a fair point.
It was also part of the formula for communism, and fascism, and the like. And family orientated could be part of the formula for small warring tribal societies. And public and duty orientated societies are part of the formula for dictatorships and monarchies. People are just easily manipulated. There is not anything particularly special about any culture in that regard.As for schooling: I know for a fact that my teachers definitely tried to teach me critical thinking skills. So any deficiency I possess is not for lack of their trying.
The thing is you do NOT just get taught the basics for functioning as a worker drone in school. There's loads of things to be improved in public education, but your view seems rather bleak, given subjects such as English etc are in the curriculum, and you read acutal literature there and don't just learn how to answer emails.
what if you replace they with we
Eh - I disagree. It certainly happens I know, but in my experience the teachers who I had who had *discussions* in class about the topics being taught ended up translating into better overall grades and attitude in the class.
That is sad. I am currently studying Molecular Biology at a solid school because of my freshman year of high school Biology teacher. I even went to school in the deep south..
It is almost as if the people setting up these tests lack critical thinking skills...
I found it odd at university that you were given only a lecture and a few hours of reading to attempt to gain critical insight into a topic that the several dozen leading researchers you were studying has spent years if not their life studying. How could you have anything but a superficial grasp of the topic?
Ha! It's very interesting when people with a *lot* of knowledge in a subject don't know something that is very common within that subject, makes you realize how easy it is to  miss something.
"Someone disagrees with me. Better downvote him without addressing his arguments."     -a user at /r/philosophy
Why does everything need to be a meaningful contribution? Sometimes you just want to be heard and let someone know how much something resonated with you.You could use that same logic against people who say thank you. What utilitarian purpose does gratitude have beyond just letting someone know you appreciate them? 
Id say people are not easily manipulated unless they want to. People want to be manipulated so they can reap the rewards. They promise to end their fears for them like a church to the sinful and to have their backs like a mafia to a petty criminal. To question is to die alone. 
It definitely feels like it. What I like about university is that, really, there are no wrong answers. You can get something absolutely categorically wrong, but as long as you have proven that you have done reading and logically come to the conclusion you've reached, you can still do well. Philosophical essays are even easier - provided there is evidence to back up your claims, you can pretty much assert anything you want. Show how you got to that point and all that's left to do is provide a counter-argument, rather than simply going "no, this is not what you were taught."
I'm grappling with that concept myself. I think it's the width as well as the depth of reading you do. Rather than studying the entirety of a topic, you're assigned an incredibly specific topic to read into significantly and get as many stances and viewpoints as possible during that time. Rather than "analyse Hegel's Philosophy of Right", it's "is Hegel's theory of justice retributive or consequentialist in Philosophy of Right" for example. 
Well I mean, what notion of truth are you even talking about? The notion itself is really dubious. There are so many different ideas about truth (esp in the humanities) that to claim that something is a source of this truth is borderline meaningless without further specification.
It's nice to see people who can admit it though.  I try not to open my mouth until the last possible second; sometimes it's sometimes it just hasn't "clicked" and I'll get it once I can sit at my desk and think.  But in a field where you're mostly making armchair decisions, being dumb is really only bad when you can't admit it
> Sometimes you just want to be heard and let someone know how much something resonated with you.It resonated so much, it inspired heartfelt lines of poetry like "This.">You could use that same logic against people who say thank you.I'm not sure about that. In fact, I think substituting "Thank you." wouldn't have generated the same negative response.
If you have a good lecturer then sure. With the mass production of University education that aspect can be lost. (in UK at least). I remember writing an essay "Show how X is different to everything else" where I quoted lots of top software gurus saying "It's Not". I got a crap mark for a really good essay.X was "Object Orientation", in case you were curious.
Yes, many essay questions narrow down, though the assumption is you have a broad enough reading to contextualise the question and a specific enough reading to give a detailed and nuanced answer. This is possible (I got a First), but the reality is that learning to find and sort the data intelligently (aka survey technique) is not the same as understanding the data (aka analysis and knowledge).
Truth is the explanation that best helps you sleep at night.
I think you're making the mistake in thinking people only comment for your entertainment. That's just a byproduct. We're social creatures that like to socialize, that's why we do this.>I'm not sure about that. In fact, I think substituting "Thank you." wouldn't have generated the same negative response.Are we talking about popularity or depth?
I do History & Politics, a lot of the politics I do is political philosophy so this is my bread and butter. 
I don't claim to know the details of how feelings work and their relationship to thought.  If it did then I believe I would have a full understanding of consciousness.To me the thread started by a claim that arts & humanities help prevent dogma and ignoring facts.  I say science is much more useful for fixing those problems in the population (and basic philosophy).
Every the philosophy of x video or book is about existentialism. They need to talk about something else already.
I like this video, but the conclusion seems a bit too simple when I think about Dan Harmon and his previous work. He often has characters grapple with existentialism but his character arcs never end with "nothing matters so I'm just gonna keep being a dick." One reason most likely being... that's not very compelling storytelling. 
Myth of Sisyphus is one of my favourite philosophical essays, and Camus did say at the end that you needed to find joy in rolling that boulder up the hill. I think things like this Rick and Morty analysis get a bit carried away.  
As much as I love Rick and Morty, it isn't even the best example of existentialism and absurdist comedy on Adult Swim. For that you'll have to watch The Eric Andre Show. One of the best, and most forward thinking shows on tv
[Abstract]Since the pilot, I have been enthralled both with the series' dark humor, yet more so in its musings on key philosophical issues. Within this video, evidence will be presented to support the claim the show has ultimately transitioned from one characterizing a philosophical world view based on existential thought into a show more closely resembled by the philosophical school of thought of Absurdism popularized by the late Albert Camus.
Doesn't matter how many times I watch it.. I get a nerd/philosophy/fuckwhatyouthoughtyouknew boner every time 
Wisecrack does excellent video essays, but they need to tone it down on the Rick and Morty. It's becoming the only thing they do. they're going to stagnate.
No. Rick is the ubermench.
Anywhere good to stream ? I have Netflix , prime and I can't find it anywhere I could always use Kodi if need be but I like the official streams if I can find them 
Cause it's pretty easily to connect everything to existentialism
They have some not existential related:Philosophy of Kanye WestPhilosophy of Darth VaderPhilosophy of Shia leboufFew that come to mind 
The Philosophy of Attack on Titan wasn't about existentialism. It was about Nazi ideology, actually. 
I didn't watch the video, but it seems to be exploring a shift from an existentialist to an absurdist perspective in the show. I'd say the show has always been absurdist in nature, whether on purpose or not. But I wouldn't point someone to Rick and Morty if they wanted to understand absurdism better. 
I will certainly cede that point to you, especially in regards to Rick and Morty, which has been beaten to death regarding its musings on existentialism. In this video's defense, it does highlight the show's shift from existential to absurdist philosophic undertones.
That's not what is being suggested as the story arc. OP proposes that the character arc of Rick is developing a way to be happy even while knowing nothing matters, without retreating to some false meaning. 
I dunno .. I listened to harmon town a lot for a while but Dan Harmon really believes himself to be a lot smarter then he actually is and sometimes doubles down on very questionable positions imo .. after a while it just becomes a little tedious and going "I m a narcissist - harharhar" sort of ceases to be an excuse if you return tothe same conceited BS again and again
Seriously Reddit and Rick and Morty fans are making me start to hate the show. Sure it's more clever than your average adult cartoon but fucking hell its as deep as a puddle. It's pop nihilism.God doesn't exis- wubalubdub szechuan sauce!! 
IIRC the end of that essay is "one might imagine Sisyphus happy." which doesn't necessarily mean he's found meaning, it could be interpreted that he has reached a state of acceptance of the absurd and revels in the meaningless turmoil of life.
Xavier: Renegade Angel is another great one. 
It's not, it's content fluff filler. They invented a narrative around an advertisement. 
world peace nerd 
Wisecrack is amazing, especially the Rick and Morty videos. Thanks for posting this
But Camus *was* an existentialist REEEEEEE
Brother...i-is that you? 
Do you really think so? I just looked at their channel page and in the last six months they made about ~45 Videos, 5 of which were about R&M.I would hardly call that 'the only thing they do'.
Don't forget the Morty Mind Shield - THE reason why all the Ricks have Mortys with them.
I say that this will be hinted towards throughout the series but then Morty dies at the end and rick doesn't give a shit
It also makes it uninteresting. The idea that reality doesn't have a built in obvious answer, so you just have to do stuff is one of exactly two options, and is taken almost as a given in modern day. Like sure, there are particular things to say about it, but to anyone who has watched / read more than one video like this, the fact that they describe the same basic existentialism facts, but then say its part of a different series gets redundant after awhile when nothing else is mentioned.
Also, the repeated theme about the ethical issue of how casually people might treat creation and disposal of life once 3d printing of flesh exists.Another interesting theme is rick's amoralism. Rick isn't a nihilist. He seems aware that good and evil exist, even saying so directly more than once. He just considers this an inert fact about reality he is capable of ignoring or using for his own ends. They could even mention moral naturalism in that rick insists goodness is a tangible thing you could theoretically measure.Etc. There's quite a few different things one could go into.
I found this comment more interesting than the video. If you wrote an essay that went a bit more into depth on some of these things, for people who don't know Philosophy 101, I'd read it.
Auto-erotic Assimilation was basically a story about A Utility Monster.
I never saw that one but I could have guessed. I've always wanted to do a write up on Nazi themes in anime. Super Saiyans change to blonde hair and blue eyes for example. Nazi themes are very prevalent in anime.
More about how season 2 finale dangles the switch from absurdism to existentialism but season three trolls us and goes full force absurdism. You were really close though. 
I see that now, you're right. The message was muddied by having one of the last lines of the video highlight how Rick doesn't care about his family and isn't learning to be compassionate. Made everything seem reductive. 
Oddly enough that's the premise of the most recent video they did on Rick and Morty
Pop nihlism is a great way to put it. My friend said it addresses deep concepts, I pointed out it's not addressing them so much as exploiting them.
It goes into more interesting concepts, people just make the Nihilism seem far more common in the show than it really is.Fandoms ruin literally everything.
Don't let stupid people ruin fun things for you. Stupid people love astrology, but I still think astronomy and space exploration are cool. 
Yeah what a genius marketing move; advertising a dipping sauce that they haven't sold in almost 20 years. Checks out.
Glad to hear it! You're certainly welcome.
This is fine but it can also very easily lead to doing fuck all with your life. You can't rationalise away the suffering that *inevitably* leads from that road. I really think it's something innate in us that hates idleness. I've never met a lazy bastard whose positive front isn't just a thinly-veiled mask for deep inner turmoil. You can see it in their eyes and their empty justifications, they'd rather be productive and useful, but it would hurt their soul even more to do so on other people's terms so they've chosen the lesser of two evils. 
/r/im14andthisisdeep
Except there is meaning in life, and that is pursuing happiness, which is an action that can always be taken.
Yeah only the Rick and Morty ones make it to the front page tho, so that's why he thinks they make just R&M videos
Careful, friend. This is how it has to be. Don't let it grind you too much. If you feel uneasy or believe yourself headed toward your own crisis, change your lens!
Rick is actually an egotist. Every single one of his actions supports this. We thought he betrayed that when he turned himself in to save his family, but we saw that was just a ruse in the season 3 opener. 
Haha thanks. I've thrown this example around with my friends before when they talk about how deep Rick and Morty is and it's usually met with blank stares. Maybe I will if you promise not to use it as homework lol 
Green eyes. The blonde hair is the only similarity, seems like a stretch to me
I'm pretty sure the philosophy isn't why people watch and love the show. The show's persistent shittalking and utter disregard for reverence is pretty consistently the main draw for the majority of fans I've spoken with. The nihilism and existentialism is just the vessel.
That's because the internet thinks everything is nihilism.
Yup, that's why I tend to ignore the majority of the fans of shit I like.
Oh yeah it won't really, my comment was mostly me expressing my frustration with internet fandom. When I watch it with friends we don't divulge in "this is deep" so I'm still content. :)
TIL Camus was from a province in eastern central China.
They're advertising a brand? Not a sauce. 
For what? You didn't produce that video did you?
I don't think being busy for busy sake or level of activity is the innate subconscious goal. I think it has more to do with having control or conversely losing control. Overall the lazy man would rather be effective than be busy or lazy or whichever conserves energy and increases output the most. However effective *and* lazy may be energy conservation at its finest.
You're looking at these things way too literally.Being a nihilist or existentialist doesn't mean finding no happiness or joy in life. Just not holding meaning beyond those simple joys. Why is the world terrible? Because it is. Why do I like cake? Because I do. Why don't I kill myself, because I don't see any reason to and I want to eat more cake.And 'living each day as your last' doesn't mean literally pretending that the world is ending tomorrow, just not putting things off till tomorrow if you can do them today (things you want to do). 
/r/imanadultandthisstuffisstillofacademicandsocietalinterest
It's not the similar content of the videos that bothers her/him. It's the existential issue. I don't like being reminded of it much either. 
Rick is a spook 
Egotist or Egoist? Because Egoism is Stirner and egotist is another word for narcissist. 
He's really a solipsist.
If you could post that essay by midnight Pacific time, I would read it too. APA format is the most readable, don't you think? 
How about a YouTube video? We need a better philosophy channel that looks at modern media/culture.
and the whole extermination and enslavement of inferior species thing
I loved that episode as well. It got me really interested to watch the show, but I couldn't get more than a half way through.Just couldn't take all the melodrama and well, anime tropes. I used to watch anime when I was younger, but now it just annoys the hell out of me.
It's sci fi and I like the jokes...I mean, I just think it's a cool show. Who cares about the fans or anti-fans if I just have a good time watching it?
Aren't we talking about Buddhism here? The concept of doing without doing?
All of this is laughably obvious, if you're really serious about killing yourself you would know better than to mention any of your feelings to anyone who could possibly jeopardize your pursuit by telling the authorities, all you have to do is go home and wrap your lips around a revolver, it's that easy.
> a nihilist or existentialistThese are two very different things though. A nihilist believes there is no meaning and no point to having a meaning in life, while and existentialist believes that there is no *inherent* meaning in life, and that therefore one must make a meaning for oneself.Nihilism liberates you from any and all responsability, while existentialism gives you the freedom to choose how to live your own life (once you accept that it has no inherent greater purpose).
For me it's about the fact that life is kind of weird. I cannot believe that there is anything other than nothing after I die. Some people would say this would remove all meaning from life not quite the opposite. It means that I give my life meaning through my own actions. 
You think that post is of academic interest?
Academic interest? Pardon my ignorance, but?
please give me a list of the other things in life you don't want to be confronted with so we can censor them out of existence, thank you. 
That's racist, and nobody uses that term anymore anyway. They prefer African American. 
Egoist -> "I'm the only person that matters."Solipsist -> "I'm the only person that exists."
For what it's worth there are plenty of anime shows that avoid those common anime tropes. You're probably thinking of shonen anime which is meant for teenage boys essentially. There are is also a seinen which is meant for a more mature adult audience, plus other genres intended for both young and older female a as well.
TIL I'm Buddhist, not lazy.
A lot of people support assisted suicide for terminally ill patients. This is due to them not having to experience great pain and suffering when there is no chance of recovery.Depression is not curable or even reliably treatable in some cases. It also causes great pain and suffering. It's not that far of a leap from there to support it if they have tried to get help and nothing really worked.
I'll admit I did have to go look up the definitions before commenting. But I think what I said was still relevant to both philosophies.Whether you find meaning in cake, or just enjoyment, you still live on.A question I would ask, in reference to /u/keliseart>finding meaning in nothingWould that make you a nihilist or an existentialist?
what if you're just programmed to think that and are actually deluding yourself? would that matter?
Not that post in particular lolThe topic
We're talking about the nature of meaning. This falls into philosophy, psychology, sociology, humanities, design, politics, etc.
Don't listen to him, you're beautiful. 
I think Rick acknowledges the existence of others, but in an infinite multiverse, any one individual's existence is worthless. Why should I care if my current granddaughter is killed if I have infinite granddaughters in other universes?
But I would think, therefore exist, right? If I was programmed to think I was doing real stuff and unbeknownst to me, I wasn't, I'd be just like Jim Cary from the Truman Show before he found out he was on the Truman Show. I'd just go along my merry way and not suspect anything and all of my experiences would be so real to me. Even if I was deluded I don't see how that would make any difference to me. I'd still feel the pain and joy I feel now even if it was a little artificial. 
Thanks! So are you.
That is pretty clearly refuted in the episode where he sacrifices himself for Morty, telling him to be better than he was. Rick doesn't have a consistent framework for his actions because he is a deeply depressed individual who actually avoids introspection whenever he can.
Brain in a Vat theory.
"The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, for example, embraced Nihilism."God damn you Crash Course.
One thing I struggle with, and paraphrasing- if the world has no purpose, you have to imbue it with one.  And some people can find this exhilarating.  But I am not one.  If I have created a purpose from my own will, and I know at its core, that it is phony.  I will always know that the purpose is something created, a fictional device, to help me cope with existence.  My struggle with being faithless, whether that is to purpose or any other belief, is that I have nothing to hold on to, and anything I create, I will know the truth of its origin.     
I've been having an existential crisis lately and didn't know what it was actually called until now. Thank god I don't feel like the only one
I recognize this video. I got to the point where they called Nietzsche a nihilist and turned it off immediately.
BUT WHAT DID THE MAN CHOOSE??????? Mom or military?
I think a problem many people may encounter is that it's too overwhelming to the idea that we are completely free to make our own choices and they are confining themselves to some kind of guidelines others tell them to make it easier. Now I'm talking practically, not total anarchy or anything like that. It's important to stay authentic because if you aren't being authentic are you really even being you?
Can Crash Course vids just be banned from /r/philosophy?
Watching this was the best 8 minutes I've used today. Great video OP
This thread is full of Philosophy majors trying to find meaning in their degree by critiquing a 'CRASH COURSE' (emphasis on that part) on Philosophy. The beauty and horror of Philosophy  is that you can argue almost anything and make it fit your box of understanding, but in a 10 minute video it's almost impossible to cover every character and idea in the same depth universities do.    
I really enjoy all of the crash course videos. I'm not exactly an expert in any of the fields but,  are they fairly accurate with most of their lessons? 
Can someone tell me if existentialism is still a viable world-view for a modern philosopher? How many modern existentialist philosophers are there?
Oh yes! The crash course series is amazing  (I think the green brothers may be disliked by Reddit, but they put out a great show in their series). If you found this video to be of high quality, then I'd highly recommend watching all the videos - at least in crash course philosophy - all the way through. I've been with them since their first philosophy video and moral luck was their latest one. Check it out if you liked it; I can't recommend it highly enough.  
Am I the only one that wants to know if he stayed with his mother or went off to war?
I lub Albert Camus...he had a grasp on things.
Not trying to offend anyone here, legit question: isn't this all just common sense? What's so revolutionary about these ideas? Admirable that people broke from the norm in primitive times, but nowadays why do people study this and revere the philosophers who founded the principals? 
Problem is: plenty of things have rules and purpose without us giving them one. Ever heard of physics? Those are laws that exist with or without humanity. Rules for the universe to abide by that no human can logically deny, change, or live outside of. The laws of the universe are the only commandments of God
More of a nihilist myself
I honestly don't get how people still misread Nietzsche this badly, it's so much of a trope that it's basically the first thing you learn about Nietzsche's work. 
now i know i don't have to watch the video
I mean, he embraced it in that he accepted it as given, and worked from there. Maybe it's a poor choice of word, but he did take the idea more seriously than almost any of his predecessors.
Great video. I loved how they said correctly the last names of the authors. I believe that Kafka's work is a great example of existential crisis and how absurdity plays a role when dealing with difficult choices.
School of Life is just better than Crash Course at discussing specific ideas. Crash Course is great for a 101 level classification-type understanding. If you have no fucking clue what epistemology means, Crash Course can help.But if you want to know about a specific person's ideas, SoL is way better every time. And their original content is lovely. I love Alain's ideas. Watch the episodes about the Rennaissance and you will understsnd the point of the channel and what it is trying to emulate. It is so amazing and cleverly done.
Two questions.   1.  What are your alternatives to a world with no purpose?It's not like we have definite proof what your purpose should be. You either have to find your own purpose or believe what someone else tells you your purpose is. There are no other options.   2. Why does the origin of your purpose even matter?You exist.  Leave the world a better place and enjoy the time you have here.  Find what makes you happy and how you can contribute to our world and do that.  
I would suggest to read "The Myth of Sisyphus" by Albert Camus, if you would like to explore the reasoning around this question in a little more detail :)
>I will always know that the purpose is something created, a fictional device, to help me cope with existence. Call me a cynic, but I don't think it's even that substantive.Usually, in practice, existentialism is just a post hoc rationalization for doing what the person was already internally motivated to do in the first place.
> I will always know that the purpose from my own will, and I know at its core, that it is phony. See, that's the problem...the things you create are the only things that *aren't* phony, *because* you've created them.  Why do you think we put such an emphasis on being "self made?"
And what is the truth of its origin?
I'm right there with you. I used to be a devout Christian, and even though life was still a struggle, I had something to anchor to. Now, I don't even think life is worth living. No "meaning" that I create will somehow negate all of the pain that comes with life. 
Damn, I'm saving this. You perfectly described what I've tried to tell people for years.
So... you'd rather believe in a phoney purpose that someone ELSE has made up? Makes sense
I think a good way of overcoming this is to find wonder in the fact that you even exist. It's so statistically unlikely that everything would fall in place to allow you an opportunity to simply be. There is joy to be found in knowing that you had the chance to experience happiness, love, sadness, etc. Even if it doesn't "mean" anything, it's still better than the alternative.
God, I hate MOR. People kept recommending it and finally I tried to read it. It's just like all other fanfiction. An obnoxious Mary Sue main character who doesn't speak like a real person. The world revolves around him, and everyone exists to make him look smart.
This reminds me of what Dilbert author Scott Adams said. >fairness isn't an objective feature of the universe. It's a concept that was invented so children and idiots can participate in arguments.[](/discordquite "Hmm, but what are the odds of that?")
The Web is the best place to learn about and discuss our existence from a philosophical perspective, in my opinion. I haven't found anyone in-person who has had an existential crisis. Probably because a lot of people are religious.
Is that so bad ? Nietzsche may not have been a nihilist; but nihilism was certainly a very important topic to him.You can play the edgy philisopher all you want, but there are enough litterature about Nietzsche being linked to nihilism that both his wand nihilism page mentions him as being a key philosopher for that specific school of thought.
This raised a question in my mind: should we interpret that freedom as altruism? 
I cannot speak for their other videos, but this one is actually fairly inaccurate. 
I haven't seen any of the other videos, but this one seems pretty decent to me. I just took a course on the philosophy of existentialism and found this video to be pretty accurate. Its only a quick subset and there is much more to be considered, but that's why its a crash course
I would argue that Sartre's view is off because he supposed that we do not have a human nature. Modern genetics has taught us a lot about behaviors that are inherited from our parents, so his argument there doesn't exactly hold up. He also likes to use Freudian psychology, which is outdated.
Any view is viable as long as it's well argued. Existentialism never really got disproven but rather it got out of fashion after a while. Most existentialists nowadays are often writers/artists rather then fully fledged philosophers.
One of my professors told this story in class.. I believe he went to war
I think that's where Sartre gets it a bit wrong: that we have no human nature. However, even with our external influences still being very powerful, we still are ultimately choose each and every one of our actions, and no one can actually force us to do anything.
Rules, yes. Purpose? hmmm
For every person who has actually learnt about Neitzsche's work, there's 10 people who overheard him being mentioned a couple of times and want to sound like they've learnt about him. Same for like everything.
He breezes too quickly over Kierkegaard and Camus, but I think the rest is fairly accurate, and a decent explanation of the general ideas. This is honestly where I started learning about it, and it's a good TL;DR.
I think the only way you could interpret Nietzsche as a nihilist is if all you read was the quote "God is dead and we have killed him." It's funny just how much Nietzsche has been misinterpreted after his death. First his sister tried to turn him into a Nazi sympathizer and now groups like Crash Course want to turn him into a nihilist.
> Leave the world a better placeAs though that's any easier to define than one's purpose.
I think I am just discussing the philosophy.  I have no issues going about my day with happiness, and treating the people around me well, but when the lights go out at the end of the day...I just haven't quite figured out how to properly cope with existential crises! 
But aren't they questioning the point of their motivations?
So what is your view on "purpose" and "meaning" and all of those sad ape questions?
he means the purpose he created from his own will is not universal - not everyone shares it - therefor not an ultimate truth/purpose thus kinda feels like a "fake" purpose.
That it is just my own construct. It is like saying "sorry" when you are not really sorry.  I might fool someone else, but I can't fool myself! 
That has to be almost the exact opposite message.The point of the Yudkowsky quote is that humans are amazing because we created the concepts of justice and fairness.Yours kinda seems to imply fairness is just a lie made to compensate the inferior.I am not downvoting, but I think Scott Adams might have an overly cynical world view.
The reason he mentions it so much isn't because he is a nihilist, but because he sees it as the greatest threat to humanity. He was absolutely not a nihilist himself.
I suspect that they are all likely equally bad. Hell this one claimed Nietzsche embraced Nihilism, despite him struggling desperately against it in all of his works. It's like how everyone trusts the news until they cover the one area where they are an expert and they see how much they got wrong, but then go back to viewing the news as credible when it covers every other subject.
How so? I'm actually interested in Existentialist beliefs and I'd like a credible source of material. 
> We exist to suffer. That is all.Suffering is the spring to action, it is not? When we touch a hot surface, we jerk our hand away. Clearly, we exist to accomplish the actions suffering impels us toward. How can an intermediate be an end? It cannot.
Anything that has function has purpose, does it not? That purpose being the function itself. Human beings might struggle to find their own personal purpose and function, but the universe at large has function. For example, the function of gravity is to create orbit and collect matter to form stars and planets. So in the same sense, the purpose of gravity is also to create orbit and collect matter to create planets and stars
BUT THESE ARE PEOPLE MAKING A PHILOSOPHY VID MAN
> there are always choices in front of us, the agony of choice is common to the human condition, occasional disappointment is part of it but not inevivatble Not inevitable?  What does this mean?
Don't overthink it. Here's a start:     * Help those who are in need, to the best of your ability.    * Speak authentically.    * Practice compassion.    * Give others the benefit of the doubt.Not an exhaustive list but any one of these things would leave the world a better place.
No one ever does but I find solace in knowing that I'm working on leaving a better world behind even if at the end of the day the world doesn't care. I care therefore I am (or something...). 
No, they're just following their motivations and acting as if there's conscious intention behind them.
Am I missing something here?  Isn't the "purpose" the survival of your genes?People overthink these things.
Isnt that the point of existentialism? The idea that there is no universial truth, and therefore there is no meaning in life. 
You are not lying to yourself when you imbue the world with purpose; like Sarte would say, you are the inventor, so invent. How, I would ask, is being an inventor of my meaning--something only capable of coming from my self--on par with being a liar?
How would you characterize philosophers studying nihilism ?Which philosophers would then be nihilist ?If I remember well, the reason Nietzsche is considered a nihilist is because of Heidegger's interpretation of Nietzsche's work which he sees as the pinnacle of nihilism.
I'm sorry, but I'm not very good at philosophy. What's wrong with this statement? Isn't that pretty close to the basic definition of nihilism?
Clearly you've never met an objectivist.
I care therefore I am... I like that. Unfortunately there are a lot of people that don't care who also seem to, be.
Man, the illusion of control is really confusing. 
That's the saddest most pathetic motivation I can imagine. Yet for too many people, you are probably right.
Your body's capacities are not your "purpose".
But still though. Let's say that you think your life is important enough to you that you should not be murdered. If someone comes around and thinks that your life is important enough to be murdered/ended, then how are you supposed to apply a form of justice?I'm assuming here that that person and you would be otherwise "good" people.
>How would you characterize philosophers studying nihilism ?They can be characterized as philosophers studying nihilism. But that doesn't make them nihilists, just like how Marx is not a capitalist because he studied capitalism. 
But that just begs the question, 'what's wrong with facing values?'
They fucked up socialism for a bit too.
As it should. The course is often fairly inaccurate in ways that are not demanded for the sake of simplicity. The course should be avoided.
Yes, but Nietzsche was *critiquing* that fall into nihilism, not at all embracing it. 
I gave away all my bootstraps in acts of compassion and now I have nothing to pull myself up by ;_;
Try reading some Heidegger. You might enjoy it. Discusses care as the defining property of being. Lack of care is still in relation to care. I don't fully get it but it was interesting 
If you want to look at people who live what you see as distasteful lives - you'll find that they fit poorly into any philosophy you wish to assign.  What the implications of that are is an answer I don't really have.  But whether you think meaning is ordained or self-determined, douchebags are douchebags.  Which is worse?  That a douchebag is pre-ordained to achieve nothing but piss other people off?  Or that they do it themselves through apathy/ignorance/whatever? To be is to be.  To choose to care is great.  
I would say it's a subconscious motivation.  I don't think it's "sad" or "pathetic" either.  It's the reason your ancestors were here and ultimately the reason why you're here.
You could name it something else and not really see how it affects your thoughts and behaviour but still it would be there in the background.
If someone finds it important enough to murder someone, then he must accept that there are people that find it important enough to stop him from murdering and punish him if he does murder. That is how you apply justice, because society has created a set of morals, or laws, that we must follow and people that go against those morals must be held accountable. 
Yeah, just answer the second part of the question without answering the first one. By your definition there is **NO** nihilist philosopher.And the downvote, what bullshit behavior.
Consensus != Truth. 
Not now, VSauce, not now.
Is there a "better" option out there that anyone reading this would recommend?
Also not very good at philosophy. How do you know he was critiquing it? Reading this quote -and nothing else- sounds blatantly nihilistic. I don't doubt you at all, I am just wondering how you know that. Which one  of his works is what I'm asking I guess.  
Lol I am not sure I get it either. Pizza is the defining property of being, lack of pizza is still in relation to pizza. 
I don't see how my being here as a result of it makes it at all a compelling argument. It isn't as though they did me a favor that I should be grateful for. If anything it is a compelling argument for why it is a bad idea.
The problem is conflating purpose in the human psychology sense with purpose in the "your body has evolved to be capable of this" sense.
The murderer can just as easily claim that since there is no objective morality, then he cannot be brought to stand trial since the court does not use/uphold an objective form of law.
Excluding special knowledge, expert consensus is as close to the truth as we're gonna get on specialized issues such as this one. Do you think you have a better way of finding truth?
Im not a big fan of lying to kids because the truth might be too hard. They may never go any farther and are stuck believing falsehoods forever.
It's completely misinforming the layman.
> I am a pile of atoms that can think and feel.I really don't mean to troll or be mean but I just can't understand how such a nonsensacle statment could be considered "closest to reality".
It's not a problem though is it.  There's a field dedicated to it called Evolutionary Psychology.  Seems kind of obvious to me.  
I'm not saying a consensus of expert opinions/findings isn't the truth. I'm just saying that you can't immediately assume that *because* there's a consensus on something that therein lies the truth. It's a logical fallacy. Experts are experts because of the amount of knowledge they have, and there does need to be a trust that the experts in their fields know what they're talking about, but you should always look at the arguments/findings/evidence/data and see whether or not it holds up. 
Thank you for explaining this so well. I already knew it, it just makes me happy when Nietzsche is explained correctly.
That sounds really nice actually, I might try to read more about it.
Here in turkey we have mandatory philosophy at grades 11 and 12, however it's awful... We do more memorizing than actual thinking :(
What would you propose we remove from the current curriculum to supplant it with philosophy? Or, are you proposing we add it on top of everything else? Please do not read my comment as having a nasty tone. I'm writing this in an inquisitive and polite tone. :-)
I place as much faith in the Canadian education system to teach me philosophy, as I did in their ability to teach me french.That is to say, not very well. VHS tapes of talking pineapples can only do so much.
Why are people with philosophy degrees so convinced that no other fields use or teach logic?
While definitely a much needed and beneficial subject I think that if the school system does begin to enforce it the subject will be taught very poorly and not in the intended manner. It's a subject that requires caution to teach but if taught well can be greatly rewarding. 
School districts in the US are still battling over teaching something as fundamental as evolution and you think they can handle something as abstract as philosophy. Get real bro. 
except your example is seen in awkward adults on reddit. not in real life or in elementary school.
In my country it's mandatory in grade 11 to 13, and guess what? Nothing changes,  you can't  teach people how to think more that you can teach dolphins to talk.
Public schooling was never designed to get people to think for themselves.
In the full IB program they teach theory of knowledge for grade 11 and 12.
Why do you need philosophy if we can just have classes in rational discourse and logic?
Imagine how shitty the teachers would be though. 
The brain does not develop the higher order thinking skills required to explore "why", "how", and so on until around 6th grade.  Attempting to teach them before this age would not be useful for core education classes meant to build the educational foundation of a young person.However, I agree with you that it should be a class in high school.  Kids with opinions are like trump supporters with guns.  
I'm taking philosophy right now and it's one of the most engaging classes I've ever taken 
Holy shit, no.  While I love philosophy and while it was fun in college, I don't want my kids wasting time on it in k-12 education.  This is like saying gaming should be taught in school because you enjoy it.
If we stick to the ideas of teaching philosophy as in logic, reasoning, and critical thinking, then yes, I'm 100% on board. I would be surprised if many teachers didn't already feel that they are attempting to teach those things. Teaching the history/field of philosophy as you might in an undergrad college course, though, I'm not so sure.
I've been studying Philosophy for 2 years in high school in Italy (this one will be the last one). It's a useless subject here. The only thing you learn is "he said this and this". Nothing else. Teachers don't teach you how some people thought,but what, and it is just completely useless in this way. You would say "it depends on the teacher", but every single one from my school teaches in the same way. Why am I supposed to memorize what someone 200 said? It's not learning to listen to the others, but consider some ideas better and superior than other.
assuming that the system is interested in creating critical thinkers...which it most certainly is not
The kind of philosophy I've seen is not appealing to me at all. I'm all for a class that teaches real critical thinking and rationality, but philosophy seems to be about something else altogether.
We already get those lessons through other subjects. Math/Science teaches logic, English/public speaking teaches fallacies and argumentative logic, and social studies teaches effects of the group on the individual. The lesson is there, just not as obvious as you'd like.
I've been saying this over and over again ever since I started reading philosophy on my own time. We learn or memorize information in the states, but philosophy can train your mind to reason properly and discover new things.
As is the case for all Turkish classes. In Literature class, the exams outright ask us "what are the 5 attributes of this very specific type of ottoman poetry" and the university entrance exam mostly consists of "from which writer's book was this exerpt taken from?"We need a major rehaul.
Turkey's education system is crap. It rewards diligence but not critical thinking. 
One semester (or year) of English. There's already four years of that in high schoool (at least where I'm at). And all the most critically important skills from English class carry *directly* over into philosophy.I can personally confirm that one Intro to Ethics class made me a far better reader and writer than sitting through yet another semester of Shakespeare.
English literature. We don't need to have 4 mandatory years of reading fiction.
My thought exactly. I learned my logic from being a "math" kid. Philosophy is a great for things like forming arguments, but things the American public deem more important can teach that just as well (history, english)
OP's pretty young. I think they meant to emphasize "logic" in more of a spoken argument sense, promoting critical thinking outside of STEM classes.
In high school? They kinda don't. You can intuitively pick up some good reasoning skills and such by studying other things, obviously. But a direct look at formal logic, induction vs. deduction, analysis, rhetoric, a peek a game theory, etc. would be useful for everyone. OP has a point.
Schools are struggling in the US just to graduate kids that can read and write, much less do math. Get real, indeed :(
I actually don't see a link between the two. You can push for both at once. Evolution is being blocked for a completely different reason (ideology). 
Speak for yourself. 
Also the example is wrong.  Of course illegial aliens take jobs from American citizens.
It was designed to sort out elites from everyone else, which it still does pretty well.  That is changing, however...the people are demanding equity.  The elites are fighting to keep the system intact, which is why you see all the standardized tests with normalized scores and "school of choice" stuff. It's a system that produces castes and divides the population into groups which are easier to manipulate. 
> Why do you need philosophy if we can just have classes in branches of philosophy?  seriously though those are basic branches of philosophy... Your question makes no sense.
Hm, I didn't think of that. I'll look more into that later and might change my opinion to 6-12. Do you think there is a way you could "plant the seeds" at a younger age though?
What philosophy have you engaged with ? 
This reminded me of the university entrance exam in Ukraine. One of the questions was "What shoes did the wife of the main character wear when she went to the market?".
Well seeing as the Turkish government rewards diligence and not critical thinking, I'd say the education system is working exactly as intended.
Oh man, we plagiarize almost religiously starting from middle school, like every single homework assignment is pulled from the internet :DAnd teachers don't care about *what* we turn in, as long as you spent time and effort... Like my teachers would criticize me for printing my homework even though I wrote the thing (just not by hand), and rain high grades upon those who could hand-write the highest amount of plagiarized bullshit...
Eh, math may not be the best way for this in my opinion, instead if they could teach *why* we do things (say, why 2+2 is 4) instead of just forcefully making students memorize things, people might start thinking more.
"Our bodies should metabolize Philosophy instead of matter!"
The ability to read and write well is something that is useful in nearly all career paths (not to mention in being a well rounded intelligent person).Instead we should stop foreign languages, which is useful in very few careers or lives (at least in America).
are you sure someone who says "where I'm at" couldn't benefit from some more English classes?
???Reading is core skill which America already lacks in high school graduates. 
I think logic itself should be taught as a class.Because some people can apply logic mathematically, or philosophically, and not vice-versa
Exactly, this is why it's not its own stand alone class. History and English do damn fine jobs of giving the basics of philosophy. You can't write an academic paper without logic, so English has you covered there. Famous philosophers influenced history and that's why them and their basic beliefs are taught in History. There's not enough school hours in the year to add in philosophy which is pretty superfluous in comparison to the other things that are taught. I'd make home economics mandatory again before I made philosophy mandatory.
"Can", but don't. If it's not among the standards, we aren't really supposed to be teaching it (nor do we have time to do so even if we decided to). What needs to happen is a standards overhaul that requires philosophical skills. If new standards are supposed to be about preparing students for the world as they're purported to be, then these skills should absolutely be included. As an English teacher, I try to incorporate philosophy as often as possible; however, as far as I know, I am the minority.
On the other hand it could be like my high school philosophy classes, reading pre-Socratic texts, then a little bit of Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Machiavelli, Rousseau, Kant, Foucault and Nietzsche.
In what way is 90% of what you teach in language logic and reasoning?  I'm not saying you are wrong but I can't help but think that there may be a disconnect between what you're defining as 'logic and reason' and what the OP is thinking of when it comes to philosophical discussion of what someone thinks and why.
Living in the Bible Belt, philosophy is also blocked for similar reasons. 
> It was designed to sort out elites from everyone elseElites don't need sorting. Public school was designed to sort out those who may be useful to the elite.
That's exactly what true maths is about. You start from the very basics, and then you build up your argument with sentences of which you can prove the truth. Even the logic is a branch of math and people could benefit very much from it.  There is a reason as to why almost all the brightest phylosophers in history were also brilliant mathematicians.
The stoics would like you. 
This is reddit... As far as I'm concerned, his statement doesn't contain any gross grammatical errors (though "all the most" instead of "all of the most" is kind of irritating). If he doesn't want to disclose his actual location, "where I'm at" is perfectly fine for casual conversation. 
As a non native english speaker, what's so wrong about saying "where I'm at"?
If you can't read by 12th grade then the system has already failed you.
When I took the upper level logic class taught by the Philosophy department it was a mix of Philosophy students, Math Students and Computer Science students.  So yeah lots of cross-over and there aren't many logicians (AoS Logicians at least) left in the Philosophy field. They seem to have been replaced by Philosophers of Science mostly. 
Have you ever studied philosophy at a university? There is so much that is left out of those history and English classes. Also I would argue that forming those arguments are just as important as learning how to form them. 
Being taught what the different logical fallacies are makes it easier to identify 1) when someone else is using them, and 2) when you are using them. Knowing they are being fallacious should allow people to step back and realize they need to reconsider their stance or approach to a problem. English, math, etc. don't teach people how to argue their point effectively, just how to do research and report on it. They are all one-way communications.
There's two types of "language" that is taught in school. The first type is spelling and grammer, which is mostly memorization. But the other type, that I'm assuming CherryTomatoGarden is talking about is reading literature and analyzing what the characters did and why, and very much teaches philosophy.
Yup. Hey kids, let's learn some Nietzsche today! It totally won't conflict with everything your parents have taught you.
Higher thought is basically blasphemy. Don't you dare throw in the words logic and reason! Went to a very, very strict Catholic school from grade 5 through 13, I know how that goes. 
Even just an intro involving rational discourse and logic?I mean obviously some authors would be blocked in areas like that... but everything?
there is reading, and then there is reading at a high school graduate level
I have, and I feel like my best high school English teachers did a better job teaching philosophy than my best college philosophy professors.
You're taught logical fallacies in English. At least I was in both middle and high school.
Kind of.  I am In a bilingual school.  Spelling and grammar in English is one thing, but a foreign language immersion requires the same mental skills as logic.  Add to that doing things as you described- reading, character study, social studies debate, etc.- doing all of that in the other language?  I really strive to challenge my kids not just to give me an answer, but to know why they gave it and be able to support it.
Really, I'm not sure what I'd think about Nietzsche being taught at a high school level, simply as a matter of difficulty.Keep it Greek. Highly beneficial, comparably accessible, less controversial.
Pretty much, yes. I've had parents complain just for mentioning I have a background in philosophy. 
Then you probably didn't have very good philosophy professors.
That is uncommon.
Good for you teaching your kids logic like that! I never quite got the whole foreign language thing myself, as a math and computer programming guy that part of my brain never clicked. And now my girlfriend speaks another language as her first language :P She speaks English almost as well as me though fortunately.
The Germans do definitely have a bit of an edge of controversy in them compared to the Greeks. 
Which is interesting considering the history of Christianity and philosophy, which has been close since.. when, Augustine? Aquinas at the latest. At some point some Protestant denominations seemed to ditch it. I wonder when and why.
Nice generalization.  How do you know it was "uncommon"?  How do you support that argument?  Are you using just your personal experience to generalize that all US students were taught like you were?  Or do you have supporting evidence?  
IMO certain Protestant denominations became so saturated with uneducated folks in poor rural areas that only a literal interpretation of the bible became acceptable because it was the easiest to understand. A lot of the religious philosophy then went out the window with any talk of symbolism or other abstract concepts. 
Just loads of personal experience and lots of daily evidence that the vast majority of people, including scientists, have little to no understanding of logic and fallacy. A quality philosophical education can help you identify such shortcomings. I've found most students in the us can't disect a sentence much less identify a fallacy. Find some evidence that it is common. I'd love to see it. I'm always happy to see education getting better.
Wow, that is appalling. I went to a Catholic (Jesuit) school, where the Theology class your junior year is Ethics, and you spend about equal time on Church doctrine and philosophical views. Plus there were several senior electives on philosophy. 
So, you can just tack on any philosopher and vaguely attach their writings to any tv show and place it in this subreddit?
Wow. Way to completely fumble the conclusion lol. These people are miserable and make everyone around them miserable. It's entertaining to watch but it is moral and practical deprivation of real fulfillment. They are in fact depraved and suffer for it. If somehow you saw any of this as positive you are the problem with our generation. 
I don't think I agree with anything from this video. I think it's a scripted tv show and if you're digging for a deeper meaning you can pick and choose moments that support your theory based on its 11 seasons. I think you could easily make the same argument with Friends or Seinfeld based on its longevity and picking moments. But then you could easily pair it with a different philosophy. 
Man springboards Nietzche and Heidegger through It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.  An exploration of moral philosophy and the nihilistic framework that makes up the TV show It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia.
>  Frank wants moneyI don't think Frank wants money. He has money, but he joins the gang because he misses living the sleazy life. Frank wants authenticity.
Charlie is arguably the smartest character. 
Username does not check outUnless oxen are some real cynical bastards
You should read "Philosophy of film" by Mary Litch. Convincing arguments that film/tv can and should be used as a springboard for big philosophical questions and propositions.  Keyword "springboard".  The idea that if it makes philosophy more accessible to students and even people who know nothing about philosophy, then its absolutely a noble pursuit.  Enlightenment is not for the 'chosen few'.  If  a more effective medium for educating has emerged, then this subreddit absolutely needs to see it!  I'm not totally disagreeing with you either though.  This video was vague.
This wasn't a bad explanation of Nietzsche imo, what did you disagree with?
I've also never seen a TV show or movie character pronounce Nietzsche's name properly. 
> While the OP makes The Gang out to be noble in the sense they are "authentic people"Haven't wastched the video but ....what? Mac for example is clearly delusional about himself, in almost every way (his fighting ability, his sexual orientation, his faith). And Dee has cripplingly low self-esteem. Charlie is constantly trying to pretend that he knows things (while being an idiot). And Dennis is constantly trying to deceive others (and himself) about who he is and how great he is. The only one with any claim to authenticity is Frank.
>If somehow you saw any of this as positive you are the problem with our generation.How's it like living in LaLa land?
To me that seems like absolutely valid/sound logic.  I guess I enjoyed the video for different reasons.  I read a book recently, Philosophy in Film by Mary Litch.  She proposed that film/tv can and should be used as a springboard for philosophical questions/propositions.  As a teacher, I'm happy to see the trend in video essays like these that explain ideas from multiple disciplines (Philosophy, Psychology, Sociology, etc.) Anything that makes academia accessible to a wide audience is brilliant to me.  
>Morality shouldn't exist and we shouldn't strive to follow our moral compass? Sounds like some nihilistic bullshit if you ask me.Sounds like dichotomous bullshit if you ask me.
thats not how i saw it at all.  I read a book, Philosophy Through Film by Mary Litch, where she absolutely persuaded me that film/tv can and should be used as a *springboard* for examining philosophical questions.  The keyword here is *springboard*.  I didn't see the video as an attempt at exposing a deeper meaning in the screenwriting,  I just saw it as an interesting attempt at making philosophy relevant and accessible to a wider audience than just philosophy students and professors. 
So then show which moments from the show are inconsistent with the interpretation in OP. Otherwise your argument doesn't work. 
Nietzsche and Heidegger*
I watched the episode where he calls for a gun protest in the city and buys shares in Gunther's Guns in order to make moneyBut on the other hand there is an episode where he says he wants to live in squalorHe is probably motivated by both
He definitely goes back and forth.  He coerces the group to let him in it and then he schemes and screws himself along the way, just like everyone else.
I don't think Charlie has ever shown desire for anything other than the waitress either. And my opinion is that Mac doesn't want strength, he is convinced he already has it. I don't think those characters in themselves are meant to represent anything 
Well then he's in the wrong place. Those assholes are in open denial about everything. Just because they're openly shitty doesn't mean they're any more authentic.It's like... If I combine the ingredients of a sandwich *before* I put them in my mouth, I'm not putting on airs, that's just how I like to eat my sandwiches.
That whole episode should be referenced if we're trying to figure out what the gang wants. I think its season 9 episode 6, the gang saves the day.
Authenticity isn't about intelligence, nor about what's doing what's best for you; it's about deciding your values and pursuits for yourself, perhaps even despite what's best for you. 
Scary thing is, I'm the least cynical of all the ox's. Source: I've personally met and know every ox
Uh, that there was no explanation of Nietzsche? This was crazy -- it was an account of "Nietzsche" indistinguishable from any modern philosopher. 
Steve Carell in Little Miss Sunshine does it in the first ten minutes.
Frank just wants to be pure.
Nah, man. Frank is constantly lying to rich people and poor people that he's one of them. He's neither, but he seems to be fully aware of that. 
> Haven't wastched the video but ....what?Your reply to the video's use of 'authentic' does not make any sense. This is obviously because you have no context since you did not watch it. Replying without any context merely enables you to create a strawman, which you have done. Just watch the video, it's short and answers this better than I am about to:OP uses the term 'authentic' in the sense that if stripped of all concerns about societal rules and norms, they are what many would be.
So you post it on the one subreddit populated by philosophy students and professors? :P
I didn't say there's no meaning but basing it off a "god is dead" and the evolution of the show is them becoming "the most authentic version of themselves" is in my opinion dumb. I agree that they are delusional arrogant and unintelligent. But in the video the guys like "it's easy to just throw around these words like narcissistic" and then claims it goes deeper? No, I don't think so.
Maybe English isn't his first language
Frank: I don't know if he wanted cash or something more sexual? Gets me every time, his delivery is flawless.
If anything, Mac wants respect/people to fear him.  The strength is just a way to make that happen.
Frank wants hot dogs.
I think it is good that they got across God is dead without connecting that to any grandiose metaphysical claims (which normal misinterpretations of Nietzsche often fall into), the fact that it is just a sociological statement and that it undermines the notion of truth.  That's distinctly Nietzschean and it is something most philosophers would oppose.
OK. I think OP has the wrong concept of "authenticity" then. Authenticity, in most existential literature, is a "living out" of one's true self. It's not a negative concept, merely not acting according to societial norms and values, although that usually happens as an offshoot. Either way, I'll stick with my original point. A person can act without concern for societal rules and norms in a wanton way that is nonetheless completely un-authentic from an existential perspective. 
I wonder if the show would have been as good as it is without him?
God is dead *is* a grandiose metaphysical claim in Nietzsche -- God is dead is part of the revaluation of all values. God is dead, and we have killed him. But will we rise to the occasion of needing to posit our values ourselves, in the knowledge that they are unfounded--except by force of our will? 
The argument is that they are the only ones that have been able to live life as their one true self because they have shed the societal skin that prevents normal people from doing so.I personally think that reasonably validates their authenticity claim.
Malkovich Malkovich?
Watch season one
Don't wonder, it would't have been. The gang "Glen, Rob and Charlie"really hit the jackpot with DeVito. Frank kinda enables the show to happen with his money and schemes there is a lot more shit to write about, if it wasn't for Frank the show would be flat just having him in the shot works. There is all kind of scenes where Frank is just idle playing like he understands whats going on and he just kills it.
I mean, do you like season 1? I think it was really strong. I agree it would've been a very different show and might have never gotten this popular but it would have still been good. 
Season one isn't as good as the rest but that's to be expected I think
I feel like Frank really opened up Charlie's character as well. Their partnership is a nice contrast to the Mac/Dennis duo.
It's really not bad, but not great. Charlie, Dennis and Mac are more or less the same characters they always are and are hilarious doing it. It hurts without having Frank, but the big thing holding it back is that Dee is relegated to the boring voice of reasons too much. Even when she does bad things, it sounds like she's really reluctant to do it and is out of character for her. When they started letting her improvise her character, her dialogue, etc. to sound more authentic, the show benefited *hugely* from it
Yeah, overall season one was more tame. Not worse, just less Sunny. I don't think it necessarily had to be DeVito, they just needed a 4th crazy person to amp things up. Although DeVito is a great fit, and his star power helped boost the show's ratings overnight.
When did they start doing that? I stopped watching this because Dee was too cringey and made me feel too sad...Source: am female
The reason tyrants love torture is precisely *because* it is immoral.    Think about it: you've got someone who's basically a decent man.  Once a tyrant gets him to the point where he tortures someone at the command of the tyrant, how can that man go back? How can he look himself in the mirror if he stops believing in the dictator? All the evil he's done will be for nothing. All the screams will haunt his nightmares for the rest of his life.  So he dares not stray.     Torture is not useful to tyrants because tortured men are honest, it is useful because the *torturing* man is loyal. 
My question is what is torture? Where does interrogation end and torture begin? Is sleep deprivation torture? Is getting them drunk? How do you put it on paper so that people know where the line is?
Arguments about morality are always kind of pointless in my opinion. As I see it, torture should be illegal for the same reason murder is illegal. Most people don't want to be murdered, so they make laws to protect them. By the same measure, most nations don't want their people to be tortured, so they agree amongst themselves to not torture. Terrorist groups are a grey area since they refuse to follow the rules, but given that there is little to be gained by torture and doing so undermines the international standing of any nation that practices it, it's pointless.
What distinguishes torture from garden-variety causing of suffering? Let's assume that forms of treatment known as torture could be undergone voluntarily, like other forms of suffering are undergone voluntarily.
If you think torture works, ask anyone involved in an interrogation during the 2001 invasion of Iraq.
It doesnt at all note why torture is always wrong regardless of the effectiveness,  it just claims "christian ethics" say it is. I am personally against torture but lets not kid ourselves: Effectiveness and whether alternatives are available are absolutely a part of its ethics. If someone is known to possess information about something specific that could kill hundreds,  of course it is at least vaguely justified,  but if you are torturing them just for unknown information, i think not. 
If two men kidnap your five year old child, and you manage to catch the one not taking him away, would you not torture him to find out where the other is going? I'm certainly not gonna wait several hours or even days for him to crack to the police. Absolute nonsense that people think torture wouldn't be reasonable when it could save lives.We found Osama through torture, so it must be decently effective.
I'm sorry, but I don't care what they do to the terrorist bastards. They have given up their right to human decency and life by supporting and condoning acts so terribly evil. If torture will help gather intelligence that will help us kill more of them, I am all for it.
It's about saving lives. Are you willing to let someone be uncomfortable, in pain, or in extreme pain (but no lasting physical harm) for the sake of getting information that could save lives, including your own or your family? Or, do you prefer letting innocent people die, because of your fear or principal of not inflicting temporary pain on a criminal? Example, if 9/11 attacks could have been prevented by waterboarding (saving 3,000 lives), would you have done it? The answer should be obvious. 
Debating the philosophy of torture during war time is hilarious somehow. Were sending people overseas to kill and die, but don't torture, no that's too far. 
But there has to be a certain point where torture is justifiable, right? Like say we know that a terrorist has information that, if obtained, will save several innocent lives from a bombing or something. Is it still wrong to torture him then? I would argue that the torture that is grief that the families of the innocents will have to endure outweighs the physical torture that the terrorist will have to endure. 
>  He's starting with a whole set of loaded assumptions and a fixed idea of what constitutes a moral good. So are you. You seem to have dismissed deontological reasoning with a wave of the hand.And the trolley problem is very much not a dilemma. It is meant to explore whether personal agency has a place in ethics. 
I never understood why "the greater good" was a valid argument in cases like this. How is two people being tortured worse than one person being tortured? Everybody feels pain individually. There isn't some collective where both of their pain goes and hence increases the burden of it. Whether 1,000,000 people are being tortured or 1, the effect is the same on each individual. It's a constant, not a sum that gets increased with each person.I'd rather just not bring evil into the world, even if it could hypothetically help others. I'd still be a source of evil.
Good post and way to reframe the argument. I would also point out that torture as done now by the US involves increasing the amount of stress experienced by subjects. Sleep deprivation, playing Britney Spears on repeat at max volume for 30 straight hours etc. gone are the medieval devices like in the picture.   
The ticking bomb scenario on 24 just isn't reality is the thing. Torture isn't used to prevent future crimes. The 1000 page CIA torture report showed they gained nothing.Not to mention you are then trusting (usually unelected) powerful people to decide which people have fallen below a level of morality deserving of humane treatment. It's not sustainable, and it will always lead to abuse.
If you have undeniable facts that say torturing a person will save lives, then is wrong for the person being tortured not to volunteer.After all, life is held highest. Waterboarding isn't death. If you only need be water boarded a couple times to save a few thousand lives, thats amazing.Here in lies the problem. Where is the proof that torture saves any lives? None, because it doesn't.Just as US national wide internet surveillance doesn't serve any purpose other than making the working class population into slaves and market manipulation.Here, the means do not justify the ends.
Sometimes I wonder if water-boarding will be considered torture once ISIS starts doing it to captured US troops.  
It sounds like you're describing Stockholm Syndrome.
this is not a good comparison because the *purpose* of the U.S. prison system is not really to "inflict suffering on people." "Retribution" is only one of the goals of correction systems and typically in the US, incapacitation and deterrence are stressed as primary objectives above rehab and retribution. You can't just say "by definition" and then use a half-truth. 
> The best example of non-controversial torture is the U.S. prison system. By definition, it is a form of torture, as its purpose is to inflict suffering on people in response to crimes.Umm, the primary purpose is to isolate dangerous criminals from the population. 
Is it always better to kill one to save many? How many? Ought you kill your mother to save two random people? Or a hundred?This is one line of reasoning which speaks against a certain type of moral theory called *consequentialism*, which basically has it that what determines whether an action is morally right or not is its effects or consequences. These types of theories are very popular, both amongst philosophers and amongst regular folks, but are rife with problems which may lead you to reject them.
> How do you put it on paper so that people know where the line is?Can the line be defined?Force feeding me bacon sounds like a fantasy come true. It might not be so much for a religious Muslim.
In my view, torture is next-level prolonged suffering as a form of punishment, and/or cruel and unusual forms of execution (popular in medieval times). Like being broken on the wheel, boiled/burned alive, or crucified... Sometimes those events took hours, or even days to kill someone - not quick, or dare I say, humane like electrocution or lethal injection. Nobody (in their right mind) is going to volunteer for that. I think we're hard-wired with a sense of self-preservation that wouldn't allow it.
Police would likely be far more effective in preventing/prosecuting crime if they had CCTV cameras in every room in every person's house, but any reasonable person would find that gain irrelevant compared to the intangible value of privacy.The same argument can be put forth here.
This sub is so tiring. This is an academic discipline and that means a lot of the work needs to be understood before it can be engaged with. Christian ethics is a set of rule based ethics. Effectiveness does not matter to them, at all. They don't mention it for that reason. 
Well the argument against nuts in a vice is that a captive will say anything at that point to avoid further torture. IIRC there have been studies done on this that conclude that information gathered during torture is generally inaccurate.
How so? Just because you're allowed to kill people under certain circumstances doesn't mean that you can torture them, just like how killing combatants in battle is different from killing prisoners.  
> Like say we know that a terrorist has information that, if obtained, will save several innocent lives from a bombing or something. Is it still wrong to torture him then?Probably not.  But...> we know that a terrorist has information that, if obtained, will save several innocent lives from a bombing or something....how can you ever know that with 100% certainty?  Even if the guy says "I planted a bomb in a school", how can you know?  Maybe he's just a whack job and you end up torturing a mentally ill person.  
I read it and found it deeply not interesting. I hanged on with Adams for a long time. God's Debris was so good, I hoped he was reading something in Trump that I was missing. I've concluded he was wrong, and I was wrong for hoping. I think he's just insulated from reality.
Adams really needs to stick to engineering and unfunny comic strips.
On the subject of a root canal vs. Torture, there is a fairly simple distinction despite both of them being painful things that could lead to a positive outcome. Namely, that a root canal is undergone willingly by the subject, whereas torture is not. Most people have some deontological intuitions that compel them to place a high amount of value on autonomy.
> and reduces ourselves to the level of our enemies. At that point, we have no moral leverage to distinguish ourselves, or explain why we consider ourselves in the right.I'm having trouble following you here. We're talking about the (im)morality of torture, and this to me sounds like you're saying "well maybe it is morally right, but we shouldn't do it because that would be immoral like the bad guys". I'm missing something, I assume?
"At that point, we have no moral leverage to distinguish ourselves" Of course we do. We're doing it to save the lives of innocent people, ISIS for example does it to commit terror, rape and kill women, kids, etc... There's a clear difference. Trust me when I say this, there would be many more innocent civilian deaths if intelligence agencies didn't use torture against people who not only deserved it but against the exact same individuals that have information which can lead to the deaths of innocent people. 
> It is meant to explore whether personal agency has a place in ethics.This is a bit of an assertion, if you read JJ Thompson you'll see that there are many explanations for why it is good to pull the switch.It is also still a dilemma, something like a fifth of philosophers state they would not pull the switch.
The goal of torture has similarly departed from the medieval times.  This isn't torture to wring out some coerced confession, or anything along those lines.  It's used specifically for gaining corroborating, actionable intelligence.  There's a significant difference.
...or sticking them in a box where they can't move and have to sit in their own piss and shit. That's not much better than the device that is in the picture.
Water-boarding was done by the Japanese on Allies (and civilians) during WW2, and was roundly and unequivocally condemned, including by the US.
I think ISIS will continue with the whole burning people alive in cages and mock executions. Water boarding isn't creative enough. 
No they don't just torture our troops. They behead them and behead civilians. 
I don't think you're fully clear on what Stockholm Syndrome is.Stockholm Syndrome refers to the specific case in which a hostage develops an affinity for their captor. The above situation is just referring to how individuals, when instructed to commit deplorable acts, have to believe in the individual instructing them to do so, because their entire world would collapse upon them if they didn't. 
Retribution and deterrence are only distinct in motive, not in effect. Both are about inflicting suffering.Rehabilitation isn't even worth addressing because that isn't actually something that the prison system does.Incapacitation only makes sense for lifers. For people who eventually will be released, you are releasing them as more hardened criminals than they were when they went in.
Prison systems don't get designed by accident. I can only assume that their effects are derived from the intentions of the people who hold absolute power over the prisons.Also, the effects that I've described are indistinguishable from acts that would be considered torture when applied to terrorist suspects at Gitmo.
Okay let's say torture is morally wrong no matter what. Now consider someone has a code to preventing the detonation of a nuclear bomb and you can only get the code by torturing him.  Should I torture him or not? 
Do you think it's just an arbitrary quantitative divide from suffering? For example, if someone is merely imprisoned, that might cause them terrible suffering. But on the same continuum, making a little kid wait for hours in a room might cause them suffering. Where does it become torture? I'm afraid the distinction often seems to involve disgust and gore, which might help explain why waterboarding isn't so much condemned and TV personalities even volunteer for it without understanding.
>Police would likely be far more effective in preventing/prosecuting crime if they had CCTV cameras in every room in every person's houseThat is still based on sacrifice/gain, though. Stopping power of crime vs personal privacy.
thats why theres further follow up torture sessions. but even if half of the information gathered is not accurate thats still half thats useful. where as you're likely to get little or no information at all using other methods. 
There's plenty of training offered on enhanced interrogation- but most of its illegal now although it was used as we all know after 9/11. I'm not trying to say that the US is torturing people or tells other people to do it. Is there a torturing type? Yes, they look like middle aged nice guys. You know the interrogators when you see them.
I see no difference between the two. 
That's conflating criteria of justification with decision-making procedures, though. It's useful to keep them distinct. 
If somebody is stating that they have a bomb, you ask them where the bomb is so you can save lives. If they don't give you an answer, you make them give you an answer. Torturing would be the most effective. "Maybe he's just a whack job and you end up torturing a mentally ill person."If he/she were to be a "whack job" i'm sure you can distinguish them from an actual threat. Besides that a lot of these people who commit mass killings for example, are mentally ill/whack jobs... therefore, you don't take chances. You don't play with lives. 
Holy shit.  "Climate change is a hoax because Trump is an expert bullshit detector."  Yeah, I agree with you, dude needs to stick to his comics.
How about legally mandated vaccines vs torture? Most would argue that the outcome is a greater good, for a majority - even if the subject may be unwilling.
It's a bit of a stretch saying it doesn't work. Doing nothing but feeding a prisoner certainly does not work in getting information, torturing might get biased or wrong information but eventually in some cases will get actual good information that could not have been obtained otherwise. Think about this, if torture was so ineffective, why did humans keep inventing new forms of it during the centuries? Just Sadism doesn't cut it.
You don't just onto a philosophy subreddit and say "Trust me when I say this"
If you can get out of it it isn't a dilemma. Dilemmas don't have solutions. But many philosophers do. The reason the trolley problem is brought up is because it is obvious how the utilitarian would behave. 
You didn't answer my initial question. You just repeated it sardonically. Multiple people dying in a crowd is worse because of the effects it has on those who lived. People become scared that they might be victims, they might have been hopeless having seen so many people die, and those effects cascade into other areas.If two people are killed in isolation, and nobody knows about it, what actually makes two worse than one? (Spelling it out in arithmetic isn't an answer.)
Yes actually it is. Would you rather loose sleep in your own piss for a few hours or have nails driven into you? 
I wonder why they like doing that to others now, then?  Very strange.  Have they forgotten how horrible it is?  They should administer an annual waterboarding exam for everyone.  It should be like getting a drivers license.
Are you saying that justifies our use of waterboarding?
> Rehabilitation isn't even worth addressing because that isn't actually something that the prison system does.I like prison documentaries. I have watched a lot of them now. This statement is wrong.
That's a good question, and not one I have a good answer to. Every moral theory has its objections, and they often are the dual of the objections to their rivals (so the benefit of consequentialism is its ability to count for this case, but its defect  is telling you to kill one to save two (or slightly more)).
> and you can only get the code by torturing him.Statements like that destroy hypothetical situations.  How did you determine he has the code, that *only* he has the code, and that there is no other option?Now, if you *really* want to get into people's minds about the topic, use the same situation from the premiere episode of the Shield.  Vic, a police officer, tortures a guy suspected of kidnapping a little girl and they have to find her before she dies from hunger/thirst/etc.  In the end, Vic gets the location and they save the girl.  Was Vic right?
But is there any level of criminality that would make you find such prevention method acceptable?That's the point I'm trying to convey - most people would never find that acceptable no matter what the risk, so it's not really a sacrifice/gain balance.
But torture isn't the only or most reliable interrogation technique.
Bullshit because torturing would not get you the information quick with a 100% success rating. Much more likely either A. He'll say whatever gets the torture to stop, wether its true or not be damned or B. May not even break and would die sooner then breaking, or just outlast the 20 minute mark. Hell, C. Could be that he may not even KNOW the code personally but youd never believe that answer from him and keeo trying to torture a code out of him that inst there until he breaks and starts trying to tell you what you want to hear spittin out random digits
> is it moral to torture himNo. Based on your framing of the question, you're clearly a consequentialist, so I'll frame my answer that way: torture is demonstrably ineffective. Because it is bad but does not produce good, it is not justified.>is it moral not to torture himThis is even easier: yes. If torture is bad, then not-torture is good.
I'm willing to bet that the vast majority of tortures involve completely different circumstances
> It's useful to keep them distinct.As a philisophical exercise, I agree. But if people are coming here to think about current events critically, it's probably good not to glaze over parts and say "that's another topic for later". 
I have a bomb.  Are you going to come torture me?
Well that's where we get into areas where we discuss which principles are okay to use to subvert someone else's autonomy (combined with causing them incredible mental and physical trauma). Your example of mandatory vaccines falls under the principles of weak paternalism and welfare, and are also quite non-invasive principles. Not many systems of ethics, when explored fully actually think that torture is permissible. The only system that does, broadly speaking, would be consequentialism, and that category of ethical systems is plagued with problematic conclusions that most people can't accept.
I completely 100% disagree. They used torture during they centuries because A) they did not understand as much about psychology as us. B) sadismAnd c) entertainment ( which could fit under sadism) but im thinking more like gladiator- forced to kill or be killed ( i would consider this torture)
Yes, they have forgotten. Or more accurately, they never knew in the first place.  I'm not sure if you realize, but there are very few people still alive who experienced WWII. The youngest of those would be in their late 80s. 
No, just that they are already using 10x more brutal methods, both physically and mentally. 
Ah, that's a much more realistic scenario.  You tell me,  was Vic right? How would someone who isn't a consequentialist explain this? That he was wrong and should have done it anyway? 
> But is there any level of criminality that would make you find such prevention method acceptable?Yes. If the police were 100% trustworthy and 20% of the local population were serial killers. Saying that, in every room is still overkill, and you would just move out.
Stick to the scenario. Assume he will not give up the information in any other way, otherwise the experiment is flawed as we havent controlled for all variables.
Its a hypothetical. Just answer the question properly based on those assumptions.
That doesnt matter, this is a theoretical mind experimental to see whether or not torture is ever moral. Its often useful to look at the extremes to test our views on morality.
I'd shoot you, blow you up, i'll try to cause as least amount of deaths as possible. If you planted an explosive, then i'd torture you to find out where. So I save/protect as many people as possible. 
So you are saying not once in human history a prisoner has "spilled the beans" under torture. Those are some top quality prisoners if I may say so.
Assuming that's true, what's your point?
> You tell me, was Vic right?He was right as in the guy did actually kidnap the girl and they did rescue her.  Right morally?  I'd say no, because they didn't know 100% he took her.
...What?What the fuck does that have to do with *anything*?
In this scenario, torture could be used to save an insane amounts of lives, which is why I'd go for that option.In the real world, it isn't as much of a no brainer, as a situation like this is immensely unrealistic  and torture would never be the only or best method of gaining information. So I'm still 100% against using torture in the real world.
Just gonna say I agree with Sirus and share his/her frustration that nobody is capable of answering questions in a vacuum when they don't like the answer.  Wait does vacuum have one c or two
Regarding he president he's actually talking about how contrived the scenario is.  It's basically porn.
> I'd shoot you, blow you up, i'll try to cause as least amount of deaths as possible.Least amount of deaths... that would be zero.  Yet you just said you'd shoot me and blow me up because of a sentence I posted on reddit.> If you planted an explosiveAnd if I didn't, you'd torture me anyway to find out?  I just told you I had a bomb.  According to you, that's enough to torture me.
See: Michael Fay, Caning, Singapore
>"It's not good therefore it's bad" is not judgment based on outcome.You didn't say that. You said "It is bad but does not produce good", meaning that you think it is bad but cannot be justified by it being good. Of course, you could still believe that if it produced good it is still bad regardless of the good. Note I posed two questions originally:"Is it moral?" and "Is it immoral not to?" which do not mean the same thing. An action could be both immoral and immoral not to do it, in my opinion.
" Yet you just said you'd shoot me and blow me up because of a sentence I posted on reddit."You're a bit illiterate, or maybe just have a bad memory. You stated that "if [you] had a bomb on [you]," I was referring to that. "And if I didn't, you'd torture me anyway to find out? I just told you I had a bomb. According to you, that's enough to torture me."I stated that if you claimed to have or the intelligence claims that you have, and you don't willingly give directions,you'd be tortured until things are settled. 
I think this has been done already. There is no such thing as a "100% success rating" for any form of interrogation.What kind of interview/interrogation tactics have you been trained in, if I may ask?
You said...> **If somebody is stating that they have a bomb**, you ask them where the bomb is so you can save lives. If they don't give you an answer, you make them give you an answer. Torturing would be the most effective. I then stated...> I have a bomb. According to you, that is enough to torture me.  You said it.  So, come torture me.
>if I may ask?None, and it doesnt matter if there is a 100% success rate or not (Obviously it is garbage): you fundamentally misunderstand the point of the question. The question is there to confirm whether or not the morality of the act is based on the consequences or the act itself. From your other comment it seems you are a consequentialist like I am, where some people in the comment section think the opposite and believe even if it was garenteed to work it is still the wrong choice.
>Yes. And in any case, man is not omniscience, so you've created an actual impossible scenario.It doesn't matter, you still just confirmed that you think the basis of the morality of torture is still based on its effectiveness and the potential gain from it, meaning you disagree with the guy who critiqued my original comment.>There's in fact no way to know if the analysis is correct because man is omniscience, so your position results in it being impossible to judge the morality of an act.This is an entirely different set of questions, though.
I was playing along the narrative that you initiated. You stated that you had a bomb, I stated/insinuated that if that was the case in a real life situation, i'd shoot you or if you planted the bomb somewhere, i'd try to find out where by torturing you, while other intelligence is committing their time to find out other intel. 
I don't think we should do anything to animals we wouldn't want an advanced alien race doing to us. Switching to lab grown meat should be both an environmental and moral priority.
I've felt for quite a while that this is what future generations will judge us most harshly for. The history of ethics is the history of people expanding their concern for living entities less and less like themselves: other people -> other families -> other tribes -> other nations/races -> other creatures.
Killing and eating animals isn't the problem, it's the fact that so many of them are raised in conditions that should qualify as torture.
The supposition that conditions are cruel for all livestock is wrong.I have bought chicken from a local farmer.  They also raise hogs and turkeys.  They exhibit great care for their livestock, in part because they're good people, but also because an animal (or plant for that matter) raised in a caring manner tastes better.  I have seen these animals, and they have good lives.I'd also refer you to the episode with Blue Hill Farm from 'A Chef's Table' on Netflix.  It reinforces the idea that thoughtfully produced food is humane and tastes better.Only problem is that it's more expensive.
What if in the future we embrace another truth; that all things die and that the only moral judge is the hand that holds the sword?I don't advocate for wanton murder, I only assert that the belief in dogmatic morality is filled with variables. If in the future we do things differently that's fine. Today we do things because they make sense to us now. We cannot do things that make sense in the future, in the same way that we cannot do things that make sense in the past. We can only do the things that make sense now.
Tbh switch to eating insects, good source of protein (and among other things) and easy to take of, space efficient and less of an animal cruelty issue. I'd fuck with insects.
bring on the lab grown meat.  If it costs the same and tastes the same, Im totally down for it.Im sure the "real thing" will remain highly sought after as a status symbol.
Lab grown meat would be wonderful. However, I don't see how it's going to work without creating antibiotic resistant bacteria and/or work at all once they become resistant (which is already happening). We already use tons of antibiotics and that's with animals with their own immune systems. My understanding is that to culture animal cells it is necessary to include antibiotics so bacteria don't take over.Please let me know if they have sound some way around this. I haven't looked into it I'm just going by what I know about how human cells are cultured in labs.
Nobody needs lab grown meat, you all just need to eat vegetables and beans more. Lab grown meat is still going to be significantly less healthy than a proper low meat high fiber diet. People were never 'meant' to eat meat everyday, especially as a main entree to the meal.  You'll still be wasting money and clogging up your vascular system. People should eat meat maybe 3 times a week at most and that should include fish. 
I agree but would want the lab grown meat to be tested long term before I made the switch. I could see some little chemical that is "harmless" from this new meat somehow having a horrible effect years down the road. Otherwise I am all for it. I love animals and I feel they should be treated with respect and love. And it pains me to realize the horrors they go through just for us to eat something we enjoy. 
But how safe is it? I've never even heard of "lab-grown meat".
The same should apply to unborn humans.
The stability brought by peace and non-aggression between humans is beneficial for the progress of our species. There is no such benefit in being kinder towards animals. It feels good to think about being kinder to animals, but doing it has negative economic consequences (opposite consequence of being peaceful with fellow humans), so I'm not really surprised we're not doing it.
Though I completely agree with you for today. What about when we are capable of making all of those produce items in a lab with no death. I am all for hunting but only if you are going to eat it. If you could go get venison for the same price would it not be cruel to go hunting for simply the sport?
And yet vegetarians continue to be shamed/questioned for their values and choices.
Of course you don't see many farmers taking anti-cruelty positions- their livelihood depends on it. That's like saying you don't see many CEOs being pro-labor.
Then people will complain only the rich can afford to eat meat, while the poor become malnourished. And if the tax is high enough, you will create a black market in meat just as with other goods in demand. 
At this moment in time it is not a luxury. It is however an intricate form of culture that will change and adapt very slowly despite taxation. In fact if you taxed this and took away such culture you would be in trouble..
I see what you're saying, but I disagree.  Killing and eating animals isn't a problem...if it is necessary for your survival.  Our society affords us ease of access to all foods, so it is hard to see the moral side of killing any animal for food these days.  It isn't necessary for our species to survive.
This is a fair point that I agree with. Factory farms do not treat animals well for efficiency. If we can improve conditions that to me is a fair compromise.
>Only problem is that it's more expensive. It's not really more expensive if you think of it this way: Hey buddy this chicken usually costs you $10/lb, but if you let me torture it, I'll knock off a couple bucks. I have no problem eating meat. My issue is with the cruelty that occurs when it is mass produced.  I try to buy from local farms or hunt it myself whenever possible.  In my mind those animals had "happy" lives and were killed in a relatively stress-free environment. 
I can grant that some farms are not as cruel as others. But do you think animals do not suffer on smaller, local farms? Or do they just suffer less than on other farms?
> It's clear these beings, despite not being conscious, actively **wish** not to be hurt. That is not clear at all. A defense mechanism does not require thought or calculation, only evolution which does not require consciousness, which plants obviously lack.> I believe this to be a right provided to a stronger specie of animal So there would be nothing ethically wrong with a more advanced alien species coming to Earth and torturing, enslaving and consuming mankind for enjoyment?
The plant argument is self-defeating. If plants were somehow ethically relevant, then it stands to reason we should reduce their consumption. Feeding plants to animals and then eating the animals is clearly worse than eating the plants.
You are also strong enough to eat children
Why do I even bother coming on this subreddit when the "philosophical" "discussion" is of this quality?If this was a chess game you would've just thrown all of the pieces on the floor and declared victory because *arbitrary*
> I am strong enough to devour lesser plants and animals, I enjoy eating them, so I eat them.And that's a fine, internally consistent justification, as long as you can also live with the fact that if that is your right, any more advanced civilizations that meet us will also get to consider those same rights vis a vis enslaving or harvesting us.
But, just like our ancestors, cruelty is not the way to slaughter an animal. The kill should be clean and swift. The upbringing of animals shouldn't have to be stressful or be carried out by people who have a lacking morale. I enjoy meat just as the next guy, but I truly believe that participating in animal cruelty (or any living creature) before slaughter or during their life is just a sign of being a bad human being.
I don't think one can classify a long term evolutionary process across the entirety of the species as "wish not to be hurt"
Cognitive dissonance. 
But would you accept the right of a species stronger than humans to eat YOU?
I think people would eventually be frowned upon for consuming animals. People already give you weird looks if you were to say fido is for dinner I could see the same reaction to chicken or cow.
It should cost less, when me and my family raised a cow it could cost 2000+ dollars to raise it.
That's actually one of the biggest draws for lab-grown meat--it must be created in sterile environments, and thus require no antibiotics at all.
Hard to find a good burger replacement without it though.
When a lion sees, chases, attacks and eats a gazelle - it's for survival. Most humans no longer have to fend for survival in the same way. We now have the cognitive and practical ability to lessen the suffering of other creatures. Why would we not utilize that power?
That is a joke, right?
I know you're being sarcastic but we don't need to take responsibility for the cruelty of other species; only our own.
When does a collection of cells become a human?
In the future, it will have positive economic consequences, because lab grown meat will be cheaper than real animals.
Personally I would sign up for a good life and mandatory death at 80
There is however the conservation aspect as well. Left unchecked deer etc can reproduce out of control and then either cause harm or starve if not enough food is available. 
Wow, projection much?I've never shamed or questioned a vegetarian for their choices.  And my post had no such implication.
Meat isn't a requirement for nourishment though.  In America at least, basic products like flour, milk and breakfast cereals are fortified as a matter of course in order to prevent malnutrition. If there is some nutrient so unique and valuable in meat that most people wouldn't get it without eating meat, then that would be fortified too.
Unfortunately the kind of reform required is so radical, given the status quo, that I doubt the current arrangement of human civilization would even attempt to accommodate it.
Does consciousness require thought?
Enjoy sure? But more like need to so that I may survive? Im not saying lab made food is a bad idea but we kinda have to eat.
Consumption of animal products does not cause cognitive dissonance. 
We wouldn't have a choice, unfortunately. 
Except there is such a thing as a lesser beings.As a human, I have an invested interest in protecting other humans. I'm a human. They are a human. It's a match made in heaven.I'm a human. That's a cow.That cow is less important than I am, or someone else is.And to me, it is monumentally less important. 
Why is it that "good morality" is so often linked with the concept of sacrifice?" Can we not have good morality without sacrifice? I say we can. In fact, it is us who defines our morality, and we've historically linked morality and sacrifice. We don't have to sacrifice tasty food in order to save animals. 
In the real world, where not everything is black or white, normal people weigh the pros and cons.Pros of being a vegetarian: healthy, good for the environment, cuts down on animal cruelty.Cons of being a vegetarian: I like the taste of meat.Come on down off that high horse and join the rest of humanity.
"moral" upside?  If I felt a moral conflict with consuming animal meat, Id be a vegetarian.  I believe that our consumption of animal meat is not immoral, we are omnivores, we consume meat the same as any other carnivore.  If anything, our slaughter processes are better than some hunting methods of other animals.
I doubt you would ever eliminate the meat farm industry.  as I mentioned earlier i think.  i expect real meat will remain an exotic meal at high end restaurants and the like.  even so, no farm is ever going to just shut down and release their cows, they would be phased out over time.
was this like... a pet?  bad term, but I assume a large cattle ranch would have inefficiencies that you would not.Ill also admit having no clue as to the wholesale value of a cow.
There are a *lot* of good burger replacements. I'd say most vegetarian 'hamburgers' are on par or significantly better than any fast food burgers. I think short of diner-style/homemade burgers, most replacements do it better. If you want a proper diner-style/homemade hamburger though, you'll probably have issues finding a perfectly suitable replacement. And beyond that, there are a lot of vegetarian burgers that don't bother trying to replicate a 'hamburger' flavor and actually taste much better anyway. 
Actually we are no use to the world at all. Why should we even exist. Wouldn't it be better for the planet if we just all killed ourselves?
Because creatures dying to be eaten does not equate to them suffering more than otherwise.  All creatures die, some just taste delicious afterwards.  In fact, I'd say most animals killed to be eaten by a man (imagine a chicken getting it's head cut off) suffer less than when they die by 'natural' causes (being eaten alive by an animal, dying of a debilitating disease without pain killers).
The whole premise of the paper is flawed, in that living things dying is not a bad thing.  If it is, then 'morally' we should neuter every animal and let the world die.
At some point before birth. This argument isn't about humans though. At what point is an Animal considered more than a collection of cells?
And wild hogs!  Good God they're a menace!  One time I went hunting on this property where some rich guy had TONS of exotic game for hunting.  We were welcome to bag as many hogs as we could get because they were overrunning the place.  And yes, we stripped every bit of meat off the carcasses when we were done.  And it was delicious!
Don't whales eat like billions of krill over the course of their lifetimes? They're not exactly vegans themselves...
It is worse for the environment to both eat meat and consume cellphones than it is to only consume cellphones.
Where exactly do you think that cow got its calories from?
So^maybe^don't^use^it^as^an^argument
Meat is fantastically healthy for humans. Eating an excessive amount causes problems. 
Milk isn't a basic product. Humans don't need cow's milk.
>Unfortunately, the rich get to do a lot of things that the poor cannot. That is capitalism.But it is not exactly capitalism when you can point to a clear instance of a tax making the good too expensive for the poor.
I don't see how consciousness can exist without thought.
Why does it makes sense to elevate humans over animals, but not animals over plants?
You don't need animal products to survive. You can thrive on a plant based diet.
Every argument defending their consumption does, though.
Why do people try to find morality in nature ? There is none, and justifying your actions based on the evolution of life on earth is just as arbitrary as not doing so. 
Yes, you can say that subjectively. But from an outside perspective it bears as much weight as saying you prefer coke over pepsi. So while, to you, "lesser beings" exist, there is no objective standard that can back up that assertion. 
Tough to get off the high horse when you present the pros and cons like that.The environmental and cruelty concerns should easily outweigh such a base personal desire of how your food tastes.
Your unstated premise seems to be that your appetite for meat outweighs the moral consideration we owe conscious beings. Do you have any evidence for that whatsoever?
HE'S on a high horse? I thought that was you, thinking that the taste of meat is comparable to making animals suffer.
i felt really low energy bein a vegetarian so idk, its not that easy
I like how the first thing people usually say about vegetarians is that they are healthy. It is completely healthy to have meat in your diet! I also know several people who are vegetarians but eat mostly chips and sweets. 
>Pros of being a vegetarian: healthyWrong. 
You're right, being eaten alive sounds a lot less pleasant than being beheaded. However, if you think the life of animals who are born, raised, and killed in factory farming conditions includes no suffering but the brief pain of being beheaded (which is not even how they are slaughtered) then you are sorely mistaken. 
Simply dying is vastly different from being killed a human.  When human action is involved, morality is involved.  When an animal kills another animal, that is not a moral issue.  The reason there is a difference in human and animal action is that humans have greater capacity to reason and can behave based on what that reason leads us to determine is ethical behavior.
At some point before birth I suppose.
That depends on how you rate the moral status of krill - they're basically insects, and a pound of wheat also requires spraying to kill huge numbers of insects too. Also, in the case of any animals that eat other animals (whether their diet is insects or more advanced animals), you could argue that humans aren't morally responsible for the actions taken by the animal itself by feeding. 
But is it worse to not consume cell phones and still eat meat? 
Small outliers don't prove the general attitude of people in farming. 
What is too expensive ? I didn't even state a specific number. I am poor and I still manage to drink when I desire. 
It definitely can, and it does. You can even do it yourself. While meditating, you are still conscious and aware of consciousness, yet you are not thinking. Really experienced meditators stop thinking altogether for as long as they want.Thought is just a mechanism of consciousness.
Because you can kill me if I don't elevate you to my level.
Thats true but we have developed as omnivores with canine teeth used for meat. Are you arguing we evolve away from eating meat because it causes suffering? If its about suffering plants also feel pain. By logical progression we have now classified animals as above plants.
The act, in and of itself, does not cause the dissonance. Social constructs produce the dissonance. 
Maybe there is morality in nature? Just because you don't think there is doesn't mean it isn't a possibility.
Exactly. Eating them isn't inherently wrong but we could be nicer about it
But it doesn't, because we're human. Our base animal desires are as much a part of us as our lofty ideals. Why should one facet of our humanity be any less important than the other?
What about the eviromental impact of "vegan leather" and other plastics and non biodegradeable products that vegans flock to for vanity? If animal suffering is the reason you went vegan, you need to stop consuming palm oil, and a large number of other products that lead to deforestation, or enviromental destruction. Petroleum products, rare earth minerals used in the production of microchips. You might as well just swear off all technology, and wear clothing made only of natural fibers. That is if yoyr morals are strong enough.
That is what our ancestors had to do to survive. A large number of humans are vegetarian now. I think you'd have a hard time making the case that the modern production and consumption of meat in western society is about "survival".
They also had no issue killing and raping other hominids.
>Like we only exist as a species because our ancestors had no issue killing an animal.You likely wouldn't exist without the second world war. How many rapes had to occur for you to exist? The path leading to you is full of atrocity and your existence is dependent on that path. But what has any of that got to do with anything?
You do realize that we eat like 50 times more meat in developed countries than either modern undeveloped nations or our own history, right? Even when we borrow cuisine from other cultures, like Mexican, Chinese, or even Mediterranean food, we double, or even triple the amount of meat, and add it to the things that didn't have it. 
I agree, animals should be treated well, until they are slaughtered for food.  100 years ago farms did pretty good at this, but taxation and regulation forced farms to come up with ridiculous production means to stay profitable, so now we have basically meat factories.
You can't measure morality.  Your 'morality' is just your opinion.  To me, it isn't immoral to catch, gut and eat a fish.  The universe designed itself so that fish carried the energy I need to survive, so I eat fish.  Sure, I could survive by eating a carrot, but I don't think I have different moral obligations to fish or carrots.  Sorry.
I suppose that depends on how much of each you consume. I buy one cell phone every few years, whereas many meat eaters do it multiple times a day.
I thought meditation isn't about "not thinking." 
What a dumb argument. People aren't consciously thinking when theyre asleep therefore consciousness doesn't require thought? Point is they are capable of thought. And anyways that's not the definition of consciousness, just a prerequisite. I know that we don't know everything about consciousness but it still has a definition, and its not what you are describing. 
A young child couldn't. What does that say of their moral value?
This is about as strong an argument as the ones from the 1800s insisting slavery wasn't bad because the white man had out evolved "the black man".Also you're happy to compare eating plants to eating animals but I'd like to see how far you'd go torturing a bird vs a cucumber.
What? This makes no sense. The only relevant question is: can we live a healthy life without meat? The answer is unequivocally yes.We can overcome our baser instincts and choose not to kill.
If you ever gave a shit about dogs being abused, then ordered a large number four, then uhhhhh ya.
Why do you think that is?
> why "meat eaters" and not "omnivarians"?Because it's omnivores, not omnivarians. Don't try to sound smart when you're not.
Do you really think rape is comparable to someone eating a hamburger?
No, taxation and regulation is not what caused this. It was better technology and demand. People wanted to pay for cheaper meat and the way to do that was to mass produce and the least costs possible.That's akin to saying that Oil spills are caused because of so much regulation that they had to skimp on costs to meet the demands of the taxes.
At least try to understand that there is no nutritional reason that you eat meat, and that it is due to taste preference alone that meat is eaten.  I think meat tastes gross, personally.I don't buy moral relativism, personally, and think that morality is absolute, but that our reason and logic have not yet discovered all of the structure of morality -- just like how math exists whether we understand it or not.
But it comes down to the individual environmental impact. The mining of oil and rare earth minerals, plastic production, and shipping by sea, compared to the environmental impact of a single humans meat consumption, taking into account the water, feed, and transportation. 
Out of curiosity, what is the definition of consciousness? I thought there wasn't even close to a consesus on the issue.
But his parents or siblings or grandparents or community could kill me. It's not realistic to kill and eat humans because of the conflict it would create in society, the unrest it would provoke.
All moral claims are equally false to the anti-realist (error theorist). There is nothing we can say to condemn slavery from a completely objective, desire-independent point of view. This may be unfortunate, but that is no argument that the view is not correct.I wouldn't torture a bird because it would make me sad. Torturing a cucumber would not make me sad. That's simply how I'm built. Other organisms may be built differently. And that's all there is to say on the matter.
No the question is not if we can but should we? We dont overcome yourlesser instinct by abstaining from meat. You are still killing a live being aka a plant.
Very incorrect.Animal abuse is different than consumption of animal products. Try again, please. 
Oh I'm not smart - I'll admit that.  I can Google shit though. You wouldn't think that would be setting the bar too high, but you never know...Anyway, my understanding is that you call a human who doesn't eat meat a vegetarian - not an herbivore because that's how you describe  animals.  By the same reasoning, a person who eats meats and vegetables is an omnivarian, not an omnivore, because that term is for animals, not humans.
How could you not understand the point of the comparison....?
This has been debunked. Also supplements are kind of a thing. 
I think there's definitely room for improvement in how we consume cell phones, just like how there is room for improvement in how we consume meat. Just because consuming cell phones is bad doesn't mean it's okay to consume meat, which is what I assume you are arguing. In most Western society, it is much easier and more practical to get by without eating meat than it is to not have a cellphone or a car, but I still think we can do better in terms of how cars and cellphones are consumed.
So a child has no intrinsic value, his value is based only what he means to those who are able to kill you? If the child had no parents, siblings, friends, or anyone who cared about him, it would not be wrong to kill him?
So it would be morally permissible to kill and eat an abandoned baby you find on the side of the road?
When you buy chicken at the grocery store, you're funding the torture and murder of chickens. When you buy cucumbers, you're funding the farming of cucumbers. Why invest in sadness?
Well good job, you happened upon the FALLACY FALLACY!Nevermind the fact that you're wrong in calling it a whataboutism>**Whataboutism**: bringing up of one issue in order to distract from the discussion of anotherNope, sorry, it's not. It's a valid counterargument to saying a vegan lifestyle containing nuts is not any more environmentally friendly.>nuts contain no essential nutrients not found elsewhereI'd be happy to continue this conversation, but you always seem to tell me I'm wrong but not point to any data yourself. Where can these nutrients be found, in what foods?
Because cows are not sentient. You'll have a tough time convincing me that killing animals for meat and products is not moral when I don't believe in objective morality. I believe in a morality governed by creatures who are able to participate in the discussion and creatures below the intellect of most apes, with some other animals of exceptional intelligence, are not given the same level of consideration by me.
> So a child has no intrinsic valueNothing has intrinsic value. Intrinsic value is an oxymoron.Our society operates largely on rules, not case-by-case situations. We decide as a civilization to say "children are valuable" because it is a highly useful and biologically reinforced maxim.
Probably not, because we have a strong concept of respect for the dead in western culture, which mirrors our respect for human life generally.If you were starving, though, I imagine it would be morally permissible.
If you want more it's called "Discrete mathematics", which include more complex and more realistic laws. Usually taught to Computer Science students 
Taking me back to my first semester. 
This is the first class of any set theory...
Probably the easiest part of Discrete math... after that it's all hell.
Valid isn't a measure of truth it's a matter of weather or not the statements make sense together "pigs have wings therefore they can fly" is a valid statement but of course it's not true.
Thanks for this. Hope you enjoyed your coffee!
You should make this into an app
Isn't she over analysing it? Drinking coffe is the function and it depends on the donuts and the cream (variables) so it's just an OR gate. coffe=(cream or donut). Then every statement that doesn't falls into that table is false.
whoa whoa whoaa -> b!ahow is this defined as True?wouldn't that be indeterminate?
I'm surprised to see the comments implying that truth tables are first seen in discrete math in college. Has anyone been introduced to these in high school geometry? 
Am I the only person who does not understand any of this and head hurts trying to understand?
Imagine if you had a friend who would always break down your arguments like this.  
I learned this in 10th grade. Good times. 
This seems like a fantastic way to waste time. I just don't understand the need for all of that true and false when in plain English the statement says "If there is a doughnut, i'll drink coffee." Well, there was a goddamn doughnut sitting right there, they just happened to be out of cream, so... you drink fucking coffee, what was so hard to understand about that? It's this kind of stuff i think was invented because people didn't understand word problems growing up and had to over complicate thing just to make it seem simple... 
You could also use common sense to see if an argument is calid
Truth tables do not determine validity. They assess the truth functional value of propositions. You may use them to test validity if the argument is converted to a proposition in conditional form (I.e. The premises are the antecedent and the conclusion is the consequent.) but this is unwieldy. There are simpler methods for evaluating validity in most cases. 
I took discrete mathematics in school. It blew my mind for the first 3 weeks and then it became so fun and interesting. We would use it in class to analyze controversial statements. I've never used it since though :/
I'm on my local county technical advisory council for the Board of education and I am constantly pressuring the addition of discrete math/structures and programmatic logic to k12. Literally the most useful skill in life is problem solving. To provide a framework to apply to everyday decision-making is critical to success. I like to call it the problem of problem solving. 
Usually taught to anyone using math. FTFY
oh great, thanks! i will research on that. I am a newbie of philosophy so pardon me :). 
Just learned this yesterday in my CS class
> Discrete mathematicsI just spent an hour watching introduction videos and doing truth tables. Never even knew about this til now. Thanks!
Every highschool student seing this on math in my country.
I was looking at it from boolean logic, and couldn't understand when p is True and q is False, how is p->q False.i.e. There is cream, and I don't drink coffee are the variable states....how does that translate to if there is cream then I don't drink coffee?
The most efficient method is usually a shortened truth table where you negate the conclusion and then try to make all the premises true.If that is possible, the argument is invalid, if it is impossible the argument is valid.And if you know a calculus to deduce premises, thats usually the fastest method to prove an argument valid.
a valid argument is obviously not necessarily true, but a valid argument is a tool you can use to determine truth, if your argument is valid, and your premises are true your conclusion will necessarily be true aswell, and invalid argument can't be used to determine if anything is true or not
All depends on the quantification of wings. Does having wings mean you can fly? Well no. Unless those wings are from red bull. 
She is trying to apply the tools mechanically. She is using a truth table to algorithmically analyze whether the following statement is valid:```((Cream -> Coffee) & (Donut -> Coffee) & (~Cream & Donut)) -> Coffee```You may have the mental faculty to intuitively reduce the premises down to OR but that is not logically rigorous unless you prove how that follows from the antecedent. 
If a then b, i.e.: a -> bmeans that b **has** to be true, if a is true.b can be anything if a is false, and the statement would still be valid.That is why the statement is essentially '!a (or) b'
Nope, I watched the entire thing and I'm still none the wiser. It would be interesting to see a video that explains how this works fully though, I'm sure I could start to understand it fairly quickly.My main issue was that she glossed over why so many of them "don't matter, they are true" when there was an F in the column she was referencing. But then that's not what this video is for so that's fair enough.
It's about understanding how to use a truth table, not about the logistics of drinking coffee, I don't get what your problem is.
You can set up truth tables for multiple propositions at once, and then test for validity by looking for counterexamples. So truth tables can in fact be used to determine whether an argument is valid.
The whole lot seems to lack a direct application.Ie. there are very few real world problems which cannot be solved without this math.Sure it's very useful as the basis of a bunch more obscure proofs in mathematics and computer science, but unlike many other fields, having a basic knowledge in the field doesn't give much utility.
Baristas with a philosophy degree never used it after graduation either so don't feel bad. 
Discrete Math was an AP course at my high school. If you haven't made any headway that might be a good place to start 
Ya i dont think its really about philosophy, although it may transfer over. But its main use is in computer science. I took a discrete mathematics course freshman year. 
You learned all of discrete math in one of your CS classes yesterday? Must not have been a very thorough lecture.
mother russia?
It translates to **If there is cream  then I drink coffee.** being false.
Saying validity is a tool that can be used to determine truth is a stretch. The validity of an argument does not tell you about the truth (soundness) of a conclusion *unless* you have some other means of determining first that every premise is true.Outside of that specific circumstance - where something else is enabling you to determine truth - validity cannot be used to determine truth. That an argument is invalid, for example, does not tell us anything about the truth of its premises or conclusion.
No.   validity has nothing to do with the truth of claims or propositions.  Soundness is the measure of truth of all premises.  Truth tables brute force all possible truth values of a symbolized argument, to determine validity, not soundness.
Also, what do you mean by quantification? If something is to be given wings (here it is a pig), it would be given wings appropriate for flight to be a possibility (Weight, length, surface area, density, etc.). Most people understand this to be true.Never mind that your comment doesn't actually impact the conversation that was being had.
I'm not sure that I agree. While it is unlikely that one will ever end up directly applying the knowledge gained from basic studying in this field (in that few people consciously break arguments down into logical statements and evaluate them), knowledge is not only valuable when it is directly applied.If studying logic causes one to subconsciously evaluate things more logically, whether overtly recognized or not, then it has substantial and long-lasting benefits.
I'm in the south in a very poor district. This school system is so far behind. I teach at a military rating school called JCAC, but try to help in the community where I can. We teach logic, discrete structures, malware, Exploitation, the works.
Thanks for the info, i know nothing about this, but it sounds very interesting, I love taking arguments apart and analysing wheter they are true or not, if that's my interest should i go into discrete math? 
It is taught by every analytic philosophy department that I'm aware of. Valid logic is crucial for making sound arguments. Aristotle, Kant, Russell, and countless others wrote on the importance of logic in philosophy
Fucking turkey
Could it be just as well to read the symbol -> as "so"? Like **there is ice cream** so **I drink coffee**. I guess the main reason I think it should be read that way is to take away the burden of reading it once and then reparsing it when you get to that conditional. On the other hand, the way she processes it is:**there is ice cream?** yes or no, **I drink coffee**
But the statement is that pigs fly because they have wings. Wings do not solely enable flight.
Most people would know that some winged creatures (avians) are not capable of flight. Ostriches, chickens, turkeys, etc.
> If studying logic causes one to subconsciously evaluate things more logically, whether overtly recognized or not, then it has substantial and long-lasting benefits.agree. i was joking with my friend the other day. it went like this:me: only the good die young.her: what about so-and-so? they lived a long time.me: time out, flag on the play. denying the antecedent, repeat the down.but more importantly, why would billy joel lie like that? it must be true.
Reasoning and critical thinking AKA common sense AKA the class the weeds the idiots about of first ear university 
If you have time and don't care about funding, maybe try setting up an after-school course for interested students.  Might possibly be able to get it in as extracurricular studies?
> I love taking arguments apart and analysing wheter they are true or not, if that's my interest should i go into discrete math?Much of discrete math will be irrelevant for that. You're probably better off with a course in critical thinking, which will cover the relevant material found in discrete math and much more. You'll find a more realistic approach to *soundness* (a stronger condition than *validity*), a more comprehensive taxonomy of fallacies, and the inclusion of inductive reasoning in addition to deductive.
Discrete math also is heavy in proof and certain types of probability calculations (at least it was for me).  Discrete Math, Logic, and Computer Engineering were the three that I took which were heavy on this type of logic (either analysis or design).  Logic was the only one that stayed with breaking down arguments the whole time.  But for the record, I did like discrete math the best.  
I read it as 'implies.' p implies q. I guess that basically has the same meaning as 'so.'
It doesn't matter.   Arguments are deductive/valid based on structure not content.  All men are mortal.Socrates is a man. Socrates is mortal. Valid and sound. All men are cats.Socrates is a man.Socrates is a cat.Valid (same exact structure as the first) but not sound (the first premise is false).Think of validity as "assuming all the premises are true, does the conclusion have to follow?" Soundness is looking at the actual truth of the premises.
Except the overwhelming majority do fly.
Billy Joel would never.
Of course, but I'm just on the advisory council to help shape the curriculum to be more applicable to "cyber" careers in the future. 
Been a while since my Discrete math course but that sounds about right.  I do remember my teacher loving to quote "Alice in Wonderland"
Love that book, but I barely got a C in my Logic course in college :-/ Did the teacher quote examples from the book, or just quoted it for the hell of it?
Something important to consider when reading "The Prince" is the context provided by the life of Niccolo Machiavelli. "The Prince" was written for Lorenzo de' Medici, ("The Medici" being the family that had him imprisoned and tortured for a short while, before the prince was written). Just leaving this tidbit here...  
The video doesn't even outline what makes a good ruler! It just talks about Machiavelli and throws in a bunch of filler while drawing random stuff. Why does he talk about the definition of 'politics'? 
The main thing I got from The Prince was a strong foundation is the key to power. Happy people coupled with a competent military and decent economy will ensure a lasting princedom. Also be wary that everyone is out for their own gain, and to always interpret the true meaning behind other's actions. Power is like a chess game, and you should always be two steps ahead.In a related note, after I read the book I became much better at Civ 5.Never trust Gandhi. Some men just want to watch the world burn.
John II of Portugal was called Perfect Prince after his death since he was associated with The Prince of Machiavelli. During his lifetime Isabella of Castile (the main rivals of Portugal) called him "El Hombre" (The Man) 
"Today's candidates no doubt know Machiavelli's words."Would it be controversial to say, "No.  It is almost certain that Donald Trump is unable to explain anything about *The Prince* beyond a vague 'pop culture' description"?
For anyone who hasn't yet, I would highly recommend reading the whole text on your own. It's dirt cheap online and it's well worth the read.
I read this piece and I am pretty sure that this was a highly satirical work, meant as a jab at the leadership at the time. Considering Machiavelli's legs were broken (at least according to the history book I read) for treason or some other reason, it makes sense he would want some kind of sweet revenge.
I liked the video, but I cringed every time the screen flickered blue because the creator didn't set a white balance and left it on auto. It's really easy and simple to do. It takes a couple of seconds to do prior to taping and helps the audience stay engaged with the content.
Yes there is an errounous assumption that Machiavelli advocated dictatorship but as I understand it he was for a republic.
I think the video actually references this around 6 minutes in (6:00), but doesn't develop it further because there is still an enormous debate over the issue. 
The Medici family did imprison him and torture him for a while.However Machiavelli wrote "The prince" for Cesare Borgia (son of the Pope of the time; Cesare was called "Valentino", because he was the duke of Valentinois).
So true. The Prince is satire more than anything.
His conclusion doesn't really answer the question he asks either, "what makes a good ruler? ... Pay attention to your politicians!"
I also found the "art" so bad it was actually distracting. 
Wait is this Sargon of Akkad?
Was he a bad hombre?
I'd rather the candidates know nothing of Machiavelli or The Prince. Not only is the book outdated and therefore inapplicable, but it shows a very unethical way of ruling (which is in itself unethical). The idea that humanity needs a leader is not a good one, and it is only used to justifiy the injustices that a ruler would do.
You mean free?
Actually he uses lots of real life examples, from "the Turk" being the Ottoman empire, the king of France who at the time waged wars in Italy, the king of Aragon, Caesar Borgia and Alexander VI.As for the impact he had, he was very influential. Frederik the Great of Prussia once wrote a counter argument to the Prince to describe the Enlightened ruler, and that was in the mid-18th century. Barack Obama once said the Prince was his bedside book.
You are not necessarily wrong, even though you're being downvoted. There is a long tradition of viewing Machiavelli's The Prince as ironic. Recent scholarship doesn't go that direction any more though, so I'd suggest to look up some recent sources and see whether you still think that to be the case.
No. Machiavelli believes deceiving the people is necessary and maintaining power must be the priority above all. This is not being a good leader and this is certainly not Donald Trump. Machiavelli tormented his enemies for personal gain and not in favor of the general public. Donald Trump's leadership prioritizes the people above all and how he can best protect and represent them, even if that means personal sacrifice, an idea very distant to Machiavelli.
His dream was that Lorenzo would use his advice to unite Italy. If we are to follow his logic, the form of government to attain this goal matters little, as long as the ruler can achieve it.Republics in the Renaissance were also not democratic at all, the Medici family had held Florence as a republic for a while before they turned it into a duchy.
Indeed.  "Machiavellian" seems to me to be synonymous with "tyrannical".  But, throughout the book he emphasizes how important it is to maintain the approval of the people...
> The Ends Define The Meansin italian it's "il fine giustifica i mezzi","il fine" translates better to "the purpose", therefore it is clear that the means are justified and calculated ways to obtain the goal. Also, i would add "this particular purpose justifies these particular means", thanks to the definite articles, therefore it's not like a goal justifies any mean, but certain ones that are just a little over the limits, given that a purpose must be reached.
The reason you're having an hard time justifying (lol) the sentence in Machiavelli's ideology is because he never ever said it. It's a false attribution, that distorts and give a darkish feeling at his work
When I say "was written for", I intended, that he "dedicated" the prince "To the magnificent Lorenzo Di Piero De' Medici". My apologies for my choice of words, and the misunderstanding. 
The Borgia was already dead in 1513, when Machiavelli wrote De Principatibus. He indeed took him as the exemplum Lorenzo should have followed
Sure he did. He said it was entirely subjective so instead he was going to talk about what Machiavelli had to say on the subject. "The Prince" is entirely about how to be a good leader, or rather, how to maintain control, survive, and achieve personal glory in a pragmatic and realistic manner. This guidebook was how to be a "good" leader.
He has a lot of audiobooks on there, The Art of War, The Epic of Gilgamesh, Hammurabi's code, along with plenty of less famous ancient writings, definitely a good resource, and if you are a big history nerd he does have a bunch of other stuff on there.
That's the shallowest most simplistic interpretation, worse than even Trump could give.No, books in philosophy, and particularly in political philosophy, do not become outdated. He's absolutely NOT describing an "unethical" way of ruling, you seem to be missing his focus on the welfare of the people. It's funny how ignorant people disregard HIS OTHER BOOK, which you clearly haven't read, which praises the Republic and Republican Freedom. But, hey, let's talk about stuff we have no idea about yay!
They read 'The 48 laws of power' instead =\
To say the Prince is "outdated" and "inapplicable" is completely false. I don't understand how political theory becomes outdated. Different ideals come in and out of favor with the public/scholars/rulers, but are still generally applicable to how government functions.Is Socrates still in vogue? What about Plato?
The idea that humanity does *not* need a leader is a naive one.
I wish we lived in a world where ethical beats pragmatic. But we don't.
I'd rather that modern political commentators knew something of him and his book, so they can recognise when today's politicians are putting the tactics he speaks of into practice.
How are you doing in Poli Sci and philosophy 101 this semester? 
Yes, it's free because it's almost 500 hundreds years old, thus belongs in the public domain. 
Thank you for your passionate and insightful comment. I have indeed read The Prince, and a few chapters from Book 1 of his Discourses on Livy, but not his other works. You have piqued my interest- I will get into this!
Do you have a source for Obama saying that? I really doubt any smart politician would openly admit to studying Machiavelli 
Thank you for the comment. I will go back and re-read The Prince to gain a better understanding. 
Can you cite any of the "many thinkers" in Rome and Greece that believed democracy was just as evil as dictatorship?
That could all be just a face he presents to the public. Though I think Trump's leadership style leans *very heavily* on advisors, since he is clearly out of his depth on some matters, like foreign policy. 
I was under the assumption that he wrote it in a mocking manner.  As if people in power thought this way regarding the end justifying the means.   Do anything within your power to consolidate and expand your power.   He certainly wasn't part of the powerful class and wouldn't have advocated such a position. 
It is a little funny that I understand everything you are talking about, largely due to Assassin's Creed
He absolutely did say it.
Sorry, I was a bit confused because when reading "Lorenzo de Medici" I assumed you meant the Magnifico (the guy who loved corporate social responsibility) and not Lorenzo *di Piero* de Medici :)
Machiavelli had the Borgia on his mind, he hoped for him to succeed and made the book (out of a letter exchange) for Cesare Borgia. Unfortunately for Machiavelli, Cesare Borgia died too soon.Well, now what? He had a good gift. Why not use it to regain the favor of the Medici? That's why he dedicated the book to Lorenzo Piero de Medici soon after Giuliano di Lorenzo de Medici (the guy who tortured and sent Machiavelli to basically an exile) died.
Well maybe you and I define answering a question differently, but if you say that the only way to answer how to be a good leader is by sloppily quoting Machiavelli I'd disagree.
Free audiobook: Dude sounds like Kermit the Frog with a fake english accent.  Checks out.
Have you read The Prince? He is talking about citizens and lords like its the medeival times. Its totally outdated.Also, I hate the idea that a ruler cannot be a good ruler and a good person at the same time, and that is one of his core ideals.
I'm surprised this doesn't get brought up more often. It really is a despicable book of strategies to manipulate and dominate at any cost.
He is speaking of political ideals in Feudalism. I believe that a lot if his ideology is no longer applicable to the modern world.
Real Democracy = no leaders. You can have a role model and what not but a LEADER means you are being told what to do and/or how to live. Sorry, but mankind is better off without leaders.
More like ethical over greed.
I think it was in a Forbes article a few years ago. I'm on my phone right now but I'll look it up.It really isn't controversial to say you take the Prince as an inspiration though. It is extensively studied in every business school, political science courses, military academies and law schools. I would be more weary of being led by a politician who hasn't read it, just in terms of lack of general culture.
It would be quite dumb to think than an academic constitutionalist has not read and studied The Prince.
Plato and Aristotle surely did. Democracy was generally viewed as a the rule of the plebs - a rule that defines itself through a general state of insecurity, because it is based on self-interest rather than the common welfare.Thats why Plato argued for the rule of "philosopher kings" and Aristotle for an hybrid form of Oligarchy and Democracy. For Rome: You have Polybios who defines the Ochlocracy  as the coerciely following step to Democracy and thus creates an hybrid form of monarchich, aristocratic and democratic elements in an attempt to break the circuit of constitutions.
It's not just a persona. Look at everything Trump has said his entire life and the tremendous respect he's gained from everyone. His entire life he's been consistent in showing a deep concern for the American people and has a record of being unselfish despite what the media wants you to believe.
I cannot reasonably see *The Prince* as a work of satire, given it was a piece produced by Machiavelli to win the favour of Lorenzo II. Machiavelli really, really loved his home city of Florence, and just could not stand being exiled from it, so he quickly penned the piece to prove his usefulness to Lorenzo, so that he could be recalled. Given this, it would not make sense for *The Prince* a work of satire, unless Machiavelli thought Lorenzo was incredibly dumb. The piece might be at times disingenuous or a work of some sycophancy to the Medici family, but it is probably not satire. 
For me it is hard to be sure, Niccolo, did in 1494 after the Medici were driven from power (an effort to my knowledge that he had assisted with) have a life well off (he had status), and none of this lasted. The Medici come back with "The will of god" (Sorry, "The Pope") and he was accused of conspiring against the Medici in 1513,  he was imprisoned and tortured, and then he retired (likely as a type of political prisoner always under the watch of the Medici), and then he wrote the prince for his good friend Lorenzo. 
Many historical accounts support this view. He was contracted by the family and highly displeased by their behavior. Many (even most) scholars view the piece as satirical.Also, historical accounts claim the piece was a gift (birthday perhaps?) Which was swiftly discarded and forgotten about. 
Same. That knowledge help me through it.I remember being told that he wrote it on Italian instead of Latin (as expected of writers at the time) so this leads me to believe it was his response/act of rebellion/fight for justice to being imprisioned and tortured by his family.
The objective of uniting Italy is laid out explicitly in the final chapter of *The Prince* (titled "An exhortation to liberate Italy from the barbarians"). 
He wrote the book 7 (SEVEN) years after Cesare's death, as it's stated in his letter to the Vettori, his friend and an ambassador in Rome. What he hoped for was to gain the favour of the Medici, so that he could be back in Firenze's politicsAnd these aren't speculations, pure facts he himself tells us about in the aforementioned letter
>  but if you say that the only way to answer how to be a good leader is by sloppily quoting Machiavelli I'd disagree.Nobody said this is the *only* way the answer "what makes a good leader?". It is one way to explore the question, since The Prince is arguably the most famous book written solely to answer it.Also the title of the video acts as a motivation to discuss the Prince, since the subject of the book is how to be a good leader. This doesn't mean the intention of the creator was to answer the question at all. He's simply saying "Here's Machiavelli's answer to it".
If you don't know who he is he has ~half a mil subs on his anti-feminism channel
I think very little in the book is despicable - it's a treatise of social realpolitik. If you are completely oblivious to that mode of thinking, you might be eaten. 
The Prince does not focus on draconian aspects of feudalism. It lays out Machiavelli's thoughts about how one might successfully gain and hold power. Further, how to govern well and some advice on military tactics.These lessons are still applicable today. The nature of power has not changed.
a real democracy can't excist... not with a big population and complexity there is in the modern day, so it's irrelevant to talk about real democracy in the modern day, the representative democracy is here for that reason. I think the real democracy can still work in a smaller population group, like maybe up to 100 people at a time? but we are not living in stone age anymore.
In that case, he seems like a genuine man who feels for the American people, but is not concerned with details. He will rely on the advisors to make up for his lack of thorough political knowledge and disinterest in details. 
>since there's no evidence it works.Except there is.   Power is not limitless.  More power requires more energy input and as our efficiency fades these directives are expressly aimed at slowing this process down.To argue that a ruler is a failure, is to argue that the sky is blue. 
You are kinda pedantic. Of course he hoped to gain the favor of the Medici again. But it's an undebatable fact that he has Cesare Borgia in his mind as a kind of "model".
Why do people keep saying that he says you shouldn't be good? He says that between fear and love you should choose fear, but that doesn't mean actually being bad, that doesn't mean that you operate outside the realm of ethics (altho you do operate, as sovereign, in ANOTHER ethical realm, and that's the interesting part).
You clearly are obsessed with Machiavelli and I would be a fool to continue arguing with you. Thanks for your effort to persuade me about his ideals, but republican or what I said, hate both. They're both objectively immoral POLITICAL philosophies.Also, I know it was in the medeival ages. I'm sorry I phrased that wrong.I admit you are right about Machiavelli's true beliefs. But I still don't agree with them.You shouldn't downvote opinion btw. Not cool. So what if you don't agree with me. Don't downvote unless I was an ass. You're the one giving me flak for disagreeing with Republicanism.
Oh, I'm aware there are sociopaths and that these are the instruments of their trade. I even know how to play the game when absolutely necessary. It just seems a bit disgusting to me to train in it.It's a little like the difference between training in how to fight for self defense and training in how to execute nothing but deceptive, crippling and, lethal blows. I would prefer to win honorably.
Yes, the philosophy is applicable because its philosophy. The ideals remain the same throughout time. But in The Prince he makes soo many specific examples to past lords and rulers and kingdoms that its hard to apply it to our time.As for his ideals, I know that they stay true with time, however, because the circumstances are vastly different, it would be unwise to apply them to our time.
Yes, you said it yourself, decentralized democracy! This is ideal.However, this is also the first era of history in which we can establish a direct democracy throughout a nation of any size. How hard can it be to set up online polls instead of a Congress (which struggles to work if it ever works at all)? And voting booth distributed everywhefe for people without internet. It would be easier and better for the people.Unless you make the argument "ohh but the people are inherently stupid". This idea is inherent to the system it exists in, representative democracy.
>  these directives are expressly aimed at slowing this process down.Prove to me they work. 
Not to be that guy, but as I recall, (I read the book almost 5 years ago) he said that it is best to be both loved and feared, but if you had to choose one, you should choose to be feared.
Also I didn't downvote you, and they are not downvoting you based on opinion, they are downvoting you because you're displaying incredible amounts of certainty for your obvious lack of contact with the field.Also, by saying "objectively immoral political philosophy" when you apparently have no idea how to use none of those 4 words.
They're tools. Nothing more, nothing less. You can use them for good or evil. 
You are incorrect.
>But in The Prince he makes soo many specific examples to past lords and rulers and kingdoms that its hard to apply it to our time.You mean for you to apply. 
*Most* people *are* actually hopelessly stupid. You know this. Do you really trust your neighbor, your boss, or even your cousin to vote for what's *best* for the nation?
Thanks, this really helped clear things up for me. This gives me a lot of stuff to look into. If you don't mind me asking, do you study polisci at a university?  
They are employed daily by people in positions of authority and with power over your life.  I'm not sure what you want from me.
Ain't that what I said pretty much? But yeah.
How would you string them together? How I said it was perfectly correct.And thanks for not downvoting, my comment on that was directed to everyone.
Damn, I give up. Thanks for persuading me, I was such an idoit before.
I don't want to argue for nationwide internet democracy, I don't like it that much either.I'm not sure how you could know my view on decentralized democracy, as I merely stated that it would be ideal.Congressmen do not represent the views of the people, they only fight for what their corrupt party's intentions are.
hey, glad I could help :) I studied at a University (in Germany tho), just handed in my master-thesis :) 
There are many maxims used by people in power.   Some use the Art of War.   Some use How to Win Friends and Influence People.   Some use the Bible.   Some use Pink Floyd lyrics.   Some use what their parents taught them.   Can you show me one maxim in Machiavelli that isn't obvious,  but is demonstrably more effective than other, perhaps contradictory lessons? 
"Objective" doesn't mean what you think it means: it doesn't mean "without bias" nor does it mean "in reality", it is not a synonim of "actually" or "really". It means "related to the nature of the object qua object". You're using "objectively" as a synonym of "really". The word is not doing any work in the phrase that you said it in. I think you were looking for a word more like "inherently".Also "morality" is not the object of political philosophy.
I don't think anyone here is under the illusion they could persuade you of anything you've already decided is wrong. They're merely trying to prevent your obstinacy from spreading. 
You stated it your self that decentralized democracy would be ideal, so thats a pretty good indicator on your view about the subject? Anything else is a contradiction.
Oh that's awesome, lol now I love the username even more
These comments have convinced me that a video that I originally liked I no longer like. 
This is not really a deep examination of the philosophy of the episode. 
I wonder how many more videos Wisecrack will make using this show. They've wrangled the philosophy of the show by making more and more videos about which shows they're just pandering to Rick and Morty fans
I'm amazed at the amount of upvotes this tripe got. I love rick and morty but this runaway fandom analysis has seeped into shit
jesus this is /r/iamverysmart condensed into a shitty youtube video.
I was totally unaware Aristotle wrote the first list of logical fallacies. Which book can I find those in?
I loved it but the pacing was wrong.  Beth, George, and Summer would not become cult members overnight and turn uncomfortably pleasant.  It's hard to shoehorn them into a "worshipping" orientation at all.It's not R&M's format to "Idiot Ball" characters, where they turn into an idiot and act wildly out of character for the purposes of an episode.It would have resonated with a wider time frame.  
I can see why everyone thinks this is just a bad highlight reel with a guy talking over it since all of Reddit is experts on logical fallacies already.
"Nobody exists on purpose, nobody belongs anywhere, everybody's going to die, come watch TV." - Always thought this quote was pretty deep for a Cartoon of this nature. 
It's just a show reflecting the multiple dimension theory and how it can cause sociopathic tendencies.
As long as no one starts telling me I'm wrong for loving Thug Notes, I can continue on surviving.
I kind of enjoyed it.  After reading these comments I am dissapointed in myself.
I was expecting further reading. Instead I got the episode told back to me without the jokes. 
More of a summary with light interpretation 
Wisecrack is never exactly academically rigorous
Yeah what a fucking joke. Just a little pat on the back for atheists.
It was interesting (yet shallow) until it just started listing logical fallacies. Could have been more interesting to compare and contrast with current events.
Better than the original post 
The show has some pretty deep/existential episodes, there's quite a bit of content for them to pull from
For real.  This was, bar none, the absolute worst episode of the show.  Worst.  Unfunny, ridiculous, meaningless BS.  It felt like a leftover script for an unmade episode of Aqua Teen Hunger Force, and it probably was.
Yes and no. It's not R&M's format, per se, to put Earth in a distinct cataclysmic panic either. There's a pretty obvious connection between the events unfolding and the behaviors we see.
Not if they arent the same family from previous episodes. Drastic changes in family members usually is a good indicator we are now following different Rick and Morty.
This is the only episode I truly dislike. It just felt so out of place. I kind of feel like it was built entirely around the Shwifty performance and the silly Ice T story. 
Nice ad hoc hominem hoc cogito culina fallacy there.
Except when "cartoon of this nature" refers to a show that already caters to pseudointellectuals, that quote is not only not deep, but also very expected. 
It isn't, really. It states the obvious, and then advocates escapism. Which cartoons are a prime example of.
I'm with you but I'm not that mad. I can nust easily ignore the episode
Why is this person being downvoted?
This is what happens whenever a video from a channel I am subscribed to ends up on Reddit. I wouldn't have the confidence if I were the Nerdwriter after on of his last videos ended up on the front page. 
Welcome to Wisecrack nowadays. 
More like "here's the idea of logical fallacies"...    His other videos (notably Bo Jack Horseman and the actual Rick and Morty episode) are way better than these. This seems more like a filler episode.
Didn't they state that Science was comparable to religion one time?
I mean, sure there's bad shit out there upvoted just because of the lulz, but you can recognize it and ignore it. There's still a lot of articles on this sub that actually have a high quality. Its not important that posts get the points they deserve, it's important that the quality posts reach enough points so I read them
Really? What I got from this video is that the thought processes related to religion are not exclusive to them. Anyone can fall into the same fallacies to justify their beliefs. 
Not everything has to be about Trump. There are so many other places to get your fix
If that's the one with Camus, you can actually learn something from that video. I've actually referenced it a few times, it's great. 
That's totally not the point of the comment above yours. This video may be irritatingly indulgent over rudimentary bs, but I think most fans of the show still find it a good episode. A tip: Just because something, anything, is uninteresting to you does not make that thing meaningless.
It's a lot of exposure.  Like, Stargate SG1 went for hundreds of episodes without changing the world by letting people know about aliens and the stargate... for  no good reason.  Other than it makes the world less relatable to the audience.But by S02's cliffhanger, the world kinda jumped way ahead and accepted Galactic Federation rule.  Prior to that, the Giant Head thing was the only case where the world was aware an alien situation was a thing.
It's always the same Rick and Morty. The family may change, but it's been the same Rick and Morty since episode 1. 
Yeah the Ice-T story was just random and silly.  I didn't "get" that part at all.  I just try to forget that part.
"My doctor said I have cancer""Lol nice appeal to authority. Take a logic class." 
OK, what is something you would consider deep within pop culture?
This sounds like something someone who thought they were intelligent but couldn't understand the content or concepts of this show would say..That, or someone arrogant and  pretentious with the sense of humor of a tree stump 
Well IMDB agrees. My disappointment with the episode only looks like anger on forums celebrating it, which are everywhere. Everybody's charmed by the catch phrase. There's people who love R&M for the right reasons, and then there's a bunch of mouth-breathers drawn to the hype and find this episode super easy to get on board with. If you can't comprehend how much more complicated the other episodes are, and truly think Shwifty is a high point of R&M, you are the reason smart shows get cancelled. 
Perfectly logical scientific theories can be built upon foundations of illogical subconcious presuppositions.That's why science without philosophy is so potentially dangerous. 
Why does every pretentious philosophy of x media focus so much on existentialism? Existentialism is a shitty outdated footnote of philosophy, not the most super interesting up to date shit.
Current events doesn't just mean Trump
But then you'd have to learn something about camus. So who's the real loser?
A tip for you: my opinion is just as valid as yours, and I'm every bit as entitled to it as you are.Don't condescend to people, friend. It just makes you look like a patronizing asshole.
I think it'd be helpful to consider the vast difference in purpose and message between the two shows you're comparing here.
how do you explain mr poopy butthole?
Wrong. Proved it at jerry daycare.
There's nothing to get. It is random.
Lmao I like Rick and Morty it's a funny show. I don't think it's as good as a lot of people here would have you believe but it's definitely a solid TV show. I don't see what that has to do with disagreeing that the quote isn't great as a serious piece of philosophy.
Name one. 
As if I wanted to life in a world where I wouldn't be able learn about Camus 
I'm sorry that you mistook my comment for condescension, but it wasn't. I was pointing out the difference between opinion and objective fact. To call something meaningless which is not is objectively wrong, and to word it as though the person you're responding to was making the same point when they weren't is rude and rather manipulative.
He's been there the whole time!
Why the downvotes? Oxxo is saying that the episode didn't follow the main Rick and Morty that episode. Even if it did contain them, the episode followed a different timeline for the most part. And Oxxo is asserting that it is possible that there are other episodes where this has happened, but we may not have realized it yet. 
Its only basis was the NAME "Ice-T".  Then it's, like, "let's make him an alien crystal of actual ice who doesn't care".  "Oh, oh, can he come from a planet of letters-and-substances?"  "and they're at war with number-planet!"  "and then he cares enough to save Earth!"Yeah, that meshes with the plot perfectly.  It's like a \[WP\] where they qualified the entry with the most DOWNVOTES.
Scientism is stupid but that comic comes off like it's written by someone little better.
Phrenology, social darwinism, eugenics
> to word it as though the person you're responding to was making the same point when they weren't is rude and rather manipulative.In my reading I missed the word "analysis" and believed the poster was talking about the episode. Such a misunderstanding is neither rude nor manipulative.Stop being judgmental!
What makes you think it followed a different timeline? Honestly asking, trying to figure out if I missed something.
That's not strictly speaking overtly nihilistic even though the last line borders on it. A lot of people overuse the term nihilism but just saying that events don't have inherent meaning is far from total global nihilism. Thinking you can fight back again lack of inherent meaning isn't usually considered nihilist. Nor is existentialist posturing.
If you mean the term "scientism" you might prefer the term "scientific expansionism".  I would agree that the term is less inherently confusing since you would naturally tend to want to call a practitioner of "scientism" a "scientist" which would naturally be conflated with a simple practitioner of the scientific method but "scientific expansionist" would not cause the same confusion.
left wing economics The subconcious presuppositions being A: if we didn't force people to share their wealth then they wouldn't, at least not to the degree that's "necessary"B: the very act of forcing people to share their wealth is not actually responsible for the vast majority of resentment for the poor and rampant greed/selfishness we see in the world today.C: mandatory compassion is not actually dehumanizing compassion itself by putting a giant middle man between the people doing the helping from the people being helped.
Can you do a tl dr and not use philosophy talk? Basically wisecrack it.
Its trying to answer two questions, one of which there is probably no reason to even ask, and the other which it answers incorrectly. The first question being about some vague thing your life is inherently ordered towards, (doesn't matter. Defaults don't mean anything, read about morality or value instead) and the second being about radical freedom to make any choice. (Heavily disregards social context so much that it leads to misleading conclusions about agency).
I think it's pretty obvious that the daycare episode and the Poopy Butthole episode feature different R&M. They even emphasize that Rick throws glowing green rocks on the trash in Total Ricall he collected in the daycare episode. Let's also not forget Mr Poopy Butthole is watching R&M at the end of the final episode, suggesting he is watching another universe. 
The problem is that we are just brains...who are hooked into life support systems composed of muscle and heart tissue and so on.  You can't neglect those.  You have to pay attention to them and the signals they pass you, and you need to keep them in good shape or your brain (you!) will cease functioning.
There's no direct evidence brains exist. Empirical senses assume a knowledge of the world prior to us sensing it. Concepts like space, time, and matter are axioms on which empiricism depend. Kantian Idealism (as opposed to realism) doesn't need this extra assumption. It claims that only minds exist. Empiricism is three dimensional representation of all possible thoughts, with an organizational bias by natural selection.U mad Churchland? *a sunglass*
The idea of self is so fascinating. I personally think it's just a peripheral experience and nothing more, the brain just gives you a viewer and motor control and the conscience gives you an impression that you are somebody when in fact everybody is nobody.
Benefits apparently include:*cheapening human life*reducing all of human experience - most relevantly, suffering - to arbitrary, uncontrollable caprice *rendering existence meaninglessI also like how her response to the last question was, "well, it doesn't bother ME, personally, so it shouldn't bother anyone else."
i think were a conscious thing that interfaces with physical reality through a brain. the consciousness interprets data. cut out a part of the brain and the data changes. i think its naive to assume were just a brain. 
I'm in the habit of thinking of myself as a product of my brain. I must be an exception as the article asserts that most people do not think this way.
The fact is, the odds of somebody who didn't exist 1 year ago, existing at some point in the that future is exactly the same as the odds of somebody who doesn't exist 1 year from now existing at some point in that future.
What makes it unusual or radical? It would seem a natural and logical conclusion for anyone who is rooted in science rather than mysticism and dogma.
But why is there awareness at all? Why the whole inner movie? Why aren't we just robots that process input and produce output? What if we create a human-level intelligence AI? Does it have the inner movie as well?Some people (myself included depending on the day) would say the hard problem of consciousness doesn't exist, but I think it's definitely something that deserves further probing before anything's definitive.
Or perhaps the awareness that *interfaces* with the brain.
If the argument is that we are the ideas constructed by a set of molecules deciding to do something special its not much further a stretch to say i'm everything constructed by the same matter.
Could you expand on the idea of minds only existing? Its an interesting thought
Interesting. >we could absolutely predict every outcome of that system. A thief, a murderer, a jaywalker... all of their actions are causal. They have no more choice in the matter than a computer running a programIs this true? What evidence is there to suggest this idea? Because while we are absolutely influenced by a myriad of factors that doesn't mean that we do not make choices, is the evidence of outside influence evidence that free will does not exist? 
I agree. But that doesn't mean they don't have free will. It just means they'll do the same thing every time. What part of this negates free will? It was still their decision to do something, every single time. 
Can't you be both conscious and a function of inputs at the same time? And just because there is no discernible line between rock and human why would we treat all objects as either all conscious or all unconscious? Surely we could narrow it down a little bit further. 
What do you mean peripheral experience? 
> > It can be hard to accept that our hopes and dreams are just functions of our brains, but it shouldn't scare us> Why would I accept something that has no empirical evidence to support it?There are plenty of psycho-active drugs that will produce, eliminate or substantially change your "hopes and dreams", so that kind of is an empirical evidence.Likewise specific types of brain trauma impairs specific mental abilities, such as emotions, planning, execution.
> Why would I accept something that has no empirical evidence to support it?You're right, there's no evidence for free will and you have no reason to just accept it.> She's implying that our intuition tells us we're 'not the brain', but the 'harsh reality' is that we are. This is the opposite of the truth. No, not at all. Most people still think their mind and their body are two separate things. Most feel that there's more to their "self", something that is not material, and not deterministic.  And they based this on nothing more than just "this is how it feels to me". 
You are the consciousness produced by your brain. 
Hmm... Im not sure I agree with that equation!
because it leads here to believe that things like "beliefs" do not exist. it's definitely counterintuitive to say the least
It always amazes me how we are literally a group of atoms that somehow think they are an individual, that thought always blows my mind.
I think the different parts of the brain combine to form our full personality, like how the neurons in our brain group together to (usually) form full functional systems. So, there isn't some central part of the brain where "we" are, "we" are a little bit of one part and a little bit of another part and another part etc. all combined together. Each part is important in making us who we are.
I've never understood how people like Dennet can say that the hard problem of consciousness doesn't exist, could you potentially elaborate on how that's possible? 
> Why aren't we just robots that process input and produce output?How do you know we're not?
Perhaps the subjective experience is a side-effect of evolutionarily selected traits. 
The way you phrased awareness interfacing with the brain implies that awareness is something that could exist independent of the brain. Like perhaps your awareness could float off after your brain dies and maybe interface itself with someone else's brain. Or perhaps float off to some place like Heaven or Hell. I think the brain produces a lot of patterns, one of which is an awareness of your self. But when the brain dies, all the patterns are gone also.
Like how the text in this post interfaces with my computer screen, and then later yours. If I smash my tablet before posting, then my post ceases to be. If I smash it after posting, the post continues to exist.
We shall disagree on how we define 'stretch' in that context. 
> Most people still think their mind and their body are two separate things. Most feel that there's more to their "self", something that is not material, and not deterministic. And they based this on nothing more than just "this is how it feels to me". Is that a pre-philosophical/pre-analytic intuition, or one that people acquire after being *taught* dualistic concepts and worldviews?
I feel like a lot of people's arguments on this article boil down to:"We can't possibly be just a brain because that makes me feel bad. Therefore there must be some special magic powder that makes us different from a computer, because that makes me feel good. Checkmate."
im not saying something outside the brain is doing the interpretation. you bend the antena on the tv the signal is still there but the picture is messed up. i think consciousness is a fundamental part of the universe. its not outside it, it is it. the physical universe is a manifestation of consciousness the same way that a dream is a manifestation of your consciousness. just at different levels. and dont mistake this for me telling you how it is. this is how I think it is. 
in your opinion you need a brain to have consciousness? I believe plants have some level of conciousness for example. 
Correlation does not imply causation. I agree with RadRussian, its flat out naive to *assume* our awareness is produced and contained within the brain simply because we correlate areas of the brain with mind-body states, just like its naive to assume a computer application is produced and contained within a monitor just because we correlate different areas of the GUI with features of the program. If you smash the monitor with a hammer of course the GUI's functionality will be affected. 
It says beliefs are products of culture+evolution+brain chemistry. I fail to see how it doesn't reconcile with other philosophy.
If you go deeper, atoms are made from protons and neutrons and electrons and you can still go deeper and look more closely. Everything that *is* is made from the same fabric but yet so miraculously different.
I don't think you understand that the brain is all you. Your desires and cravings would entirely be in the brain. Whilst other things may develop after the fact, it is still you.
He essentially thinks that once we learn more about how the brain works we will understand the exact nature of consciousness, so it won't be a problem in the sense that Chalmers meant when he coined the term.
That would imply our computers, or for that matter any system which exchanged information, produces a kind of consciousness as well. 
The capacity for subjective experience most likely is favored, but I think most people are interested in the mechanism which allows subjective experience to occur.
That is what makes the question so hard: even IF the trait is selected in evolution (and it seems there must be at least some evolutionary aspects, otherwise why would pain be subjectively "bad" and pleasure "good"?) why does it "feel like something" to be that system, rather than it just being a bunch of mindless atoms and molecules interacting with one another?In other words, the fundamental question is not if it's a side-effect, it almost certainly is.  But why does it "feel like something"?
Yeah, maybe you're the software that got downloaded into the hardware that is the brain when you were born, and it constantly uploads backups to a different unit when you sleep, so that if you die you get installed in a different hardware or something.
While meditating you can experience pure awareness.
 That's the argument behind the last thursday theory or whatever that is called. Basically you have no way to prove your memories are true and everything you know wasn't put into place yesterday.
I see - so you're more of an idealist? What then, is "the table" when 5 conscious beings are standing in a room touching a table?  Is the table consciousness?  If so, how does this help us learn about the nature of reality in comparison to physics and neuroscience?  In a dream, for example, there is no mind-independent table, so the analogy seems to break there.Please don't take my questioning as an assertion in the opposite direction - I am genuinely curious.
No. You can be very self-unaware and perform reactions.Cells perform thousands of reactions in minutes, none of them are conscious reactions.
eliminative materialists believe that "beliefs" are a part of folk psychology and have no place in mature neuroscience. they believe "beliefs" do not really exist. Insofar as "belief" is a central notion in epistemology it is quite radical. and incoherent I might add.
And those guys are working really hard to keep us together. True bro love and respect 
I remember reading a reddit comment a while back: "We are the universe experiencing itself."
I'm more interested in the why. Evolutionarily speaking, why does our brain assemble this experience for us?
I know it's been said a million times before, but I would recommend googling what is like to be a bat if you're looking for an argument as to why pure science may not be able to tell us much about consciousness, it is much more based on experience than anything. 
Yes, but if a bot plays World of Warcraft, all that code and art and 3d colourful landscapes mean nothing to it. The game only becomes a real adventure when a human plays it. A bot (or philosophical zombie) cannot experience any part of the game internally, and so the question remains, why is there a player who has experiences? Why aren't we bots processing the data with nothing going on inside?
show me the chemical or molecule that is responsible for its own "awareness". Show me the gene that lets the brain know its a brain. Until these things can be explained, I think the problem of consciousness remains. 
Ok, but the other side can't say why a brain *could* become conscious. 
This is the scenario that I wish was the case, but I don't think is. It's good to have this input, because it's very aggravating when people think they have consciousness figured out. We have clues as to how it functions, but we're only scratching the surface. That analogy you made reminds me of Graham Hancock's analogy on the subject. He's a fascinating author who has made me question practically everything from this society we live in to the nature of reality. 
Some people who are computer illerate believe computers have consciousnesses who perform actions on their own. They don't really have consciousness but their lack of knowledge creates an illusion that they do. What if our appearance of consciousness is more of our lack of understanding of our brain 
or that consciousness doesn't exist
It's the use of the frontal lobe to simulate metaphysical things. Evolution doesn't favor better or even good things only thing that allow propergation.Advanced simulation of reality is good for survival what it does on the side is just a thing
Why wouldn't it feel like something?
Well, that could explain transsexuals. female software in a male hardware body.
What is so radical about that? Has anything really come from epistemology that is solid enough to fall outside of the realm of folk psych?
This is a tough idea to continually keep together because what if our perception truly does affect how the universe responds and changes?  Oddly the Grateful Dead addressed this in a song in the 1970s called "Eyes of the World."
That's been sort of my thought for a while. What is the Universe without conciousness? This concept would be more complicated should we encounter "intelligent" beings from somewhere else in the Universe. Although I don't think it would completely discount it. As they would have been experiencing a different part of the Universe. 
One of the best attempts at an answer is the Pulitzer Prize-winning book, "Godel, Escher, and Bach". It's the author's attempt at explaining how what we think of as "consciousness" arises naturally from complex groups of neurons. 
It's an basic advantage to understand how other humans in your social group work.  Are they lying, are they jealous? etc...  Given that brains are computational engine for projecting outcomes, what happens when the same hardware is applied to the self?
Yeah, this is simply a poor explanation of the hard problem of consciousness. This is closer to a soft problem of consciousness. Moves the goal posts significantly. It's simply wrong in that it assumes the hard problem goes away with adequate explanation. This is akin to saying, "with more syntax, we'll eventually derive semantics." The hard problem is that science lacks a capacity to discuss qualia, and we cannot figure out a framework that is even capable of discussing both science and qualia. No matter how much science you have, this problem doesn't go away.
> It's depressingPerhaps it's depressing. Perhaps it's liberating.
My interpretation of consciousness is unfalsifiable. It's literally what we are experiencing right now, not free choice or anything like that. 
I think the thought is this (correct me if I'm wrong): planets as far as we know do not experience pain if they smash into each other. Conscious entities, like us, do (usually). Why are conscious entities even equipped with this ability to experience phenomenological things like "pain" when we smash into each other? If we are just a conglomerate of little things, why is it that we differ in this regard when things like planets are also groups of little things?
The Universe, without consciousness, is a field of dead stars spinning, groaning planets twitching and shrugging with volcanism, and black holes rippling towards a final end. Without consciousness, the Universe is exactly what it is, minus a few particularly complicated chemical reactions sloshing around on the surface of one planet - maybe more. It's marvelous, and we're very small. I guess that's how I feel, anyway.
How accessible is that book? 
So what's your definition of subconscious?
Because in order for us to survive, we need to make decisions and take actions based on feelings like pain and pleasure. A planet does not make decisions or take actions.
Perhaps planets are evolving this capability but there just hasn't been sufficient time for this evolution for us to have noticed yet. 
I think a lot about how we won't be missed if at this very moment the earth was destroyed by an asteroid or any other cataclysmic event.  Not only won't we be missed but I think about how meaningless the last seconds of any of our lives really would be.  So the world ends and right beforehand I was sitting in front of a computer pretending to be busy at a job I don't like.  Useless.  Meaningless. 
It's an intimidating work, deep and quite broad in subject matter. The author builds on material as the book progresses and attempts to bring you in from a novice level of simpler concepts so as to ease the burden. But I found myself re-reading whole sections of the book just remind myself what I was even reading about(especially the concept of "enumerably recursive systems") 
How sure of your assertion that planets do not make decisions are you? A planet could be viewed as a large set of numerous smaller systems.
I try to have these kind of conversations with my friends / family, but they are quick to answer blandly and discard the subject...Are things better on your end?
To add some more weight to your point there, I believe you meant "recursively enumerable"
Would enumerably recursive systems be jargon for self reflection and adjustment?
This video explains the difference between philosophical & everyday skepticism, summarizing the thesis for radical/Academic skepticism under the Closure Principle.  It also investigates some of the broader implications of skeptical attitudes, & offers a suggestion for how to cultivate healthy versions of them.
Great video and a wonderful intro to skepticism. I subscribed. 
Im skeptical that this guy is who he says he is, and not Jim Moriarty in disguise. 
The closure principle is bonkers.I know all the axioms and derivation rules of mathematics, but I don't know the proofs of all true theorems in mathematics (as the closure principle will have me believe).This is known as the problem of **LOGICAL OMNISCIENCE**. 
I don't know about this.
I don't know about the rest of you, but my fierce philosophical skepticism has led me directly into understanding the importance of faith and mysticism. Much needed corrective to the broader materialist objective epistemology that dominates bourgeois western thought  
The way I think about it is pretty straightforward. If any actors pushing forward a proposition or narrative have an incentive for said proposition/narrative to be true, then one must be skeptical and demand evidence. Not much more to it.
So help me out here, is it OK to be skeptical that humans are the sole reason for global warming, and it wouldn't have happened without us?  
Skepticism is often confused with ignorance. It's amazing how many people mistake their own ignorance for valid skepticism. For example, people calling themselves "climate skeptics" are actually being ignorant of a over a century of climate research. They aren't practicing any skepticism at all. You should always ask yourself whether you're being skeptical or whether you're being ignorant. They feel the same but there is a big difference between the two.
First time I've ever seen a "Thunk" and looking forward to more.edit--holy shit there's already 113 more.
Loved it. You dun great 
Hmmm. I don't believe you. 
That's what skeptics **DO.**
That's not what the principle claims. It only implies that we are *in a position to know*, not that we *actually do know.*
You know, you just don't know that you know. 
Are you being sarcastic or serious?
Unfortunately, almost every actor pushing forward a proposition has at least one thing to gain: attention. Not a very useful heuristic by itself in practice. Looking at how much incentive they have can be one factor in your estimation, but I'd strongly disagree with "not much more to it". 
I'm planning on doing something specifically on Nozick's epistemology at some point in the future - great stuff.
Of course... just cause people might disagree or worse, downvote you, doesn't mean you can't be wary about something. Their disagreement is in no way evidence to the contrary. I say this mostly because I believe that humans played a very little role in climate change. Majority of people I talk to about this disagree with me but it hasn't ever stopped me from believing it. I've seen the evidence I've seen and have seen other produce (to me) insufficient evidence to say other wise. 
You said that "what someone says isn't a fact, it is hearsay." However, what someone says could be both a fact and an opinion. It's not an either/or situation. Also, Descartes doesn't assume God, he throws God out as well in Meditations on First Philosophy 1 and 2. I think these are the most valuable ones, because it's only after that that he "proves" God's existence.To "give up and simply accept that which is evidence-based" sounds a whole lot like Descartes and video guy's stance to me.
This is a great correction, TY!
So don't get invested in any ideas - basically don't have beliefs - that way you don't have a problem tossing them for the sake of harmony?Eh, nice idea, but I'm not getting bent out of shape over it.
I'll get u more information...
Eh, there are a lot of variations on it. There isn't a singular form of closure, and often in terms of skepticism and skeptical arguments, the knowledge of p does in fact imply knowledge of q with the knowledge that p -> q. It does happen this way. Though the reasonable forms of it are the ones such as what you suggest, they provide different types of justifications from the form that /u/intuser is talking about.
? Seriously? Don't be an asshole
I don't think that's necessarily true. We make matter of fact statements all the time, like "it's sunny out," or "the sky is blue". There aren't incentives involved in these statements. I'll grant that the degree of the incentive certainly matters and I oversimplified on that ground.
Thank you, I feel the same. And it's not that I'm not educated (masters degree in engineering). I just think that there are so many variables, it's just too difficult to be 100% sure one way or another.     
When someone says something, it is a fact that they said it, but there's no reason to accept what they say as factual unless evidence aligns with it.Honestly, it has been a while since I read Descartes, but it was a really strong takeaway at the time.  I've still got a copy, I'll give it another go.
You could have beliefs, the problem is getting emotionally invested in them. Sometimes really smart people, who are known for their ideas, tend view those ideas as extensions of themselves so when they are attacked, they too feel under siege. 
I'm not sure knowledge through faith can really be called knowledge. You can come to conflicting conclusions through faith, and so I don't think reasonable people can consider that "knowing" something.
Knowledge of rocket science helps me build rockets. In hindsight, I know that I didn't take my knowledge of rocket science on faith, because I wouldn't have been able to build the rocket otherwise. I know that my knowledge of rocket science is true because it helped me build the rocket. Whether I've built a rocket is a demonstrable reality. Not sure how any faith is involved here.  
>but my fierce philosophical skepticism has led me directly into understanding the importance of faith and mysticismThis is an oxymoron though. To adopt mysticism means to leave behind any shred of skepticism.And to be fair>Much needed corrective to the broader materialist objective epistemology that dominates bourgeois western thoughtThis is a pretty big word salad of a sentence.
>We make matter of fact statements all the time, like "it's sunny out," or "the sky is blue".And I'm not skeptical of them because of reasons such as1) easily verifiable2) I know it's true to begin with3) this doesn't really matter so I don't give a shit**not** because I don't think people don't have an incentive to lie about "matter of fact" things. Little kids lie about random shit all the time because it's a really "cool" fact that gets them to wow their friends. Or people exaggerate how shitty the weather was in their story to make it more interesting. 
Yeah one of the biggest things that made me question it was the taxes they plan on putting in place. Some people may disagree but I've always been one to question and heavily research anything that has a tax associated with it. Why the need for a tax, who's the money going to, who has connections to companies receiving the subsidies, who/what benefits and who doesn't. This tax seems more of a way to get subsidies into select people's companies. I'm all for clean energy but I just don't like the way they're going about creating this change. 
How do you know all that? What proof is there? 
You make this sound like your skepticism about climate change has to do with your skepticism about taxes. The taxes do not enter into why the science is correct, unless you think the data is manufactured to justify taxes which would be on the conspiratorial without evidence end of things.
Re: your observation on Buddhism.The concept of the Self in Buddhism is radically different from what the psychoanalytic school (broadly speaking) presumes as a given. So I am not sure your assertion is valid. Yes, you can read Buddhism using psychoanalytic theories of all kinds, but the vector of approach and analysis that these two ways of thinking adopt are vastly different.
Are you suggesting that I can't know whether I could have built the rocket without knowledge of rocket science?
Hence why I called it a critique of Buddhism and noted their diametrically opposed more often than not. Or am I missing something? 
Can you dilate a little on some of those diametric positions? As much as I like Buddhism, I never really delved that deep into it.
You can't even know the first thing about it. A few examples:1) how do you know what a rocket is2) how do you know your memory of the event is correct3) how do you know there is any physical substrate to build anything out of at alland on and on. It's so extensive it almost doesnt even make sense to try to invent specific examples. It's just basally faulty. 
I don't truly know the answers to any of those questions. I could very well be living in a computer simulation and my rocket could actually be bits of computer code.However, I do know that the rocket operates on the laws of physics which are internally consistent in the context of the observable universe. In other words, I might not know whether I'm in a simulation but I do know that said simulation operates according to internally consistent rules if indeed I'm actually living in a simulation.
Human rights are nothing more than a social construct; something that humans decide for themselves. If they weren't, every living thing would make a set of "rights" for themselves. It is *nothing* more than just the legal basis. Otherwise, it then suggests a higher power of sorts, creationism, etc that implies nature deems human rights necessary.No, we made them up, we have taken them away, and we are inventing new "rights" all the time.
I don't think they are enough, I'm just saying that they are the main engine for people not doing bad shit to other people. I think humans are altruistic by nature but the world we have create thus far tends to make you hard and give a propensity to do wrong to other for you own benefit or just because becomes more prevalent. Moral goodness and being raised right are good tethers to keep you from doing wrong but laws are the wall.
Pshhh Anarchists have been having this discussion for decades.*Insert George Carlin quote here.*
We do not receive our rights from Government. We receive our rights through Natural Law. Through Sovereign Law. Its important to acknowledge, VERY IMPORTANT to acknowledge, that Government is not the provider of rights. We are born with natural, life-given rights that are often subjected to greedy hands of men trying to control them. If you have to ask for a right from Government, you're doing it wrong. 
How can something "transcend" a law anyway? Something is made law because of an human necessity. Stronger the need, stronger the law.
Human rights precede the law, as the law (limited right to violence) was invented to protect human rights.  
Proper rights are objectively derived, and have been known to have been for centuries. It's not culture, and it shouldn't be considered that somehow rights were only defined by a legal basis.
There are no global "Human Rights" that exist. There are no "Human Rights" inside of law, only law. 
You know what protects people more then morals, religious fear and hate in general combine?!?! Laws that's right folks. People don't want to get introuble. 
I argued about this on a United post. Ya, legally, dude shoulda got off the plane. But that shit is fucked as far as human rights go. You can speak it sophisticated or like me, but universally we all know that shit is fucked. Problem is you can't define morality. I wouldn't say human rights are supported by law. That shit is CONTROLLED by law. We're on a slippery slope folks. We already pretty much slaves. 
No, culture has nothing to do with Human Rights...remember...if it did then queer marriage would NOT be legal.  Our culture condemned it for centuries and the majority still do in this country.
If you are interested in more philosophy concerning the state of what is legal and power structures, I would highly recommend Giorgio Agamben's *Homo Sacer*. It mentions that in dictatorships, actions considered exceptions to the law become the rule. He encourages a watchful eye upon what is considered an exception to law and what is considered the rule.
While there is truth to that, I think it also avoids the question of whether the law can be beneficial in establishing morality. Can the law be a useful tool in making rights universal? Should the law be considered when making judgements about what is or is not moral?
Hitler and MLK are really popular on Reddit these days 
> It's society as a whole that determines rightsWhen do individual people become "society" (The heap problem)?If I believe we don't have a right to self-determination, but do to free ponies, does that invalidate your point ("iff people agree").
I fundamentally disagree with this article. I know a lot of people from college who grew up middle class in china. None of them felt any type of general unease at government control. We, as westerners, have rights ingrained in our society to the point where we know rights abuses when we see them. I don't think that this comes from human nature. I think it's culture internalizing legislation. Anti discrimination laws will become unnecessary at some point not because we are unbiased by nature but because western culture has used legislation to change the culture.
Hmm. The problem I see with that reasoning is that societies often sacrfice the minority in favor of the majority. The society of Nazi Germany, for instance, would have very different definitions of human rights, or at least of humans,  than us. 
Hey, someone who actually gets it. I was formulating a reply in my mind when I came across your post; well said.
Capitalism. It made it ok for people to take advantage of other people for their own benefit. Other's ignorance shouldn't be exploited, unless they've consented. Bc Violence. In that case, we must then decide if they are competent enough to make a logical decision. If they are not, what then?When will the violence and control stop?
But morals are a societal construct as well, so that doesn't really change matters.
I was just thinking this. Ancaps for example derive ,dare I say, all rights from bodily autonomy.
You only have the rights you can enforce, via political persuasion or force, or those given by benefactors. They only exist when someone else recognises them, benevolent or not, and enforces them.
So, you're a utilitarian?
Not all laws come out of necessity.
One example might be how we view women's rights in Saudi Arabia. Legally, they don't have many, but there is a general perception in the West that that is a problem. That's a case where the idea of rights transcends what is legally true.
The law, as such, was invented to protect the interests of a limited caste of people. You could say the law evolved to protect human rights, though.
I am afraid there is UN declaration of Human Rights. And that is enforced.
That would make them not human, and actually not rights either. What you believe in are 'privileges for some'.
Are you talking about the U.S.? Because the majority of citizens support it. The public support of it combined with key victories in various states is what led the supreme Court to hear the case in the first place.Now go look at a country that does not have a majority of their citizens support gay marriage: chances are it isn't legal there. That alone disproves the idea of human rights existing independently of concepts and values of society. If they truly we're independent and existed regardless, then gay marriage would be legal everywhere.
I fucking loved Agamben's *Homo Sacer* and am now skeptical of any human rights discourse.
> Should the law be considered when making judgements about what is or is not moral?No, that reverses the relationship law has with justice: law serves justice, it doesn't determine it.
Morality should and is considered when making judgements about what is and is not legal. Come on, don't be a little kid. Where do you think laws come from?
I agree that culture ultimately determines rights, but I'm curious as well if law can shape culture to the extent that norms themselves might change.
> How could you have universal rights if different cultures can't agree on them?This is exactly my point. I think there are very few (if any) rights that are truly universal. 
Consensual relationships. Thats capitalism.Anything else  is not. And any other system lacks consensual relationships
Argue for that.
> Human rights are delusional in the same way that traffic lights are delusional. Just because something is a human social construct doesn't mean it's contradictory with reality.Precisely. I don't get this proclivity among people who think they're very smart to presume that anything emerging from human consciousness or design is less 'real' than things that exist independently of human consciousness/design.It's a bizarre sort of axiomatic belief that I see far too often. Is it a kind of aggressive rationalism? 
You have natural given rights at birth. The right to eat, live, drink, and be without violence. Granted, it may be perceived otherwise simply b/c of the overreach of greedy, lustful men to control you, but the bottom line is.... nobody tells the fawn that it cant drink from the river. Nobody tells the bird that there is a no-fly zone. Nobody tells the elephant he goes to jail if he eats something. Nature, by nature (no pun intended) has inherent rights by simply existing, and we are no different than the natural that created us. 
Nope.  Jeremy Bentham was. I just think his response is brilliant.  The notion of rights falls apart as quickly as they are trampled upon.  Tell David Dao about his fourth amendment rights.  Fairy dust.  Or maybe his rights exist if a court decides they do, huh?
Most come from money. 
Isn't that because for the Western context the situation in SA is not, in fact, legally true (by which I mean it would not be legal to deny those rights Saudi deny women over here)? Our perspective that it's a problem correlates with our laws.
The law restricts the right to violence. Law is universally appealing (even thieves want the booty shared fairly.)  It allows voluntary relationships to flourish and markets to form and thrive.  Law and contracts existed prior to the first city-states. Of course, if an elite group has the *social authority* to redefine law it tends to get defined to benefit some over others.  Decentralization might be an approach forward. 
UN is now global?
if any person legally losing a right means it's not a right, then there are no rights. (which I think is true, partially for this reason). there is no right so sacrosanct that the govt won't take it from you in the right circumstances
Oh that's what I believe in? News to me. I'm more speaking along the lines of child rapists and murderers. I believe you void your "human rights" when you take away someone else's for personal gain. 
Been reading him on the backs of Foucalt's Order of Things, History of Sexuality and the essay portfolio *Biopower*.Very interesting how contemporary power Dynamics work. It also makes me realize how thin the line between freedom and tyranny is. 
Definitely could. Morality and rights are seen as subjective but I believe and have evidence that it is objective.
Violence and the threat of violence are always indicators of rights violations. So you do not have the right to rob someone.A murkier case would be the con artist.
This is quite simple from where I'm sitting... There is a very small set of universal desires and we all agree that these should be considered "rights"... everything else is and always will be argued about ad infinitum.
Ah so it's an antiquated idea, derived from religion, that has no rational basis; a pleasing fiction that exists only in our minds.
>nobody tells the fawn that it cant drink from the riverJust watch some nature document that shows what happens when the source of water are low.>Nobody tells the bird that there is a no-fly zone. Just other birds. They can be quite territorial.>The right to eat, live, drink, and be without violence.Have you ever seen nature outside of ZOO? 
This is just simplistic. If you actually hold views like this, wow.
Do yourself and us a favour and read up on what law actually is, how it came to be, and whom it actually granted rights early in its history.
Eergh... Yes...?Or you mean than not every nation has pledged to follow UN requirements? True. Like North Korea, for example. That does not do them much good though, as the principles of UN still are enforced in one way or the other, if not directly, then indirectly (via sanctions, for example).> There are no "Human Rights" inside of law, only law.Is just false for the countries which obey UN requirements. 
Note that, in such an instance, they are not fighting the dictator's troops with the intention to murder them, but to stop them, to break their opposition. If the dictator's troops surrender, they would not kill them. So in this instance, they are not denying their right to live, but their right to forcibly protect a man who does just that, and their right to oppose those who want to stop him.
So no right to a fair trial?
if it can be taken away, how is it a right? 
As a Derrida fan, I'd ask you to consider how separate those two categories are?
What evidence is that?
Should 'measurably good' policy be subject to similar protections of rights? By measurably good I mean that there is significant empirical evidence that demonstrates that the policy impacts society in a positive manner relative to not having the policy. 
That's not what is stated at all. Religion is mentioned, but certainly not related to religion at all. 
Have you ever thought for yourself outside of Government provided education?
That's not a human right, that's a constitutional right. He's saying if your going to take someone's life or innocence then you can't be upset if someone does the same to you.
To be honest, just reading the replies to my comments, I truly can't wrap my head around the way you folks think. I'm a fairly compassionate person, but for you people to feel compassion for people that don't deserve it truly boggles my mind. It's almost like you all have Stockholm's syndrome. 
Do we not have the right to live as soon as we are born? So wouldn't it be inherent that if you void another's right then yours would be voided as well?
That's not quite accurate. The Bill of Rights applies to any person on American soil, citizen or not. Furthermore the distinction you've laid out seems quite meaningless. Human rights are rights an person has, even if that concept is difficult to define. Citizen rights are positive liberties reserved for members of a certain state. I see no conflict here.
That's actually very much the point of Agamben's work, Derrida is a big influence on him.
Never read Derrida, so I think you will know better than I. 
I can give a small summary but the rest will be published in an paper at some point. So if you are genuinely curious, we can talk a short bit on it otherwise I am not interested in an argument in which you already feel has zero chance of changing your mind.
What do you mean - "how"?The way that there are so many more things that exist the way they do regardless of our ideas about them.The "Human Rights", "God", the value of money - all those things are pure fiction and have meaning even not to all Humans, but only to those who believe they exist.The atomic bomb will explode no matter what - will you or will you not brilliantly argument proving that it does not exist. That way even a simple stone is millions of times more 'real' than any "God" humanity has ever come forward with.As simple as that.
Lol are you serious? It comes from the days when people thought the big man in the sky had created everything and the universe ran according to the ticking of his cosmic clock. You take away the Deity and the idea of natural rights no longer has any solid foundation.
Do you even see the irony in that statement?
if you think some people don't deserve compassion, I don't consider you a compassionate person. but regardless, that's nothing to do with the topic here. what do rights have to do with compassion? if only some people have it, how can it be a right? 
Well, how separate are any two things we consider binary? 
I absolutely agree that justice is relative, although I think it's less relative than you are suggesting. But it is because it is so relative that we must be so cautious with the law, working to build consensus and not being so eager to criminalize those things where consensus is weak.
But you said a right is that which "cannot be taken from you without actual harm" i.e. someone has to forcibly take them from you.  Not something that when violated "feels unfair in a very basic sense"  i.e. something we have a strong intuition about.  Would seem your initial definition of human rights would preclude property rights.  So you'd either have to give up on property, or take a second look at your definition.
The bird has the natural right to fly, the cheetah the right to run, the Buffalo to graze freely. These are natural rights. The Spaghetti monster your so adamant to attack, does not. What are you on about? 
I said people don't have aright to fair trial?
Somewhat, but it's based in logic. If you have killed you have shown that you do not value life. Therefore, your life has no value and for someone to take it would mean nothing.
My only statement  is that at a certain point, you've done enough evil to void your "basic human rights"
I wasn't really considering tyranny and freedom binary. I was mainly speaking in light of how most people categorize freedom and tyranny are night and day, but the boundary between the two is very thin. 
Your response almost mimics what I thought as I wrote my post: perspective.  Justice being relative is all about the perspective you take when you look at it and as I wrote it felt like I was going in and out of thinking about justice locally versus nationally or regionally.  As you said, it may be less relative, and I agree.  Somewhere along the construction of justice those individual concepts/principles get molded in with someone else's, and so on making it more applicable to broader folks.  Your point is well taken.  Nice chatting 
Yes. As well as any other rights included in our understanding of human rights.
You don't stop being human when you hurt others, this kind of thinking only mythologizes the worst among us into some sort of monsters. They are not monsters, at least in the literal sense. I know this strips away a sort of reassuring thought that you or other people you perceive as normal would never do horrible things, but that's a delusion. We are all capable of what you call evil. This is why people are shocked their loved one would, say, molested children.
I think he was going further and suggesting that anythings that are binary have no real boundary. Though i may be putting words in mouths.
I don't remember where I read it but someone suggested (as a thought experiment) that the best law would be the one written by a group of people with artificially induced temporary amnesia of their own circumstances (technology we lack of course), forcing them to consider all perspectives equally since they never know which role they would play once they get back to their lives in society.
That's a bit of a stretch. I'm just trying to understand how you folks have such strong sympathy for evil. You must have never seen it in person. 
I'm fully aware that every human is capable of being a monster given the right circumstances, you're very right, I've seen this first hand. However when a person isn't fighting for their life, or their survival in an austere environment, and just plain enjoys hurting others, they're not human. I'm sorry, no matter how you try to swing that, some people are not fixable, and are animals, and need to be dealt with accordingly.
Probability theory is not the same thing as game theory...
I believe you have missed a fifth premise:That the act of belief carries along with it no cost during your lifetime.If there is a "cost" to believing (in other words, having to spend every Sunday in church, or socialising in different circles resulting in fewer secondary benefits) then that should also be factored into the equation.
Pascal's wager is pretty weak tbh... Especially in its intended purpose (the God example). Believing in an all knowing God just for the sake of saving your skin, I think the all knowing God would see through that. But that's just the beginning. To believe in any one God is now betting against the other 40,000 
>*The believer is confident their position is the safe one. If right, reward! If wrong, nothing!*Except their position is still unsafe, if you waste your life in a belief for "nothing".  Especially if your true beliefs are suppressed when they conflict with what's believed about God's Wishes.If there's no God and you've lived a life miserably following teachings of a non-existent God, you've actually lost infinity plus the years you've spent following a false life.  Mathematically, the wager is in atheism's favor in all circumstances where insufficient proof of God exists.
Why do we have so few references to either the primary source or to appropriate secondary sources on a "clarification" thread?Why should I, the reader believe that you understand Pascal and his purposes any better than anyone else?
A couple of things I want to address...>  This is probability theory This is known as Expected Value (EV)> Every bet a casino ever offers you favors them in the long run.This is false.  Casino's do offer some neutral EV bets where neither side has the edge.  For example, when you take odds on a number at a craps table you are placing a neutral EV bet.  The casino isnt bothered though since the first bet you made (Pass/Dont Pass/Come/Dont Come) already has the EV edge that they need. 
Small quibble with you.If the reason for the wager is to take the question of God's existence seriously, that would be a de facto argument as to why one should believe in God.I don't believe Pascal's wager gets you even to taking the question "seriously", for some of the reasons you cite.  That is, it doesn't even get you your lesser conclusion.At least we agree that game theory is awesome.
I dont necessarily agree with the 3rd because, weather or not were talking about conscious choice you cant argue the facts like the sky is a shade of blue or quarters are 1/4 a dollar, just based on "belief" it actually required more faith to believe something untrue as opposed to something that is true. (just a subjective thought) 
If the investment is less than the return multiplied by the likelihood of success, you take the bet. The principle governs everything from poker to political science.
This still has some of the fatal flaws of the flawed wager. For example, any absurd God you can posit might have similar potential outcomes (I.e. you should believe that god is a 4 foot tall elephant in a clown wig or he will send you to hell") and using your version of Pascals Wager, we would have to take each of these propositions equally seriously, even if we end up deciding against them. This wager would have us spending all of our time carefully weighing nonsense propositions.
> Belief is the involuntary result of inspecting evidence. We cannot force our minds to believe X or Y. We just do or don't.I've basically studied no philosophy (hi from r/all).  Is this widely agreed upon?
>. If I offered you a billion dollars to believe President Obama is a good president, you could not actually believe that he is.That part is incorrect based on how our beliefs are formed.  If an Obama hater had the desire to do so, they could surround themselves in liberal echo chambers and listen to a bunch of people explain why Obama was good and the probability is very high that they will begin to fully believe this.This is why propaganda works.(Case in point:  This is *exactly* what Russia is being accused of doing for Trump.)
maybe taking the question of god's existence seriously is what sends an individual to hell for eternity.  Pascal's wager inevitably leads to absurdity if you follow its logic consistently.
Best answer here.  My reply to the pascal wager theists is always "you can make any shit up and be like..... see it's better if you believe this because the elves bring you cake".
I've heard an example called "Pascal's Mugging". It goes like this:Pascal is out walking one night, when a man yanks him into a dark alley. "Give me all your money right now," says the man, "and there is a finite chance I'll give you infinite money tomorrow."Pascal, recognizing the scenario, happily hands over his wallet.I find that this illustrates the flaws in Pascal's wager very well.
Pascal's wager also is a monotheistic centric argument. What if I choose the wrong God? What if millions of them could exist? 
I'd suggest that Pascal knew of all of these shortcomings, which is why he never published the Wager.  It wasn't until after his death that the *Pensees* were published, and the were fragments, at that.  We base Pascal's Wager entirely on something that was either incomplete, known to be flawed, or both.  Why it's still bandied about boggles my mind.
Suddenly I crave apples.
But you don't have to spend finite time, you can rape and kill and steal your entire life and repent last second.
To be fair everybody is an idiot compared to Fermat. 
> But there is an infinitesimal chance that gods existI think it is flawed to attribute probability to something like "gods". It doesn't seem applicable because gods are, by (most people's) definition, not measurable by any sort of normal means. Trying to apply any sort of probability to an argument about something metaphysical seems incoherent to me.For instance, where is this "calculation" coming from?
Good point, but there's one problem. Infinity doesn't behave like a number. Infinity squared isn't bigger than infinity.Infinity +2 is still infinity.
Except by being an atheist you are placing atheistically mutually exclusive bets because god could only reward atheists with heaven. So even assuming that that bet is worth it, the odds of your atheism being rewarded are exactly the same, canceling out all possibility for theistic rewards.
That's not entirely true. You are assuming by believing in a god that doesn't exist you are expensing finite resources for zero gain.  However many people experience gains that exceed their expended resources by joining a religious organization.  Many people find a sense of community and friends.  Many find help from people from their religious community when they are down.  That's also part of Pascals wager that many forget.  There isn't zero gain by believing in a non existent god.
One could conceive as the possibilities being either God or no God. The question is the manner through which God has revealed himself to man. So it's not that an infinite number of different gods could be the correct one, but rather a question of how God has revealed himself in a number of possible ways. Arguably, God would have reveal himself in one of the major religions that currently exist, therefore making the major religions more likely than the infinite number of other obscure possibilities.
> Pascals wager is that you risk finite time, effort, and tithe for a possibility at infinite return.The actual wager is that you risk finite time, effort, and tithe for a possibility at a literal infinity of possibilities, none of which can be determined as more likely than the other. The "wager" is pure obfuscation.
Unless religious lack of mental freedom personally sickens you. In that case 'playing dumb' is a form of self torture.
Interesting perspective, thank you.
You are literally arguing against what he called the "flawed wager." What point are you exactly trying to make?
Why do you expect "Hate" from religious people?  Most have loving and sharing intentions.  If I knew Dairy Queen was handing out free ice cream cones, and I told you because I saw that you didn't have one, would you think that's because I hate you?
Why the choice of the word "vehement"?  I'm more of a quiet atheist myself.
> If the reason for the wager is to take the question of God's existence seriously, that would be a de facto argument as to why one should believe in God.It'd be an argument in favor of belief in God, but not necessarily one that can be compelling on its own.
The point is that the flawed wager IS a nonsense proposition. 
As a response to Pascal's Wager, I've always liked "well, I've never told you this before, but the truth is that I'm the guy that decides who goes to Heaven and who goes to Hell. Give me $20 and I can guarantee you a place in Heaven. $20 for a potentially infinite reward, that's worth the risk right?"
He literally discussed this in his original post.
Isn't this specifically mentioned in the op? 
That's the strongest point in my opinion. In order to actually possess a valid perspective, you would have to believe in every religion that has ever existed with equal devotion to each one. 
This right here. This is why Pascal's wager doesn't work. If you bet even *one* of your chips on black at the roulette table, but....the roulette table has been closed down for decades, and everyone is playing blackjack, then you lose. Besides, spending your free time worshipping, researching, and donating to a god/church is not comparable to spending a single chip at a casino. It takes lots of time, faith, resilience, and dedication. I'm not saying "don't do it." I'm just saying that it's not the same as spending one penny and getting $5.
What do you mean by this? What's an instance of untestable probability?
Yep. I don't understand how someone can just stop believing one thing and start believing another thing unless some evidence is presented that shows the established viewpoint to be flawed.
Being out of the pot is not a bet. It's conservation of your bankroll when the house percentage is against you.
> "God who only accepts people who don't worship one" view which would be a paradox.Why is that a paradox? Some sects believe that non-believers will be accepted into heaven/paradise, but believing in the wrong God will get you punished for eternity. In that case, then atheism is the safer bet, because why risk picking the wrong one or betting that the one you were born into just happens to be the right one?
You are restricting your view to a handful of religions (albeit common ones). There are many existing "pots" that don't strictly require you to believe anything to reap a "reward" after life - just behave in a simple manner, and/or cultivate your "spiritual self".Plus there's an infinity of imaginable "pots" that may either give rewards to anyone, or no one, or some subsets of people independently of belief, or even strictly punish fake/opportunistic believers.
What about the god that only rewards you for being an atheist?
> The main thing I'm confused about is, if you believe and follow a diety(or dieties) you inherently have a hand in the pot; those ignoring any diety (like atheists and others do) don't even seem to be placing a bet at all. The only explanation that they are in the pot is the "God who only accepts people who don't worship one" view which would be a paradox.How is that a paradox though? Why is "wanting to be worshipped" an inherent necessary characteristic of a god?
If you consider that non-belief might result in only a limbo-like state whereas false belief can result in eternal torture, then non-belief is a valid strategy.
&infin; is merely a variable representing a number that is infinitely large. How they behave when taken to the limit of infinity determines how functions of them behave.L'Hopital can explain it better than I can.This one converges to 0. You're not getting your wager back.
Albeit it's harder to argue about infinitesimal risks when finite people are being documented as dying horribly.
Well, yeah. Pascal just didn't want to admit that he was capable of higher math but incapable of distancing himself from populist peer pressure.
Lol, it's not $20! It's 10% of your gross wage! (Tithe for a catholic)
That's what every religion does, yet 98% of Americans buy into it. 
cant they just say i believe in god but not you/our deal(authority)?
Sure, but have you considered that God may exist and has no interest in your belief or devotion, but in your character and actions?
>If you bet even *one* of your chips on black at the roulette table, but....the roulette table has been closed down for decades, and everyone is playing blackjack, then you lose.Not really. If it's closed down no one is taking that chip so all you need to do is pick it back up on go on your way. What you're looking at is a quarter slot machine (or any vending machine) that isn't plugged in but it takes your quarter anyway and you can't get it back. 
> Christianity's sell-everything-you-own and "stop whining" approach to totalitarianism or bullying (in the form of 'turn the other cheek' which is pretty bad advice for a lot of scenarios) has always put me off.Many argue that those shouldn't be taken literally and are misinterpreted.  Jesus also whipped Jews who were money-changing in a temple.  Maybe "turn the other cheek" just means you should try to make peace with your enemy, not just let them destroy you.  Maybe "sell everything you own" just means give up importance of worldly possessions.
No kidding!! This behaviour is all too rare and needs to be normalized. No shame in getting things wrong. 
There are lots of things that aren't quite untestable, but that can only be tested once, like "what's the chance I will die tomorrow?"As for actually untestable, you can consider the state of objects that are far enough away from us in the universe so that their light will never reach us, which, to the best of my knowledge, physicists believe exist.
What if there is a god, but he's petty and unfit to judge but is somehow still god?Recognizing that something is not just doesn't prove it's not true.I'm atheist btw. But not because i don't like the versions of god set up by religion. Because the reasons set up for belief are inadequate.  
Unless you consider that people, or maybe life in general, is a disease on a cosmic scale which makes us the ultimate evil. Being kind and aiding your fellow human would then be exacerbating the issue and only misanthropy would be considered "good." 
I've never lost any money at craps.I've never played craps.I'm probably above average in gross profit from craps. 
Now you're weighing the truth-claims of one sect vs another, taking the question seriously per OP, and answering it according to your morality, weighing what type of a god you believe would be just.
I don't believe such a god exists.
Guaranteed limbo over possibilities of eternal Heaven or Hell? I agree, I might very well make the conscious choice not to believe in gods rather than risk it.(Furthermore, I heard that there are no non-human animals in Abraham's Heaven. Screw that place.)
What's converging here? You can't speak of limits of just anything; you need a function of some kind.
Catholics don't tithe.  Besides the weekly collection, where people usually throw a couple bucks at most in the basket, parishes have bingo nights, pasta dinners and the like to raise needed money ... because we don't tithe.
What if god exists, but heaven and hell do not exist?
Or maybe there is a god but is not even sentient and acts more as mother nature?
This is the best advice. Invest in a proverbial index fund of spirituality, and you can't go wrong. Priests hate him! 
The problem is that it's a message being misrepresented in that case, not a metaphor/analogy/moral. I mean choosing to interpret certain parts of religious text a way that is not even being expressed is just doubling down on not using critical thinking in any capacity.
Lookin' good!
Not quite. Psychology often fails us, and we often are led to believe what we want to believe. A large reason for the spread of Christianity in some areas of Europe include its promises of resurrection and other benefits that trumped those of other religions. Submitting to confirmation bias does _not_ make Pascal's Wager a better method of decision-making. 
The misattributed Marcus Aurelius quote touched on this. You ought not to worship an unjust god. _Rebel_, fight back, or suffer. Either way you lived a more virtuous life than that of one who submits to that unjust god.It should not be taken as claim of disproof. Its an acknowledgement of resistance in this one outcome.
My stance comes down to this: if there is a god and it requires my belief in it and worship of it for salvation, it is not a benevolent god and I choose damnation over worship of a malevolent being. I've not had any evangelist give a sensical response to that yet. 
Okay now I must argue my position per the rules of this thread. Don't do asshole things and the universe will not be a an asshole to you. That's how I perceive don't b an asshole. Thank you for your time spent reading my contemplation of not being an asshole 
> (Furthermore, I heard that there are no non-human animals in Abraham's Heaven. Screw that place.)My wife stopped believing in heaven/god when she was a 9-10 year old and her devout Mother told her that there were no animals in heaven, nor were they allowed.
This is essentially the same as the proof that shows the cardinality of rational numbers is the same as natural numbers is the same as integers.
It's fun to tell Christians that tithing is a strictly Old Testament thing. Christian writings never talk about giving 10% to the church.
Better not take that chance, best to just believe everything. What do you have to lose?
Arguments involve giving reasons.
Am pastor, can confirm. Tithing is not a NT concept (although Jesus has plenty to say about money/greed/charity) and even the OT model of tithing is very different from the "give 10% of your gross to the church" you almost always hear. Frankly, I don't know how we got here from there.
Believe all the things. 
I refer to my reply, lines three , four and five.3, 4, 5 respectively
I'm pretty sure German Catholics have to give about 9% of the wage. In fact I believe it is automatically deducted. (Kirchensteuer, I believe it is called).Tithe literally means "tenth part" it is derived from two old English words, though I don't remember how to spell them.
You do not have a reply in this thread that has five lines.
Waves white flag, hoping she don't come off as an asshole just because she sees it right above ur comment
People really need to stop saying that the Copenhagen interpretation implies that consciousness causes wave function collapse.
Alright guys, I'm AFK hooking myself up to a machine that will kill me if I do not win the lottery, I'll be rich when I wake up and I'll know that the theory was true.Furthermore, the idea of orbiting a black hole at the end of the universe in the dark all by my lonesome sounds kind of elegant in a way.
Isn't a major flaw in this the linking of large macro events to tiny quantum fluctuations? The doomsday device and immortality both just assume that a quantum change will be enough to change our situation enough to avoid death or stop a nuclear attack, but actually that seems very unlikely. Throw myself into a fire and what subatomic change is going to save me? Like many articles it misunderstands quantum uncertainty in a subatomic particle with "any human action or decision is possible".
Despite what others are saying about not experiencing the consciousness of other selves, I found this very intriguing. Does this mean that there exists a universe where no one dies?
Doesn't work, though. You're already in whatever universe you're in. If this is the universe where you die tomorrow, then you're screwed regardless of whether there's another where you live. You don't miraculously become your counterpart in another universe at the moment you would have died. 
Is the article implying that your consciousness and the consciousness of an alternate "you" are the same?
Isn't quantum suicide an experiment we've all performed already? By means of the overwhelmingly slim odds of our own conception and birth? 
Can someone eli5 the notion of measurement in quantum mechanics for me? If a particle can occupy several seemingly contradictory positions before the instant of measurement, how do we know, if we haven't measured them? Or is this a prediction based on theoretical knowledge about the inner workings of physical phenomena within the framework of quantum mechanics? As in, everything we know about the behavior of particles indicates that they occupy such multifarious positions or states, yet we cannot "catch" them in the act or otherwise document that they do so? Thank you for any replies. 
I'm totally new to this sub but I find it utterly fascinating the way science and philosophy intersect.  I guess I've always wrongly grouped philosophy in with religion.
There is one possible counterargument for quantum immortality. If it's impossible to die from your point of view, then eventually you're going to live out even the sun itself and all the stars in the universe. What happens then? Life needs energy output to continue and once we reach the heat death of the universe, there will be no more energy being outputted by anything anymore. Surely that would mean the permanent end of your consciousness unless you could somehow create new energy?
We don't nearly know enough about quantum science to draw this sort of conclusions.
In addition to all the above responses, these thought experiments do not make a clear distinction between possible and imaginable. The total set of possibilities of an event doesn't necessarily include every imaginable outcome. Why should I assume that if I were to attempt to kill myself there is an alternate universe that either is or comes to be in which I survive? That seems a bit vain, personally, but more importantly, not particularly rigorous. 
I definitely don't think many worlds seems intuitive at all, it also doesn't seem like a simpler explanation. This article acts like there's a dichotomy between the two interpretations of quantum physics and invalidating one validates the other. However it's quite possibly neither are correct.
Really interesting. Let's suppose the multiverse theory is actually true, consider the moral implications. None of our actions would have any consequences in the collection of realities. They obviously would in a single world but if we knew that in at least one other universe they wouldn't, how are we going to be able to determine what the current *reality* is?
I find this paradoxical. If after 1000 tries I survive, I'd be pretty confident the many worlds are real, but my assistant waiting outside will not because to him it'll be as unlikely to see me alive whether the many worlds are true or not. How can we logically arrive to different conclusions while having the exact same information?  Or else, what do I know that he doesn't that let me arrive to a different conclusion than his?
One area this does not address is the interesting case of convergence. If all of these splits are happening then eventually chance will dictate that two split universes will converge back into the same one. I think that would be an interesting idea to explore as well.
Permit me to politely disagree. The use of the word "consciousness" in connection with wave function collapse serves an essential purpose: it allows us to distinguish between writers with and without a scientific mindset.
There's a subreddit dedicated to replicating the quantum gun experiment but skipping the shooting yourself part to better their own lives, the name of the sub escapes me at the moment. Basically, according to them, you repeat some exercises until you wake up in a different reality.
I could be wrong, but I think - very basically - it's saying:Because at the quantum level things can be in multiple states at once, then all these infinite versions of yourself are actually the same thing in different states. You are all of your versions at once, it's just that we can only experience one at a time. That's how it seems to me, but as I said, I could be completely wrong.
If you do enough ketamine you eventually experience something along these lines...feeling like you've died and switched to an alternate universe upon sobering up. I experienced my reality change from 3 dimensional, to 2d, to 1d, then as what I can only describe as being a "particle" before blinking out of existence. When I woke up certain things had changed. A relationship and a few known values at work were completely different with no explanation.Purely personal perspective.
What if you create a scenario in which there is on escape for any of your quantum selves?  There wouldn't be a way for your consciousness to "jump ship" to a reality in which you were still alive.  Also, eventually all copies will die.  Why is your consciousness leaping to the longest of the lines?  Even more important, you're consciousness could only diverge around this point of split.  I can't leap to a timeline where the decision of my self was made when I was ten, because that timeline diverged in the past and has now diverged wildly from my current timeline.  
also, I'm not exactly sure what's "elegant" about the idea that *every* quantum interaction in the entire Universe diverges into n parallel Universes (where n is the number of all possible outcomes of that particular interaction), each of them at least as infinitely complex as our own.
Chemist here. You are correct. Nothing to do with consciousness. Observation = measurement. I can give a much more detailed explanation if you'd like.
*Maimed by machine and no longer able to participate in lottery*
>theory was trueNot necessarily, there's also the possibility that the machine malfunctioned. All three are true until the outcome is observed by you: You either wake up rich or you're not.  If the machine worked, you wouldn't know if you didn't win because the you that's you would never wake up, right? 
The theory only works if you assume that the quantum changes save you in the alternate universe. If you don't start with that assumption obviously it is highly unlikely to occur. The point of thought experiments is to assume a theory as valid and to extrapolate scenarios based on that assumption. 
This also implies theres a universe with no memes
Any model that would contain infinite universes would contain a universe where no one has died as well as all possible permutations of dead and alive. The only way it wouldnt is if some law of nature were to make it impossible for immortality to exist
You've completely misunderstood MWI. You should read the wikipedia page on decoherence, there's no reference to consciousness at all.
It doesn't matter, as you and your counterpart are exactly the same person up until that point. The universe splits AT the point you die, so up until that exact moment you essentially have no counterpart (in this particular "universe-line/time-line"). When the universe splits, THEN one of you dies and the other lives. But as you were exactly the same person in terms of memory and thoughts etc up to this point, and as you cannot be "aware" of the universe in which you die *following* death, as far as you're concerned you're always the one who survived. 
Yes. Which is true unless you don't consider your consciousness being the same consciousness as 1 second ago. 
> There's a universe out there where every coin toss ever thrown has been heads.Yeah, but with every coin toss, you decrease the odds by half that you're living in that universe.Go play the lotto. Know that out of a million universes where you decided the play, each of your million selves paid a dollar, a million collective dollars, so that one of the million of you could win half a million dollars.
The universe sure mustve been glad when the first conscious human emerged and instantly (thank nonlocality!) transformed the entire universe from a giant clusterfuck of superposition into a neat set of galaxies behaving mostly according to classical mechanics.
Yes, I would say we have. You could also apply it to our existence on Earth. It's just the right distance from the sun, life was able to evolve/be seeded/whatever, and we haven't been gamma-ray-bursted. By mass alone, odds indicate we should be a big cloud of Hydrogen.
I don't think it would be reasonable to assume that everything will just end. After all - the universe had to come from somewhere. Also, I wouldn't trust the predictive power of modern science on those time scales, as we still don't quite have nailed down what things like dark matter and energy are. Looking at dark energy specifically, it only came into play (overtaking gravity) in the last few billion years. Who knows what other factors may emerge?
What we measure is how the particle affects other particles, which affect other particles until it reaches our eyes/ears/etc. The numbers (0, 1, -1) are chosen arbitrarily (or out of mathematical convenience, if you prefer). I'm not sure if that's what you're asking.
How? I've always felt it is a simpler explanation
What's also to note is that this doesn't mean the fact that a measurement by bouncing a particle off another object ends up affecting its position/momentum. This does happen but has nothing to do with the observation in the copenhagen interpretation, or yet another phenomenon, quantum uncertainty, with which it is even more often confused. All three concepts are fundamentally unrelated.
How is this verified experimentally? If shooting a particle at another particle to make a measurement causes a wave function to collapse, how has this been verified without someone actually looking at the result of that interaction? 
Not trying to be an ass, this is serious:What's the difference if, from your perspective, your consciousness is the only one in existence? I.e, you can't prove that you aren't alone in your consciousness.Let's take Schrodinger's cat for example -> sure the state of the cat can be recorded without you personally opening the box and checking, but couldn't you just argue the state of the universe hasn't collapsed until you "learn" of the results? From your perspective, nothing is really relevant until YOU have observed it yourself.
There exist "observations" that don't require a particle to interact with the experiment. The Elitzur-Vaidman bomb tester is an example of this.
That's not correct either. Measurement does not require direct interaction with the particle being measured.
Just like a left turn maneuver doesn't exist in nature, consciousness doesn't exist in nature, it's a behaviour, both of the brain chemistry/physics that make it be able to be exhibited, and sociological behaviour, people with such behaving brains think about thinking and are conscious, as opposed to animals or at least lower animals. It doesn't exist in nature as some "thing" that can interact with other "things".
The universe doesn't revolve around you. If the universe splits at all, it should split at the smallest denominator of time, every time, or else according to a specific, physical trigger. You're pulling the trigger of a gun cannot possibly be that trigger, unless you're living in a universe where the rules of physics are 100% focused on you.
The universe splits into two? What? What indication, proof, hint or reason to even think that that happens? The universe isn't something that splits or does anything. And just because you imagine something happening, doesn't mean that it's possible. Would you really seriously say that the moment you pull the trigger a universe is created where you turn into a duck that speaks human language and shoots lasers from it's eyes and can create universes? I mean in one universe this happens, and in the other it doesn't, so it has to be true, right?
I'm pretty confused on how this works but from what I'm getting from this, if there is me right now experiencing my own conscious and then me in another dimension whose consciousness I'm not experiencing and I get shot in my dimension and die but my other me in the other dimension does not, then my consciousness ends and my other me is not affected whatsoever?
So when I'm born are new universes created based on my "product line"? What if I never came to existence? Why does that mean I would exist in other universes? What even starts it at all?
Sounds interesting, would love to read more about this

I read "Ketamine: Dreams and Reality" by Karl Jansen two years ago and it really explored the various uses of K and how it affects the mind and body. It was a fascinating read and very entertaining if that's something you're into- your comment reminded me of it.
Consciousness never leaps. You have missed the essence of the theory. In fact, according to many world's your consciousness simultaneously exists in an essentially infinite number of realities.
> I'm not exactly sure what's "elegant" about the idea that every quantum interaction in the entire Universe diverges into n parallel UniversesIf you "shut up and calculate", it is simpler. The universe doesn't really care what theory humans like better. And the whole copenhagen collapses add nothing to the math or the experiments and are only there to make human minds more comfortable, because we can't handle infinitely many universes.
Measurement implies consciousness.

But why did I survive? Why is it impossible for me to have gone to the universe where I die? This whole idea just seems to me to necessitate immortality - if it's true, then it would be impossible for me to ever die, because there will always be some universe where I did not die at that exact moment, and I am forced down that path instead. At the "fork", is my consciousness split into two? Or is it simply guaranteed to follow the surviving one? I could accept the first one, but the second is completely bewildering to me.
> The point of thought experiments is to assume a theory as valid and to extrapolate scenarios based on that assumption.And when it results in something absurd and obviously false such as "quantum immortality" it's time to go back to the drawing board.
The vast majority of macroscopic events would happen the same way if the universe was 100% deterministic using classical mechanics. Only some (a very small percentage) of macro events are influenced in any significant way by quantum fluctuations
Fortunately, memes are an inter-dimensional constant.
You're assuming a normal distribution of universes (in the sense of a "normal number"). It's entirely possible for there to be an infinite number of universes, all of which you get hit by a bus and die.
> most known universes are simulatedI don't follow. We know of only one universe, ours, right?
But like "1s-ago-me" resides in the same universe as "now-me." Wouldn't those alternate "you"s be inaccessible to my consciousness? So if I died, they would live, but my consciousness would be destroyed?
While that may be so, at this exact moment in time my chance of being in any one universe is equal to my chance of being in any of the other. So why do I happen to be in a universe where the normal curve exists and coin flips follow the expected pattern? 
> those are questions that physics can't answer.Why not? There's been a lot of progress on this question lately.
Double slit experiment. If you don't put a measuring device in front of the double slits (detecting which slit the particle went through), it acts as a wave function. If you do, they behave like classical particles and produce no interference pattern. Noone actually even watches the said measuring device.
YOU are just getting some information about the interaction via some other means anyways.  The "observation" or "interaction" happens with or without a person there to see it. If a wavelength collapses in the forest and noone is there to consciously observe it, it will still have discrete values. Correct me if I missed anything, but "learning" about it isn't the "observation".
Do you realize that Schrodinger's cat is scientific satire written to show that you can't apply particle and sub-particle behavior to the macro world? The universe isn't something that collapses, and neither do cats.
That is called solipsism. That would not affect any quantum effects in any way if it were true. 
That is exactly what /u/dirty_d2 is saying, lol.
The whole point of it is that its not JUST this one event, the pulling of the trigger, but EVERY even on an atomic scale, trillions of trillions of interactions and events simultaneously, always, constantly creating a infinite churning mass of "new" universes at each and every point in "space"
The idea is that the universe sits every time there is a possibility of two or more things happening at a quantum level. It has nothing to do with it revolving around you. The universe(s) where you survive are just some of billions and billions created in the last nanosecond. You only experience the ones where you are not dead so as far as you are concerned the others can be ignored. 
but at the same time, is there is no way to prove that any other consciousness is even real but your own?
Someone please correct me if I'm wrong. But what I took away from the article is that essentially every choice, action, and reaction would have multiple universes extending out from it. In one of them you were born and immediately after that there are nearly an infinite amount of you from all the universes being created based on choices from the one you were born in. (also there would be many universes in which your mother aborted you, or you were still born.)
There could definitely be universes in which you do exist those which you do not exist. Just as the multiverse can host a reality almost exactly mirroring our own, it can host some where the Milky Way doesn't even exist.As another point of interest, could there be one where the universe never came into being? Does every instance of the multiverse have a basic fundamental beginning?
> If you "shut up and calculate", it is simpler. The universe doesn't really care what theory humans like better.this is a horrendously bad reason to accept anything. "don't question, just accept" ... has formed the basis of no major theory ever.
I'm no philosopher so I'd love to hear your side of it. From a scientific perspective (my perspective) I don't see  how this is the case. A system state collapses from a superposition into an exact state which has direct relation to what you're measuring. This is not something that has to do with consciousness, only mathematics and experimental observation. How does consciousness come into the picture? I'm not trying to be inflammatory I'm genuinely curious.
Same thing 
nawh, shane carruth
As far as science is concerned, consciousness is just your brain's activity.  When the universe splits, both brains are exactly identical.  The "you" in the survivor's universe would be indistinguishable from the "you" right now and would fully believe that it is the "true you" just as you do now.Your consciousness is neither split nor moved; It is duplicated.  Each version of you is exactly as real with exactly the same history as the other.  "You" will survive because there are now two of you and one is a survivor.
What evidence do you have that this theory is "obviously false"? Is your only argument against it that it "sounds absurd"?
It's also bogus because nobody who actually knows QM actually thinks it's consciousness that's causing the collapse.
> It is quite clearly not scientific,Why not? The MWI is one of the more coherent interpretations of quantum mechanics. > as it is simply being made up with no evidence to support the claimsThere is circumstantial evidence such as apparent randomness. Also there's been a new result in the field recently which shows that single-world interpretations of QM aren't self-consistent, which is a big argument pro many worlds.
What progress? I think QM has many philosophical questions that experiments can't answer. 
Not quite. To measure the which slit it goes through requires a detector at the slits. This detector is its own system with a wavefunction. By exposing the particle to it it is "bathed in its heat" forcing it into an eigenstate which is a position at one of the two slits, losing its wavelike characteristics at that point.So the experiment is changed by an irreversible thermodynamic interaction, not by a change of impulse due to the specific detection mechanism used.
>Noone actually even watches the said measuring device.This doesn't make sense. You can't report the results of the study if no data was observed.
I am aware it is solipsism - I was just making the argument that, assuming solipsism is correct, then indeed the "observation" by consciousness (only yours) would collapse the function. This doesn't mean I support the idea.The argument is still valid based on the premises of the assumptions made!
LOL my bad man, wasn't trying to be a smartass or anything, I've just always heard it explained as either outcome A or B but never anything about whether possibilities for C, D, E, F, G, etc. would also exist
You dying isn't a quantum event, though. That's my point. Quantum events have nothing to do with humans. If the universe were to split in such a way as to create two different outcomes of the same event, it's *very* likely that the scale of the event would be so small that there's no hope of ever creating two outcomes of an event involving a complex system, such as a human body.Schroedinger's Cat is just an analogy. The quantum universe working in a way that can keep the cat both alive and dead at the same time is not at all consistent with our observations of quantum events.
How would this coincide with material determinism? Or could it? Would all things be determined at random based on the resulting position of particles, still leading to many universes but not allowing room for free will? What sparked the question is the thought of a baby making choices. I don't know much about the thought capacity of a baby but my guess is they are exhibiting basic responses to stimuli more than choosing between options - but then again that's basically the determinist argument for anyone, just more advanced responses and stimuli.
It makes me wonder if dreams are us living through other subconscious "me" living and experiencing bits and pieces of their lives. Which is why things are eerily the same, but different and time skipped in dreams.Those last questions of yours got me fucked up though...I can't even comprehend it
I've never met or heard of an immortal human. Are you telling me that every human eventually finds themselves in a reality where everyone else is dead? If I live to be 120 years old I will be guaranteed to survive an apocalypse that kills everyone but me?
What causes the collapse?
>more coherentAs opposed to what and by what standard?
I'm more interested in he source of your knowledge. Where did you learn about quantum mechanics? I'm studying to be a mechanical engineer so please don't spare the math. 
You can observe data without watching the measuring device. If we go to the extremes, if you believe the human eye has magic superpowers that affect particles, you could put an arduino to register the results and speak to humans with a voice synthesizer so they don't have to look at it. Although basically this already happens, the whole double slit expirement is done by a device that spits some numbers onto a computer screen.
Alright, think of it this way.First, you perform both experiments, once with observers, once without. We don't look at any data for the moment.Then, we look at the detection screens. On the one with observers, there is no interference pattern. On the one without, there is an interference pattern. If we proceed to destroy the observers without looking at the data they made, it doesn't change anything compared to if we looked at it.
Possibilities a,b,c,d,e,f,g....on to infinity basically, would exist, but from the perspective of *probability* version A (dead) and B (alive) would be the most likely. However, like you figured, anything is possible, a meteor could come crashing through the roof and strike the bullet in mid air, but probabilistically that option would make up a very small portion of the "infinite" possibilities. 
No me dying is a result of many quantum events, in another universe there was a set of many quantum events that did not result in my dying, those are the ones I experience. 
Kant puts it best when he poses the question: "does God like an action because it's pious? Or is an action pious because God likes it?"
Isn't this basically mindful meditation?
When a measurement is made on a quantum state, it is forced to collapse from a wave function of probability to a discrete reality. The act of measuring a quantum state is an interaction with it, which forces it to return a value. For example, if I fire a particle at a screen, that particle must exhibit a position on that screen. The Copenhagen interpretation would have us believe that the particle exhibits multiple positions until it is forced to collapse to one in response to measurement. The fact that there's a conscious observer has nothing to do with this interaction.
"Possibilities a,b,c,d,e,f,g....on to infinity basically, would exist, but from the perspective of probability version A (dead) and B (alive) would be the most likely"Okay, so if I'm getting this (which I might not be), possibilities ARE infinite, but would technically exist as sort of branches from version A and version B?  
That doesn't make any sense. For every universe in which you die as the result of a gunshot wound to the head, there would be a near-infinite number of universes in which you don't die from that same gunshot wound. By your thinking, which one of those universes do you experience?
Try it and decide for yourself. You won't.
Conversely, though, activities of conscious observation likely must necessarily always fall into the set of activities which are interactions. So it's not merely conscious observation that collapses it, but conscious observation always will, and we can't observe it not doing so.
Why does firing in a particle on a screen count as a measurement, when the particle being in transit doesn't?  It seems to me like mere existence is a measurement, but apparently its not?
Thank you for this. Does this mean that we can't "decide" wether we want to measure position or momentum of a particle, forcing the other to be uncertain, but rather that one is uncertain inherently as a result of what the particle is?
Yes that's it exactly. Although limitations of how we measure things do come into account, the uncertainty is "baked" into quantum particles. It is a feature that results from their probabilistic nature.

Why should we believe logic in the first place? 
This is all common sense 
We use Sparkol's VideoScribe! Great program :)
Eh, it's pretty smug and people misuse it a lot.
> how to counter a fallacious argument with another fallacy?The only way to counter fallacious arguments is to point them out. But of course you might be speaking to someone who have no idea how to have a logical conversation so you could counter with another fallacious argument as well if you are not strong enough to resort to violence.
Fair question. Is it ethical to believe in logic? Leap of Faith? Critique of Instrumental Reason? etc. 
How is it smug? I know it is misused, but I don't think that can be helped. I know the creator and will happily pass on any useful feedback as to how it can be improved. The world needs this stuff, we're open to suggestions. 
I asked a professor of logic this once and all she said was "because it seems right."
I suppose its usage is usually too smug, not that the site is smug per se.  The format makes it very easy to be used as such.
Someone linking someone directly to a picture of a fallacy with nothing else is not really seriously discussing for the most part.
You could always reply with the same fallacy reversed. ex. Hitler also drove a car, I guess you're biking from now on, wouldn't wanna be a car driving nazi. 
It insists upon itself, it's self consistent, and it seems to give good results. 
"There are those who would say;" "Others would argue;" "I'm not taking a position here..."No, I'm not claiming what you say. 
You sound like a sophist because you're mostly talking about how to convince people that you're right and that you 'won' an argument, without regard to what the truth of the matter is. You're probably not using phrases like 'good argument' to mean the same thing that others are, because in philosophy good arguments are generally considered to be those that are more likely to be true and to lead to the discovery of truth, not those that are more likely to convince people that they're true. 
Depends on the situation really. Truth don't matter in most cases where you have an audience.
Guh. As if there isn't enough media to consume, you just got me to subscribe to a podcast with 160 episodes at two hours apiece. I don't even want to know how many commutes that is going to be. Both dreading and looking forward to it. 
I also want to suggest Philosophize This. It's another fantastic entry level philosophy podcast. 
Also check out Very Bad Wizards!
Been a listener of this for a long time. The discussions are interesting, each hosts personality comes through, and the pre-cog episodes are good condensed versions of a text you might be interested in.
My psychologist told me about this podcast when she learned that I went to school for philosophy. Long story short I tried to give it a fair shake but when they said some super wrong and misinformed facts about Camus and his flavor of absurdism, I really lost a lot of desire to keep listening.
I checked the website and it seems interesting but for a light show a podcast of 2 hours on Wittgenstein is hard to follow. Also, the audio was not clear enough and the dudes were laughing about some inside joke i guess in the first minutes
I tried accessing this through my podcast player and it shows just a single holiday episode from I've year ago. My player is Player FM.
That description is almost insulting, but hey the podcast's pretty nice
I really dislike the name. It's a cop out for easy branding.
I run a half marathon nearly every weekend. Now I have something to listen to when I don't feel like Dan Carlins hardcore history!
The episodes are pretty self-contained, usually focusing on a single set of readings, it is a bit of a struggle to follow the terminology though, although that may just be me not paying enough attention.
PEL, VBW, Philosophize This, and HoP are all good. The first two are conversational, the second two are scripted. Different animals."In Our Time," "Philosophy Bites," "Philosopher's Zone," and "Elucidations" are also good, but they're mostly scholars talking about their own work or weighing in as experts. That's great, but there's also value in vicariously participating in a conversation among fellow learners, which is really a novel way of learning that podcasting has opened up to us.
Absolutely, anyone looking to get their feet wet in Philosophy would do well to start with Philosophize This!  It is more accessible, IMHO, for the uninitiated.
You have any recommendations on an entry episode to get me interested?
they are rivals :p
I tried both for a while but much prefer History of Philisophy Without Any Gaps, he's great. The guest interviews aren't as great as the standard episodes but it's very informative and he even gets some jokes in sometimes.
"I mean I get what he's saying, but this is basically the categorical imperative." - Wes
Camus is my favorite existentialist, though... /s
I use PlayerFM and can access all of the episodes. So they have been uploaded at least. Just give it another go after restarting the app
My hats off to you. Anything more challenging than a phish concert when I run just tires me out. 
Just found Hardcore history any series you recommend I start with?
That's the problem of a philosophy podcast against most other stuff. Even the light stuff requires putting a lot of attention we internet addict millennials aren't ready to 
History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps can be pretty dry at times but is really good if you want a chronological look at philosophy and the evolution of thought.
Agreed. Some of the PEL is pretty advanced and hard to grasp. If you are starting out in philosophy, it can be difficult 
Early stuff took them a while to get in the groove so I wouldn't start with the first episode. I would check out the episode descriptions for something you are interested in.Typically I like episodes with guests so check out those. If your a fan of Sam Harris I think Tumors All The Way Down is my favorite.
yeah, i would like a recommendation/s as well if you don't mind?
"Kant and Freud said it better".
*sigh* remove the "/s" and toss in Kierkegaard and Sartre... God when did I become such a stereotype?
I don't know how people concentrate on in-depth discussions whilst also doing some other strenuous thing. I'm so easily distracted that I drift in and out even when I'm doing nothing else. 
Shit, I would think a phish concert would be the most challenging way to run. I remember I tried to run to rusted root once in high school. That was like 20 years ago. I still remember it for how much that music did not go with running. This podcast though, I've tried it. It might be tougher than both. 
Just say music. Nobody cares that you like Phish, guh. 
"Wrath of the Khans" is insanely good I think it's three episodes 
Where applicable, I use HoP as reference material in prepping for PEL episodes. Definitely good stuff.
 Great episode
I find them to be remedial and pedantic
I think it's actually easier when you're doing a strenuous activity since it acts as something to keep your mind focused on instead of the pain/monotony of the activity. 
Running a half marathon not at race pace isn't really strenuous it's more just endurance at that point
Really?  One of their 30 minute jams that just kind of meanders around?  I love it. Great to turn off your brain, but still keep it just engaged enough to pay attention to a run. As long as you know the course. I wouldn't do it in a new environment. 
Just a little self-deprecating humor. Please don't hate me. 
When I'm doing strenuous cardio particularly, just feeling completely wiped physically and mentally by the end of both an episode and my session is a nice humble reset button for me before I crash out for the night.
For me just concentrating on my surroundings and avoiding obstacles or passers-by would bring me completely out of focus. 
I guess it depends on your pacing/running habits. It makes me want to lollygag. I'm the type of runner who hates jogging. I either want to be clocking in the 6-8 min mile range or I'd rather just walk. I love me some formless tunes sometimes, but not for running. 
Honestly its probably most effected by which modality you use as "cardio" like cycling 50miles or running 8 miles, its easier to get into a podcast and world of ideas because you'll enter a flow state after awhile.  Something like doing sprints or sled drags, you'll be exerting too much energy and won't enter a flow state during (you may afterwards though).
I dunno. I've played tennis for over twenty years; that's way more cognitively demanding than just looking where I'm going, a skill you learn when you're two or so years old.
this is totally sweet, there can be such a sense of community in poor areas or neighborhoods, there wasnt one where i grew up but once i was grown and moved there was, while i was homeless i could totally chill with any other homeless dude i came across and its the same when youre a junkie, the majority wont fuck you over like the stereotype says if youre cool with them too 
Dude I live in a big city (~1M people) known for its homeless and very mild weather, and when I'm out running at night and I see anyone who isn't easily identifiable as "not weird", I move to the other side of the street. The fact you're chilling with the homeless is mind boggling to me. Like, I don't mean I think it's disgusting, just that I don't think I ever could do it.
Homeless people showing up at my back door at 3am is EXACTLY what I'd refer to as "The bad part of town". 
I've lived in lower class neighborhoods my whole life. I've recently started a new job and moved to a middle-class suburb, and it's so much nicer here. No more being woken up at 3am by a gang of rowdy skangers coming home from the pub. No more wondering if I'm going to be mugged while walking through the nacker estate. The overall fitness, hygiene, attractiveness, and manners of everyone here is so much higher. 
I just spent a year in a bad neighborhood. I am much more frightened now. 
The opposite was true for me sadly. :(When I moved to the "bad" neighborhood, I got my car broken into twice, my apartment door lock was forced once, and and I got robbed once someone came in through the window, all this in a two year span.I don't know how old you are, but it sounds very young and naive, I'm guessing you are in your 20s.Even on the shittiest town on any western country, MOST of the people are good people. Doesn't mean there are risks and dangers associated with living there.
I wish Stockton was this friendly.
uh, that sounds nice and all, but you sound like a very comedic murder victim. 
I'm sorry but if there was a murder at a gas station it is dangerous. You should be a bit more careful. It may be fine to help the homeless but on your property at your house you're inviting trouble. You could get robbed or attacked or end up having your place be the new homeless shelter (unless that's what you want). Yes, I agree most people who live in low-income housing shouldn't be judged poorly and may be great people. Nevertheless, you should never fuck around with your safety, especially when there are murders in the area.
Honestly the difference between a "good neighborhood" and a "bad neighborhood" is less to do with income and more to do with how vigilant and willing people are when it comes to assisting catching lawbreakers. The neighborhoods people don't mind shooting people in broad daylight, they know they can do so with impunity because snitches get stitches in that area.
Not sure if you'll read this, but I'm now in the "hood" (though.. it's really not even close to the hood of my city) and I've realized the problems are caused by kids.. not by adults. Anyone that's living in their own place or even with roommates has shit to do so they keep to themselves . It's the neighborhood kids with nothing to do out getting into trouble.
Is it not a problem that the homeless people keep coming back every night if you help them once? That's what I would find annoying.
Of course the locals aren't robbing/murdering you. You ever heard of the phrase "don't shit on your own doorstep"?
I really hope there is some getting used to it. I'v been living in a predominantly upscale suburb for most of my upbringing and now I live in Santa Ana, CA. The local people seem to be okay but most most wear a mean mug, resting bitch face or stare me down as I smile at them. Hopefully i'll get used to it, today is only day 4. 
I too live in a "bad area" in South Chicago. Most of my neighbors are elderly and spend a lot of time working on cars. Or spends time reading outside with their pets. So the neighborhood is actually pretty quiet. I will say that I am pretty much ostracized socially and my fiance has gotten a few comments about being a black man dating a white girl which kind of sucks, but other than that the neighborhood is fine.
I don't know who you are OP, but you're an amazing person. Better than most I'd say. Giving the benefit of the doubt and having mercy on and showing care for those less fortunate than you is a fantastic thing. We need more people like you in the world.
There is a lyric from The Prince of Egypt movie (wait wait...stay with me) that goes "when all you've got is nothing g,there's a lot to go around." I've always liked that lyric and I feel it is more or less true. There is a stark difference when hanging out with a bunch of "lower class" people vs. "upper class". It's so prevalent that there are plenty of Hollywood movies that touch on this very idea.
Where I grew up the dude coming through the woods would rob you and the stray cat would have been killed either with boiling water or a pit bull.
Probably a possum. 
So, I'm not really living a neighborhood of absolute squalor. Many of my neighbors may have subsidized housing and others might depend on social welfare programs. Some of my neighbors smoke crack and others deal it on the side. But these aren't people that are on the verge of homelessness. Some actually own their units. They might get the power or water cut off every other month, but they aren't about to be on the street. That probably makes all the difference. 
Same. Within 6 months1. My car was robbed 3 times.2. My apartment was robbed twice.3. I had a knife pulled on me.4. I had a gun pulled on me.5. People tried to sell me Xanax, Dope, Coke, Crack, Meth (outside my house)That being said, I still couldn't really give a fuck about any of it. I've got no problem going back to that area because I refuse to let the actions of a few garbage human beings control my life
Ya.... I've lived in bad parts and OK and really good parts.  What OP describes is the OK parts that might be next to the bad parts.  It is good that this is opening them up, but OP might not want to look into other bad parts that might be worse :)
I totally agree. Poverty created by serious drug addictions is a lot different than traditionally poor neighborhoods. In the former situation, people are probably roaming around at 3 am because they are dying of withdrawal symptoms and would do anything just to get the money in your pocket. It's sad, but that puts you in a compromising decision. I know a lot of people who have been robbed because they tried to help with something they just couldn't.
Yeah, and a person got murdered in his neighborhood. I think this guy isn't seeing the big picture here.
A homeless person didn't "show up at his back door", they were walking through the woods.
> skangers> nacker estatewhat the hell are these
You are from Ireland I'm guessing
I guess because his neighbourhood isn't too bad, all in. I'm in a similar situation- I moved to the "diverse" part of the city and people talk about it like it's scary, but it is so nice! I never have any trouble and I can get waffles and kebabs at 4am. Living the dream.
Perhaps. My next door neighbor sells weed. A couple weeks ago I answer my doorbell after midnight to find a young black couple utterly surprised to see me answer the door. I told them they were looking for Sha'niece next door. They thanked me and then the guy said, "don't call the cops." "Oh, I wouldn't, why did you even? What? No. Don't worry." I replied. Then I realized he only said that because I am white. It was the first time I was a victim of prejudice. I was pretty excited. It was just like when I got my first pimple. I was so stoked to oxycute it. 
Thankfullly, my neighborhood does not have a gang problem. I see some teenagers walking around at night with their friends and the worst I think they're up to is smoking weed. That's no worse than anything my suburban friends did back in the day. We were probably even dumber, breaking into the local golf course to climb the water tower and drink vodka 100 feet up. Lucky no one died. 
It's a numbers game. OP just hasn't been there long enough for the shit to hit yet. One night that homeless vagrant wandering into his backyard will be balls deep in a schizo episode with knife in hand. OP yelling out will just be a taunt. One night that light above his drive will go out and never be replaced, suddenly making his corner of the street enticing. The 'bad' areas aren't constant doom and gloom, but the doom comes suddenly and without hesitation far more often than it does in the burbs. 
They're not puppies. If he wanted them to go away, he'd ask them to, and most likely, since he's been cool to them, they would do it. 
Dude, you're going to get murdered one of these days.  Your feel-good story about feeling comfortable there changes nothing.  This isn't about prejudice-You have literal crackheads barging into your house.  Put those bars up or get a gun or something.
The only issue being that one situation where not being cautious results in death. It's a game of odds, some people are fine with a > 0%, others prefer their odds to be 0% or as close as possible for any given controllable situation.
I fucking love that movie. It has an awesome soundtrack.
I was struggling a few months back with just feeling utterly, cosmically insignificant. I listened to that song on loop for like a week. The lyrics about the rock on top of the mountain and "looking through heaven's eyes" really helped me out. I think I came through the other side quite changed for the positive as a person. :)
Real talk, OP doesn't live in the ghetto.  Listening to the media talk about Ferguson, MO like it was Compton was infuriating.  If you think Ferguson is ghetto than  Martin Luther King and North Garrison will make your hair stand up.
It's probably that rascal Too Tall again. 
I think OP admitted he really wasn't in a bad neighborhood, just a low-income multi-cultural one. Used to run a Pizza chain place in a lower income area, we had a homeless guy hang out a lot, we fed him whenever he was hungry (as did the other restaurants). When he died there was a line of people out the door waiting to pay their respects to that man, everybody knew him. 
I grew up in a bad neighborhood. I've always maintained that its not so bad as long as you know how to protect yourself and your things. Things like leaving the TV or the radio on when you leave the house, staying alert while walking in the street while no looking scared; makes all the difference. To this day I never have more then 1 headphone in at a time. The worst thing to happen to me was a kid snatched my phone once. I chased him but fucker was fast and I had on heels. 
> There was a general rule in the town I lived in that you did not live on a street with a letter for a name because these were the neighborhoods with the most crime.I know this isn't unique to only one city/town but we have the same "rule" where I live. Hmmm.
Tree streets, around here. Pine, Elm, Ceder, etc. 
This is the best clandestine argument for social welfare programs I've heard. Desperate people do desperate things. It's almost as if a safety net to prevent total squalor lowers crime rates and builds community?
Sounds like those garbage human beings can end your life though. That's the difference.
Regardless, I'd prefer to live where homeless people don't casually stroll through the woods near my house.
It's definitely interesting to see what people consider to be the "bad neighborhood". I worked in a bad neighborhood and it wasn't funny, warm happies like this. There is constant crime, people are on the community FB page posting videos of homes being cased, pets are stolen out of yards, cops are responding to gun shots across the neighborhood, teens are dealing drugs and getting shot in broad daylight, kids are going hungry, the mentally ill walk the streets with no aid and no hope, I mean it's insane.
I am not totally convinced that OP doesn't actually live in some sort of revival district that's mostly full of yuppies and students.  And maybe he thinks it is the bad part of town because it USED to be.I live in Memphis which most people consider to be pretty damn dangerous.  But there are parts of the city that are pretty hard to distinguish from straight up ghetto unless you know what to look for, but that are actually really cool places to work/live/hang.For the most part, the actual most dangerous parts of the city are former white suburbs that were annexed by the city.  
> But if you restrict the reports to just my immediate neighborhood it's shit like marijuana arrests and noise complaints.So basically you live in a neighborhood that is no worse than the suburbs anyways... Maybe I am misunderstanding the point of your post. 
Society portrays rich people as snobby entitled pricks with no regard for the law or other humans in general. I have rich parents, so I'm automatically a spoiled brat who has never had to work for anything in life, right?
Lmao holy shit you're crazy. I'd do it with an elevator... Not stairs or a ladder.
You guys are great. 
Aw the little racist is out of his safe space.If you'd read the thread, you'd see that spouting statistics does nothing.  Context is important, and it's important to understand why crime rates are higher in minority neighborhoods. "Hurr durr black people are killers" isn't an argument, you're generalizing a whole race. Socio-economic status, history, and oppression are extremely important in understanding the cycles that perpetuate crime in these societies.But /r/beholdthemasterrace  am i right?
Are you doing well now? 
>i got into drugs and things too dark for this subThings too dark?  What did you mean by that?  You have all of my genuine interest and none of my judgement.
"Especially when it's waving a razor sharp hunting knife in your eye."
Could you expand on why wealthier neighborhoods are more dangerous? For the homeless or the homeowners? Legal action like... foreclosure? Divorce?
A lot of minorities, especially first gen, have issues with interracial relationships. Source: am first gen immigrant with white boyfriend. It gets extra fun looking ambiguously other. I have been mistaken for Indian, Hispanic, and Black, so I frequently feel the side eye.
I'm so glad you're doing better!I'm not at all a religious person but I have always admired that song as just a general upbeat look at what it means to be humble and have a sense of community.
The thing is in my experience growing up in places like that never leave you. You get these street smarts and they always color you, for instance my brothers and i always make sure we have our back to a wall most times, or are ready to fight if someone knocks on our door a little too hard. Stuff like that can really get to you if you can't let it go. 
I know! I don't know how you can look at these people and think anything other than "no one should have to live this way." The fact that so many people don't see the value in helping their fellow man, to the point where they want to hurt them instead, disturbs me.
Best social program is a job.
Anyone can end your life, if they have enough motivation. There's not much difference there.
Yeah, all those stories are quite in keeping with the Compton stereotypes I've learned via Hollywood. I don't think we have it quite that bad in Atlanta.  
As someone who adopted Oakland as her home...Nah, it's amazing here. I wouldn't want to live anywhere else in the world. It's amazingly diverse, everyone smokes weed, and there's so much culture and creativity. Also, not all parts of Oakland are "bad". It is gentrifying rapidly, which is certainly cause for concern, but I absolutely love this city.
Yup, that's the prejudice you'll likely face. And if you ever complain about being unfairly judged for your family wealth you can expect to hear very little sympathy.  This is not fair. You might not ever live a life wherein you need worry about where your next meal is coming from. But wealth brings about all sorts of other problems that your average person never has to deal with, im sure. In the end, we are all just worm food. The struggle to live a good and useful life is not restricted to the non-wealthy.  
But it's also true. There's loads of mean rich people, the same way there are rich poor people. I think it comes down to changing your personal circle, becoming someone else to only "better" yourself so that a circle of peers that you deem better than the one you are currently in accepts you. Be it money or social status, some people are assholes, and will put others down to get ahead of other people.   
I completely agree. And wealthy people tend to contort themselves in every possible direction to justify their wealth but ultimately, to me, it's as simple as the fact that clinging to luxury while other humans suffer terribly is inherently immoral and unkind.
One of these days I'll leave for work and say, "love you babe!" and she'll finally reply truthfully and say, "tolerate you, babe!" 
ive been clean and not homeless for 2 years, through no effort of my own i have to say, a man who became my best friend offered his place to me while i was detoxing and getting back on my feet, i was in a psych ward for a bit, and after living with my best friend i moved in with my partner, without them i would still be on the streets (or likely dead thanks to the drug abuse), ive made strides dealing with mental health but im still struggling thanks for reminding me to be grateful, im so selfish i only think about my current struggles and fail to remember the shit i was in in the past
What's he gonna do, stab you?
Thanks, dude. :)I am religious but I think the song just has a lot going for it on a general human level. Not being religious doesn't mean the world has to be seen as hopeless and devoid of meaning. We may define it, but I think it's worth believing in that bigger picture because it's something beautiful
"fuck you i got mine". A lot of people just don't care about anything happening past their doorstep, or anything that's visibly out of the way. 
This is a basic, though understandable, misreading of the conservative position.  Most conservatives won't phrase their position as "fuck the poor."  Many support private charity initiatives.  It's just that (a) they don't trust the government to be the one to help, and (b), they think welfare programs actually trap the poor in a cycle.  It's the difference between buying a kid a candy bar and telling him to do some chores for his allowance (Of course, this example only works if there are actually chores for him to do).
This is honestly just cities in general, they change an insane amount over the distance of just a few blocks. I live Cincinnati and just north of Downtown in OTR is an incredibly nice, urban area with great places to live that I would definitely call safe, but I would never even consider living literally 3 blocks up the street from this district
>But wealth brings about all sorts of other problems that your average person never has to deal with, im sure.All I ask is the chance to prove that money cannot make me happy. 
Don't know about you, but every poor person I've ever met was poor.
I would say that the homeless part of addiction is probably the best part. I also struggle with addiction and being homeless was the easiest part of that by far. May the fourth is my clean day. Congrats on staying clean for two years that made my heart happy to read
I'm not trying to describe the Republican party. I'm trying to describe the actions of the elected Republican congressmen, and to a degree the disgust toward lower classes that a not insignificant portion of the vocal Republican base tends to exhibit.
Money won't make you happy but a lack of it will really suck ass.
are you my guardian angel? this is *exactly* what i needed to hear after a rough week, down to the very last word, thank you for this, really. judging by your words and your OP you are exactly the type of person we need more of in this world
My daughter has a very very mild club foot. When she was born it was all twisted and on its side. Broke my heart. We're extremely lucky that we have a Shriners hospital here in town, not only that but we know a ton of the doctors there. Her foot is getting better and on the fast track to being totally normal. However my point is, if you want or need to readjust your perspective go to children's hospital. 
That's humbling to read. Now you've got me blushing. What I said is simply the truth - as I see it. And I can easily  and honestly reply that there are too few people like you in this world. Take a moment to allow yourself to be self-indulgent and explore the truth in that statement and blush too. There's nothing wrong with giving yourself a pat on the back here and there. Sometimes it's the only encouragement you'll ever receive to keep you moving forward. Be kind to yourself. It sounds simple, but it's not. 
So I have club feet, too. I just want you to know that all the bad stuff happens when they are kids. I had surgeries, I had the casts, and I had the special shoes. I barely remember all of that. As an adult, no one realizes anything is wrong with me. Heck, I barely remember myself! It only really comes up when I run too far or swim too much. And even then its only pain like what I imagine arthritis is like. Heck, I even ran a half marathon! ...thought I'll never do that again!
I just read through all of this, an I can say without a doubt you both are the type of people we need more of in this world. Stay positive and stay awesome guys.
That's awesome. That's what we're hoping for. Right now, unless you know what to look for you wouldn't see it. Thankfully she doesn't even surgery. It's been as mild as I could have hoped for. 
Enter this on a google search:    **site:reddit.com franklymydeer AROUND(10) song**    Third result.  Yes, you asked in /r/NameThatSong.
Wtf? Are you sure the redditor isn't one of your IRL friends who knew about it and is now just trying to troll you? (I assume this would be fairly easy to figure out, depending on their post history.)
Oh my god I've been trying to find a song for over a year too.Must feel amazing to actually find it, congratulations!
Cool story but damn was that song ever disappointing.
haha that's fucking awesome. I enjoyed this story.
"Mike something"---->Miike Snow. This sounds just like their music. Check out their stuff if you like this type of music!!
That's pretty cool. And the song isn't too bad either. Sometimes a song can just grab ya and it's awesome you got that sort of closure. 
Ah, this reminds me of my 90s childhood where I would hear a song on the radio or in a movie and fall in love, and NEVER HEAR IT AGAIN because there wasn't really a way to find out on the internet yet. One that I did eventually figure out was Oleander's "Why I'm Here," which I thought sounded like Nirvana and I remember going through their discography on Amazon listening to sample clips trying to find it. Which was a fruitless search and I just got lucky because I heard it again on the radio and the DJ said who it was. 
Omg. This is amazing. Wow. Ya that line "Shh bby is ok" should be...like...a thing! We must spread this everywhere!
The entire comment section of that YouTube video is "Shh bby is ok"
Isn't that like fucking terrifying though?
I expected a better song after reading all that.
Hah, kind of reminds me of this song that I loved back in middle school and I had no idea what it was (before Google). Saw a friend that had written some of the lyrics on the strap of his backpack, I got so excited because I didn't know anyone else knew the song and so I BEGGED him to tell me, but he wouldn't! It became this year long torture of him refusing to tell me. Then finally during summer I'm looking through the signatures in my yearbook and there it was, "Title, Artist -- kid's name"
>I've just realised that this whole post might be construed as a pathetic attempt at viral marketing for Seat.     Thats not at all what I suspected. I construed it as a pathetic attempt at viral marketing for BSO.    Then again, I'm a cynical bastard. Oh well.    
The only explanation is Edward Snowden 
I tried tracking this song down too - even to the point of finding the twitter feed of the guy who plays the driver (if I remember correctly he's a Spanish model) I may even have (big May) have seen your youtube comment that also have me some closure. But now I'll have to try and hear the whole song. By the way did googling the advert song keep leading you to "frontier psychiatrist" by the avalanches?
I have the same kind of problem all the time! I have Sky TV (a cable service) and on the menu they play these great songs all the time but they don't actually have a list or anything of the songs, so I've had to google lyrics and things a lot of the time.. I've actually been building a playlist recently of all of the songs just so I know them all.Anyways, congrats on the random message! :D
Can you explain your first edit? 
If you click "lyrics" on the spotify desktop application located on the bottom right while playing the song, it says the following: Shh bby is ok /u/Franklymydeer has a small dick
Yeah exactly! The mystery redditor could not have handled this better. That was probably my favourite part as well. Honestly, I giggled like a little girl when I saw that response. I don't want to give away their username because I guess they have a right to anonymity. But believe me when I say that they seem like an utterly fantastic person - based on their responses throughout our conversation, as well as their posting history in general. 
That >Shh bby is okjust made me laugh harder than anything I've seen on Reddit in months.
> Shh bby is okThis sounds like something that would be said during the act of a date rape.
how is bby formed ?
Whoa. What's the "AROUND" operator? I've never seen that before. Is there a list of such operators?
Yeah I saw that! I posted to a sub called /r/NameThatSong or something, and you replied telling me about the email. Do you remember that?Dude I'm really sorry, in this story I claimed credit for the email you sent. I couldn't remember posting about it on Reddit, but I knew I had seen an email from the Seat marketing department, so I thought I had sent them an enquiry because I was planning to do that. Hahaaa I can't believe we're reunited again! This whole thing is getting funnier and funnier. 
Aha! Thank you, you hero! I've misremembered some of the details, but this is almost definitely the missing link. God, I completely forgot about that thread. I think I was the OP, too.Having said all that, the mystery redditor didn't post any comments in that thread. They must have just observed it, and somehow remembered it a year later. It's still pretty fantastic. I do love this website sometimes. 
This was actually one of my first thoughts. But based on their comment history I really don't think I know them. They seem to live on a different continent to me.I can only assume that, at some point, I mentioned this on Reddit. It's still amazing though - if I did mention it, it would have been a year ago, and it can't have been a particularly popular thread. Maybe tomorrow, when I've calmed down, I'll go through my comment history and try to figure this out. But then again, I kinda enjoy the mystery of it all. Maybe I'll just leave it...
What song? My advice would be to post it to a random thread on Reddit, wait a year or so, and eventually some random person will PM you a link. It worked for me, it'll probably work for you too. 
Have you tried posting it to /r/tipofmytongue? There's an active subreddit dedicated to helping people find anything people can't seem to remember,  but have some vague memories of!
The journey was better than the destination. 
Yeah. Read the whole story and was looking forward to hearing something that wasn't generic car ad crap. Was disappointed.
Modern TV's should have an option for song titles to appear in the corner of the screen :o.
Hey smilin' strange,You're looking happily derangedCan you settle to shoot me?Or have you picked a target yet? Hey Sandy!While we're on the subject of obscure songs, the theme to *The Adventures of Pete & Pete* is a real song called "Hey Sandy" by Polaris.
And the YouTube comments section for the ad is now filled with "Shh bby is ok".
Shh bby is ok
Its a thing already. I'm a sort of friend of a former penguin if D00M kind of girl who retained her weirdness. She and her friends talk like that on facebook all the time
!!!Or the Illuminati? 
Shazam app?
OK now I'm really freaked out. HOW DO THEY KNOW I'VE GOT A REALLY SMALL DICK?!?!?!? I know for a fact I've never posted pictures of my dick on Reddit. 
I think it's you from the future.
I believe it might be someone involved in BSO, stumbled upon it and decided to give you the answer without taking the credit. Either way they are going to have a spike today in the song plays!! 
I think your reddit username has been made among your friends...
Since not a whole lot of other people seem to be giving a shit, how did you find the song, and OP?
legendary. so you know OP IRL? is his YouTube sn the same as his Reddit one? or what? we've gotta know
What other powers do you have!?
You make me feel uncomfortable
How does it feel to have made a meme? 
Shh bby is ok
Hey I'm the guy that emailed the company trying to help OP. Thank you so much for finding the song. I remember getting so annoyed looking for it!
To the top with you! Please deliver
Please explain how you knew this guy was looking for this song!
Time for your 15 minutes: who what when where why and WHAT THE FUCK MAN?
GUYS IT'S HIM IT'S HIM!
What are next week's lottery numbers
What that means? 
Is it too late for TheVikingHoward to trademark this shit? I feel responsible for screwing them out of money
Thought I heard her calling my name now!
It was just uploaded. By you right?
Can you send me that shirt :P
x AROUND(n) y finds x within n words of y. I stumbled upon it randomly, so I don't have a list for you. 
Holy hell that's how I found the cursed ad... I can't believe answers have been found!
The reunion. Now kith
They might not have needed to remember it a year later - it's possible that they came across the thread, researched it, found the answer, realised they could no longer respond to the thread (Reddit doesn't let you respond to threads more than 6 months old) and PMed you instead. I know I've done that before.But yes, it's fantastic when that works out. :D And I'm sorry for spoiling it - I know you said that you might just leave it because you liked the mystery. (I don't know if you caught my original comment before making it less spoilery - it was a lot more direct. If so, I apologise!)
Wait so, you didn't email the marketing department, /u/jadedDarkness did...
You know this explains yhat you didn't email them.
So user /u/JaredDarkness actually sent the email and got the reply? Because the screen shot is identical to yours, OP...and you replied to it, so it couldn't have been your alt account.
I'd leave it. Keeps it exciting.
I actually know the name, I'm just looking for a specific recording.It's an aria from Don Giovanni, I heard it in the movie Screamers but I can't find that version anywhere. It was probably recorded specifically for the movie and for some reason never released to the public.
Like the Dark Tower.
But you said you loved it so much that you couldn't stop listening to a 30-second clip of it... Is the 30-second part much better than the rest of it?
It really ruined the whole story to know OP has such a shit taste in music. 
Nice meme.
He goes into the future, PMs himself from someone else's account, and then past him does the same thing many years later after he invents the time machine.  The knowledge of the song lives in a paradoxical cycle.
or it's one of your friends irl
Frantically travelling back in time to change the divergence meter to allow him to change world lines to one in which the song exists. Finding the song, travels further back, creating a reddit account and waiting until now to reveal the song to his past self.
I think we've stumbled into a Bootstrap Paradox. OP is BSO!
But OP says he's never mentioned this on reddit. Just in the YouTube comments and to his irl friends. Maybe one of his friends knows his username? 
And why do you keep calling them baby?
From his posts, here's the answer. Went to/r/namethatsong (from alientube) is where i found /u/franklymydeeer it is or was the top post. Thats where i found him. Then it was the matter of finding the song. Which i did. It's on Spotify made by the artist BOS which i have never heard of in my life. Then simply send the song and artist to /u/franklymydeeer
Shh bby is ok
RemindMe! 2 days
I Just found a thread and looked for the song..
Magic ones 
I know sweetiepie 
Do you put the yellow dot next to your name so we think you got gold and read your comment?
I was never good at my Job as a paper delivery boy so we will se if I still got it :P
IT'S ME GUYS IT'S ME
You should sign up for the reddit secret santa then put this in there as a *wink wink nudge nudge* haha :)
Holy crap on a cracker!  I've seen dozens of lists of "useful google tricks" but never this one.  It should be on all of them.
No fucking way! I bet this'll be on some bullshit infographic within the month....Have you got any others?
I think you mean "shh bby is okay to kith"
Yeah that is it 
The spoiler alerts were many. You are clear of any spoiling. 
Yeah, I clearly got that bit wrong... I could have sworn it was me! It was ages ago, my memory is a bit fuzzy. The plot thickens!
Yep, I misremembered a few details in this story. I completely forgot that I had even posted about it on Reddit! My memory is awful. 
argh, I know that feeling. I've been looking for a specific recording of Julie London singing "Bye, Bye, Blackbird" for almost 8 years now. I think there was a video too but nothing I can find on youtube is the right video.
I am an opera singer and I have a very rare week off and will be a little board so I will look into it for you. I might not be able to find the exact recording but will be possible to find the singer and recognise their timbre. Also as an aside if you don't know what the aria is about look it up it is rather funny.
is ok meme
You missed the part where he actually completes the piece with the original composer on one of his journeys in time.
Ok, that's the truth. I can stop being weirded out. Good,I hate unanswerable questions. 
How about the same / very similar username on youtube and reddit? The guy who PM'd OP forgot it was a youtube comment he knew OP from and thought it might have been Reddit, tried finding the user and got lucky, freaking OP out in the process.
Shh bby is ok
well, the last time appears to be a Futurama reference. So we know they have good taste.
This is a beautiful story of someone pointing out the obvious to a really stupid OP. 
"Which I did" is not very clear...
22 hours to go! 
If it's on a bullshit infographic and you end up using it, is it still bullshit?
You're a mensch, sir. 
Shh bby ur ok
So why were you lurking around on year old threads?
You and jadedDarkness are the same person.You are also the "mystery redditor". You may also be a soap manufacturer or IT Security guy, who is hell bent on erasing society's debt.I am not sure which, but I will be sure to send you my building society details and account numbers so you don't miss them.
Reddit will kill it by overusing in two days.
No no no. That's *Link*-Karma. Self-posts don't get those! 
Thus a really crudely hidden version of his name is written in the credits, like Marik from YGOTAS calling himself Malik Blishtar
That's a lot of effort just to tell someone the name of a song.
This is going to take over reddit for the next few weeks. Calling it now.
I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS AND SO LITTLE ANSWERS
I have excellent taste. 
I went from warm and fuzzy feelings to actually laughing my ass off upon reading this. Brb, getting surgery to reattach my ass.
Because you touch yourself at night. 
It's the Egg. We are all the same person. 
Mike something?
The real question is how many hours do you put into Minecraft?
Shut up baby i know it :)
Yep. Its already out there in other subs.
Easily the best story I've read on t'interweb
I figured it was Miike Snow when I saw "Mike Something" Miike Snow has that pop-indie sound that commercials love. 
It's in the fabric of our universe. The song of the beginning and the song of the end. It was, is, and always will be, forever until time ceases to exist.
Wasn't this on Doctor Who recently?
That's just a quote from Bender from Futurama so it doesn't count.
'Mensch' in this context means an honorable person. It sounds a bit like a sneeze. It means "human" in German. Gesundheit is what a German person would say to you if you'd sneeze. It's not that hard. :)Or as a great man once said: *"Shh bby is ok"*
Yup same!I think I actually first started listening to them after Black and Blue was in a commercial, googled the lyrics etc.
There must be some way out of here, said the Joker to the Thief...
We love you bender..
Well, this is the Internet. People of all sorts of times hang here. For example, it's 1 in the morning here but I'm still up because my friends just left after playing board games for hours.As to the news: congratulations!!!!!! That's so exciting! Do you have any idea on male/female? Do you have any names in mind?
Congratulations! Start sleeping in now, from what I've heard you won't get much of that starting in 9 months!
Just gone 2pm here in England, so someone saw it. Congratulations sir.
After a year & a half of trying, dr appts and a fertility specialist, my wife is now pregnant too....daddy fever all around! 2016 takes...2017 gives 
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHehehehe that means you had sexy-sexy! 
Congrats! /r/daddit is awesome 
#Hi Mr. Going To Be a Dad, I'm fraud_93.
I'm right there with ya buddy. Just found out too.
Nobody will see this either. I probably have IBS.
Congrats on your sex trophy!
Congrats!  My kids are almost 27 and 22. Being a parent is amazing and sometimes horrible but something I will never regret. Here's to a healthy and happy child!
I am too!!! So when are you two due?
Congratulations!!!!!!! Here is your official executive key to /r/dadjokes
Congratulations! Do you know if it's going to be a girl/boy?
Congratulations! So am I and I have no idea what the hell im doing! WOOHOOO. Scotch on me pal! 
Shows how people are different. If I got that news, I'd want to kill myself.But bloody hell, congratulations! Just by your passion alone, I'm convinced you'll be an amaizng father!
Congratulations!  Exactly five years ago today, I got knocked up hahah.  Also I noticed you're Irish, I'm also Irish :D 
Congratultions on the news!! How does it feel? Any name ideas yet?(I don't even know you yet I feel genuinely excited and happy for you. What is this feeling)
Congrats! My wife is due in March with our first. 
Congrrraaaatttssss!!!!!! When is your SO due? 
Congratulations! :) What are you hoping the baby will be?
Gratz, man.  RemindMe! 3 months
You understand timezones, right? It was between two and three pm here when you posted.Oh, and, uh, congratulations, I guess :)
hey it's me your child from the future i am COOL and everyone loves me
What did you guys play?
Thanks! I have no idea as of yet but I'm thrilled either way!
Fyi the typical time women find out they are pregnant, it's way too early to determine the sex of the embryo.
THIS.  SLEEP NOW!  I have a 9 year old and I haven't slept since BEFORE he was born.  Also, congratulations.  There is nothing better than fatherhood!
Terrible advice. What you need to do now is start sleeping less so you learn to function without sleep. If you're not conditioned, the immediate transition is absolute murder. Source: 6 kids. 
I'm pregnant and nights where I get less than 12 hours make me furious because I know I'll never have this chance again. 
Same, Ireland here!
I just got off a 14 hour flight back from EnglandT'WAS HELL
Congratulations!!!!!My husband and I tried for a year, saw the doctor, started fertility drugs, and got pregnant and had a healthy, happy baby. (Yay!) On his first birthday, we discovered we were having another one. (Oops.) Everything worked out fine-the kids are closer in age than we'd hoped, 20 months-but I just want to warn you, trouble conceiving once doesn't mean trouble conceiving always! Lol! Seriously, parenthood is amazing. Congratulations to you and your wife. 
It felt real good when I did the sex with my penis 
Statistically speaking, he has a lot of sexy-sexy. Getting pregnant is hard! Only 3-4 days out of the whole month is it possible. 
And /r/predaddit 
Literally looked through all the comments looking for this one. Thanks for bolding it xD
Also, congratulate him on not pulling out.
Whey, congrats! I reckon September, which is kinda bad timing coz we've got three weddings but fuck it!
No idea! Don't wanna know till the day of arrival!
It's really so much easier than you think it'll be. You've managed to keep yourself alive thus far-you'll probably do the same for your kid. My first was a month early and my husband and I hadn't even put his crib together yet. We had no idea wtf we were doing. But he's 3 and doing fine! 
Thanks! We worked it out and we reckon it's around beginning of September 
I completely agree but it seems like OP is happy about it, so let's wish him well :)
It takes 9 months though.. your cover as a human is showing. 
If you're not in America or the UK that's irrelevant, because that's where 90% of redditors are.
Asking the important questions. 
Not OP, but my family got Pandemic: Legacy for Christmas, and we just played the first game last night. We're so excited it looks really awesome.
A few rounds of Love Letter, then two games of Risk.
But which one do you REALLY want it to be?  (Pro tip: reply with both and delete the one that it is not once you find out)
Thank you, I actually didn't know that!
Except an Apache helicopter. An Apache helicopter has machine guns AND missiles. It is an unbelievably impressive complement of weaponry, an absolute death machine.
6 kids?!?? how do u even manage!!
Ages? I'm curious. 
Hej, tillykke fra denmak!
Congrats from Ireland!
I've got one of those from Heathrow to LAX in about twelve hours. Not looking forward to it. 
A girl let me do it, it literally just happened. 
Whoaaaaaa THAT'S A LOT OF SEXY SEXY
You can tell Mom about r/babybumps and r/beyondthebump too. They're really supportive :)
I'm like a rogue soldier my friend, I never pull out, even when other people tell me I should 
Nice! But lots of 0 to 3 fleecy pjs
No response! OP needs to get his priorities straight.
Oh that's what I wanted for Christmas! I got Pandemic: State of Emergency and On the Brink expansions, so it's cool :D Can't wait to try it after my finals end.
**two** games of risk? How did it not take a week?!
Love Letter is great! I just got the premium edition and it is WORTH IT. 
I highly recommend Betrayal At The House On The Hill! It's by far my favorite board game! Oh and munchkin is great too! 
No problem friend! You have a great day now.
I mean, clearly he wasn't including Apache helicopters in that statement - he was speaking in hyperbole. With its speed, maneuverability, and armament, nothing can realistically be compared to the AH-64.Also, Apaches don't poop.Carry on, /u/jelly_doughnut. We understand that you didn't mean to insult the Apache.
What what, tillyke fra Danmark til papa!
Hannibal Buress on having sex on weed:>Yo, why she lettin' me do this to her
I was about to ask if there was a /r/momddit
As I read this in in fleecy Harry Potter pjs so I'm way ahead if you!
He is probably asleep - it's 4am for him right now
We just started playing the base game. Which expansions are best? 
What's the difference exactly?
Thanks, you too! Anything in particular planned?
Might I suggest booze and condoms from now on ;) 
Hi 0.0 I'm fraud_93.
Every expansion has multiple modules, so they are more of like multiple-expansions-packs. I like most modules in both expansion packs. They add different kinds of flavors and make the game (generally) harder, you can make different combinations of them to make different experiences. Personally I would start with playing base until you want more and then buy the first expansion pack. Then play with it until you want more and get the following expansion pack. 
It allows up to 8 players with some added cards that feel really natural. The cards are also bigger and thicker. Basically card stock. It also come with sleeves that fit the theme. Oh! And wooden hearts.
Oh boy! I'm staying home from work today, looking after my 2 sons, 4 and 1.5 years. It has already been an eventful day, and 90 minutes before my wife gets home...How about you? What was your New Year's like?
No, it's just a bit stupid
My New Year's Eve was pretty quiet, which is how I like it really. I went out to a nice, relatively early event with my parents (picnic where they were showing Zootopia, which is great). At home, I stayed up unreasonably late watching Doctor Who (specifically the episode The Power of Three, which has become a tradition for me) and a bit of a charity stream on Twitch.
That was a twist worthy of m. Knight Shamalan
That's awesome! Congratulations on going back to school. That's a difficult choice for a lot of people, but if it gets you to your dream job it'll be worth it!Oh and congrats on the "sleeping" too.
You played a risky game with my feelings OP
Was worried there for a second! Best of luck to you, and im glad your husband isn't cheating :)
You my dear are a post title ninja. :D  Congrats on college life.  Just watch out for the parties and know your beer pong limits.
Reminds me of my mom. She just turned 46 last week. She completed a three-year apprenticeship a few years ago and went right on into college. Was even offered a scholarship for her good grades! Till 40, she spent most of her life at home with the family. Really proud of her!Great for you too! Good luck!
Oh, you jerk. I came here armed with words of solace about how sometimes we betray each other and you pull this on us.
Nice! My first thought was "that is so NOT causal, how is this post still up??" Really though, cograts and all that :D
Good luck. Hope you succeed. :)Prepare to deal with paranoid schizophrenics. They're gonna drive you crazy!  (* _ *)
You should *totally* walk in the first day and pretend that you are the teacher.  If you're not going to a special adult education that is, otherwise it would be weird.
Next will be your husband posting that his wife makes him feel inadequate because she's friggin' awesome.
Dammit OP. I came here expecting to be depressed and frustrated with your circumstances and am instead smiling and happy.How dare you brighten up my day.
Please ~~re-frame~~ refrain from making click bait titles, thanks!
Awesome! Congrats to you! I went back for my RPN when I was 29. I am now 33 and I love my job! 
hahaha, nice!I hope to go back to school someday. But my kids are little and right now I am devoted to them.Best of luck with your future goals!
You baited us hard.
You rule =)
Greatest title and followup ever. I am so happy for you!
My 59 year old partner of 13 years, is NOT sleeping with a college senior, because she's full blown into menopause :-/
Um... Dorm sex is weird sex... ?Congrats!  Going back to school when you're older is HUGE!  (i'm back in school and am in my mid 30's... big difference from the office drone stuff I was doing...)
The most click-bait of click-bait, and I love it. I'm glad I didn't skip over this. My step-mom just got done finishing her degree, she's 47, and I can only express my excitement for you that you're doing something of this caliber. Way to go! May you reap the rewards of your education!
That's a dirty trick.... nicely done!
So this hit /r/all. Wow. How does it feel to have be number 3 on this sub?
What drives you toward psych nursing? Where are you from? As an RN in America myslef, I found Psych nursing to be a very hard subset and not at all what most expect. 
I'm a psych RN. Always happy to see others choosing this field.
When I started College in 2013, I was doing evening classes and in my class, there was a 55 years old dentist who decided to go back to school to do something else. I didn't question much, but I do respect that, it must be hard coming back in school later in life.
I really did not understand this at first and I was like...wow she is incredibly optimistic LOL.Good for you! I wish you the best of luck ^.^
oh yeah? i'm a mother fucker.
This is one of the longest conversations I've seen in this sub! Wow OP, your trick worked!
That is awesome. I have been seeing a psychiatric nurse practitioner for about 2 years and she has helped me way more than any of the psychiatrists I have seen.Good luck.
Wow, that twist. Hey, now he can boast to his friends that he's nailing a college girl! Good job OP, psychology is pretty amazing and I loved it when i had to study it.
I saw this post in /r/rising and thought,"Damn... that sucks." See it hit front page and cannot believe I missed out on this little doozy! You sly goose!
Juicy click bait title with a twist and a happy ending. Have my bloody upvote, you monster.
I kept skipping over this guiltily because I am a young college student who likes older men. I avoid people in relationships or marriage, but they will sometimes lie to you. When it comes out... all hell breaks loose. On the other hand, congratulations!
motherfuck
Nice twist m8. Good Luck! :D
WOW! You really had me going for a second.  Good luck!
You tryna give me a heart attack!? You had me worried! Good luck with your goal, I hope you can achieve it.
You are never too old to get an education. Cheers to you dear :)
Hah reminds me of one of those Thomas Sander's vines, good for you!
Congrats! keep on going forward! :D
The highest of fives to you for this wonderful post!!
Hah, awesome twist!!!I would seriously give you Gold for that, if I wasn't dirt broke right now :PIn fact, is there a way to set a reminder? Like "in three months, remind me to Gold this topic creator"?
Ha! Congrats!
Any reason for psychiatric nursing? Aside from having a really neat title to put on your business cards?
Congratulations! You had me going there. How come psychiatric nursing though?
In my head this went from you getting cheated on, to you having an open relationship, to everything making sense. 
The only way this could get better is if he was a college professor. 
I still read that wrong.... thought he was sleeping with another woman and you were okay with it and in the know. Whateves.
Good luck!
I know psych nursing is a specialty that's always in demand, too. Which is always a plus. A woman in my (nursing) classes is in her mid-50s and is running circles around most of us. Good luck!
Dammit I wanted a juicy story.
Congratulations! 
Oh, the suspense! The drama! Best wishes to you! 
Damn you OP. 
god dammit : (
So, how are things?
Congrats! Title had me confused at first. Too many ways that title could turn out.
Congrats! Very insipring!
Good luck to you! I'm about to graduate from nursing and currently taking my psych nursing clinical right now. Nursing (school) is really tough but i feel that it is one of the most rewarding jobs. Hope you achieve it
I'm picturing him being a tall bearded man
Congrats, OP! My birth-mom went back to school later in life as well (we'd laugh at the fact that we were in college at the same time!), and loved every second of it. Good luck! 
Faith in humanity maintained.  Thank you.
Psych nursing is not fun.  I worked two years in inpatient acute psych.  You will get made fun of, insulted, spat on, hair pulled, and attacked.  I guarantee  it.  But if you can handle that, then go for it.
Unless you like spending your day handing out medications, I'd advise another field. Easy ass job if that's what you are looking for.
Read the title and was like, oh my god, what the fuck. I was definitely relieved after clicking on this. Happy for you that you're going back to school! I'm in LPN school and there are a few 40-50 year olds in my program. Better late than never :)
It took an embarrassingly long time for me to get that, LOL! That's awesome- you'll make a Great nurse!
Woohoo congrats!  I'm a nurse, though not in the psychiatric realm.  That's the beauty of nursing... There are *so* many avenues of the profession.  
Congrats!Proud of you internet stranger. Get him a schoolgirl costume as a present ;)
I don't quite get it. so these two are already in divorce? what?
I want to go into psychiatry, too :') Congratulations
Oh my gosh! You're amazing. This is going to be me. I'm 21 and already have a wonderful family. We are financially stable right now so I spend my time caring for our son. I work odd jobs to help contribute but ultimately I am completely devoted to caring for my family and can't wait until I get the chance to go back to school! You're an inspiration. I have been exploring careers in behavioral hospitals and didn't even know of such a thing like psychiatric nursing. Now I know!! Thanks!  
Jesus OP, You had my heart pounding when I read the title! Reddit cannot handle these things!...or maybe just me, but still!
My mom has been a psychiatric nurse for 20+ years.  She just got nurse of the year at her facility!  Congrats on starting your new journey.  PM me if you have any questions you want me to ask her.  Good luck and enjoy!
I was expecting a very different post.You made me smile. Thanks.:)
You can do it! My mom went back at age 49, English as a second language. She has been a respiratory therapist for almost 20 years now :)
i love you
I was going to say "good for him college chicks are hot" but then you let me down.Now I am going to get a coffee
You could have said you liked to watch and then referenced looking in the mirror.
Congratulations! That's awesome. :D I'm starting college at 27 with the goal of a masters or phd so I can teach at the college level. I want to help people succeed.It's never, ever too late. And I respect you so much for putting your children first but still living your life. I hope I can find that balance when I one day have kids.
You scared me in the best way possible. Goodluck /u/Nikki4321 !!!
Congratulations! 
I knew it would be something cutsie by the subreddit!If this was in /r/relationships the title would be "My [44F] husband [40M] of one year is sleeping with a [19F] college freshman. Should I tell him this makes me uncomfortable or am I being crazy?".
I just woke up and was confused for a good minute why the hell you're ok with it and what does you going to school have to do with it.Good for you!
How did you find out?
Oh I get it....      It took me awhile......then......Hit me like a brick!!!    Good for both of you and best of luck in your chosen career....
goodluck on college! it's never too late :)
Remember as a mother you know best.
How cool! It's a brave thing to go to college at any age, but especially when you've already been out of school for so long. I hope it goes well for you.
When I saw that title, I thought of one sad and two good things that could have happened. Good thing 2# turned out to be true.
Have you ever thought of going into internet journalism instead? You sure know how to write a title!
Best of luck, this is coming from a 39yo recent graduate. I was on the two decade plan lol.
Didn't see that coming. Nice! I like that not only is it you, but you're actually 4 years older!
The old Bait and Click!  Well done for you!
That's AWESOME!!!! 
Ugh. I had to read that 4 times before I realized wtf was going on.  Bravo.
Good luck in your studies! Way to go!!!
CLIICKKK BAITTT. c; good one though. have an upvote.
Phew!  I got that urge to vomit when I saw the post.
\#StopTheClickbait
Boy I  came here ready to be depressed.
I was about to congratulate your husband......
Congratulations on being a master at clickbait. 
You scared the piss out of me. Had I been in /r/relationships or something I would have thought "that sucks" whle I glaze over the front page...I guess it goes to show how much I care for the CC community.Kudos to you, more power to ya!
Nice twist, but I called it before I clicked.As an aside, I know many psych nurses. They have wildly varying opinions of the profession.
Mods pls ban shitty clickbait titles
Moon Knight Shamalongadingdong
In that movie the 6th Sense - that dude in the hairpiece? That's Bruce Willis the whole movie. 
The amazing part is that it had two twists.  One when you figured out that she was the college freshman, and another when you figure out that she's 44.
Or O'Henry
Thank you! It is a big step but so far so good. 
I just had se-ee-eeex, and it felt so good, (felt so good)!
My mom decided she wanted to be a homemaker while my brother and I were growing up (occasionally volunteering and working part time at our school's office and such) and dad stayed the primary breadwinner. once we graduated high school she decided to start classes for her HIT degree! We actually wound up having two classes together which was pretty awesome. 
I'm sorry, come by and I'll bake you some cookies. :)
Haha I told his Sister and she told him how disgusting he was before I let her in on it.  It was pretty funny.  
I've always wanted one of those! 
I'm sorry I toyed with your emotions. My ex husband was a jerk, you can comfort me about that? 
Thank you!  I hope you laughed
Haha, thank you!  He does think I'm awesome.  He has 13 degrees himself.  Masters and a few bachelor's and associates. He is so very encouraging!  He thinks I'm the best thing since sliced bread.  I just appreciate him so much.  He thinks I'm smart, so I'm just going to work hard and do my best.  
Um... Tommy Chong has rectal cancer. Is that better? That ruined my day.  :p
You mean refrain? I'm sorry.  I thought I was being funny.  I'll try again.  
Really? That's great! Was it hard?  I'm kind of worried I am not smart enough anymore.  No school in like 28 yrs.  So far so good but I heard the program is hard
Oh, that's awful and awesome!  Wait... You know what I mean!  So what are you studying? 
Dorm sex would be weird!  Thank you! Best wishes to you.  What are you studying? 
Thank you.  How is it for you? 
It's really different to be back in a classroom after 28 yrs.  Trying to relearn how to learn.  But so far so good! 
Lol, I'm pretty shocked anyone cared!  
I know I'm a bad person.  I'm sorry... Kinda... Sorta. 
Thank you! 
Thank you! I'm so excited. I've gotten A's in my first class on everything.  I've never done a power point before and I scored over on it.  It was pretty fun! 
Few reasons. My mother was ill, and she passed it to me, in turn I passed it to my son who committed suicide 8 yrs ago. I didn't know I was sick, just thought all the crazy ups and downs were normal. Didn't know my mom was sick until recently because she died before I was two. I have a feeling, reading her file, it was not an accident when she died. I've always been drawn to the mentally ill, and I just want to help the people that are closest to my heart. I believe because I was sick and am now stable several years, that I have a unique perspective to offer and give hope. 
Came here for some dirt, didn't you? Lol
Things are good.  4 yrs ago life really sucked.  I'd felt like I lost everything, but it turned out that my ex husband was worse than I thought he was, and losing him was the best thing for me.  My youngest moved out, and now we have a great relationship, my new husband is incredibly supportive and so far I've gotten an A or above on all my assignments.  I'm really happy and putting a lot of effort in not waiting for the other shoe to drop.  I'm living in today.  And today is amazing.  How are you? 
I can.  I don't mind.  I raised 4 kids.  I'm used to it.  :)
I think it depends on where you go.  Some nursing is more hands on.  Thank you, though. 
Lol, thank you!  Hopefully I will do OK 
No, we are married.  I just started school so I am a freshman in college, so the freshman he is sleeping with is me, see? 
We do have one on the ceiling... That would have been funny.  Haha
:)  what was the other good thing? 
Ah! Nice!  So what did you decide to be when you grew up? 
Yes, he insisted I needed a 'younger man' in my life.  He's such a goober. 
Lol thank you! Sorry I broke your brain
Oh I feel bad! I'm sorry.  You OK? 
But instead I made you happy? 
Nah, this was clever. Usually they're annoying though

Good for you, it can be tough to keep the bedroom romance going over the years. ;)
I just graduated nursing school in December and work as a psychiatric nurse! It is absolutely the most rewarding job I've ever had! Mental health is my jam. I honestly couldn't see myself working in any other field. Not a lot of people want to go into psych tho, so I commend you. It's not always easy but it is so worth it! Good luck!
I actually know someone who went back to college in their late 30s and completely changed their profession, so you can do it too!she became a great psychologist 
A woman let me stick my penis inside of herrrrrr!
Hearing Instrument Technology? I know a few people that went back for one of those too!You know, there's that stigma that having classes with one of your parents would be embarrassing. But really, I would just be proud of them and happy to have someone to study with/keep me motivated.The mom/dad jokes would be okay too. Any friends that weren't okay with it wouldn't be worthwhile friends.
Don't be making undeliverable promises, now, OP! We'll be seeing you in /r/food! 
Good thing she didn't start crying and apologising for not saying anything earlier.
hahahah. Yes - "it's okay. you have a new, better husband now."
There is cancer in places that there should never be cancer. Can he press charges against the cancer? I suspect this invasion was not consentual.
I mean your thread is still up. We just don't want to fall into the same 'click bait' titled nature of other subs. 
You'll probably destroy the grading curves in all your classes!
You're talking about the collectively NICEST people on Reddit. Of course they'll care!
The worst! Haha. Good luck with the degree. You can do it.
That makes me smile so much! Congrats!! That's a great achievement :DAlso, if you get sick of PowerPoint, check out Prezi. It's a little different, but still fun! 
I have been looking into going to school for my RPN for a couple years now. I never wanted to be a nurse in my life, but I would love to be a counsellor. Psychiatric Nursing scares me, because I have never thought I was smart enough or strong enough to do it. I like your story, and can relate. You have inspired me to give schooling to be a RPN another look. Thank you. And good luck!
No, I felt sad that your husband was cheating on you :(
ER nurses for example are definitely hands on. Psychiatric nurses not so much. I worked in the top Psych hospital in the US. You would shit yourself if you knew some of the people who were inpatients there. People from all over the world. I left the field when insurance reform hit around 1996.
Sounds like you guys like to have fun lol. I have always been intrigued by the mirror on the ceiling. 
Polyamory, to be honest.
Well....I started out in political science, then business administration, then public relations followed up with MIS. After years of misguidance and misdirection, I graduated with an Interdisciplinary Studies degree since it used most of my random credits. I've been in IT for 15 years so....lol! HR at my job really just wanted a(ny) degree to justify the pay raise.
Oh, I'm ok now.  What's the opposite of vomiting? Because that's what I did when it turned out to be great news!
You did :D
Thank you, I wasn't trying to offend anyone, just being funny.  
M. Naughty Salamidong
Well, we try to keep it fresh, lol
Title says they've been married a year... 
Health Into Technology actually, but that's also another one that people seem to flock to! There were people in one of our classes that tried to determine if we were siblings or dating (she looks really young for her age), so there was that! Slightly embarrassing there for a bit, but we were easily able to laugh it off.
Oh, I need to post there! I have the prefect cake for it! 
I gave a short, lecherous chuckle but this may be the wrong subreddit for wincest jokes ;-p
Thank you for leaving it up.  I appreciate that.  I'll be more careful.  (wasn't being a smart ass about refrain, I wasn't sure if you wanted me to  reframe my post)  
Thank you for that.  I really appreciate it.  I will be asking a lot of questions on this journey to make sure it's what I want.  That gives me a lot to think about.  
Oh, wow.  I'm glad I could help!  You can do this!!  I thought about counseling, but having lost a son to suicide, I couldn't take the burden.  I'm sure you will do great! Keep me posted! 
I would watch a porn called this, if it was basically all just crazy over the top twists.Like the guy cums, the camera zooms out, and the girl was actually a pizza all along
So some bondage BDSM now and then?
oh! Post in /r/baking if you haven't already!
Thank you, I think it will be a very fulfilling career. I'm a support worker right now, working with adults with mental disabilities, and I enjoy it, a lot. But I feel like I could be doing more with my life to really help people. I think you have a great attitude and you will go far with it, especially since you have so much of your own mental health experience. I look forward to an update from you in the future to hear how awesome you are doing!

I got.. " your genius is showing"
It has to do with the CSS, I think there are around 25 custom sayings that the mods change up every now and thenjust counted, actually 35 custom sayings including some never stated
I noticed this yesterday! I think it only shows on the PC though...? I haven't seen the quotes pop up when I'm on the app
I upvoted every single comment here. What the hell happens to this subreddit? Is it /r/CasualUpvoting now?
I don't see any cute sayings. :(
Oh, sneaky! So many people will now upvote your post! :P You'll get a few extra valueless, imaginary internet points!I got "Your genius is showing" and it doesn't change if I downvote and upvote again
But... I'm a Terran. I can't build any additional pylons. I cannot help you, /r/CasualConversation!
Your genius is showing
I just gave away so many unnecessary upvotes to see these quotes.
I have RES installed and it doesn't work. :(
Time to upvote everything...
I just did a whole bunch of upvotes and I see no quirky quotes :( I'm on a PC too. What am I doing wrong?
That is pretty darn cool. Karma..
But what do they mean?
wow - I stopped watching the hockey - just to be transfixed by floating words - its Rad maan 
This is awesome!It's the best upvoting experience I've had since that sub where the upvote turned into a rocket and did some elaborate little animation! What sub was that, anyway?
If I agreed with you, we'd both be wrong.

I'm on mobile. :(
Ive been up-voting like mad. what a good feature
I got "your genius is showing", then upon upvoting the person commenting with the same message I got "master of karate and friendship"
I just upvoted a bunch of posts just to see it happen. 
Quick, do me, do me!

Whats mine?
I wonder what mine is!

It's like a fortune cookie, but you're not expected to eat it.
It's the same thing in /r/youdontsurf. They have those quirky quotes for upvotes and downvotes. There are around 4 quotes for upvotes and downvotes
Cheeky monkey!
I got "too much chlorine in the gene pool" twice in a row today.Is /r/casualconversation trying to tell me something?
I just upvoted the hole frontpage. Just to see some quotes :)
This is really cool!
I know how it can be done, since I was intrigued by the /r/askscience header and how it changed every time I went on there. So I did some digging and found that there is an element in the logout button form. It is an "input" element that is called "uh" and its value is a random alpha-numeric string. Then all you have to do is provide conditions using pseudo selectors to that string and then use even more pseudo selectors to add different content strings. If you do it by the first letter (what ask science do) then you get 36 possible values.
I got nothing because I'm on mobile
Not when you're mobile. 
Hahahaha I got "What are these words?"
I think every sub should have this
Smooth OP, asking for upvotes in a smart manner.
"master of karate and friendship".  haha!  I think that is accurate actually!
I got that as well for the OP and the same "master of karate and friendship" when upvoting your comment.
Yours is:>Master of karate and friendshipMine appears to be "topkek"; are these our own quotes?
Master of Karate and friendship. 
What does mine say? :O
...But will your genius still show after 4 month, is the question..
You are probably right, because your upvote quote is the same as /u/Supernintendolover's - "master of karate and friendship".
How does everyone's saying stay the same no matter who upvotes them?
When I up-vote, it stops me clicking the minimise comment button.Its like it creates a box that covers that area. If i try to click it, it takes away the up-vote
"/u/CrashWho is p cool." is your upvote quote.
Yes, because it's done with subreddit styles. Apps don't use subreddit styles. Or at least none of the major ones do; it's possible, but it likely wouldn't play nicely with the app's layout (not to mention that it requires a full browser -- CSS support is extremely complex).
If you use your phone's browser it'll work.
Yep, and upvoting you just gave me "Little too much chlorine in that gene pool" ... Ehh, what?
Casual Karma train is pretty chill
"Let's get weird" =)
This is Sparta!
why unnecessary?  it's fun!!you made mod smile
:*( I'm sorry.I believe in you.  I still upvoted you.  
Do you have "Use subreddit style" checked in the sidebar? If so, are you using keyboard navigation? It doesn't work unless you actually click on it.
Here's to feeling good all the time!
I'm on a PC and the message is in red...you have to be quick because the message fades up.
little too much chlorine in the gene pool 
Onion is the devil apple!
you made mod smile
It is pretty awesome.  I agree!  :d2Casual4Me
"WHOOMP THERE IT IS"p/s: what I saw when I upvoted you. This almost feel too coincidental to be true. Are these mods real? Maybe mods are just a collective manifestation of a supercomputer hiding behind reddit. Is this sub real, or is this an alternate reality? What does 'real' even mean? 42? 
Siting. the great levler
THIS IS SPARTA!
Yes, I agree.  These messages are cute & funny!Come on and slam 
I'm glad because the fun is almost ending.  It was a hell of a ride.  You missed out on some of it.  But you need to at least catch the ending.Pyrowolf8 is awesome

Hehe yeah! :DSiting. the great levler
Are you on a PC?  Use FireFox or Chrome.  That appears to be the browsers that show the upquotes as someone called them.  Upvote people on this sub and a quote appears.  You have to be fast, because it's in red and it fades upwards quite quickly.  If you miss it, upvote again, the arrow becomes gray and if you upvote again you can see the message again.  Keep doing those steps until you can read the message completely.  Hope that helps."What are these words?"
That's a great comparison Ill be back
Yes, I agree!! :dTake me to the karma shop I'll let you lick my karma pop

Well....no. I now got "Mark i did not heet her"
"Batman upvotes, too" I'm just going to upvote everyone on this sub from now on. 
I change them up too :P
my interpretation is that it would be the same for that initial comment but others that they make will be different, I've had other things to look into with other subs though so I haven't put in a lot of effort into it
"Let's get weird"
Random lol I wonder what they mean or how that happened. 
Thanks ! I'll have to check it out. 
Was that an insult? :P"Come on and slam!"
That's my favorite so far!! "This is Sparta"
"THIS IS SPARTA!"
The message you are looking for is in another upvote
Yeah.. there's nothing. I'm going to try a different browser and see..
So apparently it doesn't work on Internet Explorer, which is what I use on my work computer. Going to start using Firefox instead :)
Why thankyou! 
Agreed, I'm a filthy casual :x
nope chuck testa

Hmm strange. Yes I am on a pc and I use chrome. I do run adblock if that has anything to do with it? I'm guessing the message will appear where my mouse pointer is correct? I don't see diddly squat. Oh well.

I disagree as well! Onions are the best, but I can see them being devilish if I tried to eat them like an apple.And thank you, not_a_wallaby isn't too shabby either! :)(also your upvote phrase was "THIS IS SPARTA!")

"topkek"I keep forgetting to go to the subreddit page to upvote so I can see the message, so I have to go and re-upvote. 
"you made a mod smile"It's like a roller coaster when no one else is in line. You roll back into the station and they just let you keep going!
"/u/CrashWho is p cool"You sneaky devil spreading all these upvotes and happiness! :)
"Nope, Chuck Testa"You definitely could. Perhaps that is why they are the devil? Killing people with bad breath seems kind of satan-y.
I feel like my SO might appreciate that reddit is slowly educating me on Seinfeld jokes, so I'm not as clueless.
Why are you such a sweetums
You made mod smile
It was a really nice thing for the mods to do. I think it's pretty cool.

This is my second favorite!! Batman upvotes, too
Well that was absolutely harrowing to read; I can't begin to imagine what it was like to experience.
But have you truly *lived*?
That's pretty damn interesting for sure. Not many people can say they can experience and remember all of that. Thanks for sharing.
This is absolutely super interesting, OP. Thanks for sharing! I also teared up at the crying EMT part. Glad you made such an amazing recovery :')
ER nurse here. I can assure you that you are a story that the medical staff at the hospital will be talking about for years to come. 
Intense!What happened to the girl who you T-boned? Did she survive? What about your friend?
You make it sound pretty pleasant tbh
Damn, and you don't remember anything during those 113 seconds? Basically just sleeping? 
During the 113 second duration while you were dead, when you woke up, what did it feel like, in terms of time passing?  Did time feel like it was instant like when you wake up from sleep?  Did you wake up groggy (after the shock)?  
Thank you for sharing this. As I get older, I think about death more and more. My mom once coded while having heart surgery and she spoke about having an out of body experience and floating above herself, but not recognizing it was her. She was gone for approx 90 seconds before the defibrillator worked. She said the same thing about the taste, smell and pain of being brought back that way, but she was grateful. 
Wow, I can't imagine what you went through. I'm so happy you made it back. Did anything else happen when you were gone?
Well this does nothing to alleviate the crippling fear of my inevitable death.
What was bleeding so bad that you lost so much blood? Artery in your arms? Back?also i cant read this again bcus i almost had a panic attack, for some reason descriptions of death trigger my anxiety like nothing else lol
Thank you so much for sharing this, that's such an amazing story! I'm so glad you're alive to tell it too. 
That was quite the read.What made you "die"? Was it blood loss or something else?
This topic interests me to no end, so thanks for sharing!One question - What was the first thought you remember after being brought back? I'm just curious what a brain's first response would be to being shocked back into existence.
So you could still remember what happened before you died? That's fascinating to me. I just assumed the brain would forget things while you were dead. How was your long-term memory afterwards? Could you still remember things?
Do you know what happened to the person that caused the accident?
Making me cry in a subway store isn't cool, dude.
What sensory did you lose last? My bf shot himself a few years ago and I read that hearing is to go last. I always think that he heard the chirping of birds and the wind before he died. 
I don't work in the medical field(CPR certified though) but I'm pretty sure a defibrillator doesn't start a stopped heart like the movies lead us to believe.  They are used to reset the heart beat when it's irregular.  
Don't think anyone has asked this:did it hurt, being flung out the windshield and all those cuts that the pooling blood came from? Or did it happened so fast that you couldn't really think about the pain?
I was sitting eating breakfast while reading this....this is insane. I was just thinking about how it must have felt when seeing a pool of blood around you. I am glad you survived the ordeal!
I guess your username checks out?It sounds like you had some massive blood loss. Did you get transfusions or was it just the injuries that made you go out, or the blood loss?
Quite an interesting story you have there! Thanks for sharing. Dying is always something I've thought about. I could never imagine what it was like 
Do you still have any scars from the accident?
It was fascinating to read your story. I'm glad it turned out well. My mom believes she died in a car wreck when she was 17. My dad would roll his eyes and say if you were really dead you wouldn't be here. I feel pretty certain you can return from the brink. Not sure if there's anything after this tho.
>I wish I had replied to herWas this referring to your mother, or someone else?
Ok, now I have anxiety, because what you're describing sounds kinda similar to being put under for an endoscopy, and I am supposed to have another one this year.  If I equate that feeling with dying, I'm not sure I can do the procedure again.
All I want to know is if you told your mom you loved her after you woke up. My heart broke when I read that was your last thought. Glad you lived to tell your story.
What killed you? Did you bleed out? If so, from where? 
I had a diabetic attack a couple months ago and I can only imagine what you went through. 
> My final though was "I wish I had replied to her,"I tried to find the answer in the comments but couldn't. Was this thought relating to your mum? or a crush? By the way, that is the first time i've ever read something like it! You all good now?
Do you remember feeling the chest compressions? What was it like? 
1( was your friend OK?2( did the blood turn out to be yours?3( were did it turn out you'd been hurt? 4( how far out of the windshield did you go?
Did you suffer any brain damage from the 2 minutes of death? How was your body overall right after the accident
Hey I'm living in Japan too! Loved your story, sounds really intense. I'm shocked you have that vivid recollection of the event. 
How was your mum afterwards?
Incredible story! Thanks for sharing. I work in EMS, it's actually really common for people to say sorry to first responders.
This has to be the best thing I've read on Reddit. Thanks for sharing your amazing story. Glad your alive and well. 
I'm listening to really emotional music right now, and reading this made me tear up big time. You sound like a wonderful human. So glad you're still with us.
TDLR: Everything went black, just like falling asleep
>I later found out that my heart had stopped for 113 seconds.How did they restart his heart, I thought that wasn't possible with just defibrillators??
Holy shit you're lucky dude. Do you have any sick scars?
I always wanted to ask this to someone who was brought back with the defib. Does that leave any lingering effects on your heart? Like, does the doctor tell you not to do cardio anymore or something like that? I hope you are all okay man!
Awesome read. Sounds honestly a lot of like what I imagine dying is. Which is itself pretty surreal. What we're some of your thoughts as you were going through those moments of kind of a realization that you were... Dying I guess. I've always been curious. I'm glad you made it and thanks for sharing man.
So what special talent did you come back with?
Amazing story. Thank you. I'm glad you are alive and well.I've been curious for a long time and studied NDEs, OOBEs, Astral Projection, and Lucid Dreams extensively along with my own experiments. Anything you recall in between "falling asleep" and being defibrillated? Or was there any time distortion that you perceived in the process of coming back to life along with the flash and loud bang sound?
This was a crazy read.  Thank you for sharing your story!
Did you talk to your mom about this afterward and tell her that you loved her? I looked trough the answers and couldn't find this.
This is incredible to read. Real sorry you went through that but amazing that you were lucky enough to make it through
I've never cried from reading anything in my life but >My final though was "I wish I had replied to her."really touched me and lets just say my first sentence is now a lie. I'm glad you're alright.
I'm really glad to hear this! I could hardly say anything so I just kind of blurted out what felt right. I've said in other comments that I really just felt like what was happening was just going to let everybody down. So I felt like somebody needed to hear that I wasn't doing it deliberately.
Maybe its odd to say, but I would imagine that particular night  was much worse for my friends and family than it was for me. The recovery afterwards definately sucked though.
Asking the real questions.
No problem! Most people think that its really strange that I was concious up until the fact. A lot of the doctors wanted to interview me about the experience after they had found out.
I actually got the chance to thank him afterwards. I think he was pretty new; he told me that I was the first person he had ever used the defibrillator on.I ended up with like 45 stitches, a back brace, and a torn Trapezius (the muscle in your back.) I was also placed on life support for a couple of hours. I got up and pulled the tube out because I had to pee, the doctors were super SUPER unhappy about it.I feel like not remembering vividly, especially from your childhood, is probably not too bad of a thing.
I'd already teared up at "I wish I could have replied to my mom" but that's just the cherry on the cake.
Thank you! I'm glad you enjoyed reading it.
At least I made an impression somewhere, I suppose haha
The girl did survive, her car ended up spinning out and hitting a utility pole after we hit her. She went to the hospital for minor injuries according to the police report.My friend was trapped in the car because the dash had folded in and pinned his leg to the seat. The fire department ended up using a bottle jack to push it back forward enough to get him out. He also went to the hospital but was only bruised.
Honestly, at the time I wasn't really scared about it at all, so it wasn't unpleasant in that way for me. There also wasn't much pain twords the end so I wasn't in agony either.All of the unpleasent feelings that I felt were mostly from sadness. It really felt like I was going to let everyone down and there wasn't much I could do about it. 
No, I really don't. It was just like I had nodded off and had a very rude, yet much appreciated awakening.
This concludes that being dead will be a weird experience considering your consciousness is *off* forever. Imagining being unconscious for a non-finite time seems impossible.
It didn't feel like any time had passed. I had no idea that I had died. I learned it later at the trama center while I was getting my stitches.I actually can't answer if I was groggy or not; honestly I don't think so though. I mean, I was jolted awake and then given shot after shot of adrenaline. They're pretty mean with those shots too. I got one of them right in the chest. After that you're pretty awake haha
That's really interesting. I was actually put under to have my wisdom teeth pulled and I had a dream that I was the dentist pulling them!I'm glad your mom made it through. Being shocked is a super strange experience.
> She was gone for approx 90 seconds before the defibrillator worked. I'm sorry but I don't really understand what you're trying to say... A defibrillator will do nothing to someone who is dead as a defibrillator is used to stop the heart. 
As in "the light at the end of the tunnel" occurrence? No, literally the only way for me to explain it is by attributing it to a dreamless night of sleep.When I woke up I remember being really warm though, which people like to joke about quite often. 
Jeez, I'm glad that it worked out about equally okay for you!
Concussion? I had a similar experience playing backyard football and taking a strong knee to the head.. twice..
How much blood loss is considered a lot I know I needed about 64 units of blood when I got in my accident but idk if that's a lot or most people need about that much I know I was hurt fairly badly but I didn't know how badly 
haha something along the lines of "HOLY SHIT WHAT JUST HAPPENED." and then I was confused about the ambulance guy yelling at me and the ambulance girl yelling at him and then I got a lot of shots.I had a chance to think about it later though and I realize that they were probably just communicating with eachother on a play-by-play of what was happening. 
It's super intense. Its nice to hear that everything ended up okay for you also. That stuff is no joke man.
Yeah my memory was fine, I don't vividly remember much of my time in the actual hospital, but I attribute that to the pain medication that I had been given. I don't have any memory problems from it.
I know from the police report that her car had spun out and hit a utility pole on the opposite side of the road and that she had gone to the hospital with minor injuries.
Wow, that's terrible. Hearing was the last thing that I remember, I couldn't really hear what was going on around me though. It was more like my body tuned to the sound of my heartbeat.
I'm sorry to hear of your loss.  I had an experience somewhat similar to the OP and it was very much like lying in bed at night with your eyes closed - everything is black,  you feel warm,  no pain and you can just hear what's happening around you. Your thinking is probably spot on,  he'd have been completely comfortable and only been aware of the birds and breeze.  
You are correct, I'm also not a medical professional and I'm not exactly sure of the steps that they took in between heart stopping and defibrillation. I know they did chest compressions, and I assume that there was also some kind of medication in there.The man from the ambulance told me himself how long it had been though, its the only reason I know.
That and the way the bystanders were looking at me were some of the worst parts of the whole thing. It really felt that it was something that shouldn't be allowed to happen by the laws of nature.
ahh sorry if that wasn't clear. Yes it was to my mother, I could tell that she was hysterical when she called out to me; so it was a really awful feeling that I couldn't physically reply to her at the time.
Yeah I lost about 3 - 4 pints of blood, mostly from my head, neck, and shoulder region. I had a gash that went from above my left eye and up to about the middle of my head. 
diabetes is no joke, make sure you take care of yourself!
yeah sorry, there was one other that asked this same question. I was referring to my mom, I could tell that she was hysterical at the seen of the accident when she called out to me.It really was a shit feeling that I couldn't even get out an "I love you too." the last time that I thought I would see her.
Too Dong Lidn't Read
I became really good at talking to suicide survivors.
"I swear I'm not dying on purpose" 
I've been in a really bad accident before too and this is the same way I look at it. I feel bad my best friend had to sit there for a while thinking she'd seen me die, pretty traumatizing for her, while I don't really remember much.Glad you're okay though.. hope youre not in any pain anymore!
They're really asking if you've rebelled against England.
did you take advantage of the opportunity and tell them you saw a giant one-eyed cat at the end of the tunnel, and that it was speaking to you in perfectly understandable mathematical equations that explained the nature of the universe and put you as ease and oneness, and that you still harbor this state of mind? And that you can predict events with a 5-second lead?
>I got up and pulled the tube out because I had to pee, and the doctors were super SUPER unhappy about it.I'm a respiratory therapist, and this made me giggle a bit. Sure, you could have damaged your vocal chords, or your throat could have swelled, but most of the time, if you're strong enough to actually stand up, normally you're fine. Don't do that again. <3 
>I actually got the chance to thank him afterwards.That really made me smile. I can imagine that the first time would be particularly stressful. But he did it, he saved you, and I'd like to imagine that it gave him to confidence to help a lot of other people from then on knowing that he had the power to make a difference.
~~(there's more than one back muscle)~~
Thanks for sharing. I had a near death experience after falling 22 feet through a skylight on my roof deck. I don't know how I lived but stories like these make me know that there are survivors like us. Much love <3
The dashboard, from the sound of it.
Has she ever contacted you to apologize? Have you met her ever, in court or whatnot? 
Hey, I know it's a weird thing to ask, but I was wondering if I could use your story and specifically this comment for some of the suicide prevention stuff I do. If not that's completely fine, but I like to ask my sources.
That's how I imagine it'll be with death. Its not the dying, it's the helplessness. Every time I see some sort of death, I always get this ping in my heart about how terrible it must be to know you're slipping away and can't do anything about it. That's my #1 fear about dying, that helplessness. 
Thank you for sharing your story. My gma passed away yesterday and although it wasn't due to an event like yours, it brings comfort to read about your lack of pain. I know her body was causing her a lot of discomfort the last 6 months so it's calming to know the moment was most likely peaceful
Being electrocuted while sleeping is pretty rude, but in this case, not as rude as usual 
Aaaaand you just lost a multi-million dollar book deal.
> being dead will be a weird experienceIt won't be any kind of experience. You'll be dead.
I watched Wayward Pines once, and I struggled to wrap my head around how confused the residents were to know that thousands of years have passed since the last time they were cryo-frozen. When they woke up they felt like their last memories were like a day ago; they were not a day ago.Then I realised the passage of time is an emergent property; an illusion due to our stream of consciousness. When you pass out, or even die, (and then get revived), it can feel like the time hasn't passed at all. 
Wait so you haven't had surgery to repair your torn trapezius? What's the extent of the tear and does it limit your movements in any way?
I guess dying and being brought back to life a weird sensation :pGlad you are doing okay. My friend got in a head on collision with a drunk driver and died so knowing someone like you exist makes me happy :)Hug your friends and family for me
Very strange. Did the experience confirm or change your views on afterlife?
I had the same feeling when I woke up after I hit my head and had a seizure. My whole body felt warm.
man, you missed out on a free dose of DMT.
Yep! That was many years ago when I was in high school. It was a very interesting trip, that's for sure. My friends asked me if I wanted to go to the hospital once we were back in the car. I said no, since there probably wasn't really anything they could do except give me some pain medication and maybe an ice pack and charge me a few thousand dollars for it. So far, so good. I've actually been trying to remember what Park it was at because I'd like to do it again (w/O the flip this time). 
I just wanted to say that your matter-of-fact prose is refreshing. This entire thread was worth reading.
Make sure you monitor your sleep as well. Both excessive sleepiness (narcolepsy) and insomnia can be caused by head trauma. You said it was six years ago, but sometimes it is hard to notice narcolepsy (it isn't always falling asleep via sleep attacks, sometimes it is just needing to sleep for 11+ hours to feel rested).
You don't know anything about if she faced charges? Considering she killed you and all? 
Thank you for this. You have no idea how much better this makes me feel about my uncle's death.
That would've sucked! Even just thinking about it. It's so shocking, did you feel as if everything was a dream, as if nothing was hurting , all that was going on was thoughts in your mind?
I needed to laugh after reading something so emotional.  Haha thank you.
What was the nature of the universe?I dunno, I wasn't taking notes.
Then someone accidentally knocks his oatmeal over and he catches it before it hits the ground like Spiderman?
See that's the thing that kinda comforts me, that there's no memory. If/when I go, I certainly won't know about it.
Believe me, after the way it felt it's not something I would do again!
I like your user name
I just want to say that I absolutely love your username now that I know you're a respiratory therapist :) 
Ahh I guess its worth mentioning. I was in a ton of pain when I got up out of the street but the pain I can remember only lasted minutes at best. I'm sure that between adrenaline and shock I was more concerned with how much blood I was losing.
My trapezius
No I never heard anything else from or about her. I doubt that she even knew the extent of my injuries. My lawyer was able to deal with the court without me being there.
go ahead, I don't mind at all!
I live with constant pain and had an experience similar to OP though not due to an accident.  It was the first time in years where there was no pain,  I wasn't afraid, I just felt warm, comfortable and relaxed. I felt bad knowing that my mum would be devastated but at the same time I knew everything would be okay.  I'm sorry for your loss and I'm sure her passing was peaceful.  
yeah, I had to let it slide that time.
ahh damn, I didn't even think of that! oh well, somehow I'll cope.
I've had nights where "sleep" was the moment between closing and opening my eyes- felt like an instant but in reality, 10 hours had passed. Makes me wonder how feasible(probably not + likely unethic somehow) artificial comas are for "personal time travel" aka. "wake me up in 2040 when we have flying cars ok bye".
This is a good question; I've never been a religious person. I would place myself as Optimistically agnostic. I don't know if theres an actual heaven or hell; but its nice to believe that something happens after we're gone.
yeah in the movies everyone's like "my body feels so cold..." and I'm just like, heh.
Can you explain please? I tried to Google it but I'm still confused...sorry.
What the fuck...why didn't you go to the hospital?! You have no idea what even happened to you..do you? 
Nobody can say for sure, but that's a really amazing and special story.
Thanks for this, I pretty much just threw it up on the page as I thought about it. I'm just glad to hear it made sense.
Ahh I see your question. No I have no idea, I assume that she was ticketed and all of the basics. But I never heard anything about actual charges.
Tears in my eyes and laughter on my lips is an odd roller-coaster.
So was the heart stopping due to blood loss? or shock? I am surprised that you basically died but only had to stay in the hospital for roughly two days!
Answer damnit!
I feel like this is something out of Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.
Assuming it was at ET tube, that'd be because there's a balloon on the end holding it just below your vocal cords :/
What was the outcome?
Only this time? You don't want to be woken up by electricity again? I mean, it's definitely gotta get you going 
Just say you saw some angels and you're set doing talks for life. 
oh yeah that too. I almost forgot about that. I've experienced such 'dreamless sleep' before, and it did trip me out. But I most of the time dream vividly, so such sleep is rare to me.As for the 'personal coma', I'd love to do that if we had the tech, but considering how bad humans are at maintaining our civilisation (based on our histories), plus how I don't trust that my sleeping body would be safe from harm, if the tech really does become available, I'd probably not try it out haha
I figure that if no afterlife is the worst case, then death is a pretty good deal. I mean, a dreamless sleep is pretty relaxing. Imagine that, somehow, trillions of years and big bangs down the line, some absurd level of technology finds a way to reignite your consciousness.You might ask for five more minutes. 
The cold feeling is shock, caused by your blood retreating from your extremities. After you heart was restarted, the blood would have flowed back out to them, probably causing the warm feeling.
the "white light" and general hallucinations many get when dying are suspected to be caused by a release of DMT (a very strong hallucinogen) by your body.afaik it hasn't been proven yet.
DMT is a very powerful psychedelic, the trip feels like home, you "travel to another dimension" with indescribably visuals that look more real than real along side crazy alien music, you might even meet beyond crazy entities. The drug is naturally occurring in the human body.Due to the nature of the trip some believe the dimension it takes you to is what is "after life". There is no evidence that it plays a role in birth/death or dreams. DMT has been found in pineal gland of rats through but there is no proof currently that it's the same with humans or that it has any meaningful role.
It was just a concussion. There is very, very little doctors can do about them. 
This is probably one of the coolest things I've seen on reddit. Seriously, no hyperbole. Thank you for this. 
Its too bad that she didn't visit you or say she was sorry for causing the accident
Do you have the same thing, where it doesn't feel at all that all those people are at work, and it's their job, but it seems more like they were living their life, and then you got ill, and now they have to take care of you? :D
It's the switcheroo. Douglas Adams does that a lot. For example:"It's unpleasantly like being drunk."  "What's unpleasant about being drunk?"  "Go ask a glass of water." 
I once pulled a catheter out(for my wee), not realising it had an air filled balloon keeping it in place :-( nurses were shocked is an understatement
I'm actually not sure as I don't have any kind of extensive medical knowledge, There was a small stopper looking thing at the end but it was pretty small and not very balloon-like.
I had all of my medical bills and physical therapy paid for, lawyer took a huge chunk, and I pocketed about $15,000 which I used to pay for a study abroad trip.
You're on to something here. We need to pantent the electric alarm clock. I'm thinking "Shock-Clock" for the product name.
That would be too obvious. Just say you saw a middle-aged chinese woman looking at you disappointedly.THAT'll garner some attention.
This reads like the beginning of a novel, and I want more!
Your consciousness is only a result of the brain holding it together. Once that is turned to dust, there's no coming back. I wish there was a way
Surely it would be pretty easy to prove, no?
Thank you, very informative and interesting. I read the Wikipedia page but it sounded more like a synthetic drug people take.
Maaan I want to try DMT, but like, I have sleep paralysis too, so I'm worried that I'll have a hellacious trip, and not a fun one. I am a lucid dreamer, and my dreams quite literally to other people that I have told them to, say, "you got a free dose of DMT," which is why I want to try it lol
I'd actually imagine that her insurance told her not to contact me directly. My friends insurance told us something similar, not to initiate contact with her. 
My wife is a nurse and has seen that happen. And been shocked. 
..wtf. Just having the nurses pull the catheter out of me was awful, you ripped the fucker out with the balloon still inflated? Holy shit. 
I thought that said Shock-Cock...I think that would wake up men fairly well 
/r/writingprompts! It would be great!
well it's known that humans and other mammals are able to create DMT, it's very similar to serotonin after all. the problem is that is breaks down quickly and testing it would be done very soon after the person died.
Welcome, I find it extremely interesting. Yes DMT is simply extracted from a number of plants around the world that have a high percentage of the substance. DMT is physically quite safe the only physical effects are dilated pupils, slightly higher heart rate and blood pressure. It's not really possible to overdose when vaping DMT.DMT is also known to help with a number of mental illnesses.
I think you'd be surprised by DMT, as SWIM says it's like you're still completely your self just in another dimension I wouldn't say sleep paralysis would effect it because your not asleep. As long as you go into the trip relaxed as possible, treat the drug like it's not a toy, willing to go anywhere, expectation-less and excited you should be fine.SWIM says after you do it once you'll be a lot more comfortable.
Would that be because of possible grudges and conflicts between you and the girl?
Yeah, that part really sucks. They told me I shouldn't even send anonymous Get Well Soon flowers to the hospital. I mean, it's just common decency, not a signed legal statement.
I wasn't 'in the right frame of mind' :-/ actually, I was desperate for a poo too & I think I thought it would help??Plus I'm a girl. Does it make a difference??!
Now we're getting into a new line of products.
Damn, they beat me to it; name and everything.
Oh cool, does that mean that DMT would be very difficult, if not impossible to pick up in a drug test?
I dunno if it's right for me, considering I have major anxiety though. Maybe after I'm 30 and (hopefully) in a house with my bf. I've logged your advice mentally though so when I am ready to do it, that's what I'll be.
I'm sure that it's a mix of that as well as the fact that insurance doesn't actually want to pay more than they have to. The less the girl knew about my condition the less likely that she would be persuaded to take full blame.Likewise, I wasn't supposed to be in contact with her because It would seem like I was pressuring / harassing her, I suppose.Although, I was the passenger so no matter what I got no blame regardless.
I think the fact that you're a girl became definitively obvious, was when you said the word "poo". The earlier hint was "pee".  I get it, when in labor, some women poo during the pushing. I made my husband swear not to look, but if he accidentally did, under no circumstances would he tell me if I did, either way. 
Do some men actually like that? It sounds fairly unpleasant 
Most psychedelic drugs are impossible to be picked up on drug tests (excluding marijuana of course - which is a psychedelic drug fyi). Shrooms and LSD are unable to be picked up on drug tests. I'm pretty sure DMT is the same. 
Good on you.  :)  The time I tried to learn how to say "Congratulations" in Hindi to talk to a friend's boyfriend, I apparently both butchered the pronunciation and misjudged -- while he's Indian, Hindi isn't his native tongue.
Sometimes the little things can mean the most. good on you dude :)
I used to work with a few Kazakh guys. One of them taught me how to say "luck" or "good luck". It was something he always said when he was trying out a new simulation. He'd cross his fingers, say the words, and click the button. The phrase was Ah'lem malayam or something like that. I picked it up and still say it to this day.A few months ago we were catching up and I mentioned this to him. Turns out he got it off an Iranian magician who had a tv show. I've been saying Iranian alakazam for luck for years. Damn tricksy Kazakhs.
Aww, this is so sweet!When I was younger, we agreed to host a Japanese student for a couple weeks. When she stepped out of the cabin from the camp we picked her up from, I could tell she didn't speak much English. However, I had gone to a Japanese immersion school and I totally caught her and her teacher off guard when I (a pasty, tall white girl) started speaking in accurate Japanese. She was so excited and we spent the whole time talking in Japanese, and me translating for my parents.
You're such a thoughtful person! Perhaps you can encourage your friend to learn some basic Kazakh so as to be a better boyfriend? 
Reminds me of one of my stories!I used to work in a fast food drive thru (Oh so many stories) and on the rare occasion I got a foreign customer, I'd find out where they are from and learn a greeting in their language for the next time they came back. It was genuinely fun.
I always feel too awkward to try and speak to someone in their native language. I don't know why. My dad can speak a few languages pretty well and has no problem throwing out jokes and stuff. Wish I would have inherited that. 
This reminds me a kid in my discrete math class. He thought it would be cool to learn to say 'hello how are you' in Russian and greet the professor when he got to class. But the professor wasn't Russian. He and his family fled Poland from the Soviets back in the 80's because he was part of the solidarity movement.Needless to say it didn't go over well for the kid. 
Aw, that's nice. I expected you to say or do something offensive but I didn't realise what sub I was in. 
I thought this was going in a different direction. Good for you!
When people found out I was Croatian they googled for quite a few laborious minutes to learn how to say hello and we're quite disappointed to find out it's just "hi"
One time I did this with a Russian exchange student. But he didnt like it at all. :( glad your friend liked it though!!
You failed to mention that Yakshemash is how you say it in kazakh. As in Yakshemash my name is  Borat lol
I had an awkward conversation once where I tried to practice my Mandarin Chinese on this girl from Hong Kong. In my defence she told me she was Chinese, so it wasn't a terrible assumption to make. :)
haha, well, there are a lot of dialects in India!
I always thought that Hindi was the go-to language in India - I think it was referred to as the 'Business Language' so almost a common second tongue.  I could be mistaken though 
Serious question, is the phrase "good on you" or "good for you?" I guess I could have googled that question instead, oh well. 
It's ok. There are literally hundreds of languages spoken in india. But hindi is the national language so almost everyone speaks it. 
Meeting people of different cultures and backgrounds makes you a lot more empathetic 
I like languages, so didn't really think much of it at the time. I guess when you grow up speaking English, you don't really think of other people learning your language as anything other than normal.It definitely feels nice to make someone's day though.
Was it "Ahalay Mahalay"?
Standing at a subway station in toronto I had an asian girl come up to me and just say "Downsview?" to me. I figured she was mainland Chinese and was either unable or far too shy to speak much English.   Handily I spend a lot of time in China for work and have managed to pick up a good deal of basic mandarin. Her eyes lit up when I started explaining to her in shitty mandarin how to get to Downsview station. A mixture of surprise, happiness and total confusion (I'm a big white guy). Glad I could help her out!
Where did you grow up that has Japanese immersion schools? That sounds awesome.
Haha, he got fake mad at me when she told him, like 'what have you done?? You're making me look bad'. He messaged me afterwards asking me where I learned though, so I think he has realised how much it would mean to her :).
Man Kazakh is almost impossible to learn 
I heard a relevant joke once:>What do you call someone who k ows three languages? >Trilingual>What do you call someone who knows two languages?>Bilingual >What do you call someone who knows only one language?>EnglishI never really got it until I did the German exchange. Us English really are ignorant of other languages. Oh  and I probably butchered the wording somewhere.. :/
Yeah we're awful with languages, I wish something was taught as a universal second language in this country. Still can't believe that I was the only one of my friends to bother learning any Czech when we went ti Prague a few years ago
i too did this once. but the person who claimed it made me feel like they were lying. i didnt see the phone fall out of their possession, so i can never really be sure if that phone really belonged to them. plus, they were an asshole about it, like i tried to steal their phone or something.
This is awesome, good job for making random peoples day :D
What? How could that ever be racist or ignorant? In school one of the best ways to have a conversation with the international students (or even second gen immigrants) is to talk about their language, their culture, their home because surprise! It's part of who they are. I wouldn't have thought that Lithuania is particularly interesting or relevant, but because I was able to talk to a Lithuanian about their language and country I found out that their language is the oldest surviving language in Europe, and they have a god damn interesting history. 
I have friends who are either obviously foreign-born (accent) or born here but obviously 'non-native' (skin-colour). I get how asking someone "where they're from" could be offensive, but wondering about someones heritage is just curiosity, as long as you don't start assuming things because of their background. 
I'm told that white people learning PoC languages is a form of cultural appropriation, as well. It's almost like it's just an effort to feel superior to others.
Because Russian is far less obscure than Kazakh. Most people probably know a word or two, so it's more of a hassle. Not that your gesture isn't welcome or anything.
For those who aren't aware, in Hong Kong they speak Cantonese, not Mandarin
Reminds me of the guy who kept digging himself deeper pretending he was Korean. 
While in Japan, I once found the one Japanese guy in Tokyo that didn't speak Japanese. It was an awkward train ride after that.
i just subscribed to your newsletter, tell me more
Despite both sides not liking the idea, linguists consider Hindi and Urdu the same language, called Hindustani, that has two different literary forms (Urdu and Hindi). 
Listening to Tamil and Malayalam is like listening to Morse code. They speak so quickly and it bears no resemblance to any European language. If I'm listening to Russian or Malay or Japanese I can recognise at least that words are being said. Tamil just sounds like an unbroken string of babble. This is not an insult, just a reflection of how different it is. 
Not just dialects. We have hundreds of full blown languages, and many regional dialects stemming from each of those languages.
Most of India does learn at least some Hindi in school. The only place in India where you can safely expect nobody to know any Hindi is the state of Tamil Nadu, where Hindi is viewed as a linguistic threat to the native language of Tamil.
Hindi and English are the two "universal" languages in India. Anyone trying to get a decently good job is expected to know both.Everything else is regional, even if it is considered an "official" language.
Hindi is not our national language. Although the largest fraction speaks Hindi, it still doesn't make for a clear majority of people (a clear majority requires more than 50% of the population to speak Hindi).Hindi is one of our ~20 official languages.
I'm reminded of the Mark Twain quote; "Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime.". 
It might have been, there's definitely an m sound in the middle and I'm not sure about the ending of the second word. There's only so many times you can ask a person to repeat something haha.
You got lucky haha, I'm surprised you could tell the difference between mainland and Hong Kong / Taiwan 
Haha, it was pretty cool! I grew up in Oregon. West Coast, Best Coast!
Call all the women he's with "Em". Just to be safe.
How could he learn Kazakh, I wonder... :P
FYI he might actually be legit angry that in seconds you may have made a deeper or at least more involved emotional relationship with her than he did.Good on you for being considerate to her, but don't forget about possible side effects!
It is really difficult to learn Kazakh. I'm from there originally but never lived there, and I can't find any place to learn it. Since my family is from Almaty, I've been learning Russian instead, but it kind of sucks not to have that connection... 
It's so unfortunate that you get people like that. It almost makes you inclined to just pocket the phone and say you know nothing of it if you knew they'd do that. Did others buy your story over theirs?
I would also usually talk in a radio voice. Making people laugh and question whether or not it was a recording was solid gold. It's one of the very few things I miss about it.
>I wouldn't have thought that Lithuania is particularly interesting or relevant, but because I was able to talk to a Lithuanian about their language and country I found out that their language is the oldest surviving language in Europe, and they have a god damn interesting history.Lithuainia was also (a usually forgotten) half of the greatest power in Eastern Europe for a long while.POLISH-LUTHANIAN COMMONWEALTH STRONK
Not me.  It's either funny (I was born in the same hospital as you) or interesting.  There are far too many sticks up arses nowadays.  Even the Puritans would be confused.
No it isn't. "How are you?" in Kazakh sounds like "Kal kalai?". "K" sounds roughtly, like cough
My mistake, yeah. Cantonese and Mandarin are as different as English and Russian. 
I've known people from HK who could speak at least a bit of Mandarin. 
Link for that? That reminds me of a TIFU where a guy adopted his son who was Asian and believed he was Chinese and raised him with that kind of cultural influence only to find out his son was Korean
What does he speak then?
I was unaware that I had a newsletter.  That sounds like a pretty cool thing for me to have.
My dad speaks Malayalam and my mom says it sounds like rocks in a blender. It is an even tumbling sound, because they actually put even stess on all syllables! I'm not sure if this is specific to Malayalam, but speakers also combine the last sound of a word with the first sound of another that has the same letter. It sounds weird when they do it in English.
Languages from different families as well. Indo-Aryan, Sino-Tibetan, Dravidian and Austro-Asiatic.
No one is expected to know Hindi in India for business. It's English that's important.
Ha bhai Maaf kardo
In this day and age, this can even be sorry if possible through they internet and documentaries, and plenty of media. As long as you don't vegetate in your own little corner of media all the time. Which, unfortunately, a lot of people do.
There was famous soviet magician Amayak Akopyan who had catchphrase "sim-salabim ahalay mahalay". Last part of the phrase can be used to describe some magic action, like word "abracadabra". So I thought this could be the phrase that your colleague used.
I find theres quite a difference actually. The way people look and dress (especially younger people) is way different in taiwan and HK to the mainland imo. Also Taiwanese speak mandarin, so that wouldn't have mattered.   And a  young Hong Konger would almost certainly speak some English.  Call it an educated guess haha.
That's awesome! I'm up in Vancouver BC (west coast = best coast indeed) and now I'll have to see if we have anything like that here!
I disagree. OP did the right thing making this girl feel welcome outside her home country. In a couple seconds he made her feel at home in a way that no one else had done since she had left. Her boyfriend may not have had the idea but at least he's stepping up to the plate in a way that will bring them closer together. If the boyfriend is/was mad then that's on him. OP did the right thing.
i love when people make boring things fun. you are a cool person.
The phrase I used sounded a little like 'kalinz kalai', which apparently is the more formal version
Only spoken, written they are mostly (exactly?) the same. 
Oh gosh, that. Definitely a reason to do a little more reading before assuming one thing or another. I mean "Kim", hardly a Chinese surname.
Maybe it's different now, but from what I've heard from family and friends, Hindi is a necessary part of getting a good job in India.
Chalo maaf kiya. :)
I didn't wanna get into a whole long essay, but yeah, I don't think it has to be *literal* travel, with the options available these days. 
Yes, Hongkies will mostly likely already know some English.Source: a fellow Hongki.
It was a gas, man. One of my favorite lines was "Wwwwwwelcome to the best [insert fast food restaurant] in [insert town]!" The kicker was that this was the only one of this chain in town, so some people would be like "Hey, wait! This is the only X in town!"
Hong Kong uses traditional characters while mainland China uses simplified, but yeah. The characters represent concepts rather than sounds. Japan also uses a bunch of the characters in combination with their own alphabets.In fact, if you put a Mandarin speaker, a Cantonese speaker and a Japanese speaker into a room, even if none of them speak any of the other languages they can communicate through writing characters for each other. It's a fascinating system.
IIRC the surname was Park
Dhanyaavaad. India may he rehte hai ya bahar?
Is that really what people from hong kong are called in English? 
See! you are a cool guy! what do you do now, if you dont mind?
The Japanese person would have difficulties though, as grammar isn't as similar and they wouldn't be able to use their Japanese characters, which are about half of what is typically written (in terms of information, not by character. By character it's more than half. Kanji is more information dense than hiragana or katakana.)
Learning to read and speak mandarin is essentially learning 2 languages
Written language being disconnected from spoken language boggles my mind. 
The characters used in Cantonese are different in many cases than those used in Mandarin. In fact, some characters are used for sound as opposed to any represented concept.Another interesting fact is that the simplified character set is not the same for Japanese and Mandarin (meaning they don't simplify all the same characters).Traditional characters using the Mandarin words would be the best bet for shared understanding. Source: studied all three languages
No, I made it up myself. I think Hong Kongers is the preferred term. I think Hongkies sounds catchy though, even though it somewhat coincide with a Texan slang or something.
I work for Delta now, doing plane stuff. How about yourself?
Oh yeah it wouldn't be fluent by any stretch of the imagination; they could get their point across though.
Even for native people it's hard. I'm ethically Chinese, but I live in Singapore. I can speak Chinese just fine but my writing... It wouldn't be exaggerating to say a 12 year old kid could write better. I really only know the basic words and then some. 
Those phonetic characters are  also used in Mandarin, and are also used to convey the tone of the sentence. The difference in written Cantonese and Mandarin are the specific phrases used to describe an object or concept. I don't have any immediate examples to give but an object like toilet can have different combinations for both, but would still be legible for both languages, although they would sound strange to the other side because they don't usually call the thing that way.   Note: I probably butchered the English language by typing that, English is not my first language.
ooooo plane stuff! I'm an engineering student. I just wrote my last final for the semester. Exciting side news: I'm starting my first junior engineering job on Monday!
You seem like a fairly shrewd person and in addition also interested in learning other cultures. How did you think referencing Borat is funny or relevant in any other way still?
Please if you gave me the PSLE Chinese paper right now I'd probably fail. Oral and listening though, I think I'd do pretty OK.
Metaphors, poetry, puns, etc must be a barrel of monkeys. 
Engineering job?! Fat wallet swingin' :DGood job getting through that, man, it must've been tough. What do you engineer?

I'd like to see Jon Stewart give it a shot. 
Barack Obama
*whispers* Bernie
How about someone actually running and on the ballot in all 50 States? I'm voting for Gary Johnson. I certainly don't agree with all of his ideas (or those of his running mate), but way better than Hillary or Donald.
I am a Bernie supporter, but Trump and Clinton are not at all equally unqualified for the job. Clinton has been a Senator, Secretary of State, and has spent time working as an attorney for years. Trump has no government experience whatsoever. His money was inherited and he has made epic blunders with that money over the years. While I don't love Clinton, she is vastly more qualified to be President than Trump. 
Gucci Mane.*brrrrr*
If you vote for president and don't want either of the two canadates, think about Gary Johnson, or better yet the man who will re-unify this great country:Indigo3256....I have an associates degree from a small heartland community college, and I may not be "qualified" or a "politician" but I treat everybody as my equal, mean what I say, and have never backed out of a promise/deal with someone. I'm only 27, but I mean we had a Canadian run for president, right? On second thought, just stick with Johnson, I spend waaaaay too much time on video games to deal with foreign policy.
Of that 324M number, are those all even eligible for presidential candidacy (meaning they are US born citizens at or over the age of 35)?
Ellen Pao. I kinda just wanna see how reddit reacts tbh.
The silly thing is that people still view the presidency as a single person, when it is in fact the sum total of all of the people that get included in a presidential administration, from advisors and staff to cabinet members and congressmen who increase their status with newly acquired access. This also ignores the monied interests that bankrolled the candidates campaign.It is not one person. It is one person with ~~scores~~ *millions of people working/pushing for/at them.
Besides bullshit conspiracy theories and ideologically motivated slander, Clinton is actually an excellent candidate with a pretty clear platform - uninspiring but competent leadership, and not a lot of change. No new deals, but no pointless quagmires either. If you stop getting your politics from reddit, you will realize that Clinton is actually *not* a monster. The same cannot be said for Trump. 
Hiding, if they know what's good for them. 
Shit. This is beautiful, and really thought-provoking. R.I.P. Mr. Sagan
A few of them were also pretty genuinely terrible people and had some wildly archaic beliefs by today's standards. I think it's important not to put men on a pedestal simply because they were around at the beginning. Granted, they got the job done. 
Calm down, Gandhi. 
Which civ?   I've been thinking of playing but I don't know which one to play.  
Also because they can convice voters to vote for them. Regardless of your ideas, you also need to be able to communicate them in such way that the people want you. You need to be good at the political game, which is not just about different opinions but also about making alliances and enemies at the right times with the right people. I think many geniuses have trouble communicating to the "normal" people, so they could never become president. The charisma just isn't there. Let alone that they could dive into the political game.
Citizens of America, gingivitis has been eroding the gums of our nation for too long.
What do you mean, "I couldn't be the president of the United States of America"?Tell me something, it's still "We the people", right?

We're already getting Claire Underwood with Hillary tho
Is honest and honorable the best thing we should look for in a leader, though? That one character from Game of Thrones got his head chopped off, after all (I don't know how to put things in a spoilers link).
I also nominate Me.
And almost literally one candidate from every race ever. In the recent decades it's just been the shiniest of two turds.
My prediction is that George W. was better than Hillary would be.  
He would probably just ask you to vote for Hillary. 
Problem with the modern electorate in once sentence.
I'd genuinely love to see some poll numbers on him.  I suspect he'd end up doing *very* well against both of them.
I'd give Obama a third term over current two options.

Well he shouldve worked harder for the minority vote instead of saying "i marched with MLK once, you owe me " 
The problem in this election is that the two mainstream candidates are not equally bad.  I dislike Hillary and do not want her to be president, but I think Trump would be an indescribable disaster.  Hildog will have to have a *very* secure lead in the polls before I'll even consider voting 3^(rd) party.Also, dunno any specifics about Gary Johnson, but the Libertarian party has its own streak of batshit crazy positions that turn many people off.
Choo choo! Here comes the Johnson!
What about Seth Rollins? 
Oh man, I can absolutely see America rallying behind President Rollins. Intelligent. Strong. Captivating. He'd make a great leader of some kind or other. Qualified? No, of course not. But I can just see myself going along with it anyway.
Seriously.  Hillary absolutely has the resume for the job, if not the charisma.
Right, because these days it's almost certain that a person would be ousted for thinking and acting differently outside the common and accepted norm; especially if they're ideals challenge the status quo; which revolutionary and advanced thinkers always do.
Well of course. But giving people free speech and free press and the right to practice any religion they wanted and attempting to keep religion out of government was ridiculously progressive for 1776.  
Nahhh, I'm more of a Cyrus the Great kind of guy.
Definitely Civ 5, or wait for Civ 6 this October.
> * Saint Douglas AdamsFTFY.
> be able to communicate them in such way that the people want you"I know the human being and fish can coexist peacefully" - President George W Bush
And you also need a billion dollars. 
Exactly. That's the distinction between Trump and any old angry racist bigot. He's a proven artist of deception, and he has about 7 billion more dollars.
Isn't that first thing an ok thing to do in certain states? Either that, or my sister was  feeding me bs to make sure I didn't try to stop her.Also, there are a lot of bad things to be said about both Israel and the U.S.
"Do you still stand by your policy to grant one free pony to every American?""YES I DO, SIR."

Tbh that would probably be better as a screenplay
> Your American Citizenship is currently updating. Please do not turn off the power...
Very true. Also kind of hard to influence him with more money.But don't forget modern Bill Gates is a lot more likeable than what he used to be. There is a history of shady business tactics, monopolies, questionable intellectual property use, etc.
I'm sorry, but belly-petting is reserved for the official 500 dollar a plate fundraising dinners. How many tickets would you like to buy?
I think Me has all the appropriate qualifications. Me's foreign policy is unmatched. 
I feel like these candidates are so terrible, it forces you to vote *against* the other candidates, no matter what your personal beliefs. Not for some important issue, not for some goal or promised progress. It's bullshit.
I don't know...He's not perfect, but I really like most of what Obama has done. I would definitely put him in the "good at the job" category. 
You....I wanna like you.
Obama will go down as one of the best of the modern presidents. We will remember the  intransigent and frankly racist opposition by the party of no. I think it's fair to say in 2008 and 2012 Obama was a giant of a candidate striding over a field of petty bickering ants.I know it's popular to hate on Obama, and as a progressive I wish he was the great progressive hope we wanted, but strangely even extrajudicial drone murder doesn't knock him out of the best President in recent memory position.
I dunno man/woman - I doubt Hillary will invade a sovereign nation and occupy it for the rest of her presidency on not the best intelligence.I'm sure I'll get a million replies about her vote for the Iraq war; I think that's made her incredibly weary to intelligence.  God I fucking hope so!
With Trump running, he doesnt have to ask.
I think somewhere there's an article saying a decent amount of Americans would consider it right now. 
I would, too. I'm not sure Michelle would be interested in four more years, though...
Good news! Obama *is* running for a third term, and she's currently ahead.
_howls loudly at the top of my lungs from forlorn moonlit cliffs at night_ Berrrrrnieeeeee!\*sobs\*
Wait, seriously? Johnson is pro gay marriage, pro choice, & pro environment??  May need to look into this guy.
He's pro private prisons. 
\#FeelTheJohnson
At least for the first two years, sure.Unfortunately, his third State of the Union will be when he defects to Russia and launches the nukes on America.Then Super Reigns becomes our leader, so I guess we still win in the end?
Sounds like a Trump voter 
My issue with her is she is a criminal and probably going to get away with it because of her last name and money.
Ahh forgot about that. He'd be too busy to focus on populating Mars anyway so it's probably for the best. 
Welcome to democracy. 
I love playing Montezuma, since I get to warmonger AND build culture! 
A lot of science fiction does tend to rely on dystopian futures of bureaucracy and corruption and whatnot, so I guess it comes from that?Even though Adams' stuff is really light-hearted (shoe shops!) I can see it in there :p
From all the stories hear, I'll never live in an HOA neighborhood
> he has about 7 billion more dollars.Going to need an actual source for that.I know he plays a billionaire on tv. Dont know that he is one.
> Either that, or my sister was feeding me bs to make sure I didn't try to stop her.wat
"Do you have any other major policies?""Just that one. I think that's enough."
I'll be the first in line
> Very true. Also kind of hard to influence him with more money.> One could make that same argument about Trump.  One shouldn't, however.  I had an argument with a friend a decade ago that I never forgot.  I had mentioned that an IQ test should be a requirement to serve public office.  He pointed out that this is extremely flawed reasoning; there are plenty of highly intelligent people in office who act maliciously.  Instead we should test their EQ, or empathy quotient.  We should test their ability to assess the needs of their fellow citizens and care for them.
What about You. I heard he's got great charisma and ideas
Me also speaks lots of different languages fluently, so it's easy for them to communicate with other countries. 
This is why I think Trump and Clinton have a sort of co-dependence. The only chance they have at winning is if they're running against the other person.
Thats the point of the two party system.
Regardless of whether you like or dislike him he's certainly the most impactful president in recent memory, all while dealing with the most batshit retarded Congress in history.
I would say decent but that's my opinion. Only problem I have had is with the Obamacare. Good idea just poor execution
Don't talk about change, just do it!
It is an unending source of bafflement to me that, after arguably the most capable president the US has ever had died during his 4th term in office, our nation collectively went "nah, we don't want anyone that capable in office that long again, we'd rather just be screwed". Like, what in the living fuck, guys?!
If you think Hillary is going to give a third Obama term you're gonna have a bad time. 
He supports abolishing all and any federal agencies that he is allowed to. EPA, NIH, Department of Education, etc. Abolish them all. That alone is enough to tell you he's a completely impractical candidate who has vested to much faith in the "free market."
Libertarians are just fancy-sounding conservatives.
Instructions unclear: In voting booth playing with self.
Nah we just lock him in the Ambrose Asylum if he goes rogue.
Trump is also a serious swindler. He has a history of ripping people off and making poor investment decisions. 
And I'm starting my computer and a new game of civ
We're living that in the present.  It's a trick of theirs that we don't realize it.  Median income for an American family of four (household) is $50K.
That's not how I see it. Power isn't a corrupting force, power allows you to act on your corruption.
Same. But if that's the case, be prepared to settle for an older house. In a lot of areas, all the new houses are in HOA neighborhoods.
You're right. His actual net worth is definitely up for debate, but the point I'm trying to make is that he's definitely not poor, you know?
But it better work this time :(
Conspiracy theory time!  Trump is a ringer to give Hilary the presidency.  He takes out all of the Republican competition, then makes the rest of the country hate him so they vote Clunton.  There's no other way in hell that would make me vote for her, but come November, I probably will.
Which candidate running in the primary was supposed to win?Did Chafee, Webb, and O'Malley really look better than Hillary?Were we rooting for Jeb! Bush or Ted Cruz or Lil' Marco over Donald Trump?The bottom line is that anyone who won would have been subjected to the same "They both suck!" rhetoric.  Even Obama took this shit from various "Not pure enough" die-hards back in '08 when he was supposed to be the fucking Messiah.
If only someone warned us about this sort of thing...
He's very nuanced, professional and good at what he does. He understands the world and his impact. I'm Belgian and I'm gonna miss him man
That's the biggest issue though. A motivated population is one of the scariest things that a government can imagine. But a motivated population is virtually impossible to have.
You might dislike her as a person, but aren't they both pretty much what you expect from people representing the Democratic party, as far as policy goes?
Libertarianism is astrology for men.
I'm fairly libertarian and liberal/progressive. A lot of people are. Head on over to the political compass. We're the bottom left quadrant. 
Not at all, i have way too many differences with conservatives to be closely  ideologically related 
Your argument is that if other politicians break the law and get away with it it's an okay thing for Hillary to do too? That's elementary school logic dude.Who said any of us agree with what the other politicians did?
See you in 14 hours.
I mean sure, now's pretty awful for a lot of people..but we haven't evolved into birds that are scared of the ground after the entire world turns into shoeshops, so we have that going for us.
Yeah but then there will be almost nobody left.     ...     Ok, let's do it.
You say that like it's a bad thing. Older houses kick ass assuming they were nice houses to begin with.
PEACE SELLS!
What if Clinton is a ringer to give Trump the presidency? She gets the Dem nomination, lies every time she speaks, and pretends she isn't a corrupt piece of shit so people vote for Trump. 
Yeah, like, if only our very first president warned us about something like this in his farewell speech...
That was actually a semi-obscure youtube reference, but yes, I agree :P
But now you just end up having political dynasties :/
Not at all.  If you look at things she was say at the beginning and prior to her campaign versus what she's saying now,  she's pulled a complete 180 on many big issues.  She's pandering for votes,  which to me means once she gets into office she's going to flip again. Changing your mind on issues based on new information is one thing.   Flipping on most major issues after you start slipping in the polls is another. 
Damn that's funny, did you come up with that? 
Big Show for Sec Def
My argument is that it is and always was a non-issue, it's being blown up purely to harm her chances at getting elected.  Do you honestly think anybody actually gives a shit about email servers?  Of course not, which is why every other SecState did whatever the fuck they wanted with them.It was never a 'crime' until republicans decided to call it one.
14? Do you play on Quick speed? ScrublordGit Gud then come back.
Which is nice.
I'm from the UK and a basically just want to bring this back to use on George Osborne. :)
Thanks, that was an enjoyable read. Ever tried your hand in /r/WritingPrompts?
But who's buying?
>she's pulled a complete 180 on many big issues.Which ones? Her policy ideas have been pretty progressive, and include things that many other candidates never talk about (child care, for one).
National security is a non-issue? But okay, I'll humor you. Let's for a minute pretend that the only reason the emails are being blown up like this, is because of the GOP and the upcoming election.Does this suddenly invalidate the fact that she did something wrong? No. Of course not. I don't care if every Secretary of State,  Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Defense, and Attorney General did it too. It doesn't make it acceptable if it poses a legitimate security risk.The fact that she's deleting records and hiding shit about them is just the cherry on top.
That's exactly why Ostracism wasn't very successful late into democratic Athens' lifetime. People ostracised people whose policies they didn't like rather than, the intended targets, threats to the democracy.
Minor objection: Australia does not use FPTP exclusively, and both Canada and the UK don't so much have multi-party systems as we have "dynamic" two-party systems (there's always two relevant parties, but *which* two changes from time to time)
I'm not going to lie, I pretty much would just use it out of spite or because I thought it would be funny. 
The fact that it was white and cold didn't strike you as odd? 
Lol, best thing I've read today. As a black coffee drinker.
Have you heard about the freshman 15? Because this is how it happens.
God help you, have my upvote.  I laughed out loud, and then read this to my boyfriend. 
if you ever want to get into coffee just get really liberal with milk and sugar (more so the former), then work your way down. it really is an acquired taste
Try a caramel frappucino. Served at Starbucks, McDonald's and a lot of independent stands. It's basically a coffee milkshake and you can hide double and triple espresso shots in it easily without the bad taste
Like the other people on this thread, I would not recommend cafeteria coffee as a starting place to get into coffee. Drinks like lattes or cappuccinos are fantastic, and most universities or colleges will have some hip hole-in-the-wall cafe near campus where you can buy really good quality beans. With coffee, you kind of have to start with the good stuff, then build up a dependence so that eventually even the shitty stuff seems fantastic
Blacker than a moonless night, hotter and more bitter than hell itself. That is coffee.  ~Prosecutor GodotThought I'd share this, since were on the topic of coffee.
Have you tried tea instead? I've always liked tea a lot more than coffee because there are a lot of flavors. I usually just drink plain black tea, but there are a lot of variations. 
try light roast coffees!  they taste much less like burning and even have more caffeine. 
Here's what you do buy a french press and just ease your way into black coffee by starting with a few grinds and as your tolerance builds add more grinds. One day you'll become jaded like me and be able to just much on mushy grinds.
Don't start drinking coffee.
Why do you want to even get into coffee? I took my first ever sip of coffee this year at the age of 21 which only assured me of my decision to never drink any more coffee.My point is, when you can already function independent of coffee, why make yourself dependent on a substance that is not good for you?
Nearly dropped my phone after reading this, hah! You poor soul.  Have you given up looking for coffee that you can drink or does the search continue?
I wanna drink coffee so bad but it's literally the worst thing I've ever tasted. The amount of milk and sugar I have to add to make it even bearable turns it into a sugar slosh with some coffee mixed in. Am I missing something? Is coffee supposed to taste horrible or am I just crazy?
Wonderful story.If you are just starting to get into coffee, I recommend a light roast.  They are generally less bitter as well as a bit smoother overall.  I also recommend starting with black.  Creamer and sugar are always there to improve a crappy roast.
>just started collegeGive it time, before you know it, its not gonna matter how it tastes.  You're just gonna need it.
This is bestof material right here. Oh bless your heart OP. 
This gave me a big laugh. Thank you, OP. Although I hope you're okay after having THAT MUCH creamer. I've never been much of a coffee person. I can't drink it anyway because of Crohn's. I like Starbuck's fraps though. Do you go to Starbucks? What do you usually get? Otherwise, what do you like to drink?
Creamer is 18% milk fat and white. I doubt you were drinking creamer, and confused it with a hot, black liquid. Also French Vanilla is just basically sugar plus water. It is really good but usually more expensive than a standard cup of coffee.
Oh my God, I too have bbeen drinking creamer.
Just don't get too into coffee.. because no matter how great your coffee is, there will be some guy with a smug look going "Peehhhhh" and drinking his supreme "these coffee beans are 3000 years old" blend (read next sentences for irony).My personal favorite is to grind French Vanilla and Hazel beans together, 2 spoons of sugar and just a tiny bit of milk. Tastes better than that liquid diarhea mud water we have here in Tim Hortons. 
Wait real question will you stop drinking it?
Sorry but this is funny
Maybe try a lighter brew? or a flavored one. It is an acquired taste, but many have a natural preference for different types. Most of my friends hate coffee until I make it for them.
How did you not notice that change in caloric intake?Also relevant username. Hook 'em. 
lolThat's really funny, thanks.It sounds like weird advice I know, but have you tried darker roasts? I find they tend to be more smooth than medium roast, which is what most coffee in gas stations is.
OP, you crack me up. I hope that you figure out what the mystery machine in the cafeteria serves. 
On the bright side, you were getting a hell of a sugar rush from it. Seriously though, coffee kicks ass. Mix half a cup of coffee with a quarter cup of milk and a quarter cup of some kind of creamer, and just sip on it. You'll be incredibly efficient all day.
Do things like grapefruit (juice or fresh), brussels sprouts, cooked cabbage, green tea, most alcohol and licorice also taste really bad to you?  Do mushrooms taste extremely earthy?  You might be a supertaster.  Yes, it's a thing - Google it.  
do you have any idea how many calories are in that creamer. You've literally been drinking cream. Also you should x-post this to /r/coffee 
so...how many calories were you drinking?
It came out steaming hot and it was a light brown (I think it's actually a caramel/vanilla flavor), so it didn't occur to me it might not be coffee.
It came out steaming hot and it was a light brown (I think it's actually a caramel/vanilla flavor), so it didn't occur to me it might not be coffee.
Best thing I've read today too. As a white, coffee drinker.
Black coffee is best coffee. Tastier and essentially no calories. ;)
Dont really see why you had to say your race... Some people...
> As a black coffee drinkerI hope to get to that point someday. It's been a slow process.
> God help you, have my upvote. I laughed out loud, :D> and then read this to my boyfriend.:(
Huh, I started with black tea (no additions), transitioned to shitty coffee drunk black, now consume great freshly burr ground coffee with a little milk to cool it down in the morning, a 200mg pill at noon, another cup drunk black after getting home, a latte in the late evening, and a 3 bag kettle of green tea at night. Fuck.
Exactly what I do. Five to six spoonfuls or just plain condensed milk in there and you'll find it quite sweet.
Or if you're like me and never liked caramel, the mocha frappuccino is the same thing but with chocolate instead. It's pretty much a frozen chocolate drink with whipped cream and with a coffee undertone.
You just gave /r/coffee a collective heart attack 
Actually I had the opposite effect occur to me. I started with really shitty coffee they had in school or the cheaper brand to make at home. I didn't really like it but it was caffeine so wth. Then I started going to a cafe that roasted their beans in-house and it was glorious! Bought a french press and bought their beans. So much enjoyable being able to make it myself. Last time I tried to drink the coffee from school I had to add a lot of milk because it tasted like bitter water. I'm too dependant on good coffee now. I can't even enjoy the shitty /cheap gas station coffee now.
Agree - a latte with low fat milk is my go to breakfast habit.  Used to be able to skip it if I was running late, but not anymore
I started drinking meh dunken donuts coffee for a while, then moved to store bought ground coffee, which eventually led to going for the full fresh-roasted, whole bean single origin stuff. Drinking anything other than high quality coffee taste like shit unless I pile it with cream now. 
I think my ability to tell when things are bitter is screwed up. I 100% don't understand why people think dark chocolate is bitter.
This! I've been a daily coffee drinker since I was 12 (now 29) and for a long time, I drank dark roasts exclusively. A couple years ago, I heard that lighter roasts have more caffeine, so I decided to give them a try, and as it turns out, I actually prefer the taste. They aren't just for noobz.
Yea it'll turn you gay
I can't stand the taste of it and I have plenty enough energy without it. I'll never understand it.
> I took my first ever sip of coffee this year at the age of 21 which only assured me of my decision to never drink any more coffee.I had my first hamburger at 21, and from then on I knew ground beef wasn't for me.Seriously though, the popularity of coffee as a utilitarian means of providing caffeine means that you really have to look to find good coffee. Starbucks and Folgers don't do coffee justice any more than McDonalds and Burgerking should impact your standard for beef.
Well, I've left the church I grew up in and it's a "thing" for us apostates to drink the devil's liquid, so I thought I should at least try it. I really like hot chocolate and would like to able to replace it with something that has fewer calories. I just like the idea of grabbing a coffee with someone. It's a tradition lots of people do and I'd like to be a part of it.I don't want it to become an everyday thing though. I just want to get to the point where I don't hate it.
The search continues. I had a cafe au lait yesterday and it wasn't the most terrible thing ever. Next time I go, I think I'll get a latte.
You're not alone. I think it's just an acquired taste that comes easier for some than others.
Glad you enjoyed it.
I might do that next time I grab something. I've tried dark/full city roasts so far, but I don't think I've tried a light roast.
Don't know how I would notice since I don't have access to a scale. Are you talking about my username that's relevant?
I've tried medium/dark roasts, so I'm thinking next time I want to try something lighter.
I agree with the other user, if it was steaming hot and light brown I would highly doubt it was coffee creamer. Sounds to me like you were drinking a French vanilla cappuccino.
It might be cappuccino, actually.  It comes out of a machine that you press a button and hold your cup under?  And it's hot and frothy?
Good coffee is like good whiskey. Doesn't need any frills; it's perfect as is.
Black coffee can be both beautiful and terrible. I had black coffee from starbucks a few years ago, before they had started making their blonde roasts and stopped nuking their coffee so hard; dear God that stuff was terrible, it was so burned that it tasted like charcoal. It's one of the few cups of coffee I was completely unable to finish.I've also had black coffee that was beautiful, it tasted beautiful, it smelled beautiful, it was beautiful. Now I have that kind of coffee pretty much any time I want to make myself a cup, it's pretty  nice.
That's why i eat straight cacao. People who eat processed chocolate just don't get it.
Only reason I add Milk is because my coffee is too hot everytime.
>  no caloriesHow does that work? Just wondering 
**I LIKE MY COFFEE LIKE I LIKE MY WOMEN**
If you *ever* have the chance, Jamaican. Blue. Mountain.  Sooooo fucking good.  It's how I learned to drink straight black coffee.  I got *really* lucky and was able to drink super fresh fresh Jamaican Blue Mountain for about three weeks, and it was fucking amazing, and turned me into a black coffee lover.
"never like caramel"Erm...wut?  How is that like, even a thing?
Yeah, I quit dairy recently but lattes were totally my gateway drug
I don't find dark chocolate bitter. I just don't really like the taste really...
I understand that, my real point is why voluntarily get yourself addicted to caffeine when you have gone so long without it?I get that there are worse addictions out there and that we are all "addicted" to something in some form or another, but why add on another addiction voluntarily?Same reason why I don't drink or use other substances like marijuana. I can live a perfectly happy live without all of those things, like many other people can. Wanting to add another addiction cannot be a good thing, right?
If people invite me out for coffee, I just have a tea. No one ever questions it. I've had about two sips of coffee in my entire life and it was revolting. Even the super sugary flavoured ones. Why force yourself into a caffeine addiction just to fit in?
Could be. Doesn't taste anything like coffee though.
Yeah. It doesn't taste like coffee at all though. Upon further tasting, the subtle undertone I thought was the coffee is actually caramel. I've got a hell of a refined palate.
Best thing for me as well, as a yellow, tea drinker.
And they're both an acquired taste.
God now I want coffee and it's almost midnightI fucking love coffee so much that I travel to Colombia myself sometimes, go to th mountain area rip down as much as I want rip off the fruits, carry the beans back to me apartment in bogota then roast a little then a few months later I put the rest still in roasted in my bag back to the us and roast them myself as I need them.I love coffee
Any recommendations?  I'd like to get into drinking coffee but I don't really have any idea where to start. I just know I don't like Dunkin Donuts black coffee.
I'm not much of a partier and have no particular desire to start drinking yet, but I'll keep that in mind for a few years down the road.
Interestingly I hear lots of girls saying this (not that i know princesshashbrown's true gender) Apparently dudes can't refuse milk+sugar in any form though. 
You think that's bad? I like bubble tea... Without the bubbles :)
Just switch to soy or almond! Just as good. 
Have you tried the Ghirardelli 86%? It almost defeats the purpose of buying very dark chocolate so you don't eat too much at a time.
I didn't start drinking alcohol for the same reasons (though lately I've been looking at it from a different view). But coffee doesn't just have to be about caffeine, and I'm disappointed that it's at a state where a lot of people don't realize that.It's not about being a substance, it's about being an enjoyable luxury, like a fine meal or a nice painting. It's genuinely something I wish I could share with people, because drinking it just for caffeine has turned it into exactly what you described: Just a drug.
I'd just want to be sure I actually like it before I go around investing a lot of money in it. 
Yeah it's a fake mix out of those machines, like you'd get at the gas station.  Not real coffee, kinda like hot chocolate.
Yeah a lot of times they don't. But I highly doubt you've been drinking coffee creamer! I think that would make you sick. Very confident it's been cappuccino's. The French vanilla ones aren't necessarily made with coffee, especially the ones from the machines.
I just went to taste the creamer in my fridge. It was thick and nauseatingly sweet. The aftertaste was delicious though. I hope, for your pancreas, that it was cappucino
Those flavored cappuccinos don't really taste like coffee.  They're very very sweet.  It just seems very unlike that what you've been drinking is creamer, if it's coming out of a dispenser hot.
Worst thing for me, as just a drinker.
If you have a Stumptown coffee roasters near you, they're really good. /r/coffee can also assist you in picking a good coffeemaker 
Then start eating dark chocolate! :)
I'm a girl, and I don't like caramel. I do, however, love hash browns! :) I really don't understand why I don't like caramel because it *seems* good in theory, but I don't like the flavor and texture.
I love bubble tea with bubbles or coconut jelly!
I completely forgot about the social aspect. My own biased perception of caffeine after getting off of soda after 12 years has morphed my view of soda, coffee, and alcohol from being something that can be enjoyed casually to something that will inevitably lead to addiction.That is an ignorant view as many people have more self control in that aspect.
And most people mix it with coffee
I have had some digestive troubles, but it's hard to know if my "coffee" was the cause.
I did the same (had some leftovers in a thermos in my fridge) and now realize how it's way too thick/sweet. I was just deluded by the fact I had found coffee that didn't taste so nasty and bitter that I didn't see it for what it really was.
#allcoffeecolorsmatter 
Because if we kept the culinary tastes of a 7 year old we'd just eat unhealthy garbage our entire lives.  Actually, this explains a lot of issues our society has with obesity..
> never be such a thing as an 'acquired taste'  Eggplant, bittermelon, eggs, just straight hard liquor, IPA beer, oatmeal, pea soup, sushi, sardines. All that stuff I wasn't able to stand before until I just tried bits of it more and more. Hell, I didn't know deviled eggs were so good until I had to stomach through the smell (was allergic to eggs as a kid.)  I feel like you are putting "acquired taste" as something that is way over the top like here: > > **just to fit in socially**  Really? Acquiring taste vs. peer pressure. Completely different. 
Beer is definitely an acquired taste. There's this Stockholm Syndrome effect with guys who make you feel less of a man if you prefer another beverage until it's difficult to not drink it socially without comment (especially when you're a young guy growing up in England, it seems). Needless to say, the second I gave in, it's led to years of loving the stuff.
Petes Coffee bought Stumptown and Intelligentsia so I don't know how long the quality will last, I myself have never liked it. Some shops across the US will deliver online and to other states. A big chain that's actually really good is Blue Bottle coffee, it's great. I'd always prefer to look for smaller, local roasters, they tend to serve what the local likes.
 I like caramel but I don't like caramel flavored things, like Frappuccinos.
What does hash browns have anything to do with this?
I fucking love hash browns, I haven't had them in a few years. I'm going to buy some tomorrow and make them 
Oh no one of you. I loathe hash brown lovers because people that order like 6 hash browns in the McDonalds drive thru hold up the entire line by 3 minutes (we have to drop hash browns fresh) and kill are times every day. I hate all day breakfast. 
I tried it with jelly, still don't like it lol
It would be more likely to be real coffee if the digestive troubles are correlating with your ingestion of the mystery drink. Caffeine helps with GI motility (although if you're experiencing more of a constipating effect, it's more likely the dairy in the drink). Also with the headaches, those could very well be from caffeine or caffeine withdrawal.
Straight flavored creamer is sickly sweet and kept cold. Sounds like you had cappuccino.
I don't like the term acquired taste. I prefer to think of it as "learning how to appreciate" a thing. I never liked jazz music until I had a teacher dissect it for me and instruct me what to attune my ear to, for example.
Take eggplant. Say you try it for the first time and you don't like it. If, over the next few years, your SO every once in a while offers you a bite of his/her eggplant, you accept just for the hell of it, and eventually start liking it, that's natural and fine. But if, as some other redditors have said in their responses to me (particularly with cofffee), you purposely keep eating it and despising it just because you think that you may eventually come out the other side and like it, that's insane.
While Stumptown is now owned by Peet's, the people who make Stimptown what it is are going to remain in control, so quality shouldnt change. It would likt he article that I learned that, but I am at work and Sprudge is blocked, but Reddit isnt, lucky me.
Hm. I guess the value of it is being able to expand how many sensual experiences you're able to enjoy.It isn't a food, but one of my favourite music albums is one that, when I first heard it, I couldn't stand.  It's almost a kind of learning; through exposure we become able to appreciate things we otherwise couldn't, I guess?
It's like a movie that has a really slow, uninteresting beginning but then later on there's hot naked people. Don't you like to see hot naked people?
> It isn't though. It sucks for the entire experience...But that's the point. Once you've acquired the taste, it's enjoyable. Basically, you power through the unpleasantness, and then you have one more thing which you enjoy and gives you satisfaction, which is always a good thing.
Capsaicin induces serotonin and dopamine production.Liking spicy foods has nothing to do with masochism; eating them literally release the chemicals in your brain that make you feel good.
Sometimes food is boring enough that a little pain is better than nothing. 
What album?
I call it second-hand embarrassment, and I have it really bad. Makes it hard for me to watch undercover/secret camera/prank shows, or things like roasts. 
I get this too! Interestingly enough, I never experienced this with Arrested Development. Probably because they're all terrible people so I don't feel bad when they get embarrassed. 
I like Curb your Enthusiasm, but by god isn't it too much for me at times. Just really nailbiting, almost chewing my fingers.
YES! I FUCKING HATE CRINGE HUMOR! When I see somebody else do something horribly embarrassing I feel awful! Same thing goes with real painful situations. I hate watching stuff like jackass where people get hurt because it's almost physically painful to watch. 
The only episode of The Office that made me cringe for this reason is the Scott's Tot's episode. I can't even watch it again.
It's called "Fremdscham" where I live and yeah, it can be pretty bad. If you find The Office US hard to watch, wait till you see UK version with Ricky Gervais as David Brent (Office UK equivalent of Michael Scott), though. Definitely some of the cringiest stuff I've ever seen. I often had to look away and pause the video for a moment to not be completely overwhelmed with cringe.
Oh hell - this. Yes, I do. *Peep Show*, *The Office*, *Curb Your Enthusiasm*, *It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia*, even *Breaking Bad*... anything where I can see horrible consequences coming like a slow-motion car-crash makes me nope out.
Most accurate word I've found is the German word Fremdscham which translates to "stranger shame". Similar US terms I've heard used: douche chill and cringeworthy.
I have this issue, and it's probably the reason I couldn't watch the office as well.  Also: Meet the Fokkers, and Something about Mary.  Actually, it's kind of pronounced whenever Ben Stiller is playing his serious rube character.  I just can't handle it.  
I call this Ben Stiller humor because I feel like his whole brand is built upon it.  Everything of his that I've seen has made me cringe. 
I can't deal with the stress of going to see a play.I just sit there and stress out that someone might flub a line.. or god forbid, trip and fall down.. or a prop might not work.And.... if they have to do something like light a candle.. what if the lighter doesn't work? Then what? They have to 'pretend' it's lit.. but *we'll all know it's not.. and they know we know it's not lit.*  But they'll just have to keep going....Oh god.. I hate plays.
I have not watched it but some people say this about Nathan for you and I wtf at them 
Same thing with the Inbetweeners (British version). It is marketed as a teen high-school comedy.In reality, it consists of 4 socially awkward dudes getting into extremely embarrassing situations and everyone around them cringing up. Like for an example, one dude at a club gets his peepee injured and bleeding from a zipper I think, but his friends are too embarrassed or awkward to get help. It was supposed to be "funny" but was really painful to watch.I've heard the US version is much funnier and lighter though.
Are you able to watch It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia? It's second hand embarrassment and sadness.
I used to have this problem too, until I heard a particular interview with Louie CK on NPR. They asked him (paraphrasing) how he dealt with what they called the "cringe" comedy in his show, and he says when he runs into those moments in life, he liked to just take a deep breath and walk in and see what was there. I had never thought of it like that, and by copying what he does it really allowed me to enjoy a lot of different forms of entertainment, including certain episodes of his show. 
I felt the same, and then I watched Parks and Recreation. It's very similar except all the characters(including the side ones) are a little crazy which makes it much easier to watch, since they aren't realistic.
I also have this. I knew it was a thing, and I knew not everybody felt it, but I had no idea that it was common and other people experienced it as well.I remember as a kid having a hard time enjoying the "Hank The Cowdog" books because Hank was such an idiot.
My wife and I binged on The Office while she was pregnant. Thanks mostly to the brutal genius of Steve Carell, I routinely had to leave the room while my wife laughed at me. 
Definitely watch Nathan for You
I think one difference between Arrested and The Office is the only sane person in Arrested knows everyone around him is crazy, while the Office has several "normal" people trying to grapple with the oddballs on the show and keep some level of composure while cringing inside. 
I have had to literally get up and leave the room watching Larry David.  
Curb your Enthusiasm can give me intense anxiety.... But dammit every once and a while Larry is in a situation and reacts just the way I'd want to react. Season two was much easier to watch (in my opinion) than season one
Jackass when they're messing with each other I'm perfectly fine with but when they start messing with random strangers, I can't handle it.  Those guys signed up to look like a fool or have some crazy stuff happen to them on camera.  The average person going about their day did not.
For me it was movies like Meet the Parents and There's Something About Mary, where it's just the guy publicly humiliating himself over and over for 2 hours. Couldn't handle it, never laughed once at either movie and never made it all the way through them. 
Came to say this. The Office had some great, funny moments but the overall cringe-y tenor of the show kept me away. I was leery of P&R when it came on as it was a similar pseudo-documentary format. Thankfully, I gave it a shot.
Meet the Parents kills me for this reason. Ben Stillers character is so uncomfortable I almost can't watch it.
/r/cannotwatchscottstots
Phyllis and Bob's wedding is another one. I skip both of those episodes every time.
....and the dinner party episode.  I feel so uncomfortable just thinking about it!
The Office UK is beautifully cringey. And by that I mean it's a brutal cringefest. 
I cannot watch the UK Office because of David Brent. Does anyone else also feel like the UK series is just downright depressing compared to the US series?
Yeah man, these coddled kids out here saying "I can't watch Scott's Tots!" and meanwhile I'm the old man in his rocking chair going "Let me tell you about a man named David Brent..."
I love The Office (UK) and David Brent funny in a cringey way, but my favourite part was the Gareth/Tim relationship. Mckenzie Crook and Martin Freeman bounced off each other really well.
I feel like this is something I'd be able to buy at IKEA.
Peep Show is the most awkward thing I've ever watched. It hurts to watch, but I love it.
... I love all of these shows
Ben Stiller movies exemplify this. 
uugghhh and he tells every Officer Jenny he meets that she's even more beautiful than all the other Jennys noooo Brock stooopppp.....
If Ben Stiller created it, Ricky Gervais has perfected it. The Office was bad, Extras was even worse, and then he went full retard and did a show about a mentally challenged caretaker. I liked the original version of The Office that he did but his other stuff is too much. 
I've loved Louis CK's standup since the 90s, so I kept giving Louie another shot.Every new season I would watch an episode to see if I or the show had changed.  Every time I'd want to gouge my eyes out.His standup is still terrific.  Joe Pesci had it completely backwards.  Louis CK should stay far away from TV and movies, and dedicate his whole life to standup.
I found parks and rec to rely less on cringe humour than the office, at least after the first season. I couldn't handle the office at all, but I loooove parks and rec!
In portuguese it's "vergonha alheia", literally "shame for another one".I suffer from this so bad I can't even browser /r/cringe
I wish we could just smash words together in English not just celebrity names.
Thank you Germany! This is even better than Schadenfreude.
The Germans seem to have a word for every oddball emotional situation.
How does that word form in German is it a mash of other words or a coinage type deal? 
I'll come out of my long time lurk to give u a hell yes for Hank the Cowdog!
That one episode where he bails on paying for the kids college... so painful.
Ha, my SO actually showed me this show. I could sorta handle it. 
OP needs to watch Peep Show.
Also, arrested development never seems as "real" for me. Nothing ever sticks to these people, they are all so far insane I just sit back and laugh until I cry
To me, (in the UK version at least) the "normal" guy Tim actually turns out to be the worst one of all.I mean, he stays there in his safe little rut because all the terrible people make him feel less inadequate by comparison. If he was as normal deep down as he appears, what is he doing working there long-term? He's afraid.
To be fair, any time you see a person on Jackass who doesn't have their face blurred out, they've signed a release form. They may not have been in on the home at the moment, but rest assured they were at least informed of what happened afterwards.
Yeah, pain and embarrassment are (to me) the lowest form of humor.  I don't generally find stupid funny, just annoying at best.  
Yeah, that kind of stuff makes me want to compress my body down into a singularity out of embarrassment 
I was just asking friends yesterday if P&R got better as two episodes in, all I'm feeling is cringey embarrassment.  Poehler's character is just awful to me.
1,000+ subs?!?! I haven't made it that far in the series yet but now I can't wait.
And Business School, which is like right before Phyllis's Wedding. Just so much cringe from so many angles. 
The dinner party episode is cringe but so fucking funny. There's some great one liners. I also saw the season blooper real and there's some clips from that episode and they are hilarious. Michael and Jan keep cracking up during scenes at the dinner party. 
Peep Show is worse
It absolutely is.  The US version has heart, while the UK is just brutal (which I think makes it soooo much better, but the shows are so different, to each her own).  That said, the Christmas Special series finale for the UK version is amazing and incredibly touching.  So if you never managed to finish, that's something worth knowing.
I think it's so hard because people truly endear Michael Scott.
It's completely agonizing. Great show
Then have you seen *The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margarett*?  I found it hard to watch, but you might like it.
I didn't think Derek was cringey, just one hell of an emotional roller coaster 
God dang, I'm glad to see many other people suffer from this. Not in a sadistic way, just glad I'm not too weird.
The USA *did* have the option of using German as a national language, but nooooo.... :P
*Nothing* is better than Schadenfreude.
It's because we do go through a lot of oddball emotional situations. For example Kummerspeck is also a word here, it refers to the weight you gain when you feel depressed or just broke up with someone.
> It means being ashamed for a stranger.This is literally what it means. It's a combination word of the words 'strange' and 'shame'
You're not the only one/r/CannotWatchScottsTots
I love Peep Show. The whole cinematography is designed to make you as uncomfortable as possible.
Jim was a well-adjusted, cool guy.Tim was a depressed loser.
Give it some time - it keeps gets better and less cringey as it goes. It really takes off about midway through the 2nd season and just keeps getting better. It has one of the most thorough/satisfying series finales I've seen.
It's....you have to watch it. You *have* to watch it, and you'll never want to watch it again. But the episode is genius and displays one of the most Michael Scott-y events in the series.
Its one of the worst things I have ever seen. I had to keep pausing it to let the waves if cringe subside 
I watched it due to all the hype on Reddit, but it was pretty disappointing. Your average prank video is worse.
That's why if you watch season two of the US office the lighting is a lot different. The show didn't do too well because the US audience found Michael Scott to be too cringey and idiotic, so they revamped his image to be a loveable kindhearted idiot. They also made the lighting more "warm"  because prior lighting made the show appear "cold". I like both, and both cater to the audiences who watched each. That said, the Christmas special for the UK version felt really great and well earned. Finally turn around for characters that deserved it.
Is that what the show turned out like? I only saw the first episode and just didn't feel like going through the series. 
Haha my husband does this with romantic comedies. He can't watch the awkward parts and will literally pace around the living room until it is over. 
"Pena ajena", too
Yepp, there are still a lot of empathetic people like us who can't take watching other people suffer (at least psychologically). Whether this suffering is self-inflicted or inflicted by others doesn't matter. Some things just hurt. That might be a cringeworthy chat-up line or a miserably fucked-up attempt to sing... It just hurts. Physically. I can't stand that. Not even for a moment. 
It we had lots of towns and cities who did official government work in German. Then something happened around 1940
we just take the words we like, e.g. schadenfruede and fremdschamen.we don't even put umlauts in there, because those words are ours now.
lebenslangerschicksalsschatz?
I tried to watch it because I love David Mitchell. But I tapped out in the first 10  minutes. Fuck, It was too cringy.
The episode where he meets his dream girl who's studying history and then it all goes to shit....it's physically painful to watch
there's a reason the british version went for 2 series vs the 9 seasons the US version got. 
I mean it was funny but it wasn't more cringy than any other episode
Haha aww that's terrible! Your synopsis makes it sound pretty funny though. I'm sure it's probably a lot worse in the episode though, huh?
Putting my historian hat on for a moment, it was more likely WW1. The cultural hate was stronger in the First World War, perhaps because there was a much stronger bogeyman of a leader present in WW2. Typically, WW1 was when people were renaming cities, foods, etcetera. 
Odd, I wonder what might have happened!
Yeah, the argument for "English needs an equivalent word for schadenfreude" gets weaker all the time. Why would we need one at this point? Words aren't a finite resource. It's not like the Germans can't use it anymore.It would be awesome to see fremdschamen gain the traction that schadenfreude has though. It's way cooler than "second-hand embarrassment". 
I hate that Episode because of that word. Yes you can theoretically do that in German, but no one here would do that
Because Americans don't know when to quit? (Don't worry, I'm American)
I dunno man, to me it's the magnitude of his actions and the failure to deliver to the kids. I mean, if you think about it, there's so many consequences to his idiotic actions, moreso than the other episodes. That's what makes it awful for me. 
Everyone online exaggerates how bad it was, but it was definitely worse than most other episodes, cringe wise at least. People saying they couldn't finish it in one sitting, or could never watch it again are just bullshitting I think
Cool, TIL. So Nazi/German hate was sowed into the fabric of geopolitics well before Hitler came to power? 
Americans in the entertainment industry have a very narrow idea of what they want German to sound and look like. Probably because it's funnier when you shout it at people. I hate it but this is the reason most of us think German is an angry sounding language when, in my opinion, it's a beautiful one. 
In fact that's part of the reason hitler was able to gain power; his platform was centered on the mistreatment of Germans after WW1. Hitler spoke of the "power hungry Jews" and the "draconian war reparations" and treaty of Versailles in several "us against the world" speeches. The nazi party never gained a majority of any vote but hitler was able to gain enough support in power circles to gain the position of chancellor. Hindenburg's death allowed a bloodless coup bit the whole rise to power was seeded in the perceived oppression of Germans after WW1. 
There's always the historical issue of the impact of man vs the impact of the forces of history.Although we can't be sure , how different do you think that period would have been without Hitler ?
I'm so sorry this happened to you and your family. I know one family from Iran and they are the nicest people you would ever meet. I sincerely hope this situation solves itself quickly. 
My boss is Iranian and has been here like 20 or 25 years and has family back there.  I don't even really like her but I'm fucking irate about this cause I'm a human fucking being.  All I've been thinking about is her and her family. I'm with you OP. 
Iran retaliated by doing the same thing towards American citizens.That is a strong message ,other countries should follow and then it would get reversed lol
I really can not believe this shit is actually happening. How can this maniac just order something like this? Do you guys not have anything in place to stop or - by now - reverse this idiotic bullshit?
This freaking sucks. Sorry for this shitty stupid situation. 
Oh geez. I am sending you a big hug. Why would you fail due to one paper? When is your family due back to US?
I'm so sorry. Trump is honestly insane. I had some hope and faith in him but that is fast fading. Its been a shit week for me too.. just broke up with my girlfriend and its been hard to study. Maybe I'll fail out and join the circus too.
My girlfriend of two years decided today, without warning, that I wasn't what she wanted anymore. No chance to fix anything just done. To make it better she did it over text, while I was at work. Nothing compared to your troubles, but definitely not a good day. 
Wait, Green Card holders are legitimate, were they included in the ban?? I mean they have legal right to enter the U.S.! how does this make sense.
Ugh that really sucks man. I fuckin can't stand this guy and he's my boss, so gotta roll with the punches.As for my day, sitting at work for 12 hours (8 to go!) bored out of my mind cause nothing breaks on the weekends. Just gonna practice my Japanese, then going on a date with a new girl after work! What's your cat's name?
I'm sure you're already aware, but federal courts have halted the immigration ban for the time being, and hopefully it'll be overturned soon, because it's unconstitutional. 
The circus is closing down.
Thank you. It makes me feel better knowing that so many people are disgusted by this. We have a lovely culture and a big part of it is sharing, we love having guests and making friends.
Don't believe for a moment that a large portion of the country doesn't want you here. You are a citizen. You are one of us, and you will always be welcome. Don't allow this administration to divide & conquer. 
I hope not, they have a house and everything here.Thank you. She's grumpy about going to the vet and wants space but all I want to do is cuddle her :(
I became close with a teacher from Iran.Today he was so sad.It hurts to see someone like that affected by something so stupid. 
I mean it's unconstitutional as is, but it's still shitty that it's keeping family apart, especially with our New Year coming up. It's the only time of year I get to see them.
I spent this morning reading about the Internment camps because I feel like too many people forget that that happened... All the parallels are terrifying. This is the first time I feel unsure about living here :(
The ACLU filed a suit so hopefully it gets reversed quickly. 
Yes. The federal court just blocked the whole mess for now. 
I'm sorry for all of the US really :(
They're due back this week, but now who knows. And my teacher has a blanket 'no late work' policy and the papers are 60% of the grade. I had 100% and have never had a late assignment before. She's not nice.
The circus is a valid path, I've been training for three years as a back up plan. That comment was only a half joke ha.I'm sorry to hear that :( I hope your week gets better.
That's cold, sorry man. It'll take a while, but through a lot of pain you'll come out the other end stronger and better. Keep your head up.
That's horrible, I wish you the best of luck. You'll make it through. 
Ooooh, a date! That's exciting! Whatcha gonna do? And Japanese is so cool! How long have you been learning?Her name is Athena, but I mostly call her Memow or Queena :)
I've lived in the US my entire life.  Several generations of my family were born on this soil.  And I am utterly appalled.  This is not okay.  This is not what our country means, or stands for.  It's making me so sad and angry.  I really, really hope your cat feels better, your paper gets top marks and some how your family can get in.   Big hugs to you.
Yeah for real, the people who are vocally against all this are the only reason why I still have faith in America.
Yes, many who voted for Trump did so because they thought he'd bring jobs, not because they are racist or Islamaphobic. So even if he won, it doesn't mean all who voted agree with the worst of him. Just that they somehow managed to ignore it.
Obama paused accepting new refugee applications. He did not deny entry to people with lawfully held visas and sure as hell not to green card holders! This is unprecedented. Imagine you went on vacation and on return to your permanent home you were told no, you can't enter the country. That is what is happening here, temporary or not.
>It hurts to see someone like that affected by someone so stupid.  FTFY I don't think the ban itself can be completely explained or categorized as stupid, I think that's a very subtle word for it. It saddens me "we" as a society have gone this far back after all the progress we'd made in recent decades. 
Seriously.. I almost feel like he planned it around this time so we couldn't see loved ones. You're not alone, many of us are going through this as well. No matter what he does, the sun will still move and the New Years still exist. Stay strong.
Have you contacted the ACLU? Sometimes they need/want witnesses and actual claimants. 
We aren't all like him. I just want you to know that. I sincerely hate that man and his administration. They're monsters and bring incredible shame to this country.
Please try talking to her anyway. You have nothing to loose. If she won't budge, could you drop the class and take an incomplete? You may need to contact the ACLU for help for your family. They are filing papers to fight this. Do you know them?
Ok now that's actually pretty cool. What does training entail?
That's just ONE circus, not THE circus! :D Modern circus is better anyways.
Thanks man. You wouldn't think it, but getting it off my chest and having someone say something back to me really helped. It's been a helluva day. Thank you for taking time out of your day to respond to me. 
I got to Japan in 2013, was here for two years then went to Korea for a year, now I am back in Japan. I started learning about 1 year into my first year here. I am not as good as I should be, but I have been picking it up more diligently recently. I think we are going to grab some dinner then go to a themed bar in Tokyo! Hopefully a jazz bar with some good beer, I dig those haha.That's a dope name! 
To be fair, I think everyone knew what he was about during the campaign and they should own their decisions.
This is a blanket ban on members of a specific religion from Middle Eastern countries where Trump has no business ties. It is certainly unconstitutional.
8 U.S.C. 1152 (a)(1)(A) "...no person shall receive any preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person's race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence." He cannot discriminate on the basis of any of those categories which is exactly what he is doing by restricting immigration based on country of origin. Additionally, because he is applying the executive order to legal permanent residents (LPRs), he is in violation of the due process clause by restricting their right to travel freely without due process.
It's too insane. History truly repeats itself.
I really wish that I didn't read that
I'm looking into it right now to see if they need/want any of that! I'm gonna set up a recurring donation when I get paid again.
I sent her a message and she said she's not taking it. I'll try again on Tuesday when I see her. I'm in my last year and I'll have to wait another year to take the class, the department is really small.And yes, thank you, I've been reading up on them a lot, and CAIR too, and talking to my dad. I read that they're doing it case by case, so if that's true, hopefully they aren't held for too long since they're doctors.
I started going to a class, and then one by one everyone else quit and it was just me and the teacher and from there, it's only ramped up! Circus hurts and weeds people out that way.I do trapeze training 3x a week, handstand practice, ballet, and conditioning 3x a week! :) I started for exercise and then it was the best thing for my mental health and physical health!
I feel you, and glad you got something positive out of it. I've been there before. When my girlfriend of 5 years broke up with me I was wrecked for a full year. Couldn't hold a relationship with anyone for more than a month without spiraling out, beer for breakfast, that sort of thing. Eventually I came out of it, but it took a lot of work. Happily married now. Hang in there!
Amazing! What do you do for work, if you don't mind? I want to go to grad school for foreign policy! I've been learning French for 10 years and still feel like I'm not where I should be, I think that's just a trait of language learning haha.That sounds like an awesome time! I've always wanted to go to Japan.And thanks! I adopted her when she was 5 and I thought it would be weird to change her name when she was already an adult.
You do realize that's not a credible website don't you? It's just Brietbart for people wearing ties.
just because it has happened before doesn't mean it's ok now
For a long time the US banned Chinese people from coming to America. Most would argue that that was bad, but it was very much constitutional. Trump's Muslim ban follows in the same line and is within his powers.I think the blanket ban is really stupid, but not liking something doesn't make it unconstitutional. 
No where in his EO does it state its against Muslims. 
Hey, not sure if you've heard this yet, but Trump's order has been temporarily "paused". If your family gets detained, contact the ACLU immediately. They have lawyers at major airports to assist with this.
CNN also asked people who have been affected by this to contact them.
I sure hope and pray she changes her mind. Does another university offer it online? What is your major?Iran has banned Iranians from travelling here too. It will be very, very messy. There is an emergency hearing tonight in Brooklyn. Please know that we are with you.
That's really cool. Makes me want to start back up with my exercise regime. School always burns me out and i lose all my healthy habits.
So what do you consider a credible website? salon, Huffington Post, CNN, MSNBC?All sites that have lied about this executive order.
Do you believe he is correct in saying that all people from those countries would be detrimental to the interests of the United States?
I'm a French major and I intended on going to grad school. I'll look and see if there's anything online and equivalent, but I swear the longer I'm in university, the more they just want to bleed you and don't care about the rest.Thank you, it's scary for my family. We love this country and it hurts to see this all happening.
Do it! I'm in the best shape of my life. I hated exercise until I found one that I can't imagine living without anymore. A trapeze artist is just what I am :)
I know all about the costs. I went back to college as an adult, and both my daughters were in college too. Total cost: $240,000. Each one of us pays our own loans. It is scary. I can't imagine what you all must be feelings. I am so angry. Racism and Hatred are occupying the Oval office. However, it gives me great hope when so many of us are protesting, contacting congressional representatives, etc. We will fight that bastard until the end.
That's awesome. I'm a real fan of urban exploration and had been training in parkour for a while, school and money took priority though. I'm finally a senior so I have the time again!
Ouch :( I am blessed to have very minimal debt and hopefully I can keep it that way. I found an equivalent course online though, now the question is if my school will take it. They're strict on upper division transfer credits.I'm going to a rally tomorrow night to help show that real humans are affected by this. A lot of folks don't know many, if any, Iranian people and the media's view is all we tend to have of each other.
I tried parkour once! Totally kicked my ass. I am a one dimensional acrobat hahaha.I get the money and school, I had to take a summer off of training once :(  What's your major??
This is going in circles.  The legal code allows the president to stop entry from all aliens.  Green card holders are aliens.  Permanent residents are aliens.  Thus the president has the right to deny them entry to the country.
I bet they will take it. If not you can petition them.No protests near me, or I would go too. Glad you are going! Would you please check back with me and tell me what happened? Take some pics?
I'd love to just take off somewhere but I live with my partner and I'm scared of upsetting him. 
I did this. Was fed up with my job and quit without anything lined up or planned. Was planning to move somewhere else, but I never pulled the trigger. Ended up being unemployed for a year and then went back to the same job.So it didn't really work out the way I planned.
That is so awesome!  How quickly did you find a new place and new job?
I wish I had the balls to do something like this - I'm certain it would likely work out exactly the same way. Congratulations, and good luck on your new life!
Awesome man. Great display of courage, you earned your new improved life! :)
Yep, I did this in 2011, after dealing with under employment following the financial crisis, and being fed up with the situation in the US (looking back, I wish for those days, politically).I sold essentially everything I owned (snowboard gear was basically all the survived the purge), and bought a one way ticket to Bangkok.I traveled for nearly two years on the other side of the globe before coming home with a new perspective.Now I'm back in school, I have purpose, and goals. Best thing I ever did.
I used to live in SoCal but recently moved to North Carolina. HUGE difference. I was culture shocked for a good couple months. Still am really. Unfortunately things did not improve for me, in fact my health has been on a steady decline. Hope everything works out for the best in your situation brother!
I got tired of my retail job. And all my debts. So I hastedly decided to move to France, where I would earn a lot less than I already did, but also work less, so I would have loads of time for skiing, though I'd never skied in my life ever before! I somehow managed to pay off all my debts after 2 years, and have never been happier, I'm married and even got a dog!Your new life is going to feel like a new beginning, and it's going to be absolutely amazing! Enjoy every single moment of it.
This is why you don't have kids, because it sounds like you were living my life before, but the responsibilities I have keep me from rebooting and even from suicide.
I think about this a lot. I also think about killing myself a lot.
I did this. I moved from San Diego to Brooklyn after uprooting my life in about a week. Quit my job, cut ties with a non-serious relationship, sold my car, and bought a ticket. My biggest issue was thinking that I could run away from my problems. It just doesn't work that way. Aside from that, I'll be real with you. San Diego was hard to leave and I came back. You chose a great place to pack up and bail to. I hope you love it here!
Now that you're in San Diego, you gotta get into craft beer. I am up to suggest things for you.
Good for you, but how did you manage to find a job - and a better one at that, in just a few days? And San Diego is a very expensive - how did you find an affordable place to live?
Relevant username!
Do you love your partner? Do you trust them?Let them know of your desire to be more spontaneous in life. It may be the root of more relationship/personal issues than you think. Also, maybe they will like the idea? You just have to trust and take risks. We don't advance by playing life safe. 
so did you have something planned or not?
My question is how? How do you just 'spend the next two years traveling'? Don't you need money?
Good advice. On the flip side, a change of scene can be exactly what you need to break old destructive habits, and build new beneficial habits. It has to be deliberate and planned out, though, with specific attainable goals.
Hey, I packed my car and drove to Nashville too about two years ago. Life has made a 180 since then. My best decision in the last 5 years bar none. 
I love your boss's reaction. "Shit, he knows"
What do you have that keeps you from being financially stable?  I'm assuming you aren't married or have kids since you didn't mention that.  You said you aren't in school so you probably don't have that debt.  What is tying to a job you hate?
I quit Monday morning and had it all figured out by Wednesday evening.
You can do it in a safer way.Look for the new job and then turn things upside down. You don't need to take the risk of simply quitting and being unemployed.
His place is easily 2k+ a month for a 1 or 2 bedroon appartment if he's near a beach. 
Yeah I'm pretty skeptical of his claims too. What he's doing is just NOT that easy. 
So, how do magnets work?
Can you elaborate on how your travels changed your perspective and gave you purpose? I've heard others say it and never thought to ask. 
What part of NC? If you're rural it's going to be a yuge culture shock. And I mean that. 
San Diego is my dream city. I don't know why you'd ever leave!
What field are you in? And congratulations! 
I'm from Portland, is the scene bigger in San Diego? I feel like all I do is drink craft beer.
LinkedIn and Craigslist.
Wanna make it happen?
In general... if my partner all of a sudden starts saying "You wanna pack up and move with me??" alarm bells would be ringing. I'm sure their partner has a life where they live, it's not so simple as love and trust. Sometimes you get lucky and you both want the same thing but instability can be a relationship killer
> We don't advance by playing life safe.This is amazing. I wanna hang this quote on my wall.
I was planning to move to Austin Texas. Shortly after I quit I went for a week long visit and it was not everything I hoped it would be. So the plan ended there.
Yep. Rather a lot of it in fact.
Honestly, it takes a little planning, but Peace Corps is a great option for this.  180 degree change in your life, travel to far off places and live in a foreign culture, and companies will look more favorably on you than someone who just quit to travel.
*scene, btw :) 
Nice!  I don't know if I'll stay. So far I've gotten more out of moving than I expected, so it's a win no matter what. But after living in and around NYC for near 5 decades, Nashville is a bit...well...dull.
Oh it was hilarious. He just "oh, fuck"ed.A bit of background, we were in "disaster recovery" space because 7 months earlier an islamopithicine had flown an airplane into our office building while we were working.So stress was already high and "fuckit"itude was running pretty rampant around the office.
This!! I'm 46 and in nursing school. I graduate May 2018. You can go to school whenever you want! 
I live with 2 friends. As is after paying my share of rent and such, plus basic necessities, I have around 200 dollars left each month. It's not that I can't save money or anything. It's just that at this rate it's going to take a while for me to save enough to comfortably move to wherever I want. I mean, I have nothing tying me down from leaving, in fact I get close and close to doing it each day. It's just not financially viable for me. (Yet)
Wow!  That's so fast!  Had you been looking into it beforehand or did you just luck out?
Being in a single-income household, I wouldn't just walk out of a job. It is impressive, though, that people are able to do it and make it work without ruining literally everything.
I love all of the naysayers. People do this all the time. It's scary, and a lot don't make it. But it's certainly doable. 
Ummm, shit, I've been found out. How could I ever have anticipated someone actually asking? C'mon
Advance. Trust me i know
Conspiracy charges here we come!! 
Yeah maybe do more of a "throw a dart at a map and take off to there for a weekend" type deal.
I dunno, I really dislike these kind of shallow mountain wisdom. I think people can advance while playing safe, building up a happy life step by step, just like people can screw up everything by risking too much. I know nowadays these one-sentence philosophies (and tons of motivational quotes everywhere) are extremely popular, but I think most of them are plain BS.
Haha yes! Being from California everyone told me that the only plane in Texas I would like is Austin. Visited last march and kind of underwhelmed. I loved Dallas on the other hand and I'm moving there in July!
Yep, few years back I packed up and moved to Austin with only what I could fit in my backseat and trunk and while it's better than where I was before, I am already looking to move again. Austin's really suffering from the huge population influx it's maintained for the last several years, it really seems like the local government treats the city as if it's a lot smaller than it actually is.
What were you hoping it would be like and how did it not compare to your ideals? 
So this option isn't open to a lot of people. I imagine the advice we're seeing in this thread could ruin a whole lot of people. It needs a disclaimer
Any chance you could do an ama? 
I've thought about doing Peace Corps (my longtime SO has talked about doing it too), but I worry about returning after 1-3 years with no prospects. Like I don't think it'd make me significantly more employable and my field is already on the down and very competitive.
ha, whoopsie doodle
I came from Dallas so I know the feeling. I feel like one day I'll go back, but my career has progressed so much here, I don't see myself going back anytime soon.
Yeah, I've never had something that drastic happen to me, but I've been in situations where everyone around you is quitting and you have to hold it together. I can't blame you for quitting. In my case, I had to hold it together or I would have been stranded in Atlanta for a summer.
Which tower? 
Honestly I had no plans of this as of Monday at 8 AM. But I had been talking to the owner of a different company for about 6 months on LinkedIn and I knew he would hire me, and with Craigslist and FaceTime it wasn't hard to find a place that was a good match at all.
Get ye to Winston-Salem or Raleigh and do not look back, my child. Avoid Statesville. Tis a silly place. Greensboro is meh. 
I'll bring the rope! 
70% chance you're taking a cruise.
The point isn't that these soundbites are universally true, and equally applicable to everyone and every situation. The point is that you find a few that ring with you and your particular life experience. If you've found that playing it safe hasn't gotten you anywhere, and maybe you're too anxious or worried about doing things that benefit you, then it might seem true to you and you adopt it into your lifestyle. It's literally the same as any other motivational or inspirational story - what you get out of it depends on how you, as an individual, decide to read into it.
Thank you for introducing me.I really enjoy Seth Sentry now.
Welcome (well, soon) to Dallas! Dallas is really underrated in my opinion. 
It definitely seems like they can't keep up with the population influx. I think Portland is having the same issues. They want to keep it a small city but it is already way past that.
\*nods\*People seem to be reading this as some wacky "sustainable nomadism" thing, which, no matter how many times I re-read it, isn't there.It's called 'saving money and then spending it.'
I don't think /u/madwilliamflint was giving advice. He was just telling us about a time in his life which happened to be relevant to the OP. In a casual way... casually conversational even.
\*shrug\* people need to understand their own situational limitations. If they don't, a disclaimer isn't going to help them. 
It's their life to fuck up. If you're not smart enough to realize it needs a lot of money to do something like that, that's on you. 
I'm in engineering and good at saving so it isn't a problem for me, but people could take the same time off and just live a wildly different lifestyle if they really wanted to.
If people don't have the common sense to know things take money they got bigger problems, a disclaimer here and there won't help them.
I think people are really over reading this.- Saved money.- Quit job. (I hadn't planned on it. Just had enough.)- Went on trips to Iceland, Ecuador, Costa Rica, The Galapagos Islands, and Warsaw.
I won't likely go back to Brooklyn. Not unless I hit it big. It's just too much of a soul suck. But I'll definitely head back north. I can't take this weather. Winter is supposed to be winter.
There were a lot of reasons I couldn't do it anymore.  It was a little ptsd/survivor guilt. But primarily I'd developed this software product and because I was the expert, I was relegated to doing nothing but support, which was a complete waste of brain. 
North. First one hit, 2nd one down.
Thanks for the input, these are the exact things that have been going through my head. I'll definitely have a place to stay if I come back, and a minimum wage job is sufficient to pay for what I need where I'm living right now.I'm looking to leave in about 2 months, giving me time to save up around $2000.I've been thinking about doing this for like 6 months and am finally starting to realize it is absolutely possible from all you guys' responses. Thank you!
Ah, so you had the security of a landing pad set up already.
And there's the detail that fucks up your narrative...This post is very misleading. If you had a job lined up already, you didn't impulsively make this move. This was thought out and calculated. 
I love all of your usernames. 
Using a blueprint of my bedroom. With everything bar the bed cut out. It's still a map right?
Why call it a sound bite when you can more accurately describe it as a "quote" in fewer letters?
Good to hear. I always enjoy introducing people to some aussie artists when i can as they are often criminally underrated.Id also recommend you check out thundamentals they just released their new album and its fantastic haha.
Except by those of us from Dallas. There really isn't quite anywhere like it
Wait. Are you telling me this sub is for casual conversation?? I had no idea! :0
Obviously everyone does what the internet tells them to do without any self responsibility.
>It's their life to fuck up.This is why we don't have nationalized healthcare in the US
of course most people's' wild lifestyle would be "homeless."
Ignore this if you don't want to answer... but I am genuinely interested lol. 1. What made you decide those places to go?2. You stayed in hotels for these trips? Flights? And what was the longest and short trip?3. What kind of job did you have before? I'm 18 and need some ideas for careers bc Dairy Queen isn't cutting it. Thank you!
Thanks for your input. It sounds like your experience was worthwhile for you.My degree is in journalism/public relations, so I don't know if I would bring back any directly applicable skills, though that's not the reason I would want to do it, but it does matter for when I'd return. Though I wish I majored in something else anyway and chose a different field, so maybe PC can help someone branch out?
This Texas boy is glad there isn't snow often. I did one winter in Columbus, and it was enough for me to take it off the potential destination list.
Pfft, I don't know what companies expect when they put people in those positions. Of course you are going to quit. And then you leave and no one else knows how to use what you created since they didn't have you teach anyone.
Were you in the building at the time? I was visiting my dad in world financial that day. I had surgery on my leg, and was in a wheelchair. I was 8. He pushed me forever up the west side highway. 
That probably wasn't obvious to him when he made the decision. People can rarely point out their saving grace before they're in trouble. I think the point is that if you make these brash decisions in accordance with your authentic wants then a viable path will present itself to you and you'll later think "of course; it's so obvious". 
LOL I never imagined that I would work for this company. After quitting I scrolled through my LinkedIn messages, lost, and remembered my conversations with this particular guy and decided to go for it. You sound really salty and prickly and that's the exact type of person I'm going to avoid becoming by doing what makes me happy. Cheers dude.
Do you like my username?
Oh yeah, definitely by people who aren't from there or haven't been there. I think it has a bad rep for being rich and snobby, but there's so many different neighborhoods, there's something for everyone. 
Directions unclear. Dick stuck in responsibility.
Buy a Lamborghini.  *if you can afford to eat after purchase.  Reminder, oil changes are $1,500 at the dealer.  
I know I do. I'm gonna go do some randomly suggested internet stuffs ***right now!***
Yeah, no. That's not even close to the same thing. 
Well you did just say "And I knew he would hire me".That's significantly different than "I moved to SoCal and then randomly got a job."It's still a big move and congrats. 
Out of interest, do you message a lot of people on LinkedIn? How/why? I've never messaged someone on there.
Mine is in the mail
Yeaahhhh. The right to medical care is *rather* different to the privilege of being able to quit, pack your bags and leave on a moments notice. Of course, it'd be awesome if everyone *did* have that option. There'd be a lot fewer stressed out, strung out, miserable people slowly dying in a job they hate. Hey, might even bring health expenditure down! 
Wait...your responsibility..or...?
It's not some special right or advantage. The people worked for it.

Upquote are the shit! 
I don't think I've ever upvoted more.....
Ayyy Upvote
I actually hate them. I always have to upvote each comment at least 3 times so I can actually read what is written there.
Can confirm. Just upvoted everyone in this thread for mere fun.
Not gonna lie, totally upvoted this just to see what message I'd get.
Yeah, I usually turn the Subreddit style off on the subs I visit regularly, but CC's is so well done that I can't bear to. It's not only easy on the eyes, but it's full of clever little easter eggs like the upvote messages. 
Whoa! I've never noticed those before. That's pretty cool, I like it. Although, my first one was Praetorian and I dunno what that is haha.
But is it 11/10 with rice?
this is how is show my entusiasm get
Oh, what do my upvotes say?
Dude, what's mine say?
i dont get it.what messages?
The downvote messages are funnier.
What about mine? D:
Now I'm craving bubblegum. Thanks, braces, you ruin everything.(And as a test for anyone out there, what does it say on your screen when you upvote my comment here? It's probably randomly generated for each person, but I'm curious)
The messages just appear to be other comments in the thread. Am I missing something?
i dont vote, am i missing out?
You sneaky bastard. 10/10
Guess you just did the whole frontpage of this sub a huge favour ;)
What's mine? :(
I got this too!
Hijacking top comment to sayyy: **If you would like to submit some upvote messages of your own, feel free to either reply to this, or send them in the modmail.**^<3
"I'm a princess!"but seriously though, is the duck one a reference joke?
I made that one (the second)! :D
I upvoted your comment and it said "Thanks, Obama." :D
There are little phrases that pop up when you upvote something on the normal, non mobile version. The CSS is great on this sub, so you're definitely missing out.
I don't see them either, and I'm using my PC. Probably a joke to get people to upvote to see them or something.
404 UPQUOTE NOT FOUND
I don't know that one, but I do know that the Roman emperor's personal guards/soldiers were called the Preatorian Guard. There were the legion responsible for the safety of Rome and the Emperor.
I got "I'm a princess" from yours :3
What are some other easter eggs you've noticed?
I think I'm having deja vu...Anyway, the Praetorian Guard was the Roman emperor's personal legion. They were responsible for defending the city of Rome and the Emperor himself. However, they were most famous for assassinating emperors.
Not at all.12/10 with rice.
sweet! dude, whats mine say? 
Upvote some stuff here and you should be able to see little phrases pop out of the arrow if you can see the CSS on this sub.
You can undo your automatic upvote and re-upvote yourself... for instance, mine is "Yer an upvoter, Harry."

I'm gonna keep upvoting stuff until I get a 'Thanks, Obama'. 
It's the same for everyone :p
When I was in elementary school, I would throw pinecones at ducks in the part, because kids are all secretly evil.
The upvote button is a fountain of dank memes.
I got the same one!
does it use the same one's for comments within a thread? Cause that's what I got. And I got 10/10 would up vote again for OP.
But it hides the downvote button, which I find offensive.  It's not like it stops people from disabling CSS and downvoting anyway.
I'm seeing them. Mostly they're meme stuff like ayy lmao, quest complete, etc etc etc
LEGEN - wait for it - DAIRY!
Hey man, be careful, when I up voted him, it said he throws bricks at ducks!
You are, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
Yours says "Anything can happen"!!
I like the rules bar a lot. I know the rollover drop down rules sidebar is used elsewhere, but it's usually pretty awkwardly done and hard to read. some of the subtle humor that is hidden in the sidebar also pleases me. 
Oh my bad, I didn't see that it was already asked!
Darn did not know rice was that much better...white, yellow, or brown rice?
It also says "hadplen," not "happen."
Gravity Falls reference.  Also it's " anythding can hadpen"
The message is based on the 'thing ID' that's given to every post and comment. For example, OP's post's thing ID is `3escgd`(check in the url), so it matches this rule:    .thing[data-fullname$="d"]>.midcol>.upmod:focus:after {        content: "10/10 would upvote again"    }Hovering over my permalink, this comment's thing ID is `ctigrpr`, which matches:     .thing[data-fullname$="r"]>.midcol>.upmod:focus:after {         content: "DESTROY THEM WITH LASERS"     }
10/10 would upvote again. again
except then there's also "Have you hugged a stranger today?"...Upvotes, I'm getting mixed signals here.
Illuminati confirmed.
I love it.
Wait, so did I. So now I know how this works. It gets assigned randomly when post is made, not when we upvote. 
Why would anyone downvote something in this subreddit? Everyone here is so friendly.
Are you some kind of wizard?Can you teach me the magicks?
Very casual.
404 UPQUOTE NOT FOUND
I've got binders of upvotes.
I like white rice, but brown rice is great for cajun, or any food that has a stronger flavor than the rice. It's too rich and nutty for something without a strong flavor.So in this case, certainly brown rice.
Thank you :) it sure is a fun and interesting feature isn't it?
Thanks for this.
very casual.
Oh man our usernames are only 2 letters apart.Hello estranged brother/sister. Nice to meet you.
If we reply to each other's comments enough, but still remain anonymous, are we strangers? If we are strangers, should we hug? Do either of us have candy?
Jet fuel can't melt dank memes
Quest complete 
It's the principle!
i have the CSS disabled because the colour scheme makes my eyes hurt
I'm just clicking up arrows dude
Thanks, Obama
Lisa, you shouldn't throw bricks at ducks. They're easily startled, but they'll soon return... and in greater numbers. ^^^Seriously, ^^^ducks ^^^are ^^^gangsters.
You're a princess
It's never Lupus. Except when it is.
No way dude. Nice to meat you brother :D
*gives you candy and a hug*I try not to think too hard about these things.
You will receive an upvote!
I don't see freeze peaches anywhere, just lots of friendly people conversing casually.Besides, downvotes may add vitriol and cruelty to this sub, and we don't like that kind of thing. Here, we join hands and eat pineapple.
They should have a lights on/lights off mode like /r/nosleep.
HI IM MR MESEEKS
I wouldn't, couldn't throw bricks at ducks.I shall keep this in mind, the gangster ducks I mean :)

How have things been with the family? It's been so long since I moved out.
*gives you candy a hug back*That answers those questions.
I want a pineapple.  Life pro tip: If you are ever on Oahu, buy a pineapple from one of the roadside stands on the North Shore.  That was the best goddamn pineapple I ever had in my life.  (Once I got it.  The little girl ran away with my money until grandma tuned her up.)Second life pro tip:  If you buy a pineapple on the North Shore of Oahu,  don't eat too much of it in one day.  Don't ask me how I know.
It's never lupus. Except when it is.
You're very casual.

It's been nice, uncle Kevin has been improving his cuisine a lot. Don't you miss him?
My family (Mom, Dad, Me, Sister) went to Waikiki over Christmas break one year. For me, the pinnacle of Hawaiian cuisine is the moco loco.
> If you are ever on Oahu, buy a pineapple from one of the roadside stands on the North Shore.OMG yes. I haven't been to Hawaii in well over a decade and I still remember how delicious that goddamn pineapple was. 
If you want to capture someone's attention, whisper.
I'm so lost right now. 
Thanks obama
Thanks, Obama.
I dunno, those sugar-free diabetic cookies he used to make were pretty bad. But if he's gotten better about his diet cooking, then I might think about visiting.
I stayed in Waikiki too.  I'm not sure the pinnacle of anything is located in Waikiki.
Bitch please, I'm fabulous.
This reminds me of a story I read some years ago. Something about "name discrimination". A guy with a Spanish name tried to apply for jobs by sending his resume to them but he didn't get a response back. So then one day he just changed his first name to "Joe" and he tried again....and he got a bunch of phone calls from those employers asking him about a possible job interview.
My name's Raheem so I go by Remy, it makes me sound French so double win mon cher.
Tinder is where people can be super shallow. I personally wouldn't want to be with a person who wouldn't swipe right just because of my name, that's stupid.  I can understand the familiarity that the other comment is referring to, but there's a line where it's just rude and you're right, it is sad and that's not fair. I'm sorry. 
I see you gave yourself a nick name.
I wouldn't mind dating an Ahmed, but I'm Jewish, haha. I've actually had a similar problem, people see "Jewish and laughing about it" and pass me by. Glad you found your strike there, Nick! Though I would've gone with something like "Matt", since "mahd" can sound kind of like Matt depending on pronunciation. "Oh, it's short for AHMAD BWUAHAHA!" 
Honestly it may just be a religious thing, they might assume (because of the name) that you are super religious and not into that. At least for me, if any chic opens with a Jesus/Gode line I swipe left.  Personally I don't care if the person I'm dating is religious, I've just found that they almost never feel the same about me not being religious..
People like to cling to things familiar to them. If a name like Ahmed comes up they think foreign and therefore not familiar and comfortable. Nick is a more common name (I'm assuming you're in the us or europe) so people are more comforted when it shows up and therefore more likely to swipe right. 
This might be an unpopular opinion but a while ago I was on an online dating site. Not Tinder though. The amount of stupid annoying copy pasta or simply 'Hey gorgeous, wanna marry me?' from men with 'foreign' (not common in NZ) was shocking. After a couple of weeks I stopped paying any attention to anyone whos message did not look genuine right away. And I hate to admit but I ignored many guys with names that did not sound like they lived in my country. So sorry if there were any genuine guys but the masses ruined it for you. 
I have friends who work in call centers. They say all the Indian guys there tell customers that their name is Dave.
I'm a dude, but I get it. I would kind of assume if someone had a obviously Arabic name they were Muslim and I wouldn't want to date them. Not because they are Muslim specifically, just a general aversion to religion.
My boyfriend's brother's name is Al Hussein. In Egypt, he was "Hussein". In the US, he's "Al". 
ITT: white people desperately inventing reasons why this has nothing to do with racism.  You all are missing my favorite. As a brown person when I get treated differently or badly it's just a "coincidence." That's my vote, Ahmed.  No one is racist or xenophobic, unconscious bias is a lie, all the studies that show it are lies...this is just a coincidence :) 
I'm not using Tinder anytime soon, let alone doing so in a place where my name isn't completely typical, but I'll keep that in mind. Sadly, I can't think of any nice anagrams for my name. Why did you pick Nick? 
Hmm I wonder if that's why I never got many matches (my name's Mina and I'm a guy[Egyptian]). Interesting...
I wonder what my american name could be... I think I'd go for something creepy like Travis.
Change your name to Nickahmad and start a band.
They did a test like this in Finland with applying to a job. Someone had a first name Ali and never got a job interview. When he changed his name to Ari, he started getting to interviews... 
That sucks. :( I can imagine that it's not necessarily full-blown racism in some cases, though. Maybe people were looking at your profile and thinking, "Oh, we might not have much in common if we're from different cultures," or something like that. Still making assumptions based on your name, but it's not like they're thinking, "Eww, a Middle Eastern guy."Also, I feel like I've gotten more matches since I replaced my sincere description of myself and my interests with a couple self-deprecating jokes, but I haven't been actually counting.Good luck with your tinder adventures!
Is it really sad?I mean if people assume (rightly or wrongly) that you are Islamic on the basis of your name, and they wouldn't date a Muslim (religious differences aren't *shallow*) ... how is that sad?It's as if assuming you are Islamic is unreasonable.
Sorry people are dirty racists Nick. /sBut seriously, good luck. Be happy, meet people!
Wait, where are you from anyway OP? I mean, that does matter a lot, too.I don't have a lot of matches(like 3?) in my own country (Venezuela), because with the fucked up situation only the kids with money bother with that stuff, but I used a GPS spoofer for Colombia and Detroit, and I got a lot more matches in 2 or so days of doing it, without changing anything, except the language of course.
Studies have also been done with other ethnic names, such as traditionally sounding African or Hispanic names, and the same results happen. And any time it's brought up, you basically just get a bunch of people saying, "well parents shouldn't give their children those names because it harms their chances of getting a job." It's pretty sad that the solution seems to be "everyone should have generic whitebread names" instead of "everyone should try to avoid negatively stereotyping people due to their name."
How does this work legally, exactly? Can I just call myself whatever on the application then only use my real name on bank documents and shit?
My name's Mohammad and I go by Mo
All I can think of is Ratatouille, the movie. (Remy is the name of a character in the movie: a rat).
Tinder is where you go to bury both your dick and your faith in humanity, generally speaking.
I know, man. It is what is it...what can we do...
Tinder isn't for dating. It's for fucking, most of the time.I, uh, met my girlfriend on Tinder. So that doesn't always apply.
I've never known anyone to take Tinder seriously (both girls and guys I know). Yes, you can meet someone and fall in love but for the most part you are judging someone based on a few photos, name, and a description. My girlfriends for the most part swipe on Tinder when they're bored and some of my guy friends do it in groups to have fun with it almost like a hobby.
This is pretty much why I'll never use programs like this. Why would you ever want to interact with people like that?
Holy shit, that's genius. I will keep that in mind. 
But, I have pictures of me with beer and partying... 
> At least for me, if any chic opens with a Jesus/Gode line I swipe left.I also hate it when people immediately start the conversation by talking about the former capital of the Somali region up until 1994. Like, is that their whole identity? What if I identify with a different region of Somalia? And if we had kids, what would we teach them about the Ogaden War?
Assuming someone is "super religious" because of their name is pretty idiotic
Well, turns out OP is a trp poster so I guess he's not gonna change your mind about them...
Thanks for being real. Difficult truths are a lot more palpable than bullshit rationalizations.
But what's fucked up is that I am getting rejected by girls from my own region. Ahmad should be "known" or "familiar" to them... But you're definitely right about this Parks and Rec. 
>They're simply looking for something comfortableRacism doesn't have to just mean you hate the person and think their race is genetically inferior. Being less comfortable with people of other races, if it isn't racist, its at least pretty damn close.The fact that we have to make ourselves seem as white as possible to be accepted by people sucks, and I'd totally call it racism on a broader scale.
Racial bias is a thing on dating sites as well though, think there's been a few studies done about white people being less inclined to message a black person on dating sites  (not sure about the reverse or how different races affect it)Familiarity works here but for slightly different reasons.
I am in Toronto (Canada). I thought this city is multicultural. I was wrong haha. I noticed that I was swiped left by a lot of middle-eastern girls as well. 
But like 80% of white americans identify as christian. Would you make the same assumption about them? Or someone with a Jewish last name? Having an "ethnic" name in reality has very little bearing on how religious you are, since the name is chosen by your parents, it's at most a reflection of your parents' religion.
I worked with a guy who was named Saddam Hussein right around the time Bush the second was invading Iraq. He introduced himself as 'Saddam' and I winced and went 'Ohh, I bet that's rough.' he just laughed and was like 'Oh, it gets worse, my last name is Hussein.' He was named before the other guy became well known so it was just an unfortunate coincidence.
Dude i fucking love brown people and im a jew. I was at the club this weekend and wouldnt you know four middle eastern guys with bald heads and beards all looking exactly the same were there. I had conversations with every one of them. The one guy even fucked with me saying "yeah thats my twin" for a good two minutes. Maybe its just because im in dc but i also crush hard on middle eastern and indian chicks. Come to think of, the kids place i stayed at all weekend was lebanese. Can i be honorary brown? You guys are cool as fuck. 
I don't know. I guess, I thought of it, as my nick name. That way I can joke about it, and say my nick name is Nick, my actual name is Ahmad. 
I totally agree. All the people here saying stuff like "Ahmed is such an unfamiliar name" or "their family is probably too religious for me" like it somehow excuses their behavior is a little ridiculous. I get that it makes people uncomfortable to talk about, so the natural response is probably to redirect the conversation towards something else, but not being able to accept that racism still exists is a big part of the problem. Just accept it and try and be better in the future, that's all you have to do.
Reddit is literally the breeding ground for casual racism. This thread shouldn't surprise you. 
as a guy called Osama this scares me. To make it worse im an athesit, people will always assume im muslim 
This.  I don't understand how anyone is ignoring this.  Western women don't want to end up converting to Islam, so why waste time meeting someone you'll never want to connect with.
I am from Afghanistan. I have hazel eyes, dark brown hair , and fairly light skin, lighter than eastern Asians (people from Pakistan, India, Srilanka , etc.) Whenever someone tried to guess my background, they always start with" are you Latino?"  
The recruiting system where I work totally anonymises all applications before they get to me; all I see are the answers to the questions and an applicant number. It can be annoying, but it certainly strips away any (un)conscious bias gleaned from age, gender, perceived race etc.
Fair enough, but one of those things is going to work, and the other is not.
Man, that's really sad. I am okay with discrimination on tinder. After all, it's a dating/hookingup app. But when it comes to jobs and career, this type of shit is infuriating. 
From what some sits have, it is not technically illegal. But good luck getting to an interview and showing a different person/name.
I want to be offended, but I'm gonna take that as I'm a good cook.
I met my fiance on tinder, we're getting married next year.There's plenty of fish in the tinder sea, but if you use a shallow lure with whore bait, don't be upset when you catch some stinkers. 
Dont use the app
How would you even go about explaining to a potential girlfriend that you gave a fake name?
I loved this.  I'm beginning to seriously date a girl on tinder and she says things every now and then that make me realize she was NOT just hooking up with people. first night she came over to my apartment she said something along the lines of, "well we skipped the actual date and now I'm at your house. haha this is an unusual tinder date." I laughed and agreed all the while in my own head thought, "the only thing atypical here is I'm not inside you and I actually enjoy what you have to say." so....things are going well. but it can definitely be used to both ends. 
No dog - allergies. No passport - reasonably shallowUnder 6 ft - reasonably shallowDoesn't smoke - reasonably shallowDoesn't like her kids- I don't get the criticism with this one, why would you want to be with someone at all if they have a problem with your kid? Normie job - yeah that's pretty shallow
My buddy met his long-term gf on Tinder. I think it was a terrible decision, but so far she hasn't cheated on him, so maybe he knows something I don't.
Because you want to get laid...
Ah, Madison, you missed an opportunity there.
What's with the sarcasm shit? Do girls not realize it's such a cliche?  Every single bio has some sarcasm related comment.   
They may be assuming your family or friends are super religious even if you are not. I know, super big assumption that doesn't even make sense and it stupid to begin with. But that may be their (stupid) reason. /u/_afox_  may be correct. Also, he foxbro!
Yeah, but there are pictures of Anjem Choudary drinking and partying. Plus, as mentioned below, the kind of person who is going to left swipe you purely based on your religion/race probably knows little to nothing about your race/religion. They be stupid idiots.
> Difficult truths are a lot more palpable than bullshit rationalizationswe can say that about both sides
Wait, where (approximately) do you live, OP? This is a lot more surprising if it's happening in Turkey than if it's happening in Texas.
Have you met any of these girls? Are you gonna answer as nick or tell them your real name? no judgement just curious haha
Yeah I know, I feel like I'm nuts at some of the lack of awareness I see here. People basically saying "Oh no, it's probably just because they just associate some negative stereotypes they have about Muslim people when they saw your name or they get uncomfortable around foreign people, it's not racism!" and I'm like "Um, that's exactly what racism is?"
Are you the guy who reads those online applications that make you re-fill out the  information after your resume has been uploaded in addition to a 50 question personality test?
Is it discrimination if they make more money with women? Seems like a business choice to me. 
My name is Charlene but I go by Charly.  My resume and business cards say Charly and only things like cheques and benefits say Charlene for processing.  I've never had a problem with it.  I'm sure if you make up a completely different name it may cause some confusion but there was an example a few months ago where "Deandre" hated his name for job-hunting.  Everyone told him to use either "Dean" or "Andre" instead.
Yeah, but booty...
I wish you didn't need a Facebook to use tinder. I understand why but I haven't had a Facebook page for 3 years. On one hand Facebook is a waste of time, on the other hand I need one to sign up for tinder 
Go for the long con
Why would he need to?  *Everyone calls me Nick* is an easy fix.
My cousin's boyfriend lied about his height on whatever dating thing they met on, even though she is tall and had set a certain height. She tells it like is a funny story that the first time they met she found out he was a liar ... some people are just weird.
Girlfriend..? Who uses tinder for a girlfriend? 
> Doesn't smoke That's legit. Smoking is disgusting, and Idk if I could ever actually date a smoker.
> No passport - reasonably shallowIf it's only for sex, then yeah, that's shallow, but if you're actually hoping to meet someone nice, I don't see what's wrong with wanting someone who doesn't think the borders of the US are the borders of the world. That's so unsophisticated.
pretty simple answer here, most people aren't looking for the most stimulating experiences
I was thinking Ahmy. 
Ahahahahaha can we be best friends?
> If you have a Muslim name, a girl might be concerned that she wouldn't be as accepted by your family, therefore limiting the potential for the relationship to ever get serious.no offense to you and sorry for the xperiences you had , but i think you are reaching here.  the probability that an avg girl is on tinder for a serious relationship, let alone a relationship whereby she sees OP's name and worries about how his (supposedly religious/conservative) parents may not accept him, is quite a reach.  again, i speak generally.we should call a spade a spade.
He's in Toronto, from Afghanistan. 
I read a stat(I forget where) where people will date outside of their culture/religion but once they start thinking of marriage they go back to someone that shares their culture/religion.
You're assuming it's a religion thing I think He might be Muslim, not sure if he said he was though, He didn't say the girls were either, just that they were middle eastern yet seemed put off by a name that wasn't western.
Let's not forget Polish! My wife's grandfather dropped the "ski" from their last name. Does anyone even remember why we were racist against the Polish to begin with? Oh well.
I went on two dates, and have actually told one that my real name is Ahmad, i use nick as my nickname. She was okay with it. I am going to meet this Thursday for drinks . 
Haha, no human sees those applications if you don't score high enough on that personality quiz. 
It's clear on the application that the entirety of the judging is done on the answers; unless the application requests it, you're not expected to upload a CV, and I think they even get stripped out too; at least I hope they do, otherwise the person who answered 'see my CV' for everything didn't even bother uploading it. Would have failed anyway.
> Is it discrimination if they make more money with womenby that logic, anyone who can potentially get pregnant (and therefore miss out on many months of work) should get less hiring/pay, as it costs the company real money/time/effort in training and other HR issues.Seems like a business choice to me!
In my area all the girls have "no hookups" in their bio. I hate the south
I don't understand why. ELI5?Does it match you with friends of friends (no thank you) or does it data mine your facebook interests/likes (I have left everything blank...)
I like this. Hire Caucasian actors as parents. Legally change your name. Put Nick on your tombstone. She will never have to know. The swipe is all that matters.
My wife calls me Jake. My name is not Jake.My bar name that night was Jake.
"Why do people call you Nick? Is Nick an Arabic name? You don't look like a Nick."
I think that's a pretty innocent lie, considering many people think they know height better than they do. E.g. Girls thinking a guy under 6ft is too small for them when really 5'10 or 5'11 is taller than they think, probably because many guys that height will have said they're 6ft to sound cool.  I can understanding him wanting to ovovercome an initial rejection based on what can just be prejudice - your cousin's case is different. I don't really see what's so weird about what was probably insecurity, nor her ability to laugh off a white lie.
I do. But for *your* girlfriend. 
Yeah but it's a process to get a passport. If I hadn't been planning a trip about anyway then I wouldn't have a passport now. What's the point in going through the effort to get one if you weren't preparing to leave anyway? 
I thought that was pretty much ALL they were looking for.
Ames maybe?
can we make a club? 
Well im one of those people. I speak Urdu, language of Pakistan. Now growing up on it, thinking and listening to its songs, its part of my identity and huge aspect of my life. Now when seeing a causaian person huge aspect of my life, humor is what my partner cant grasp. Im not saying that if i find a perfect white girl im gonna say no to marrying her but culture/language is very important to me so what you said can be reasoned with my ideology
I'm part Polish, and what I find strange is that when my great grandfather came over to the US from Poland, he shortened our last name by three letters, but kept the "sky." It was only 9 letters long to begin with, and really easy to spell and pronounce. I never understood the point. 
OP said it was in Toronto. I've met more non-religious people in Toronto than religious, over the 21 years I lived there. Your entire "American" argument isn't valid here.
Yeah, but if I'm on an app like Tinder, I'm not going to be looking that far into it. I'm just going to make a snap decision based on the little information it shows me at that moment. If they were white and they had a weird name that I would expect from dumb ass yuppie parents I'd pass on them too.
What's up with the weird green 'thebutton' dot next to your name?
The authentication system they use involves Facebook's token and they didn't use a homegrown account system.
If I had to guess, it'd be to prevent bots from being quite so prevalent, and to help with accountability if somebody goes missing, gets hurt, etc. 
Adds at least a modicum of "this person isn't a creepy rapist." 
they _don't_ match you with friends. and they show 'common connections' to people around your friend circle you appear to not know.
In a similar vein I think there was a post a while back about a guy who faked being Jewish with his wife's help so the in-laws would approve, and managed to get his parents to fake being Jewish at the wedding
Well Jake is a pretty great name.
Your bar name?
"No, my name's Ahmad, it's just *spelled* Nick."
Good, take her
I think it shows that it's something you're looking forward to. A passport is good for 10 years. If a person can't save enough in 10 years to go somewhere that you need a passport (they even recommend taking it to Canada these days), to me that's not a person who wants to travel internationally.
Likes: positive stimuli, resting periods  Dislikes: negative stimuli, waking periods, extinction
Paging /u/pandoras_fox
> You're going to find that by and large, folks from India find other folks from India more attractive than Irish people.Am I? Much of Asia worships white beauty standards. If you ever visit, maybe you'll find that Caucasian models are everywhere.
Okay, but then all the more reason to not assume that a young Canadian Muslim you meet is super devout and culturally incompatible with you.
And they choose not to add Google, Twitter, LinkedIn or others. 
Having spent some time doing web app development, I can say with relative certainty that Facebook integration is relied on as a quick way to get the personal information that the app depends on -- like your name, photos, social connections, etc -- without having to explicitly ask for them. Using social media authentication is also great for the user, being as they won't have to set up yet another account, verify their email, or remember which password they used, all of which generally turn people off from using new services.
Yeah, cause there are no creepy rapists on Facebook.   I avoid using any free service where my personal info is the product.  I don't sell plasma or pimp myself for medical experiments either, just a personal standard. So yeah, no tinder for me.  
I know some guys that would disagreer/antijakes
She sounds hideous! 
A fake name you give girls at the bar.  Ron Mexico, Carlos Danger, Jake...
By and large, yeah, you will: Statistically speaking, you'll find folks from India are sleeping with other folks from India more than they are folks from Ireland. 
LinkedIn for Tinder would be awful.
I pass on every single website that requires me to sign in using FB. I have a FB account, but just no. 
I recognise that show but I couldn't name it, probably because I'm not American. I wonder if the guys story was just a rip from that or just similar by coincidence, Is it the exact same in that show?
Ahahahaha wtf is this?/r/ofcoursethatsathing I guess
No. My name is actually Jake and I fucking hate that commercial, because half the people I meet say "like Jake from State Farm!"
But...why would you do that?
I'd bet my saving that the picture is from Seinfeld, altough I can't quite recall what episode, but I can confirm that George Costanza would be in it for the long con and would do more for less.
Yeah of course it is. Jake is the reason for all the miseries in the world 
Awwww, yeah, that has to be hard. I have a very common name too but mine has about 6 different spellings, so I grew up constantly verifying the spelling. I just spell it out of habit now when I'm giving it out to stores or whatnot, because they always spell it wrong.I would understand a downvote for bringing up your most hated commercial, haha
Nice friends she got...
did you find anything interesting secret agent schnebly5?
That's awesome. You'll not regret this when you grow older, I guarantee it.
Something happen between you and your girl?
See if you can't get up in the vents. But don't blame me if you get in trouble :)
We need an update stat! 
From a European agent: what is a prom?
I never regretted not attending my high school prom until I read this thread. That sounds like way more fun than doing prom crap like I see in the movies! Except for getting laid...that'd be pretty cool, but I still think this is more memorable.
Fuck you're awesome dude. 
Where's the awesome girl who'd rather be with you doing this? Wires got crossed. 
I read this as, "I'm at my girlfriend's porn right now."Now instead you're a secret agent. If Hollywood's taught me anything, being a secret agent will get you more diddly doo than being in a porno.
shouldn't you be trying to get laid?
This sounds like me and my friends shroom trip, we ran around our college campus at like 8pm pretending to be secret agents. My friends room became the "room of secrets" as we took the Schrodinger cat idea to the extreme and We names a BLT Dale
my prom is in two weeks and now i really want to try snoping aroudn the hotel tooi will go do some research and look at the blue prints to start prepping for my mission :P
I feel like everyone in this thread would really enjoy playing Ingress. 
>When I got downstairs, some shit was going downRed ladder room guy heard some crazy person sneaking around restricted radio equipment. I'm pretty sure you are the shit that was going down. But +1 for evading capture.
I don't think secret agents would be wandering around with their nose in their phones. I mean that just isn't conducive to secret agent stuff. 
I know its over, but I just want you to know that reading this really made my day! Thanks! :D
I'm still reading! Sorry about the breakup. :(
I'm reading your story with the voice of Butters and it work wonderfully.
going into the same situation, but the girls not my girlfriend. just someone ive known for a long time... now i know what im gonna do if i end up solo 
Did you get the package?
Oh I just finished my prom, my frienda got a room and we started to drinking anf came back to the prom as drunk as can be, they snorted aome crushed pills I didn't thought it was cocaine. I danced majestically.  Slow danced with some chick to the last song since you know prom movies.  Now I'm at a Denny's with some coffe and burger quesadillas.  I'm going to go back to that hotel to access the roof now.
Sorry about your break-up mate. From the sound of it, you're a pretty fun guy, so I'm sure you'll be alright in the future.
Is it normal for American High Schools to allow their students to stay over at the hotel??Cause, y'know...^^^they ^^^WILL ^^^have  ^^^the ^^^sexy  ^^^time.
Burt Macklin, is that you?
I would really want a boyfriend who would do secret agent stuff in hotels with me. Keep on doing your thing! Uni/College will do you tons of favors, I'm sure.
HOLY SHIT IT WAS HAUNTED?! Was there even anyone up in that room? YOU ALMOST CAUGHT A GHOST HOLY SHIT.Also, I'm here bro. Sorry that you broke up. Always sucks man, but sounds like college may be right around the corner. It may just be perfect timing. Stay positive!
Concert pianist?Hangs with Bill Nye?Truly blends in all surroundings like a true secret agent. Good luck at Duke!
Threat Level Midnight! 
Dude i read this and thought immediately "this guy is an infp for sure" so glad you posted 
Hey man I'm still reading, and it sucks to hear about the breakup. But hey, the best part of your life is still ahead of you, and you seem like an awesome guy. Girls tend to like awesome guys so you should have no problem finding a better replacement!
This is by far the best thing I've read all day. And it has inspired me to write the next teen drama/comedy. Thanks /u/schnebly5!
Was this possibly B-CC prom at the Omni Shoreham hotel? If so, the reason the security guards were busy in that last photo is because they found a kid doing cocaine in the bathroom who then proceeded to fight them. 
My prom is coming up in about a month and it's at a sugar bush. I'm planning on going undercover to acquire some fresh maple syrup. Any tips on how to be inconspicuous?
Damn too bad getting laid is more fun than playing secret agents
Yeah. I won't lie...for a guy who's shy and put himself out there to ask to hang out with the friends, it didn't feel good for them to just brush me off several times. But... whatever. They weren't worth making friends with anyway then, and frankly, I probably had more fun snooping around by myself than they did. 
> eating goldfishWhat? Like actual goldfish?
Agent schnebly5 reporting in. I've snuck past the guard and am in the elevator. As I am writing this the elevator stopped and two women got in. They don't seem to be concerned, just a weird look since I'm in a tux. Will report in soon. On the 5th floor. 
Can't tell if you're sarcastic. It's either this or sitting by myself. Remember, this is her prom, not mine. I go to a different school, so I'll have my own prom with people I onow
I've done that before IRL. the halls were empty after school so me and my friend were doing secret spy flips past doorways, hiding behind lockers, and dashing everywhere like super badass spies while humming the mission impossible music. It was pretty awesome and I forgot about both him and this memory until just now.
Too hard in a tux 
I went to prom my junior year stag. Senior year I dragged...my gay date. Had a blast both times.
It's an American high school tradition where students dress up in their best and have a blast dancing and what not.  They vote for Prom King & Queen and it's generally a big deal for people to go to at least once.
:D I'm sure you are too! 
Wow thanks so much for sharing. You sound awesome! That's some awesome advice, so thank you. 
damn, thanks for sharing! Apparently you have just got married, congratulations!!! Reading this made me really happy :)You should be really happy by now ;) enjoy your life as a married man! Best wishes from Brazil**"never lose the spirit of adventure"**
So you're saying it gets you...   ... Alotta Fagina? 
Already did after prom ;)
Nothin's ever gonna keep you down! 
That sounds exactly like the kind of thing I'm hoping to do in college 
I have the same personality type as Butters: INFP!
I hope so :D
I KNOW!!! I NEED TO GO BACK AND FIND IT!!! Also, really thank you for your positive vibes... it's just kind of dizzying right now cause the breakup is a bit messy here and there so it takes some work to close. I really hope you're right about college. If I may ask, are you in college? 
Wow! Awesome! Let me know what you come up with! 
Fellow agent, one of the keys to being stealthy and going places you're not supposed to is the ability to retreat. In my adventures in the hotel, I had a few "safe spots" where I *knew* nobody would find me (e.g. this little nook on the F1 staircase on the 6th floor). So each time I went a little further in the ladder room and sensed danger, I knew I had a place to fall back to. It's like guerrilla warfare. 
You'll find more awesome people like you in college/uni. Let those high school snobs be
You can get plenty more high school girls once you're in college. 
It's a kind of cracker I think. Threw me too, the first time I heard an American say that.
beware of the two ladies, they must not find out your true identity :D!
Yo, as someone who never went to prom... I doubt you'll regret anything. Life is so much better after high school in my opinion.
Darn. What about the roof? Ha. Don't take me seriously. 
Hey, America shouldn't be giving out its secrets to other spy agencies 
...with your girlfriend?
I'm curious to know how toast came up too. 
Becareful. Look at the user name. It might be stockholm syndrome. You should try an interrogation.
Dresden Files....MBTI...INFP(like me).....audiobooks? Y'all're mah internet buddies who I'll never really talk to. :DD
I just realized what uni meant from your comment. I feel like an idiot
The key is just to leave your fucks at the door and realize there is nothing to lose--there are no consequences for looking like an idiot with people you don't know. If you can make sure you're not afraid to do what you like, even if it may seem stupid to some, it'll seem awesome to others who feel the same way. That's how you make your best friends. Or so I'm told... It's easy for me to give this advice, but I certainly have not put it into practice enough to verify its truth. But everyone has to start somewhere!
I'm going into my junior year, think there's still hope for me? Side note: I'm 32, will that be a problem?
Heh. Foreigners. I didn't even know that Goldfish were America exclusive. 
Reporting in. Close call! Saw a room service lady on floor 5 and then on floor 6. She gave me weird looks. I ran up stair E and then stair G to floor 8 where I am now. I think I lost her. I see a sign for "roof access" so I'm going to check it out. 
Good to hear cause high school...hasn't been the most fun thing I could imagine. 
You didn't go to prom, how would you know?
I wonder how many calories you just burned.
Read above. I think the red ladder may have led to the roof. 
Well after the toaster is done toasting, the toast comes up
it's short for unitard, duh.
I want to impregnate your brain and get a little schnebly-attitude baby that just goes around everywhere with your mindset. Seriously, that advice is the ultimate key in theory but its really difficult to put it into practice as you said, but still, if you managed to snag a girl from another school then it must've worked, heh. Bestest of luck my friend, hope I meet a schnebly one day <3 
We get all the good exclusives. 
If there is no helicopter at the roof waiting for you, they have found us out and you must stay hidden D:!
Just dont end up in the water tank!
Left high school 12 years ago, remember precisely nothing about it or what happened there. Moved away, got actual friends, got a proper job. Life starts after education.
high school was the worst time of my life, college was the best (and still is for another year cuz i fucked up real good).
Because, I went to homecoming... I imagine prom has the same shitty DJ, with the same shitty people, with the same shitty awkwardness. From what I can tell, prom was like the tutorial to proper partying.
The only proper attire if you want to morph into a tiger and still be modest later on. 
Except our chocolate. Fuck our chocolate. 
OH SHIT HUGE ENCOUNTER. So I just took stair F1 up to floor 9 and found an unmarked door. Walked in and it had a dirty room with construction materials. Clearly not somewhere where guests are supposed to go. In there, there was an alarm locked door and a tiny unmarked side door with a lock. It was unlocked. I slowly opened the door and I shit you not there was nothing but a red ladder that led up to an office of some sort. I heard the rustling of papers and bolted. The first door slammed shut unfortunately. Currently hiding on floor 6 stair E. Should I pursue the office again? 
Me too minus the friends. Have discovered I hate people. 
That's a good point. High school has basically sucked, so I'm going to make a conscious effort to make what follows not suck. 
Meh, it was fun considering the young age. Maybe you just had "shitty" high school experience.
Thank you for your advice. What you (and all the internet strangers) don't know is that this wasn't the perfect relationship to begin with. This prom thing wasn't a big deal, but it just brought to light some of the larger issues in the relationship. Really, it was more of a red flag to me when she didn't care about all my secret agent stuff than when she ditched me in the first place. It's not something she did wrong, it's just indicative of a lack of chemistry I think. 
I hate to break it to you, but if she wasn't talking or dancing with other guys, it sounds like she was hoping to.Whether that's the case or not though, she sounds way less awesome than you. 
Haha I think he was a waste of a pick. I think Mettenberger is better right now, frankly. But who knows? Maybe he'll turn out to be a better Russell Wilson. I doubt it, though. 
Pursue immediately, Agent.  
It's a secret office! obtain secret data from the office :D!
You are remarkably well-grounded. You know who you are, are good at being yourself, and don't fault other's for not being someone they are not.   Pretty rare in life, but especially to find in a high school student.  You'll thrive in college and life with that attitude.  
Welp, in that case trust your gut and do what you think is best. You do you and all that motivational stuff.I just thought it's important to give you a contrary viewpoint for once, because I imagine a bunch of people telling you to end your relationship over petty shit can really get to you. In the end you need to be the one who's happy, that's all.
Not all girls are secretly thirsting after guys all the time. She wanted to dance with her girlfriends, and that's fine. She shouldn't have abandoned me, but that doesn't mean she wanted to be off with other guys. 
I bolted down all the way to the lobby. I popped out near the prom and scared the bejesus out of two guys when I popped out. Currently making my way back to floor 8... Will report soon about the red ladder room. 
you should get :D! on a t-shirt. really though.
Haha, reminds me of Denko and stupid f*cking hamster face!
Happy Birthday dude!You got Steam? I'll buy you a birthday game if you do.
Happy birthday! Here is a birthday poem composed for you by using the auto-fill feature on my iPhone (starting with "Happy Birthday" and picking a word offered each time):Happy Birthday! The fact I can see it as an excuse for the next few weeks of a good time with you guys should make it a lot of fun 
Happy birthday dude! The trick is expect nothing.
When I turned 30, I thought everyone would make a big deal about it. I woke up in the best mood. But instead, I got a bday text from my mom and spent the night at home alone with my 2 year old. To top it off, I found my first gray hair that day. One good thing about it though, for the five bdays following my 30th, I have expected nothing, so any gift or "happy bday" I receive is a great surprise!
Happy birthday /u/hawkeye1515 I hope you're day turns around for you!
What day is today? It's hawkeye1515 birthday! What a day for a birthday! Let's all have some caaake! Disclaimer: you have to imagine the cake and that we're all eating it together :D
Happy Birthday Mate! What was the game you were wanting? If you'll give me your steam I'll be happy to buy it for you:). Have a great day
Happy birthday!Aww, sorry to hear that! Turn it around and make it a priority to remember other's birthdays and make them feel special! Who do you know that has a birthday coming up?
I now buy myself the thing i want most. That way I'm never disappointed. Happy birthday amigo. 
Hey we have same birthdays! I also didn't get presents.
Happy Happy Happy Birthday!! (: If its any consolation, I didn't get anything from my family last year for Christmas. & It was my first Christmas after I moved away from home. I went to the bar and cried.  
Hawkeye fan? :D Iowa wrecking Northwestern! 
Happy Birthday, I can't speak for the people in your life or excuse them forgetting your birthday but sometimes things happen and people get wrapped up in their own lives. Try not to take it to heart, I have no doubt you are very much loved - in fact, expect extra attention once you've reminded them! Have a great day OP
I'm sorry the people in your life didn't remember your birthday.  That's harsh.  :(I think you should make (or buy) yourself one HELL of a birthday cake and share it with NO ONE!  Eat that whole damned thing yourself.  :)Happy birthday!
Aww :( happy birthday dude! If I could, I would buy you the game and be one if those internet avengers. I'm sorry!
Happy birthday bud, hopefully everything turned out to be better :)
What game was it you wanted?
This Friday is my birthday. Most people hate me, so I expect not many people to value it. You're not alone. 
Aww dude, that sucks... What game was it you wanted?
Happy birthday bud. My birthday was a few days ago but I'm in my mid-20s so it wasn't as special as it used to be, but it was still fun. Try not to worry about it; you've got plenty of time to surround yourself with people who will get excited about your birthday and look forward to spending it with you next year. :) 
Happy Birthday! I'm afraid I can't give you anything fancy but I can wish you a lovely day! 
Happy Birthday Stranger!
Happy birthday! I sorta feel your pain. My birthday is Christmas Eve. As such I get no gifts and people lump what the get me in with Christmas. On the other hand, there usually is good food and a party so I can pretend its mine :P you got a copy of terrairia? (Spelled wrong, oh well) If not, happy birthday!shoot me a pm and I'll change that :3
**Happy Birthday!**A few days ago it was my Birthday of which every year I dread and I wasn't expecting many Happy Birthday messages, maybe 2-3 but I woke up to lots of messages via card, text, whatsapp, skype and more which kept coming throughout the day... it made me feel so much better.A few of the messages meant so much to me because of the content and more specifically because of who sent the messages. They made me feel very special indeed.Hopefully you feel special, because you are. Fuck people who show no love to someone especially on their Birthday. Once again **Happy Birthday!**
I'm glad reddit is so generous, but honestly who cares if people don't get you presents? That's petty... count the blessings you do have, I'm sure your life could be worse and not getting birthday presents is so insigificant.
Found this thread from /r/bestof on the front page, didn't expect to find another /r/longboarding regular and their hedgehog!Reddit is a small world.
Very much appreciate the offer but its ok, get yourself a game and thanks alot!:)
Somehow I expected the photo to show twins.Beautiful though.
You don't happen to live in Arizona, do you? That looks like an AZ sunset.
I love your username and we could be best friends. 
I feel like there's a deeper meaning to this that I'm just not getting (ignoring the fact that it's random words)
Going to try it with SwiftKey...."Happy Birthday! I am going to sleep."
If you expect nothing you will never be disappointed. I've been following this motto since I was ten
What if you expect nothing, get nothing, and get depressed that you were right in expecting nothing?
I'm in my early 20's & I've already got a gray. :(I call it Gandalf.
I've complerely skipped gray hair. I have three white ones...shockingly white. I pluck them in a state of existential despair and wait for them to grow back.
Thanks alot!!!!!!!!! I saw your pm and replied earlier aswell :P. Also your pm seemed to had 4 games and you said 7? 
Wow! Thanks so much! You guys are too good!
Thanks! People here are so nice
thanks for the cake, it's so good xD
It was Super Smash bros for the 3ds :P and thanks alot!:)
Thanks! A friend of mine has a birthday real soon, I'll try make his birthday awesome
Mountain lion?
Hell yeah! 
Aww, I love you though!:D
3DS Super smash bros
I feel your pain. My birthday is on Christmas Day :(
Haha I have plenty of games believe me. PM your Steam name to me and I'll see what I can come up with. Can't have you presentless.
Still haven't seen anything about super smash being bought yet. Please pm me your email address and I'll send you an Amazon code for $50. Don't feel guilty, I took a brief survey to get it, least I could do is make someone else's birthday memorable!! 
Looks like Florida to me..lol
Pessimism is the new optimism
"Expectations are premeditated resentments." - Al Anon 
Yah plus, when you expect nothing, no one will get mad at you for forgetting their birthday. Honestly, I think the entire concept is stupid, but what ev..
If you except nothing you won't be depressed because you expected that. 
Nice name. I called mine "Bitch Ass Motherfucker". Surprisingly, no more have showed up since that day. But Bitch Ass Motherfucker seems to stick around...
29 and starting to get some grays! I see it as a sign that I need to move to a tropical beach area and quit worrying about day to day bullshit!
One of the keys has 3 games in it ;) (ops, I mean 6 games in total)Let me know if you were able to redeem them just fine.
A Hawkeye fan? :O I love Hawkeye
Hawkeye? Iowa?? go Hawks dude :)
Did you ever end up getting it? I have a 25$ gift card to amazon if you didn't end up buying it yourself. It's not the full game but it'd be much cheaper!
Pls op. Wishlist!
No, it's fine, really. Life deals people different hands, and this is the one I have played with all along. Some people have big parties, I appreciate another day.
You are awesome! The world needs more people like you :-)
Dude, you're a seriously rad guy.
So the question is, where did you take a brief survey that earns you a $50 Amazon gift card?
Well, at least it rhymes. 
Yup! It's kind of sad, but I feel like I'd rather go into a situation expecting the very worst and being surprised than hoping for the best and being disappointed.
yeah but that is depressing
Isn't it hair pigmentation primarily genetic? But yeah, I've had a pretty stressful couple of years recently so either one explains my little wizard.Just look at it as your body adjusting to how wise you are hahah
Was able to reedem them fine, thanks again! xD
I think that Hawkeye chick from Full Metal Alchemist is hot... does that count?
Green Arrow is far superiorNothing beats boxing glove arrow
Howdy from a neighbor across the river! See you guys on thanksgiving ;)
Haha well thank you :) that's really kind. 
Like every year :\
Haha, thanks! I'm glad you liked, enjoy your new games :)
Which games? Just curious! 
Shank 2, Super meat boy, braid, Lone Survivor, Binding of Isaac and Bastion
Bastion is so good.
Bastion is soooooooo good.
Thank you! I just woke up feeling a little down and negative. So it's nice of you to share something I don't have enough of right now :) Has anything cool happened to you lately or is it really impossible to tell where your good mood comes from?
Thank you. So far, it's been shit, but there's enough time for a nice change of pace! Staying optimistic.You go and have a nice day too, you hear
That's so nice of you! Thanks, yes I will have a nice day. That gave me that motivation I was needing for studying and jogging. Have an awesome and productive day too, see ya! 
Why thank you, my day hasn't been shit, but I always feel that it can be a little better anytime, anywhere.
Thanks! I have a lot of office work to complete + a professional exam to study for but can't seem to focus my energy into either. 
What if I'm not reading this?
well the weather is nice and I had a decent sleep so yeah today is pretty decent. thanks for the good day wishes and the same to you m8
Last night, the neighbors had a shouting match until 1am. Then my cat puked twice. I went to actual sleep at around 4am. I have a distinct feeling I'm going to be extremely grumpy today, so I graciously accept your positive energy and hope it works. 
**BREAKING NEWS** */U/Cailllech hopes people who doesn't read their post have a bad day!* 
Wow I wish I read this 12 hours ago maybe my day had gone better. 
Thanks, and you too! My day isn't that bad, working from home, the sun is our so I'm in the yard. All I need now is a nice cold Corona, but you know, work and beer don't mix (and it's only 12:38 pm over here).
Still have yet to sleep but I guess it is the same day. I stay up late and wake up late but thinking it should still be a pretty good day 
Thank you. It's been a good day, I started on my new job and it's going well so far :D What about you? 
One day I will feel happiness again. Iv forgotten how it feels for any years. I'm happy for you, and jealous.
Cheers buddy :) hope you had a nice day
Thanks Op.  My day is almost done, but I figure you'll be ok with me having a good late evening. 
Thank you, Sir/Madam /u/Cailllech!Many smashingly wonderous happies be returned upon your soul, too.SOrry, best prose I could do after a glass or three of wine.
Awww that was a nice thing to read!  I tossed and turned (again) last night so I gave up, got up at 5 and went for a walk. Such a good way to start the day and then reading that was even that much better. 
It's Thursday so I have my golf league for work, which means not only do I get to play golf but I get to leave work early to do it. Plus the weather looks like it's going to be perfect for golf so I'm looking forward to it, should be a good day over here for me!
"and if you're not reading this, well fuuuuuck *you*"
I once woke up like that and couldn't figured out why until I remembered I had taken Vicodin the night before post oral surgery
Thanks :D I have a first date today so I'm a little nervous, thanks for the positive energy tho friendo
Thank you! I'm attending a funeral today for a very lovely woman, so it's a sad day. But it will get better.I hope your day is going well!
My upvote on this post was my birth year. Niiiiiice.And thank you! I actually woke up feeling pretty down, this was a nice post to see on the front page of my favorite sub.
Thanks. One of the better days as of late. Finally made progress on my thesis yesterday and this fills me with determination.
Thanks! I just found out I have to be at a surgery center by 6:30am tomorrow for my lymph node biopsy so I really could use the good day today.
I'm having a dispute between eBay and Paypal. It is extremely frustrating. No one wants to actually fix it. Or explain to me why I've been blocked. 
Thank you !! It's my birthday and I'm having a good day too you just gave me amazing vibes 
This was such a pleasant surprise to come across while scrolling through my feed.  I hope you and everyone who reads this have a nice day as well. 
Yesterday my inconsiderate brother in law in Texas called my husband at 6 am and woke me up too. I don't get home until 9:30 every night. This morning the other brother in law's parole officer in Texas called at 5:15!!! Wtf!! I hate this family. 
Well I have to spend today cramming out a 3000 word essay. I should probably get started on that aye
You too! I've just finished my final-year uni project
I woke up feeling absolutely shitty (ofc my IBS flares up same day I have my University entry exams 300km away) and it's nice to hear someone else is having better day than I!
You. I like you. 
I just got back from a bad day at work, i accidentally broke the water pipe to my house and while rushing out i broke my car remote. No good day here
Thank you! Hopefully I will. So far so good to be honest, and I'm not usually the happiest on my birthday.
Thank you! I had a tooth pulled last night and I've been feeling pretty crappy all morning, but I hope that you feel great today!
I just started my 8 hour trip to Ohio for Colossal con. pretty good day so far.
Thanks! I hope this you wear this feeling for a long time!
I've been sick all night and woke up to this. This is delightful and made me smile, I hope your day is great as well!
[](/You are a wonderful person, and should be proud of yourself for helping others have a better day)
I feel kind of silly, but I need to see this today. Tragedy struck my family 2 days ago when my cousin was unexpectedly killed by a reckless driver. I have been drowning in a combination of sadness and blind rage. Just seeing this post made me smile, if only for a moment. Thank you, internet stranger. Maybe some of your positivity will pass on to me. 
Thanks! I just spent 11-4 AM vomiting, and I'm really hoping today gets better. I hope you have a good day too :)
You made me smile :)Romba nundri ( that's "many thanks" or "thank you", in Tamil).Hope you're continuing to have a super day!
Hey! I'm on the other side of the world and it's 10pm here. When I was on my way home, there were heaps of people heading down the stairs and from the corner of my eye I saw these two ladies cut into a man's way. Usually people would be really annoyed and scrunch up their face but this man, he smiled politely and let them go ahead. That made me smile :) positivity breeds positivity, so thank you so much for your positivity op! Hope you have a wonderful day! 
Thanks, buddy! I had a nasty fever dream, but this brightened my morning right up! I hope you have more good mornings like this one!
I needed this post today. Also had a nightmare last night complete with cold sweats in addition to having sinus problems, haha! Studying for the medical school admissions exam is dragging me down a bit. But you're right -- the only way out is THROUGH! And gratitude certainly helps. I can't forget that; it's also a journey and not a race!! Thank you for reminding me OP. Sending positivity your way as well :) 
Thank you. Ive been in a mood slump and it nice to hear someone say they hope i have a great dayI hope you have a wonderful day today too
"And if you're not reading this you can BURN IN HELL" - the thought that makes me smile.
Thank you, OP! You are a very nice and amazing person. I hope you have a nice day as well. :)
Thank you! I hope something random and wonderful happens to you this weekend.
Thanks. Wish I woke up with that energy. 
Thanks :) hope you have lots of happiness and love in your life
Thanks man, I really don't know how this day will go, I haven't slept since 3am yesterday and I have to work.
Hope you have a nice day too!
Thank you. I've been waking up with negative energy for the last few days, and I really hope I can shake it. I hope your day is great as well!
You too! Sadly I got woken up by loud music right outside my house at 5 this morning, which didn't get me in a good mood to start the day, but since then my day's been better and my mood has improved to match :) 
I wish I ever had a nice day, but chances of that happening anytime soon are rather slim
If you're reading this, I couldn't give any less of a shit about how your day is going. Frankly, I don't even really care whether you live through it, or not. 
HelloI had a nightmare last night and I woke up having a sinus lol and I woke up late.But I didn't want to ruin my day because of that and forget about my blessings so I just wanted to be happy. I also have lot of things to do today so if I'm not in good mood I won't be able to do them.
It will for sure. I woke up today sick and I had a nightmare but I didn't want to ruin my day because of that so I started my day by smiling. And I believe that if you smile for people, which is free of charge, you may change someone's day and make him happier
Best of luck Do not overthink about thatJust try your best. You can do it
Thank you 
Is your cat okay?
I hope all people have a great day
Everyday I try to wake up early cause I have lot of things to do but I've never been able to open my eyes lolNow it's noon and I'm still having my cup of tea (I've been holding it for 30 minutes)  
are you in an "odd" time zone or you just work nights?
I'm glad I made it better. I wish that can wake up early as you do
your work has a golf league?
Hahahahahahaha I like you
What Vicodin is?
HelloI'm sorry for my late replyHow was your date?I hope it went well!
Good luck tonight! What are your plans?
Reading your comment made me smile
Nice! What's your thesis on?
I hope you'll get well soon
You still blocked?
Send a wide text to your inlaws politely asking them to remember time zones and give them an easy way to think about it - for example, "subtract 3 hours from the current time. If it's before _AM, call us later". Be sure not to name names so nobody can get butthurt about it. :)
It's good to hear thatI'm happy for youWhat's next? What are you going to do?I'm still working on my final-year project 
Thank You 
Happy birthday! Do all the things that make you happy! Whether it's indulging in ice cream or just having a quiet day! Have a good one!
I wish you a happy birthdayIt's not about being the happiestYou can do something that make it special
OopsI'm sorry about your tooth 
Have a great trip out there
I hope you feel better now (8 hours later)
Hope you feel better soon! 
Hahahaha you made me smile
Thank you so much
Thank you so muchI hope you have lot of happiness and love in your life too
i have so much to do today, i'm in a fairly good mood, but still don't want to do anything :( any tips, OP? 
That's a pretty great attitude! It's pretty inspiring to me how some people (like you) can really turn bad things or annoyances into positivity like that :) I want to try that more often!
A sinus lol? Like a snort or something? ;) 
That's really positive of you :) Certainly look up to your actions and for the very few people that see this. I believe darker days exist so that the sun can shine brightly on others :) 
Thank you :) hope you had a great day. 
I was teasing :) it's been a while since you originally posted, how did your day end up going? 
Oh my gosh!  Just holding my morning pint of tea, which is lukewarm as it always takes an hour to drink it, lol!
I still have plenty of time to do most things just feels a bit better if I wake up a bit earlier but nothing too crazy. Sort of did wake up at 3 pm so I've only been awake for 12 hours or so. Also hoping that tea is still hot, I make mine in small amounts that I can drink right away.
In an odd one. Australia. 
5 is usually just when I get tired of trying to fall back asleep but I'm up at 6 every morning whether I want to be or not. My brain is just wired that way. 
Yep! And both my bosses are on it which is nice because I don't get any crap for leaving early 
it went well, thanks for asking :)
Thanks! we're gonna go get lunch and walk around a nice little village area and chat, theres a lot of cool little shops and stuff, I don't have any hard set plans other than where we're eating. but I do want to pet the cat at the bookstore
I wanna read out the contents of the L1 cache of ARM processors (specifically of an A53) to check whether certain properties that are of interest to a kernel hold at runtime.
Nope. I got it sorted. I had to go to the website rather than use the app and put in my PayPal details. Got a bunch of things listed and we shall see how they shake out. 
Just focus on summer projects and try and find some work experience before starting my masters (audio engineering).What's your final-year project on?
I hope you're having a good day!
Its okay! How was your day?
thanks! Just arrived. how is your day going so far?
Its been a general trend downwards lately. Aint your fault
It ended up very well, thank youActually I haven't done much, but the fact that I woke up with a positive energy and seeing that many people have responded in a positive way on my post made my dayI just woke up and it's a new day nowHow's yours going so far? 
Sounds like a great time, good luck!
I couldn't understand any word lol I feel stupid
It's about using fiber optic sensors for irrigation (agricultural engineering) All the best luck for you 
Yes it was a good day. Thank youIt's 2am now so it's a new dayI hope you had a good day too
Thanks for the good wishes, I think it's going to go well :) (its going to crash and burn now lmao)
Some computer stuff that will only interest other computer people, I guess ;)
Sadly I'm still at work. You stay up late!
No way! You got this! (Of course, you gotta report back after the fact now!)
I don't understand these stuffMy major is a way far from yours
it went well :D I'm a dummy and didn't go for the kiss though lol rip, I'll get it next time
What is your major?
Agricultural engineer 
Good luck 
Hey it's been about an hour, how'd it go?
How did the interaction go? What did you say to her?
Fantastic! What is your plan for the date?
I saw this was posted "1 hour ago", and got excited to see how it went. Congratulations. You two remember to have fun.
Fuck yes. What's the date? I had something similar happen recently. Fucking decade of flirting and now things are moving forward. 
On your date, there are 2 things you must do to win her over. First, comment on her shoes. Girls spend a lot of effort deciding what shoes to wear, in the hopes that someone will notice. When you do notice, it confirms her taste in fashion. And secondly, ask her about her father. Whether her relationship is good or bad with her father, it is a topic she will be passionate about, and she will confide in your genuine interest in her personal life.
Glad to hear it went well! What do you got planned?
Sounds like you're putting her on a pedestal. Be careful with that, it will never work out if you do..
Don't go past first base on the first date
So happy for you my man. Wish I had the balls.
What are you guys doing for your date?
Congradulations! What are your plans? 
Grats to you, dude.I'm wondering, how did you start talking to her?There's a cute girl in my class I've noticed the past few weeks, and I've noticed she's usually waiting for class to start around the same time I am. Just don't know how to start the conversation. I know the usual ask about the class stuff, but I can't make myself go say "Hi!" to her to open up the conversation.
Try not to be all weird on the actual date, just be normal.
Hey OP! How did it go?
What's his name?
Class is almost over, I'll update when I do it
Word for word: "Hey crush how was your spring break?""It was great luke, how was yours?""Pretty good. Hey I was wondering if you'd want to hang out sometime? Like not at school but maybe go do something fun?""What do you mean?""I'm asking you out, do you wanna go on a date sometime?"Pause, she started blushing"Yes"The rest I don't really remember I was too excited
I honestly have no clue. Probably bowling or mini golf or just dinner
I'm not sure yet, but someone on here suggested the zoo and that sounded perfect
"Nice shoes. Did your dad buy them?" Haha, cracked me up thinking of OP saying that. 
I'm not sure, but we've talked about hiking before. That's not really a 1st date idea (hey lemme take you out in the woods where nobody can hear you) but maybe down the line.
I always think long term with this stuff, even if I am only 20. Its just what I want. Thanks for this, hadn't considered it
Nothing yet. I forgot what happens after you get a yes hahaha
She actually came up and did the "Hi!" thing to me. I hadn't even noticed this girl until she did that and every day since that day we've talked more and more. It works, you just have to be relaxed about it. I know what it's like to talk to a girl you know very little about yet are completely infatuated with. Stop acting like you're defusing a bomb, and just relax. 
I think she likes who I am. I'll just be that
It went great. I'm not gonna make an update post, just because I'd rather not put our entire relationship out here but yeah it went well. 
>won't be able to try next year or any yearWhy not?
I'm the his, I asked out a her. 
Oh I was thinking it was the same girl, I was like, "DUDE GET THE HINT!" HAHA!I'm happy she said yes, what are you guys doing for the date?
You called her "crush" ... ballsy move ;) 
Ha ha! Fist-bump over IP to you!A smile and a blush is a good sign. My (pointless) advice: don't overthink it. Go without expectation.
For some reason every scenario i have in my head goes to eastern European accentNice one mate, yer giving me confidence for the future. You suggest anyway to get to know a crush better before making the first step?
Damn man you shouldn't have even stressed that took some stones to just drop it on her like that lol. It's that easy I guess.
Piece of advice, next time, don't ask. Instead of asking, "wondering if you'd want to hang out sometime?" just say, "Let's hang out sometime." Makes it less likely for her to say no. (because of the implication)
Mini golf is good. As long as you don't get easily frustrated that is, mini golf is hard  
Bowling is an awful date if you don't know each other well. You don't get to talk. When you sit down, she goes up, and vice versa, until it's over. Unless you both really like friendly competition! Plus butt-gazing, too, I guess.IMO bowling is a boring first date. Mini golf would be much more interactive!
That's actually a great idea. Just make sure to check out the weekly forecast and pick a day with nice weather. I don't know where you're from, but we're in the 90s this week.
I think it's a great idea, because of the implication...
I actually took my girlfriend on a hiking first date and specifically asked her if she was sure for this reason. She went with it and were together and not dead 1.5 years later :) 
Sure thing..Another thing..  Make sure you can fart in front of each other!! You need to have that level of comfort! That was also our first date.. tickle fights and fart contests..11 years since our first date. 
In a few months, she'll move from Germany to England, and I don't think I'll be able to see her again
Haha yeah I didn't word that one the best
I think he just substituted her name with "crush" and his with "luke" for anonymity's sake. 
Where's the RFC for FboIP
Depends where you know her from. Work or school, talk about work and school. Study together, or talk during a meal break. Small talk doesn't have to be awkward. You can find common interests over time. But make sure you ask her questions she would want to answer, it'll show her you care, because you do care after all. There isn't anything wrong with showing your feelings either. Don't go Ted Mosby and say you love her, but a genuine complement and a little flirting go a long way.
I tend to stress over these things more than the average person. Asking someone out means a lot to me, more than the average guy at least.
What implication?
Might actually be a good idea then to see if his crush can handle frustration lol. Good opening test. 
Thats a ballsy move, not sure if I'll do that first date haha
DUDE! Nice, I'm really happy for you. No greater feeling than hearing the "yes" after asking someone out. Do you know where you're going to take her yet?
Doesn't matter, you put yourself out there! That's the hardest part and now you've done it NINE times now. There will always be failures in the sense they may say no but the real failure would be not trying again. I will echo what others have said too. Don't over do it on the first date. Find somewhere nice and quiet where you can talk and get to know each other in a new sense. But overall well done and I wish you all the best! 
I think that he was joking 
You got balls. I'm 19 myself. 
School, same as you pretty much. I'm just dabbling, trying to find someone good. I did at one point but i fugged that up good
It's from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. 
I have no clue yet
Hey, rejection happens, all you can do is be like oh well and go for the next one.If you like a girl, just go for it. If she says no be thankful she didn't lead you on, if she says yes, you're one step closer.
I've done that too. She was the perfect package and I passed her up for a bitchy cheater with big boobs. But thats all in the past.Since you know her at school, try inviting her to study or work on homework together. It's a good excuse to have a conversation. And like I said before, don't be afraid to show her how you feel. People like being liked, and if she can guess you like her, it'll help out. 
Just trying to play along :/
If I could offer any advice, my general rule for first dates is don't make it a big, flashy thing. No movie. No elaborate, expensive thing. A first date is meant to talk and get to know one another better. For example, my first date with my wife was to a dessert restaurant where we split some cookies and ice cream, and talked over that. Cost about 5 bucks, if that, and lasted an hour or two. Keep it simple, and if/when more dates happen, then you can start branching out and up.Good luck, and congrats!
Take her to the zoo. It's casual, everyone loves animals, and you always have something new to talk about to help drive the conversation in a normal way without it being a Q&A session. Also, it will be daytime and if you really hit it off you will end up spending the entire day together without realizing it. TIP: Don't have too good of a time because then later when she breaks your heart you will never be able to go back there and every time you drive past it you will dream about breaking in, freeing the animals, and burning it down. :)
Never go to a movie. And dinner isn't the best choice either. Do something where u can talk and get to know each other. Coffee or smoothies are good,  arcades,  parks. 
Why is going to see a movie a bad idea?
Movie followed by dinner isn't terrible since you have the movie to discuss at dinner.
Yeah if she's worth caring about she won't judge you based off whether you can afford a fancy first date
... I think that's a rather sad way to look at. It shouldn't be a money spending contest, the girl isn't up for the highest bidder. It's about getting to know somebody properly.Now, I'm not saying that spending money on a date is a bad thing, but if someone complains that you're not spending enough on them you need to start evaluating their thoughts on you.
I feel like the purpose of a first date is to talk to your date and get to know one another. It's difficult to do that during a movie.Sure, you can watch a movie and chat after, if that's what you or your date enjoys. I'm sure some people would love that. So maybe it's not necessarily a bad idea, I just don't think it's the best idea when there are other options that are more personable (and less expensive).I say save the movie for later. Get some ice cream or drinks and get to know one another for a bit.
Aww, tell her I said hi!
That's cool.Can I be the trouble maker?It would be great if you could tell your mom about your one friend that is always up to shenanigans.I will try harder to give you something to talk to her about. 
...Well? Are we?!
I told my mom about the whole Dogecar thing because she follows NASCAR a little bit, she thought it was really neat.
What do you mean by "she thinks"? I AM YOUR BEST *internet* FRIEND. Anyways, Hi, I'm Chriswiss. I like movies , soccer and butts.
Oh, boy. Don't tell her all the jokes that your friends on the internet make about her, especially not the ones that involve you breaking your arm.
G'day internet strangers mum! I'll be your mate! Can I be the crazy Aussie mate? 
Tell her we said Happy Mothers day this Sunday if your in the states
I like to think she's right :)I now feel pressure tho to say interesting things to give your mom something to hear about!
I recently started getting involved on casual conversation, it's easily one of my favorite subreddits now. I haven't yet, but I feel that soon I will probably make some awesome internet friends
Yay that means I have a friend!
Update: My mom says thanks for all the kind words :)I showed her every one of these comments and she was laughing and smiling at all of theThank you everyone for a fantastic impromptu start to Mother's Day weekend haha :)
Haha aww. Hey I'll be your internet friend. Here's an internet friend cookie (::)
Hey I'm not your friend, pal
I wanna be the stupid sexy friend! 
Friends buy friends gold.
hi from south Africa.
Hi from Texas 
I will when I wake up! she is in bed right now as am I, I just woke up randomly and wanted to put my words into text.
Hi from Alberta, Canada!
Hi from Ypsilanti, Michigan!
Hi from Santiago, Chile! :)
Hi from Switzerland :)
Trouble makers don't ask permission to be bad. They just do it.
I'll be the tough guy who secretly has a heart of gold!
Or we can talk about the kid Unidan Dan, he was caught cheating so we *murdered him*
WHAT ARE WE TO YOU OP???
We are :) I love OP.
Your friends came together to race in nascar? That's great! I'll make some sandwiches, I'm sure they're hungry after all that fun. Have I met the driver friend before? You should bring them over! 
and I'm Soli, I love ice creams, video games, and boobs.
I'll be that one bloke where the family is sizzlin some snags and I come by  and hav em uninvited. Everybody knows that one bloke
Hey there /u/porridgemonster, could we have some free porridge? :)
I'm the Nana friend !*Nana internet hug*
Tell her i said hi too! Actually "Hi tatertot255's mom!" 
You should make a card for her with our usernames on it!
Tell her I said Hi from Los Angeles! 
Hi from NJ!
Hi from beautiful New Jersey

He's a polite trouble maker. How dare you?
Oh, we have someone just like that at our school. Tough drummer guy at first, but when you get to know him he's the nicest guy you will ever meet.
ooh! Can I be the creepy one?! :D
Love? I guess it's a bit more than friends haha
Husband and I are more into Formula 1 but he does have a Jeep and goes off-roading with our sons, grandson and friends. If you want to come along - bring your Mom of course - he would love to show you a day of mud, water, rocks and Jeep parts (that fall off) :) That's his favorite thing to do with friends :)
and I'm Marm, I love pizza, buffy and butts.
Oh yeah. All good though mate, I'll throw some extra snags on for you ;)
*Awkward hot internet hug* :D
I'll tell her for you
You don't want my username on it
Beautiful day we're having in NJ, isn't it?
Ya know, I was surprised at how beautiful NJ actually is.  It has an unfair reputation!  
Likewise, hello from NJ, albeit very rainy!
If we wait a few more minutes it should be snowy Minnesota 
NC Chapel Hill/Raleigh, woot woot!
Make that two howdys, pardner!
Fellow New Yorker also saying hi
Hi there neighbor!  Plano here :)
What can I say? I'm a little stinker.
Can't you love your friends? I do.
Haha I love you haha :)
I want this to happen. 
Hi marm I'm matt, I like pizza, burgers and porn
All of those things are the best things! 
You're a top bloke
Awww --- *takes in awkward hug with gratitude*
I'm sure she'd find it weird. Nobody has an Arabic numeral in their names. 
Looks at username *oh dear!*
Idk about your mom, but my mom would think your user name is great. Cherries are her favorite berries. She doesn't really think about double entendres.
That's because most people that have been in NJ only briefly usually pass through the areas near NYC, which are very industrial, swampy and overall ugly. Not too beautiful today, though... cold and rainy
We do this to keep everyone else away. Now you've gone and ruined it.
Had a tour of TCNJ today. Rain was definitely there.
I'm not sure what you mean, my inbox is fine
Nah, it's 88 in Minneapolis today.
Greenville, Arrrgh!!!
Nice to meet ya man! Actually in Denton, but I felt Dallas is alot more recognizable.
Is your username a Comedy Bang Bang reference by any chance?!
I think that person might be having a stroke.
Would be fun! :)
I'm Jay, I love Game of Thrones, Burgers and women in riding gear. *Don't judge me.*
Then you are a person with good taste!
Guys, english please. What are snags?
How's your day going so far?
Mine would be fine! 
... I mean, NJ sucks.  "Garden State" my ass.  More like "Garbage State", amiright?
still NC, give me a high five! 
Winchester, old boy! Nice and sunny, what?
Of course! I'm actually listening right now.
That's not friendly at all! :)
Where are the fun old people in my area?
I'm Limbo, I love Silicon Valley, Chicken and women with intelligence. *Don't judge me either*.
Best season? Best toppings?BEST BUTT?important information, let's be real
Sausages. Or sensitive new age guys I guess but they don't get put on the barbie generally.
Are you a Seppo?
Terrific thank you! The weather is beautiful - blue skies and sunny and in the 60's. Getting some chores done but taking time to fun outside every now and then for a blast of sunshine! Checking in with reddit now and then too of course :)
Bolton/Delco/Reigelwood here!
Sunny and warm and should be for the next few days..
Portsmouth checking in!
It was just a joke :D
I'm Pan, I love Community, Sushi and nerds :)
I can never decide between 2 3 or 5, they're all too good! I might be a bit of a heathen for this, but BBQ sauce instead of marinara with double cheese and donate meat with pepperoni and mushrooms. Best butt would have to be that Pantera chicken who did the amazing twerking video.Same questions back at ya!
No. At least I don't think so. I'm from the other Australia. The one with the mountains, you know.
It's a nice day today, too. Really beautiful day today
Oh how pretty!  This is similar to the style I want to paint on my bedroom wall. 
wow never heard of those
/r/Portsmouth
I know ya silly rabbit. I was joking backatcha! :) *wink*
I'm Yun, I love video games, cartoons and butts.
And the Hobbits? 
North of Southport, west of Wilmington, east of Whiteville, south of Smithfield
Oh, silly me, haha
I'm Dea I like drugs and music :)
I may regret this...What do you mean by weird nasty porn?
Not *that* one. The one with the similar name, not the similar flag.
This is adorable! But you've got me glancing over at my husband -fifteen years of him opening doors for me- I wonder what I almost broke?  
It's a win win. She get's the door opened for her and you get to look chivalrous and not have the window get messed up. 
That shit's outta a Disney princess movie or some shit. Beautiful man :V Also that's kinda hilarious.
I love this story! It's really true, though, opening the car door for them has always really impressed my girlfriends.
Ed3times, I know how you feel. My pint sized girlfriend slams my 2001 Forrester's doors so hard. I swear she gathers more energy for door closing than any other activity. 
I hate when people, wives, co-workers whatever slam the doors of nice Japanese cars. I think they're so used to their shitty American heavy car doors. I once left a girl at a shop after I gave her a ride, she slammed my door so hard!
So do you still have the forester?
Hey that's the exact same car as I have! Same color as the picture too. I'll have to start doing that on dates to save my windows. 
FYI... 6th top post in /r/CC history :)
Good for you, and peeps should do whatever they're into but personally the whole "opening a car door for a woman" is, imho, the kind of neurosis that fucks shit up in society. Unless you happen to be "playing princess" this behavior is stone aged. 
you gotta ask now and let us know
When my wife and I were dating,  I would get the door for her then walk around the car and rip a fart I had been holding. 
You've got a nice butt.
I count three wins here.
That is literally what OP said... Why was it upvoted over 400 times?
A dirty non presser..
I was thinking more Seinfeld or Curb Your Enthusiasm 
i know a dude who goes by ezra online, are you him?
OK, your name and tag. Are they references to anything in particular?  
Oh wow - I bought a used car 1 1/2 years ago.  It is a nice car but i never knew why is is all scratched up near the door handle!  I bet it is from the previous owners wedding ring or rings his ex-wife used to wear!  Thank you for solving this mystery for me!  I had my old car for 14 1/2 years and there were no scratches near the door handle at all!
body shops hate him!seriously though, long fingernails ruin the paint too.
Dude stop throwing your money around like that, you're making the rest of us look bad.
Is she Italian? I bet she's Italian.
That was traded in, but I have a 2013 Subaru Legacy now.  I'm kind of hooked on Subaru, they've never let me down.
Ha! Turns out he's really a gentleman (whew!). He thinks OP's a genius though! 
Win win win, we all win
Better than a 59s er
No, no. Larry would just complain to her.
No o_o" Unless this guy lives in New Mexico...
I just like the name Ezra and wish it was mine. My tag though is from Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, a fantasticle anime.
I also usually have very long fingernails with all my rings ....
Why does the Forester gets the lesbian puns while the the BMW 3 series, the #1 car for gay men, only get the douchebag stereotype?
Lol they are definitely not much more known for things like that.  Car enthusiasts are a minority.
As am I. Currently have an Impreza and a Forester. Never going back from AWD.
Didn't  they get rid of the frameless doors?
He's totally just telling you that to look like a good person, there must be something he's hiding.
Ah yes, option number 5.
How the hay do you know that?
haha no, not only does he not live in new mexico, but if you were him you'd recognise my name anyway :P im not sure why i mentioned it now it seemed relevent at the time... i blame vodka.
I actually just started watching Gurren Lagann, the name caught me off guard, I watched a movie based off of space pirate captain harlock (70's anime) and the antagonist was named Ezra. That sounds a lot more convoluted typed out, wow
Did you just make that from that other guys image?
I have yet to see a lesbian subaru owner. I see sport modded subaru all the time. So.... 
I've never been able to test it out myself, but I've heard from at least two people that AWD doesn't do very  well in the snow. Seems counter intuitive to me but since I don't really have the experience to know if they were right or not, what's your opinion? 
They did, unfortunately.  
Yeah, reddit agrees. Delete facebook, lawyer up, and hit the gym. Your marriage is OVER. 
Good work everybody!
I love the flair. Bwahaha
this flair colors r from the button?
Just looked through your comments to see if you posted on /r/thebutton and found a comment where you did and went to it.
Vodka's always good. Rum is even better ;3
>i blame vodka.Don't we all
I believe i have watched the same movie. :3 Gurren Lagann is fuckin' amazing. YOUR DRILL WILL BE THE DRILL THAT PIERCES THE HEAVENS!!!
No, it's just a popular image that someone made for a default Sub and it's spread from there.
the whole point of awd is to be great in the snow. and the rain. and loose dirt or mud. basically all slippery road conditions. i drive a subaru in new england and have never had trouble in any of those conditions.
I think what they mean is that it doesn't do any better when compared to a 2WD in the snow. AWD is a better for preventing wheel spin when starting off from a stop, and preventing getting stuck in thicker snow, but when it comes to stopping it's that same as any other vehicle because you are no longer transmitting power to all four wheels. A lot of people like to claim AWD is much safer in snow, but the advantages are fairly minimal. In plain old rainy conditions however, AWD is definitely superior.
Standard reddit advice 
You have been made a mod of /r/relationships 
Reddit solved another problem? Like that time we caught terrorists!
Haha whoa someone got it?!
No, you just pick your color. The flair colors from the button are in /r/thebutton
Oh...So this is a safe space where we can talk without worrying about colour :)
I'm a whiskey girl myself. Jack honey please! 
I love it, on Netflix it did something weird though. The first episode was the Japanese dub and every episode past that has been English dub. It's odd
Everybody to the limit, the Cheat is to the limit!
do they have a meaning?
Yup. Color doesn't matter here. People can be any color they want.
I used to drink exclusively whiskey until a few years back when I almost destroyed myself with it. God I miss whiskey =D
But honey jack is technically not whiskey :p
Everybody come on fhqwhgads!
Also, thank you for getting that stuck in my head =)
Yay, equality!:)
:D ^:D ^^:) ^^^:|
Ezra brooks?
It's still delicious though. Haha. I'll take "real" straight whiskey as well though, I just like the sweet burn of honey whiskey. 
Don't knowWho it isBut it's probably fhqwhgads
Same here, but no regrets.
So why do you eat lipsticks and lube?
It is delicious, sorry I didn't mean for the comment to be dickish at all lol, its an inside joke with my friends to point out its not really whiskey after anyone talks about honey jack or evan williams honey cause of an all out argument we had about it back before. But sometimes I forget I'm not talking to my friends lol
Honestly, YouTube really f-d up when they picked that name for their paid service. They should have known it was too similar to the porn site. 
Reminds me of the time I told a co-worker who was wondering where I'd gotten a sweatshirt I was wearing that he could get it from dicks.com.  Turns out it's dickssportinggoods.com.  That first one was definitely not the place to go to shop for a sweatshirt.
Thats a real gem, I wish i had similarly entertaining stories but this one takes the cake.
My Canadian boss mentioned that in his homeland, milk is packaged in bags. Curious, I google image searched "milk bags". The results weren't quite SFW.
I sold cell phones a few years ago. Sold an elderly customer a basic flip phone. He came back 5 minutes later saying it's broke because there is no dial tone.Another elderly costumer comes I and starts looking at phones. I start showing him the new touch screen phones and he cuts me off to tell me that he doesn't want a touch screen phone. He said the last thing I touched, I married.
The first time I saw a porn site was in 5th grade at school. We were doing research projects on presidents. A girl goes to whitehouse.com and my teacher immediately freaks out and tries to block the web content with her palms.
My poor mom did the same thing a few days ago. I've never seen her face turn from so calm to utter disgust in such a short period of time
During a summer camp I worked at, I overheard a 10 year old boy telling this innocent kid there, "Dude you know that premium YouTube without ads? YouTube Red? Just type in redtube.com and you can get it for free, no joke."So savage for only 10 years old jeez lol that poor child had no idea he was getting messed with.
Older people? Technology?  My parents.. they shouldn't be anywhere near a computer because they'll mess up something that they assume i know how to fix..
Whenever I see those Redbox things for renting DVDs I always get confused with Redtube. Redbox sounds like a pornsite name too. Is there another Pornsite called something-box? I just always double-take when I see those Redbox vending machines, like, are people really that open about renting porno DVDs?
Reminds me of late 90s mom wants to search for something online. Limited search engines back in the day found that hotbot.com worked well for me. Tell her to go on hotbot she types in hotbut and you can guess from here.
I would still rather pay for redtube and I am adamantly against paying for porn 
One time when I was in college and working at the local parks and recreation center for the summer, I left my laptop on my desk to go help my boss with something and when I came back one of my coworkers, who was an older 50-something woman who hated me from the moment she saw me, said, "you left your VIDEO GAMES running on your computer!"She was referring to my screen saver.
My mom did this while looking for tickets to the Broadway musical Wicked. She typed in wicked.com and learned that that's an adult film production company. 
"It's monster.com, Michael, no 's'."
When i got a new t.v. for my mom, she is still finding the button to change the aspect ratio of the t.v. and calls me to push the button to fix it.
I just realized... I might actually indicate to that poor woman that I know what Redtube is in that scenario!I'd want to crawl in a hole if I said *anything* other than "Red-what? You mean YouTube Red?" But I know my reaction would be a very telling laugh.
An anecdotal story I heard about the interwebs is about an ol' granny that assumed "LOL" stood for "Lots of Love" (instead of "Laugh out Loud"). So during one email she wrote.> Dear Janice, I'm so sorry to hear that your son was killed in an auto accident. **LOL** -Mabel.
I would really like YouTube red, but the fee for it is pretty ridiculous last time I checked. $10/month for YouTube? And it won't even play minimized on my phone like firefox will. I don't see anything there worth the price, even if the ads are annoying.
Not the same but similar, we were at the checkout line at the grocery and my wife (looking over at the Redbox) says loudly, "oh we should do a Redtube tonight!". I just stared at her blankly waiting for her to realize what she said while the cashier started blushing a bit. Of course she was totally oblivious.
On those nights where I stay late and miss the last opportunity to get home via public transportation, one of older coworkers always asks me if I plan on taking a "yuber" to get home. Another one calls it "hoover."Baby boomers are adawwwwrable. 
Can you just use "sans"?Can i have the enchiladas sans sour creme? yeah im eating with sans meat. 
I bet this isn't true
Yeah, I don't know if they weren't aware or what, it isn't like YouTube has any knowledge of Google /s
Even if they didn't know about the porn site (which I highly doubt), red has a long history of being associated with sexual content - as in, 'red band' trailers for movies, and 'red light districts' in cities.
Yeah when I first heard Youtube was coming out with a new service called "Youtube Red" my first thought was that they had bought out Redtube, and were getting into the porn streaming game.
Wait, the porn site came first?!
oh yes, and the classic whitehouse.com
dicks.com goes to dickssportinggoods.comhow long ago was this?
Maybe it used to, but it looks like Dick's Sporting Goods must have bought up the url for www.dicks.com
One time at work, one of my co-workers was looking at a new softball bat on dick's website for the company league. I couldn't help myself and started  saying (quite loudly) "DENNIS, WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT DICKS? YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE LOOKING AT DICKS ONLINE AT WORK"
Try: "3L Milk Bags in Ontario"That worked to show the actual product -- I even tested with unsafe search.
Magic Actions for YouTube has this and a lot of other useful features. I haven't used YouTube in white for years and it's much better on the eyes.
or if you're gonna stick with ASCII use != (or <> if you're one of *those* people)
On my Galaxy. Couldn't find it, was too lazy to google it. Thanks though
You spend a lot of time on the facebook, so I know you know a lot about computers....
Redbox sounds like a very specialised porn site (I'm assuming shark week porn is a thing).
RedBox has been around longer I think. I wish people were though.
It didn't help that your screensaver was a game of Ms Pacman
The problem is, if you show them, and they have trouble grasping those things they'll just end up doing more damage in the long run.
you should be able to run YouTube in the background with Red. also it comes with play music, (basically the same as Spotify premium). I think it's a pretty good deal
$10 seems to be pretty standard though. I wonder when google will kill it. They seem to only kill projects I love though. RIP Google Reader
So did you Redtube with her that night? If so... Link?
Yeah with their Racism, Xenophobia, Sexism and ruining out economy and blaming us! No they are adorable though
>yuberMy roommate calls it this. He also calls udon noodles "yudon."
They had to have known, personally I think it was a way to get back at them. But it was probably not the best decision at all for YouTube
They could have at least binged it.
None of them have ever watched porn, either. I guarantee it. /s
Google owns youtube. 
I remember being in the 3rd grade during our computers class. Teacher writes "whitehouse.com" on the board, and that was my first exposure to porn.
How has the government not just taken every domain name that could possibly have any similarities with the actual whitehouse.gov ?
I'd guess it was about 5-6yrs ago. Good to see it's changed now.
Why is it always Dennis, too? lol
Install her Ubuntu. And/or uBlock Origin.
Sadly, this only works with the US keyboard.
You are a programmer, so you probably know how to install pirated windows 10 on this laptop from the 90s.
That kind of porn is a thing and there's even a subreddit for it if you know where to look. You... PROBABLY don't want to though >_> 
Oh I haven't looked into the music.It's just that I already pay for netflix, spotify, and a few other services. I know everyone wants their own cut but I can't really justify it for YouTube.If their service is better than spotify I'll consider swapping the two tho.
Do you like Allo? Because it is probably next on the chopping block.
Look on the bright side. Most of them rant way more than they do things.
Cringers at full power, Mr. Sulu.
Get back at google or get back at redtube???  What did redtube do to google or whh would youtube want to get back at its parent company?
Well Bing is better for looking up porn.
No no, what sort of self respecting programmer watches smut?!?!?!?
Why did the teacher write that on the board?
This was 20 years ago
My biggest thing is my mom not learning. My brother will act all annoyed anytime she asks him how to do something on her phone because it's "so easy." I know she hasn't grown up with this stuff and it's not as intuitive to her. When she asks me how to do something I patiently show her step by step on how to do it and why to do things that way. Half the time I look up and she's distracted by the TV. The other half I think she gets it. Then next time I see her she asks me how to do something and when I explain it to her she acts like she didn't even know it was possible. Frustrating. 
Is this due to ALT_GR being more common/already in use on other layouts? RIGHT_ALT was mostly just a duplicate key on most modern systems using en_us keyboards.Or is it simply missing support, which could likely be resolved?
If you don't you're not a very good programmer obviously. Why did you even go to college?
Wait do people use Allo? I only use it so the assistant will send me poems three times a day
Well that sucks
But most of them vote. Which wouldn't be a problem, but younger people don't.So an  easy election victory is to ignore the young, focus on the people who actually vote.
>Mr. SyulyuFTFY
I think the other poster means get back at RedTube. Not that they did anything wrong, but maybe YouTube feels "well, **we** did the whole ___tube thing FIRST." Like a territorial dispute?
And it doesn't steer you away from the really weird parts of YouTube, either.
Assume much, do you? I know how to do it (if the device meets the requirements), I just hate doing it and I am tired of people who expect I will do free service for them. So chill out.I went to college (well, university of technology) to be a programmer not a tech assistant. And I have put that example because most programmers know the pain. "You work with computers? Oh, then fix that shitty full of malware computer of mine for free because this is what you do, isn't it?"
I do love me some weird YouTube but sometimes it's like hunting for unicorns. You just gotta let it come to you 
I think it's funny that you have to clarify that some tube sites aren't even pornographic! 
r/deepintoyoutube is the place for that.
There are websites without porn on them? 
/r/AskReddit is set to private WHAT IS HAPPENING
Instead of looking at it like *Reddit* is imploding, realize that most of the defaults are modded by the same group of people.*That* group is protesting and it should be interesting to see the response.
/r/OutOfTheLoop? Do they have anything on it?
please don't leave us /r/CasualConversation mods 
I just noticed /r/gaming has gone private too, which is weird. Probably in solidarity?
/r/Art has just gone dark!
shit, I eat dinner, and shoot for an hour, and reddit has imploded... I could never quite get the hang of Thursdays 
As much as we would love going dark(not making a stance, just for the sheer irony of it) /r/Casualconversation will not be going dark. 
now /r/AskReddit is going private.
Maybe the government is finally doing something about the economy. I mean if there was no Reddit, then thousands of people might become so bored they actually decide to get jobs. 
Small note, /r/circlejerk was private for about a week before this. I'm not 100% on why though, something about summer vacation I think? Or maybe updating the subreddit? Either way, it's not as a result of Victoria being fired.
Alongside that you have the deletion of several contreversial subs, which seemed to rock the boat. Someone created a new reddit substitute which promptly had the ISP shut things down due to hate speech. All of a sudden redditors seemed to get a little *angrier*.I dunno, I remember when I started redditing people were complaining about how post-digg reddit sucked, but **man** this I feel like the content has just gotten a lot more agressive and angsty.There's also the whole astro-turfing debacle that happened a while back. It's like the nature of the site's been changed.
My god, the prophecies were true!Seriously though. WTF is happening, is this really the end? And what will we do after Reddit ends? 
Don't leave me /r/CasualConversation. ;-;
Woah I didn't even realise! Get out your popcorn, shit's about to go down.
NOT /R/FALLOUT. THAT WAS MY HOME.
This has all happened before and it will happen again. There is constant subreddit drama but you just normally don't see it until it is a popular sub. The storm will calm and everything will be business as usual. 
Shit I didn't even notice that. I wonder why Victoria got fired? As far as I could tell she always did a good job.
I propose to follow in the way of our friends of 4chan, who when moot sold out, made a great exodus, across the internet to the place known as 8chan, the land of the Based Lord Hotwheels, where they reside to this day. I now say to you, casual conversers, that we make an exodus of our own! To 8ch.net/kind/!
Wow...it feels like reddit is larger than I ever expected it to be....this strike is something I never expected to see on internet.Meanwhile, today I got banned from offmychest for being subscribed to another subreddit. WTF?!
can someone explain to me what the effects are of a subreddit going private?
I think reddit needs a new CEO, and ultimately a new set of admins. They need to all be on the same page, and more importantly they need to agree upon the future of reddit. 
I'M FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW!!!! WHAT WILL WE DO WITHOUT OUR GLORIOUS SUBREDDITS?!?! /r/CasualConversation mods, NEVER BETRAY US LIKE THEY DID!!!!
As a user, all I'm inclined to do is not visit Reddit anymore :/ I get this is "solidarity" or whatever but this move is going to inevitably drive users away 
If reddit collapses I need someone to explain to me how tumblr works.
If being a mod is that miserable, just quit. This just seems like a power trip from the mods to me.
Does anyone else not really care about the Victoria situation? She had an important job and seemed to be good at what she did but I'm sure she didn't get fired for no reason. 
Internal drama on a large social media website.  I've never seen that happen before.
/r/law /r/art /r/CrappyDesign and /r/Spain are also Private and submissions to /r/listentothis are restricted.
TIL reddit is full of drama queens.
As bad as this is, if we really wanted to get Victoria re-employed /r/gonewild should bite the bullet as wellIMAGINE THE CHAOS
Oh shit.Is this The End? This feels like The End. Christ, I never thought I'd be here to witness the Reddpocalypse happen as it unfolds O_O
"As a statment on the treatment of moderators by Reddit administrators, as well as a lack of communication and proper moderation tools, /r/AskReddit has decided to go private for the time being. Please see this post in /r/ideasforaskreddit for more discussion."
I'm scared. Somebody hold me please
Victoria who helped out with the AMAs was fired without any notice to the mods. Apparently this is a huge problem because of how integral she is to the organization of these events. 
What does gone private mean?
Will your gaming forum still be open?    *senpai don't kill me*
That group holds vast amounts of influence and is the cause of a substantial amount of traffic on this website. They could very well cause the rest of Reddit to collapse if they keep this up.
There's like 250~ default mods (800+ if you count all the mods on /r/askscience) It's hard to call them the same group when many of them don't get along...at all.
I agree, but with the bias that I never thought much of the mods of those subs in the first place. I feel like some of their power got taken from them and they don't like that they didn't make the decision so now they're going to try and win their power back. Like I said though, I never liked them, so I've got an automatic negative view of the situation. 
> That group is protestingYeah, the nerd cabal that runs most of the defaults. Everyone normally rips on them and hates them for their censorship and inconsistency, now all of a sudden the entire website is on their side. It's so fucked up lol.
If /r/OutOfTheLoop becomes private we're all doomed. 
I will never do that to you <3
This is our chance to get on the top!
Terribly sorry, I'm afraid I represent the new wave of Reddit with our weird clothes and shitty music. :PI do hope things go back to normal... but from what I understand, especially for /r/IAmA, recovering from this is a pretty herculean task. It seems like they were (to be a little bit unkind) somewhat *too* reliant on a single individual to keep a subreddit of millions running.
Oh no. How ever will I be able to look at gaming memes and GTA gifs?
Plz don't leave us ;_;Seriously though, all this shutting down of subreddits means that its actually *harder* for people to get the relevant information. As a means of protest, I kind of feel like its somewhat self-defeating in some sense, as nobody can see *why* they've shut themselves down.
May I ask how the mods have arrived at that decision?
Jebus Christ, I was looking at that subreddit like half an hour ago!
Conspiracy theory right there. I like it.Wait, I mean, I don't like Reddit going dark.
Yeah, I was gonna say that. They're on /r/summervacation .But yeah, bit bad, innit?
Voat was created long before its ISP shut them down, and they got shut down because they use servers based in Germany 
.....4CHAN.*cries*
I promise I can't do that to you guys.
I think /r/History is the alternative to /r/AskHistorians, not the other way round. The latter is tightly moderated, and they don't tolerate shinnenigans there.Of course, I'm subbed there, so that's just my biases talking...
Yeah, I love Reddit and all, but my spidey senses detect a mass migration is a-comin'.I just hope I get the note that we're all leaving when it happens! How can one tell when its happening??
I dunno, I've seen shitstorms on Reddit before but they've always been just people complaining about admin actions... This on the other hand? /r/IAmA was one of the key components of the Reddit community as a whole. With that gone, and apparently with the likelihood of it being unable to recover? This feels far more serious than the usual controversies. 
Some rumors say that all reddit employees had to relocate to the Bay Area, and Victoria might not have wanted to move from NYC, which is a possibility.
I hate to sound discriminatory, but I'd really rather not associate with Channers. xD Redditors at least can have a decent, mature conversation on the odd ocassion :P
I disagree. I don't think we should seriously consider suggestions from food that discriminates based on race.
I think that's the whole point. "Make the changes we want, or kiss your user base (and profits) good bye".Of course, it can backfire - for example, admins can simply fire the current mods, and put newer, more compliant ones. So.. meh. I don't really involve myself with this sort of politics.
You... only *just* learnt this?
Do we even know why she was fired? Perhaps until we get the details of her termination we should shut up. She could have been fired for something like sexual harassment which would be immediate.
I'm too young for Reddit to die! I haven't even had my first cakeday yet!
This is the end....bum bum bum....
Repent for the end is neigh! Dogs and cats posting together, MASS HYSTERIA!
In remaining optimist, if we survive until the aftermath of the Reddpocalypse we'll at the least be the witness of a massive boost in world productivity
Lol Reddit has "ended" like 20 times. Don't worry about it. Everyone will forget it in a few days.
If worse comes to worst, we can always turn our computers off and go outside :-D
Everyone is asking so many questions, but we can't get answers!
It's not the end, just the beginning. Voat.co is my new home. It's pretty awesome at the moment.
I don't like this at all, but I'm very impressed at the solidarity of reddit's mods at the same time
*hug*I don't want this website to end. Not like this. ;_;
Okay but mods are just regular old reddit users who get a few controls over a subreddit. You can go make one yourself right nowThe admins have zero obligation to involve them with their internal staffing affairs. That would be a nightmare for HRLike or hate the admins, this situation is really dumb. 
&#3232;_&#3232;
We will all be set **FREEEEEEEE!**
Well, I don't know they are the *cause* of the traffic. Redditors as a potential market are the cause of the traffic.
Not necessarily. The admins have full control over all subreddits so they can make everything public again and shadowban the mods if they wanted. 
Admins choose the defaults.
True. But although all animals are equal, some are more equal than others.
It will be interesting to watch.
Go figure.
<3 ilu Tiz.Now to hide from /u/sayyaygirl
Why not if I may ask?
we shall rise and take over all of reddit 
Hahaha, I agree. I usually don't look at that subreddit, but there was a gif with an Oculus and a horror game which I wanted to link to someone
I know you joke, but I actually used that subreddit quite a lot :\Its also possible that other default subreddits will follow suit and shut down as well. If too many more major subreddits shut down, there won't be much of a website left for Redditors to visit and people will start looking for alternatives. I sure know I'm thinking about it.
haha right? It'll probably blow over because there isn't any website to replace this one. I have an idea of a better reddit, but not the skills nor resources to make one.
The main thing is that the admins know, its more of a mod-admin protest then a user-mod-admin protest. I don't 100% agree with what they are doing, but I completely understand why they are doing it. 
For starters, it goes against one of our primary rules(don't take things too seriously/partaking in a protest isn't casual). And casual conversation isn't big enough to make a significant impact in the protest. While we are not all contented with how the communications are with mods to admins, it wouldn't be fair to take away a place that has no bearing in the dispute. A fair number of the mods have had subs they mod go private as a form of protest, I myself have had two. Naturally, these subs have more of a claim to the protest then we do. 
Its the end times!!!!!!!!!
Pls no, anything but 4chan :'(
do you have a different suggestion?I'm not making claims about moderation, I was just listing similar subreddits to the ones that are set to private. 
Well, theres voat, but that's mostly filled with all the people butthurt over the fph scandal. Not exactly the best of the old reddit community. 
No single person, anywhere, is irreplaceable. Reddit let an employee go. another will take her place. The world will continue to turn. 
I feel like if that was the case there'd be a smoother transition. It's not like relocation happens over night! :0
4chans community is as a whole much better than the reddit community. Honestly I've spent a lot of time on 4chan and from your comments it sounds like you haven't even given it a legit shot and are just echoing what you read here on reddit.
I bet you're one of those Damn waffles... 
Well, reddit can't "fire" them in that sense, but they can remove them. The problem is, being a mod is a volunteer position, and modding a default sub is not exactly easy.
Reddit *can't* die! I've never gotten gold AND I'm still a virgin!
Mine is in a few days and I just hit 10,000 comment karma the other day. SAY IT AIN'T SO.
I've been on the site for a long time now and I don't think much will come out of it, the Admns can (and probably will) force the current moderators out and install new ones, they are a private company and it's up to us to decided our permanence in it.It sucks, but that's how it goes. 
Once /r/aww goes quiet, its gonna be all over for Reddit.
Yeah this is a new level of angry,  imo, but I'm pretty sure it will blow over.
Where could one go to ask questions and get answers, hmmmm....
Isn't that where the pedos went? No thanks.
It could backfire a bit... They have no idea why Victoria was fired. She could have been diddling orphans or running a conglomerate of puppy mills for all we know. Think of the puppies!
What am I supposed to do while everything's down? Wash the dishes? Walk the dog? This is preposterous!
but it killed them with the AMAs they had lineuped. victoria was their go to person, and then no one even told the mods that she was fired, and then they had no way to contact the people who were coming to do the AMAs. 
I dunno, I think AMA's are what really set Reddit apart from any other aggregate content sharing site, and they've basically just neutered them so badly that they can't happen efficiently anymore.It's kind of a big deal
Are you the guy from the scorpion killing forum?
What a good sport.
But I don't wanna be FREEEE...
That's an interesting thought. Are you saying that not only are we the traffic but we're the product? After all what is reddit without redditors? What is a dating site without members? Admins ignoring the growing pains of their userbase isn't just hurting their traffic, but it is hurting their product because they are the same. That's the core of why I love reddit. It's relatively novel and an interesting study. While I have my personal desire to keep it going, objectively it's fascinating to see all the factors interact and the results that are produced.
Assuming the admins can just go out and find a bunch of competent people willing to dedicate huge amounts of their leisure time to a for-profit site at no cost.I don't know the full story, but it seems like Reddit management has been acting pretty fucky lately. I doubt Reddit's going to collapse wholesale, but if this is a nail in the coffin I wouldn't be surprised.
Trust me, there's a lot of fighting among the default mods.
Sure will! I got popcorn and everything :D
\*hides under a blanket*
Love and kindness and casualness for all! MWAHAHAHA!
voat.co is a clone with some of the improvements that reddit should've had for years. But right now, it's getting the hug of death by all the new comers.
Yeah, true enough. I'm just waiting for the admins to respond. They *cannot* ignore these shenanigans without an explanation, or this website is done for.
9gaglolno
Oh sorry no, I'm not criticizing your list, I'm just.. I dunno, appreciating the irony. Just think of it as the reddit equivalent of an old man rambling.
I have given 4chan a "legit shot". Between white suprem- sorry, race realism, rabid right-wing tendecies (try saying "I think there's nothing wrong with multiculturalism"), sexism and GG, I'd say they are not the place I'd recommend anyone without a lot of patience... or if you're white. Although depending on the board and time of day, the definition of "white" differs.
WHOEVER BOUGHT THIS GUY GOLD FUCK YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE SUPPORTING REDDIT!
Bold move, let's see if it works...
Happy cakeday and congratulations! I hope I can reach that ~~before reddit goes down~~ someday.
Problem with that theory: krispykrackers is an admin and the top mod of AskReddit. If he really wanted to he could've just turned the sub back on already.I think that shows that they're talking, at least.
The admins can definitely undo the privacy settings for the affected subs and/or remove mod privileges. I think it would be a bad move for them and would result in a lot of backlash. I suspect we'll get more info regarding victoria leaving, they will get someone else in place to deal with the AMAs (they've already said they have a team of people ready for them), and it will all eventually blow over. Just my two cents. 
Not with a bang, but a whimper.
Also if we actually get Victoria back it will be the greatest accomplishment the Reddit hivemind has ever made and songs will be sung about it for generations.
I don't think pedos went there, but very toxic angry man children. Still crap.
I blame SRS. They're a convenient scapegoat to me.
Hell, maybe she quit on her own. But why haven't they issued a statement? Why haven't they hired a replacement? It's all incredibly sketchy; unacceptably so.
Then I would say that the admins fucked up by not hiring a replacement before firing their employee, and the fallout is their thing to deal with. That's assuming these AMAs really have been lost, and I kinda doubt that. Maybe they will be now that the mods reacted in this way though. That's kinda bad press, I wouldn't want to be associated with that.Either way I think this is a terrible way to react. Instead of stepping up their game and pooling their resources, they just pouted and decided to mess things up for tons of people who shouldn't have to be affected by any of this. 
&#3232;_&#3232;
Heh, I try.
I believe you.
I'm getting too old for this shit.
Don't hide from me ;-;
*oh my...*
I'll take 4chan anytime rather than going to 9gag, thanks very much.With all due honesty, 4chan isn't that all bad though, as long as you don't go to shitty place like /b/.
I ramble all the time :)Although I am not an old man...To me it's funny that the truly well moderated subreddits are just going about their business. I don't know if that's the irony you're seeing but it is the one I'm seeing!
Congrats on the gold!
Halfway there at least...
Thank you in advance! You can totally do it. Just talk to everyone about everything most subs and you'll get there. Or like me get lucky a few times with a comment and watch it skyrocket.
Exactly, Reddit won't go down like Digg did, but more like a party that everyone starts to leave one by one.
Idk catching the boston bomber was pretty amazing. /s
That's a very special skill set, so it would be weird to hire someone the same day... As far as why her employment ended, that's probably private regardless of how it happened. She's not a congresswoman. 
yea thats the main gripe, like /r/books had authors going to do an ama, but the mods had no idea how to contact them since victoria was setting it up, and the admins didnt let them know anything about it. seems like they know its not their place to ask why someone was fired, but the admins didnt think ahead and nothing was set up to take on her workload. 
Wait, there is a scorpion killing forum? You should at least be proud of that one. 
how many times have you used the look of disapproval on reddit?
On a scale from 1 to 10, how sick are you of this shit?
Hey why didn't you add me back on snapchat?! You make me sad.
You wrote a book? :O
Ok seriously who are you? I see someone ask you this every once and a while but I guess it was before my time because I have no idea why.
But what about the mods on the Warlizard gaming forums?^^^I'm ^^^sorry, ^^^this ^^^is ^^^the ^^^first ^^^time ^^^I've ^^^had ^^^the ^^^opportunity ^^^to ^^^make ^^^that ^^^joke.I really hate to see all this happening to reddit.
haha that's fair. You haven't found it just gets funnier as you get older though? That's been my experience, but then I do tend to try not to be directly involved with dramatic situations. I didn't figure you were in any drama either though, you seem pretty well liked. :)
then come under the blanket with me silly
i wonder if she's there too
I assumed you've never been to either /r/History or /r/AskHistorians; I also made further assumptions (yeah yeah, I know) that you (or anyone not familiar with both subs) think the former is the "main" sub and the latter is the "backup" one. The second fiddle, as it were. In reality, AH is the good stuff; H is just worldnews-lite with a historical slant.
A fellow purple. Have you joined the button arena yet?
Dirty presser.
How did Digg go?
Sadly, no.
Fewer times than people have asked me.
My friends list is maxxed out.
Yep. Quite a few.
Just a guy. Wrote some books. Talked some smack. Made some comments. Got stalked and turned into a meme.
&#3232;_&#3232;Same.
Okay!\*snuggles*
guess again ',:\^)
I'd just like to point out that the FPH drama and this all came after the Button ended, meaning that the Button was the only thing keeping this site from imploding. Therefore, I did my part in delaying the collapse of reddit just a little bit longer, while you probably stayed grey and did nothing./s
So the war lizards don't kill scorpions? What is this madness?!
Sadly you're not proud of it? What's got you down today? Hmmm?
Hey man, it's pretty much free karma for you.
I made it on there though :)
Hey aren't you that guy from that Warlizard snapchat account. In all seriousness what's your username on snapchat? 
I think this is the kind of response we need to give so the admins do something about it. I've been around here for quite some time and it's obvious that the admins haven't been exactly the most responsive group and anymore the site has only been getting bad press.
Can I join? 
Can... can I have a hug too? ( ._.)
:o is it u???
Purple. 60s. Yes, that .00001 of a second kept us going. If all you purples had saved your presses for single digits, we could have sustained reddit for millennia.
Yes they do.
Until they open up the karma store, it doesn't do much.
I haven't spoken to the admins in some time.
nooo she's all mine!!!
Nooo he's all mine!!!
I worked for a food bank for a few years. Peanut butter is the gold standard in donations. Good protein that goes a long way. Your dad's legacy helped a lot of people. PSA: When your mail carrier does the food drive, don't go to the cabinet and find the canned crap you haven't eaten in four years. Go grab some peanut butter if you want to help. Sorry for your loss, OP. Great job of finding a positive in a negative.
It's been on Reddit for 6 hours. OP hasn't listed an address for donations.OK, OP....now, time to add an address for the "Reddit Power"...it's possible this webgroup will send more jars than Corporate Peter Pan. 
Creamy or Chunky peanut butter?
"What the hell is a 'Peter Pan Peanut Butter alert'?"
/r/HailCorporate
I'm so sorry for your loss. He sounds like a beautiful person, and I'm sure he'd be very proud of you for doing this. Maybe it can become an ongoing thing, as a way of honouring his memory? Best wishes. 
My grandpa passes away 5 years ago and he loved Peter Pan peanut butter too! He was buried with a container of it. I'm going to pass along this information, I'm sure a lot of my family would be interested in donating to the cause!
I have to suck up my pride and go to a food bank tomorrow.  It's been more than a week since I've had a meal.  Hopefully I get something as good as Peter Pan peanut butter.  
I would love to see an update from OP about the number of donations and peanut butter jars that showed up in your doorstep from fellow reddit people :)P.S : I am sending my jars soon too :)
Firstly, my condolences to you and your family. That's really awesome :')I LOVE peter pan peanut butter
You shouldn't discourage people from giving what they can :(
I thought about it, but decided that would seem too forward.
Yeah I was thinking they should ask for money donations, socks, coats, etc instead of the peanut butter jars. Peanut butter doesn't do much to help homeless individuals. It's a good sentiment though.
Came to say exactly all of this. OP, your grandpa had really awesome taste! There really is no better peanut butter. I think opening a new jar of it and taking the first scoop might be one of the best feelings ever (yes I love PP PB that much). Sounds like your grandpa's greatness attracts other great people, what a fun legacy to leave behind :)
Four year old can is probably expired.
Well, on the original post, yes. But, it's been long enough. I don't believe you're here "begging" for more....If, I were you, just add an edit...saying..."A fellow redditor, suggested that I add an address, in case anyone random internet stranger felt the desire to send a jar of Peter Pan peanut butter."
Done! Thanks for your suggestion :)
Hey, guys? Peter Pan Freshly Ground Peanut Butter is a few bucks and ships free with Amazon Prime.
That is really weird. Maybe your parents don't have much experience with those kinds of relationships?
...What a strange reaction
I once had a girlfriend who broke up with me because of Tarot cards. She told me that I was soon going to be a father and that we weren't supposed to be together. I ran into her five months later. She apparently got drunk, went home with some dude in a bar and got knocked up. I laughed and told her "Guess the Tarot cards got that baby thing backward then, huh?" 
I've dealt with some odd family members before, but I think this takes the cake. 
It's great that *you*, who boviously is much more down to earth than your parents, gave her some advice; she probably really appreciates it during this time....but, a *tarot card reader...?* That's just *off*.
And I thought my family was crazy. I stand corrected.
What. The actual. Fuck. They tryin to give her a complex? Cuz that's how you give someone a complex. 
That is extremely unusual. Especially since they were only together for one month. Weird... 
*One* month? That's barely even a boyfriend. 
is your family super religious or something? Is there anything wrong with your sister as in your parents might feel like she will have trouble meeting someone? On the surface being 22 and single is great and would recommend not getting married until her 30's
WTF? Does your mom think that she has to necessarily find a perfect match on the first try. I mean, a month isn't much time at all. How does she think your sister is going to find someone she is compatible with if she can't date people? It's just part of dating that if you don't find the right one, you have to break up. 
Jesus. What a screwed up way to deal with a situation like this and, well,any situation, really. How could you tell your own daughter that she needs to change herself in order to please men? And don't get me started on tarot cards... I hope your sister is doing okay and that she hasn't let your parents' reaction get to her. Breakups fucking suck and to have your own parents try to pin some sort of blame on you can't be easy.
I see a lot of posts with this construct and this certainly isn't targeted specifically at the OP, but it's driving me nuts.It was a *month*. That's not a boyfriend. It's a free trial to Netflix.
Glad to hear you turned out fine o_o
Ever feel like you're wiser than your parents?  I feel that way sometimes.
Just a suggestion: You may wish to steer your sister towards /r/raisedbynarcissists. This sounds a lot like what I usually read there. It's a support/help sub.
My ex girlfriend told me she went to a tarot card reader and she described a guy she was getting into, she got with him, she said they'd marry and stuff. Few months later she found 3 of his mobile phones he uses to speak to different girls, one of which he was taking away on holiday.
Do you live in a small town? I moved to a small town from a larger city and it's amazing how important marriage seems to be. If you're not married by the time you're 22, you're like an old maid. It's strange. 
If your sister is as loony as your parents, that's probably what men don't like about her.
Family has more issues than Time Magazine. Cept for you OP, you cool. Keep on keeping on!
Funny story, I pronounced "tarot" as carrot with a T until last year, when my coworker finally called me out. I felt so stupid.
Best thing I've read all day!But really, I'm sorry for her. It's a good thing she has you to balance out the weirdness.
Your parents are very clearly mentally fucked up.  Tarot card readings? Opinions like that? She's 22. How do people like that have children.  You're lucky you're sane.  Too easy to end up like them.  
This sounds like a plot to a sitcom TV show. 
I'm just trying to get my head around the "why?" behind their actions. How does one connect the dots in such a way that leads to this kind of response?
That's pretty fucked.....kudos to you, though. Hope your sister is ok. 
It's nice that you've got your feet on the ground and don't take all that crap. I really don't know how you could deal with your parent's, being they so superstitious, but what's important is that you make your sister know that it's not her fault (I mean, his boyfriend might have left her because of something he did not like about her, that completely possible,but whatever the case was, **fault** is almost never the right word to use) and that you're by her side.The best of luck for you.
Why the hell did your father take her to a TAROT card reader?
Was this your sister's very first boyfriend, or something? And have they reacted as equally crazy at your relationships?
They'll never realize tarot is bullshit. Like any pseudoscience or astral magic. It's really funny to me.
I am a Tarot reader and I know many others. Never in my life have I met a Tarot reader who detects "spells." That's..... That's not how the cards work. Sorry your sister had to hear that nonsense. 
Where the hell do you live, in the past? 
Maybe just me but I wouldn't tell my parents I had a girlfriend for a little bit longer. Things are so "unofficial" you could say in the first month or two.
That's strange... is it a cultural thing?
What the hell are your parents on? 
Struck me as a desperate need for grandchildren scenario. Is it possible that everyone got convinced that this guy was the guy who'd fill the gaping hole in their life?
What the actual fuck.... I feel like your dad cant be serious and is just playing into her craziness
This whole situation seems strange. It reminds me of one story I read on the internet the other day that turned out to be completely made up.
whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up. There are still tarot card readers?
Wow. Drama much? How did your sister take your human advice?
So, from reading the rest of the comments, you're apparently the older sibling. Did they ever go fucking bananas over you, too, and give you terrible advice, or is this a new development in a long series of getting weirder?
Can I ask what nationality your parents are?
How does she feel about all this? A little bummed out? Or is she totally heartbroken? Because a month isn't very long at all...Your parents are nucking futs though...
hmmm, tell her to go to church...a bible teaching church where they can council her and pray for her and support her
Well then i uh you know what? No bad parents, good work on being a good sister.
Serious issues aside, your family sounds legitimately fun. Are you living in a sitcom? Dear God, hahaha.
Are your parents wiccans or some shit ? Was their marriage arranged or something ?
Why is this so highly upvoted
I thought tarot card readers usually gave more general advice or fortunes did not know they were in the business of diagnosing spells.
Is this the first time something like this has happened?
wow that's pretty intense for just that. Maybe it was the first one and they're afraid because they don't think she's attractive enough?
That makes me think of when my did found i was making a 70 in my high school spanish class. I had been making As and Bs in all other classes but he flips out saying im an idiot and that im going to spend the rest of my life digging ditches.  Now that I'm making high grades in my high school physics and algebra 2 and was allowed to take advanced pre-cal next year, I feel like I should be laughing in his face right now
No experience is more like it. A Tarot card reader is wayy over the top. 
Right? I meant what kind of TAROT reader just says bad stuff like that. 
Thirsty for babies. 
Maybe the tarot actually said "you will have a baby with a man whom you should not be with", in which case it would have been incredibly accurate though completely not what she expected
This is manifest destiny my friend.  She is an ignorant fatalist of the superstitious variety.
When I tell people my family is crazy everyone tells me "ahah, yeah, we all have crazy families". 
Yes, that's sad. I'm sorry your mom gave you a hard time. And congratulations on putting yourself trough college. I'm 29 and I quit college in my last year, years ago. 
Times like this I thank god for my mom who didn't always make the wisest choices in life.  By the time I was out in the world she could objectively tell me "Wait as long as you need to to get married and/or have kids.  If neither of those things interests you, that's awesome too."
Oh dear lord, did you do one of those studies where you work and then study in the evening? I knew of some guys at my college who did that (sure there were women too, just not in my IT study), thinking about it now, it must be hell.
Good grief. What ethnicity are you, just out of curiosity?
Yeah, it really pissed me off too, being a total skeptic.
Believe me, they've already given us both plenty of complexes.
So are you and OP gonna PM each other? 
I agree. Although dude was posting their pictures on FB talking about how she was the love of his life.
No, no, my sister is blonde, skinny and cute. Her only problem is her shitty family.Not super religious. My mother believes in something undefined while my dad is into all that pagan, esoteric stuff.
Yeah. Well, in Portugal people in general take things a bit more serious. We don't really have the concept of "dating" here. 
Oh, it does. Thank you. My mom told me just yesterday that God basically gave her money to buy cigarettes, so...
Well, in our family we are used to the weirdness. She just kind of conforms to it, while I get pissed off all the time.
I wouldn't say I'm exactly fine.
I have felt that way since age 8 or 9.  My mother used to be smart.  Then she started watching FoxNews.  
She isn't, actually. She has actually become pretty mature in recent years. 
Too be honest, I thought her boyfriend was an asshole from the beggining. 
I don't know. He believes that kind of stuff. Always worried about spells and demons and shit.
Is that right? Because everytime I hear a Tarot story around here (Portugal) there's always related to someone putting a spell on you.
People in my family take everything too serious.
I don't think so. I think they just don't know how to deal with her being sad about it. 
Oh man, sure. They gave me terrible advice all the time. I had insomnia since I was little and I'd be scared of sounds and shit. They'd tell me it was demons out to get me because we had too many religious books in the house (we were Jehova Witnesses at the time).
She's bummed out about the guy because she liked him. But it will pass. It's normal! That's the thing. It's normal life. 
With all due respect, that's not really my thing.
I for one have no idea.
As openly absurd, yes.
Yeah, well. They got married around her age. Divorced 20 years later. My father re-married almost immediately. My mother never had anyone else. It's still lack of common sense. 
The kind that wants you to come back for advice on how to improve. Occasionally it's the kind who will hold your cursed money for you too.
Can you draw me stuff?
Huh. That was like 2 episodes worth of stories. 
They probably don't want to say, "Well, that's undoubtedly weirdest reaction I've ever heard of..."
And I tell them, "Did your mother ever borrow the book *Passive Aggressive Men and the Women Who Love* them from the library, not read it, and leave it in the car for two weeks?"
My mother once sat at the dinner table at christmas telling everyone, via her hand sock puppet, that she was helping the Christmas spirit by walking through the grocery store and singing carols. She explained that she did this with her sock puppet friend and her puppet was telling everyone they should "BE HAPPY BECAUSE IT'S CHRISTMAS!!!".She's "weird". She got on meds for awhile but won't stay on them.
Thanks!  Why'd you quit?  Have you ever thought of going back?  I took one semester in 1994 and then didn't go back until 2002 and they let me keep the credits from before.
My parents got married at 19/20.  My mother seems to believe that you do whatever your husband tells you to and that your job is to be wife.  Which is pretty odd since her mother worked (as a nurse in the Red Cross).  Also, my parents aren't typically conservative or religious or anything.  My father has never told her to obey him or anything.  It's just the way she is.
Generic, white American with no cultural/religious/or ethnic upbringing at all.
There is nothing to be skeptical about... it's complete baloney. 
Eh, ignore that shit. I'm sure your super awesome in your own ways and don't need that kinda crap. 
Everyone feels like they are the 'love of your life' for the first month. It's chemical. 
that is so weird then and seems like they do suck. I am sorry that they are giving her such a hard time. you are a good brother. Tell her she has nothing to worry about and she should travel and live her own life on her own terms and no one needs to live up to someone else's expectations especially their parents. 
What the fuck? Eu sou de portugal, como assim nao temos o conceito de "dating" ? So se tiveres a falar de levar a um restaurante e se nao pegar nao pegou e ta a andar, realmente nao temos isso, mas temos dating claro! Boa sorte com os teus pais!!
As a fellow self-confessed weirdo, I notice that you have mentioned several times that you have not come through their parenting process unscathed. Anything you need to get off your chest? By the way, I'm so glad your sister has you as a rational, sane, and supportive sibling. They can make a huge difference in life. 
My mom got sucked into conservationism as well.  She went from life long old south democrat (Bill Clinton supporter) to facebook spamming republican.  Ewe.
If your sister is still living at home she should leave home. 
I'm in the United States. Not to brag, but I've studied under two of the most well-known Tarot readers, Mary Greer and Rachael Pollock. The concept of "spells" has never come up in any of my studies. I don't believe in spells and I don't know a reader who does. The cards a querent draws are the starting point for a conversation about whatever issue they are coming to me with. That's been my experience. 
That's insane, my condolences. Glad she's got a reasonable person around to help her cope in a healthy way.
Woah, Jehovah's Witness to Paganism?  Oddly enough, my brother-in-law did the same transition.  
that's a totally normal reaction. does she see how crazy your parents are being?
All they needed to do was pre-arrange the reader to give her good advice and slip her an extra $20.
So it's been almost a day - I'm really curious - how are you all managing? Did she appreciate your input? I wish the best for you guys, man.
The kind that should have the book thrown at them.
How random. What stuff?
Oh, no, I haven't told them this particular story.The ones who have met my family in person instantly understand what I mean.
That's a good one! I'm going to pirate it.
I'm sorry. It sucks to have a family like that, it's understandable that your father was left with some stuff to overcome.
I was going trough a rough path in my life. I had great grades but stopped going to classes. Then my scholarship ended and I had no money to stay enrolled.
Your grandmother sounds awesome :-)  Yeah, some women seem to really enjoy being subservient!  And that's great, if you marry the right guy, I guess.I've found that 8 years in I kind of like playing the dutiful wife part, having dinner ready when he gets home, etc.  But that's only because it's my idea and he still seems really surprised and grateful EVERY SINGLE DAY.  If he ever ordered me to have dinner ready I'd tell him to go fuck himself :)(Also, for what it's worth, I got married at 27).
Well, I know that. You know what I mean. 
I can verify. I used to do it for a living.
My siblings and I were sitting together shooting the shit one day and I happened to mention that our mother told me I was "running away from my problems" when I moved in with the woman who would become my wife. It came out that she told us all that the people we ended up marrying were a bad idea early on.Incidentally, she's be on her third marriage now if it wouldn't cut into her alimony.
Yeah, but most are smart enough to not say it.
Yes, thanks. I try my best :) Seems like you would be a good sibling/parent as well.
I do get it off my chest. My parents are costing me a fortune in therapy.
My mother was always a conservative.  She was a 20+yr National Guard veteran and she also spent 20+yrs as a law enforcement officer.  She has always been somewhat bigoted and judging, but I remember her able to construct legitimate arguments and to somewhat reasonably explain why she felt the way she did.Now, it seems that her ability to reason and use logic have completely disappeared.  She has become a hate filled "Christian" who judges everyone who is different from her.  
She really should. In Portugal it's hard for people her age to do so, though. 
I think she does. 
Well there is that piece of writing by T.Paine.
Yes there is, it's just that common sense isn't that common.
I'll call the tarot police.
My roommate and I talked about it and a giraffe/walrus in a fight with a mantis shrimp is what we're requesting. You can likely change the first animal to one you like better, but the mantis shrimp is important(and the coolest thing ever)
Is your username meant to be a drawer full of stuff? Because I think they took it to mean that you draw stuff.
[Whispers] ^^^draw ^^^me ^^^a ^^^cyborg ^^^cat.
No offense, but I would **not** like to meet your parents. On the other hand, if you ever need to talk about how crazy they are, I will lend a sympathetic ear.
I used it in my stand-up act twenty years ago. One of the dozens of people who saw me might remember it. ;)
Oh. I forgot the homeless uncle with a gambling problem who expected my dad to pay for everything for him. On the plus side my mom's side is incredible! I (naturally) saw them more anyway. I did see my dad's side a little bit growing up, but it got harder as we grew as they were all being arrested or put into hospitals. The worst part is I feel bad for my father, and definitely appreciate everything he was for us and how he managed to stay positive for so long. 
Look into how much Pell Grant you have left. Might be able to finish some courses at a community college, then finish elsewhere.
Same thing happened to me. Few years of antidepressants and therapy later, I'm going back. You're not alone!
Yeah, I use it to imagine possibilities that I might not have considered. It's also a very interesting way to create motivations for characters because the cards represent a plethora of human emotion and thought.
Basically this. I had a gf some years back that was big into tarot (also turned out she was legitimately crazy and thought that gods or something were speaking to her through the cards, but that's a whole other story), so I messed around with them a bit just for fun. I looked at it like a kind of self-administered Rorschach test; the cards themselves don't actually mean anything, but the way you react to them or the stuff you notice in them can definitely give some decent insight into your own thought process. Almost like a sort of guided exercise in introspection.
Oooh okay just checking
Dang, what wOuld you do? Just tell them some nonsense?  Oh oh, did anybody ever* "call you out" for a bullshit reading? 
Is that the rapper turned singer?
isn't the definition of common sense that it's, well, common? If it's uncommon then it doesn't really count anymore as "common".
Regular police will be fine.  They can be charged with fraud.
O_O the mantis shrimp is a thing of glory. I can't draw a thing now cause my mum just made me turn off the lights (its 1am), but maybe I'll surprise you when i wake up morning.
I do/am both. Dobedobedo!
Their flair says ask me to draw stuff
I saw that.
Thank you :)
You don't reuse jokes?
If OP went to college right after high school those credits will have expired. 
> gods or something were speaking to her through the cardsSuspending disbelief for just a second, it isn't out of the realm of possibility for a god to control a card's shuffling. She is crazy, but the logic is sound.
I thought it was pretty bovious. 
I just listened, asked questions, laid out the cards, and gave them the best advice I could. I used the cards like story prompts.People used to come for a reading all the time to try to *prove* that the cards were bullshit, then talk themselves into believing. 
He was the computer voice turn nobody
i think we should call it occasional sense tbh
Scent is the new common sense
I don't think a fortune teller can be charged with fraud.
That's so cute!!!
Somehow I missed that! Lol. I'm stupid.
D: Don't call the cops!
YAY! THANK YOUUU![Checks pet cats for cyborg tech]^^^I ^^^am ^^^a ^^^she ^^^but ^^^I'm ^^^an ^^^honorary ^^^dude...
You've got some skill son.Whats up with the witch standing in front though? 
I wanna hear crazy parent stories too! 
I try to only reuse my own. I'm not very good at it, though. Probably just as well I didn't stay in stand-up.
Oooh okay, i was just checking. 
Sooooo, you wanna play MTG with your Tarot deck? 
That's an ignorant statement. He has a very beautiful singing voice. You should look up his npr concert.
Deductive, logical reasoning doesn't cut it for a description? 
:-D its a quack!
$20 bucks.
I was going for a road sweeper shaking its broom at the ploopy eagle. But i know not what north korean roadsweepers looked like, and the stick figure was too small. @_@ Son i am not, daughter i am. 
Like that time my mom sold my desktop computer for 50$ so she could buy smokes? I was in college far from home at the time. 
XD that's quite clever, wish I could upvote you more!You should make a full tarot set like that! I'd pay 15$ for that for sure!
Tarot cards
I have no money... :(
Wait, you thought for the _longest time_ you wouldn't be able to move on, and now it's been 3 weeks?I'd say you're moving on at a record pace. 
First of all, great attitude, keep it up.Second of all-- it was not random that this girl did not accept. Even if she was interested in you, she can't or shouldn't. She knows your ex, dude. Which means she knows you dated this girl for 6 years. 6 years is a pretty long time compared to 3 weeks. Therefore, this girl you asked out sees you as being on the rebound, which is correct.You've only been single like 20 days in the last 6 years, take some time to do you and don't ask anyone out for a while. Certainly not someone who knows your ex.
congratulations! I really commend your bravery and optimism. :')
I'm in such a similar position to you.  I recently was dumped from a 6 year relationship and about 3 weeks after I went on an OkCupid date.    It honestly feels weird and I'm acting like I've moved on more than I actually have.
Props on to you man, you had the courage to ask a girl out and weren't even slowed down by it. I admire your optimism! As for me, I'll be taking my driving license soon and I'm nervous as hell since this is my first time. Just don't want to screw up is all, y'know?
What's the aftermath looking like? I always get worried about asking people out because I fear that it will just ruin my friendship with that person if they say no.
Keep at it.  Don't be afraid of failure.  There were times when I met girls and I didn't tell them how I felt nor had the courage to ask them out.  The things you regret most in life are the things you don't do.
Hey dude, don't feel rushed to get into a new relationship just because your ex has. My ex and I broke up a while back and she started seeing someone new in about a month. At first I thought I should get back into dating since she moved on,  but realized that I needed to learn how to make myself happy before finding someone else to do it for me. You may not feel the same way, but there's definitely no rush to get into anything new. Take your time if you need to
Maybe try to process the feelings and get to know yourself a bit. You've changed a lot in six years! Perhaps taking time for you would be best.
You did wonderful! A lot of women prefer guys who have the courage to ask someone out in person. If a guy did that I'd give him a chance just based on that. I am tired of tinder. Keep at it!
Damn, I've been trying to work up the courage to ask a girl out for 3 months. I just can't haha. Anyways, good for you man. 
Good on you OP, I was with my girlfriend for 3 years and she turned around one day and said she didn't love me anymore. You gotta admit to yourself that it's gonna suck but it's for the better. Seems sleezy but the day after I messaged and old friend and we caught up. You gotta do what you gotta do, can't let it beat you. Good on you aswell keep going man you'll get there !
Okay - now ask someone else. Ask someone else every day - twice a day - until you get a "yes".You can do it - I have faith in you :)
Not to mention the girl knew his ex so she was probably her friend he tried asking out. Hmmmm
Some of us have been at it for 3 years now, not finding the courage to move on. Congratulations OP.
My ex moved on even sooner - I guess that's made the 3 weeks feel even longer. I just had to go out there and prove to myself I could start trying to move on too!
Yeah, makes sense. I don't reckon it was the smartest thing I did - it certainly was a rebound, but I figured I'm never going to see her again and just asked. It is me time now - getting back to working out, playing Zelda on my Switch, and work!
Thanks man! And I'm sure you'll do fine - no first time is easy, but you've got this.I'm actually pretty terrible at driving - I live in a country with great public transport and never really had to learn when I was younger, but as a 22 year old who is a bad driver, I regret not working on it sooner. 
What helped me stay confident when taking my road test was remembering how many bad drivers are on the road.  They all passed somehow, so i can too.  You got this.
I'm still learning to drive at the moment and I've had about 8 or so lessons but right now it feels like I'm getting worse at it.How many lessons did you have in total??
One tip i can give - get talking to the assessor. Making small talk with them puts you both at ease, I found I was a lot calmer once we got chatting. Just don't get distracted too much! Good luck!
i broke up a 6 year relationship 2 days before my test...    I still passed though so theres that even though i didnt want to leave my bed :D
I'm likely never to meet her again - she lives in Paris and I live a couple of hours away. I had asked her if I could ask her on a date when I'm in Paris next week for work.But we did spend the rest of the evening hanging out and it wasn't terribly awkward - so not the best, but not the worst.
It sometimes feels like an ego thing - like should I move on because she has too? I don't even know if I want to date now, but I want to entertain the idea that I still can date.
Thanks - that's awesome to know! I figured I won't get to see the girl again and if I was going to try some time, I might as well now. It was only afterwards I felt like I'm getting over my old relationship. 
What's the worsen that can happen if she says no?
I don't recommend this at all. 
Not a friend, but an acquaintance - but you're right, in hindsight, it probably wasn't the best person to ask.
It's been almost 2 years for me but at this point I think I'm just too lazy
While I agree with you, I still applaud OP for the quick turnaround. I wish it was that easy.
They come to you, if they are interested.  If a woman starts appearing in your space...it is time to roar again, Big Guy!
3 weeks is nothing. I'd even say it's too soon. 
I don't want to paint with too broad a brush, but that's been my experience with girls often - they move on super quick. My guess is that it's just seeking comfort in loneliness, and it's easier for girls to score a date than a guy. But I can't say anything about your ex - I'm just guessing based on my experience.I always find it pretty upsetting to see a former partner move on so fast - has it been hard for you?
Our countries might be different in terms of the process of taking a license, but for me this is my third lesson.The first one was sort of like a conference you have to sit through and listen on the basics and road safety. Once done with that, the second step is to take a test where you have to answer some questions. I failed this one a lot and had only passed it recently which was *so satisfying*. And now here I am on my third, holding the wheel for the first time!
I don't really loathe on myself too often so no worries about that, just hoping that I'll get a patient and nice instructor! On a side note wow, Netherlands seems very friendly with license newcomers since they'll still give them a license even if they've failed a lot. I always did like the methods that most European countries would do!
Just that, the worse that'll happen us she says no. And I tell myself that every day, but to no avail. 
If you don't try - nothing happens.
Hey maybe she will tell her and make your ex feel some shit!
Bro... you just got out of a relationship that took up six years of your life. Wait a while before you go back into one. Maybe ask why you're seeking to be in a relationship so much and try being happy with yourself.
Almost 2 years for me as well man. Still finding it tough. But main thing for me now is to focus on myself and career.. Sadly have 0% care for myself. No idea where to start. Gyms are a little too... Scary? But yeah, relationships suck yo.
Going on 8 here. Honestly it feels like a fluke that I ever had a girlfriend at all, as if everyone else's default is to be paired up, and mine is just to be alone.
I would say give it a year. The biggest mistake I ever made in my life was getting into relationships too soon. I really screwed up with some nice people and I deserved to have time alone to grow as a person. It's hard being alone after having someone but you will be a better person if you wait.
Now I will die. Why did you do this? :(
Yeah, the idea of her with someone else hasn't been great. I know she has been single and can do what she wants, but man, it isn't fun...
I'm not sure if you're just going along with it or if I have confused you.The thing about the Netherlands is a joke. Of course you won't get a license without passing the test - all license plates in the Netherlands are yellow.I edited my previous post a bit to hopefully make it more obvious that I'm joking...
Set a date and do it. Ask her Friday. That way you have time to plan out what you'll say, where you'll invite her to, etc. and worse case scenario she says no, but you won't wonder if you should have. How will you feel if someone else asks her out? You'll wished you asked then. 
There's a wide margin between nothing and twice a day. 
Maybe?...Rule #1 of life: Girls always talk. 
I, too, do not like gyms. Do you have those outdoor exercise areas in your community? Its typically some benches/balance beams, pull-up bars and such. I like to use those because they're usually not full of staring people and bonus, they're outside in the nice fresh air. Just my two cents!
Getting fit is so scary lol ..
A year? Gtfo it and move on. No one has time for that
I was in the exact same shoes a year and a half ago man. After 6 years my ex moved on very quickly to the next few guys. Knowing that tore me up, but man I know everyone says this to you and I know you're tired of hearing it, but it gets better. I go full days without even thinking about her even a little. You're gonna do great buddy. 
I didn't check the link...so yeah I thought you were serious. Either way, that was dumb of me :v
That's true. I'm actually hangin at work now, and she is here closing. Should I just go up and ask her out for drinks or somethun? I don't think she likes alcohol too much, so maybe ask her out for coffee or tea at our local coffee shop? 
Rule #2: Guys talk more than you think they do.
It's fantastic to see another Follower of the Iron Path speaking the Truth to potential Believers.May Brodin bless your gains.
It's not that we don't care, it because we're usually checking ourselves in the mirror and occasionally checking out the hot girl. /r/bodyweighfitness is also a good place to look, specially if you don't wanna hit the gym right away. 
In your opinion, is it worth it at all to start out with an hour (or so) once a week?My boyfriend and I both need to get in better cardiovascular health, but once a week on the weekends is when we can go together. Obviously going more than that is key, but is it even worth bothering with the once a week while we try to get into the swing of it?
Yeah jeez how long do people think life is? We're lucky if we get 30,000 days on this earth.If you're ready to date other people, do it. If not, don't. It doesn't matter if it's been 10 months or 10 minutes.
Maybe "moving on" is being ok being single, anyway.
I wished I seen this sooner. Did you ask? How'd it go? If not, wait until the shift is over so if it doesn't go well you don't still have an awkward interaction the rest of the night. 
What? No we don't.
Thank you, brother/sister. I have been cursed by Broki and old age. Broki has cursed upon me injury that leaves me away from the Iron Temple for almost 3 fortnight.Soon, with the All Spotters blessing, I will be back praying in the most Holy of 5x5 devotions. As it was written, so shall it happen for the All Spotter does not rack weights we cannot lift.Wheymen.
That's why you don't depend on motivation because that's only doing things when you 'feel' like it , and you're not always going to wake up everyday and be magically motivated, the key is to have discipline, that means doing things because you have to and it's a part of your life, if you only depend on motivation you ain't ever going to be consistent 
Nah yer good haha. And I didn't ask her out, but she didn't have any tables so she sat with me and we chatted for a good half hour. So I found out more about her, and now I'm a bit more confident in asking next time. :)
Talking? Pffft Don't be so silly.
The only reason women are thought to talk more than men, is because we kept them quiet for most of our developed history. Women can't talk enough, mate, to make up for that.
Next time that happens get her to laughing and show her you're fun to be around. When she's relaxed, ask her, but frame it as "I'm going whether you go or not" but don't use those words. haha That way it doesn't feel like your evening plans are contingent on her. "I'm going to X Saturday night. Would you like to come with me?" She'll get the implication and it won't be awkward. You got this. 
Talkings overrated. Men communicate in a series of head nods and grunts and we can perfectly understand each other
When a joke get a political response.Not saying you're wrong (I think you're right)Just, chill man, not everything have to be about something
I didn't even think of that. Thanks for all the advice :)
Good luck dude
WOW that's amazing!!! I love Dada Life, and you must be pretty badass if you are opening for them!!!
That's awesome pal! I'm genuinely happy for you. Out of curiosity, what was your house like growing up? Were you allowed to pursue music or did you have to kind of become a rebel in order to do what you loved?
My advice for you:1. Don't play any Dada Life tracks2. Don't play any peak time bangers3. Keep the BPM/ tempo under what you expect them to play4. Do play your favorite more obscure tracks (ie. nothing from the Beatport top 100)5. Have fun!
Yeah suck it, grandma!But really, congrats! Sounds like a great opportunity for you. :D
Suck it, grandma!
I went through a stage when I became really into music, and began learning terms, styles, and all the basic stuff I would need to DJ. I even went as far as planning out the gear I would need to buy, and how it would help me further that dream.Unfortunately that idea never panned out, but it did leave me with a bunch of knowledge, a new appreciation for music and high quality audio, and a killer set of cans. Props to you for sticking with it man, have fun! 
That is so awesome dude! Congrats on being able to do what you love in life. I hope you never lose this passion and can do this as a job that will sustain you.
Congrats man. I recently discovered Dada Life because they did some work for League Of Legends recently. They aren't bad!
Hi there! Hope you'll have a great time tomorrow, Dada Life seems like a really fun duo :) Which venue will you be playing?
When I was 18, I aspired to do tattoo art.  One day a tattooer sent me a picture of a rose, saying "you won't ever tattoo a rose like this."  Tuesday I am tattooing a Neotraditional rose that is sure to leave some astounded.  Congrats OP!!
Congrats man! I know exactly how you feel. My grandpa once called me "the worst actor he had ever seen in his life", then I was cast in a commercial in my first audition after I moved to New York city. 
Wow thats so awesome!!! Grats! I had a small passion for DJing for a good 5 years or so but I kinda just gave up on it and found other thing. Its hella expensive but awesome if you can do it right. And clearly youre doing something correct because of opening for Dada Life. Again grats and all the luck with your prospects in the future.
I've never tried DJ but I can imagine how difficult it would be to capture the mood. I get kinda pissy when people think that all DJ do is press play and sit easy for 3 hours.But more importantly, would you rather chainsaws for arms or springs for legs?
Dude. Cherish that moment. Not because your grandma laughed at you face but because your doing something that (i guess) not a lot people thought you could do. But most importantly, you're living your childhood dream. I wish you the best of luck. I don't know if it's because I'm drunk or whatever but I'm incredibly jealous of you for being able to live your dreams and not dream your life. 
So you were 12 three years ago? Didn't know it was so easy to break into the DJ industry at a young age
You'll be fine bro. 
That laugh is why you became a DJ. Many moments of mockery resulted in greatness.
I'm very fucking proud of you dude, preforming my music is my dream. We get to see Dada Life with their compound tour in a few weeks here in Salt Lake. I love Dada Life.Will you do me a favor? Will you tell me what exactly they are brining to the Dada Land Compound? I can't contain my excitement.
Can...can I touch your laptop?Good luck!
This is great!!Do you have any advice for new DJs?^^How ^^do ^^I ^^get ^^gigs ^^;_;
Favourite Dada Life song?
I thought this was an AMA for a minute.  Awesome good for you to prove  them all wrong. 
In Brooklyn!! I just got home haha 
"Get rekt gramma"
All the best.
hey man, congratulations! good job and keep it up.
Well, I've never heard of Dada Life, but I've heard of you, just now. So that's a win, right?     Basically, it should be: *"When I was 12, I wanted to be a policeman, like every other kid, but tomorrow night, we're playing after the DeanTheDJ! Woohoo!"* - Dada Life
I still would laugh im your face if you tell me that that is something meaningful 
That feeling of proving someone wrong is... (enhales) INVIGORATING... :D
hahah congratz, man that's awesome!! Play French Jeans as a throwback 
Congrats on the gig, I'm playing tonight for Valentine's Day at a trance party! Also super excited!!!
how old are you know if i may ask ? :)
Kudos to you for not accepting another's belief about the possibility for yourself. It can be difficult when it is someone you respect. 
Checkmate Grandmother. 
My parents and brother wouldn't agree (mainly because I'm a guy) and didn't think I would succeed at being at makeup artist, but I did 2 photoshoots in the last 7 days and I feel great getting into it. I have also gotten their support. :) Many of my makeup artist friends say im very talented and that I don't even have to finish a makeup artist school. (I'm 18 atm if that matters.)
Im really happy for you and all, but do you have a Soundcloud so we can hear some of your work? :)
hahahaha I followed your soundcloud and apparently one of your three comments is on my teaser. Small world!  Good luck!
Not my kind of music at all, but good luck tomorrow! And in the future.
Are you a producer too or just a DJ?
I don't know shit about edm, and even I know of Dada Life. Good for you! 
That's super exciting! Put in effort to build a relationship with these promotors so you can get booked again and keep it going :D
Dude, that's amazing! Keep grinding and making a name for yourself!
Congratulations on the gig! I have always wanted to get into EDM creation, and have just had no idea where to begin. Do you have any recommendations for any software that you may use? Thanks.
kick ass and take names dude, hope it all goes well, this might be the one thing your DJ'ing career needs to take off (:
Screw grandma. Go make your dreams come true and kick some ass!
I think it's really amazing and exciting that you pursued that dream from your childhood. Hope you're loving every minute. Happy for you.  
Congratulations. If you can't tell from my username, I too once dreamed of becoming a DJ. I now dream of becoming a writer.BTW, what equipment are you using? I may have set DJing to the side, but I'm always interested in tech!
Wow, congrats dude! That is so, so cool! I'm really inspired actually. I am used to the whole "getting laughed at" thing, but I'll try not to let it get me down so much. Thanks a lot.-Squirbos
Dude, fuck yeah! You're living your dream and that is awesome. Good luck tomorrow night, bud. 
For some reason, someone is mass-downvoting everyone in the thread.Compensating now.
Kick out the epic, motherfucker! :) Good luck. Glad to hear it's all going well for you.
Hell yeah, DJ-bro.
Good luck ya bastard ye! :)
That's great!  Sure showed them :)
Good stuff man! I love DJing as well and its awesome to hear that you got such a cool gig like that! All the best! :)
Come share your story at /r/DJs (and stick around)! 
CONGRATS!!! Dada Life is one of my absolute favorites for years. That should be a blast!!!
Congratulations! I've seen Dada Life a few times and they're awesome. Maybe one day you'll be headlining EDC. Good luck!
Damn, I just got done with a song by them. Congrats!
Man never give up on your dreams. I dream f making sweet sweet love one day. You gotta dream small before you dream big. 
Congrats man thats amazing
Best of luck to you dude! Hope you kill it.
Right on man... I miss my DJing days...of course I never played a stage that big.
I'd love to learn to DJ some day, especially with vinyl, but I'm too scared to talk to my parents about it... especially seeing as half decent turntables cost so much and I doubt it'd ever take me anywhere. Congrats :)
> playing an hour long setWhat does that involve?
So... you're just an average dj and not a producer? Djing is too easy.
I know of dada love from their scion sampler track smile you're on dada lol
You wanted to stand behind a table and fist bump with one hand over your ear? I could see why they laughed at you. 
lol you should get actual friends to celebrate with you instead of bragging to the internet
Haha I love them too! I'm most likely gonna get to meet them, and I'm so excited for it! I'm not that great, and it's my first time playing in front of such a big crowd, so I hope I don't mess up ! :p
No, not one bit! My family was generally very supportive of my dreams, it's just that financial problems held me back more than anything. Before my grandfather passed, he always told me that as long as I'm doing good in classes and behaving in school, he'd buy me whatever I wanted. I've never taken advantage of it, but it was always nice to know that even though we were a middle class family, he'd look out for me regardless.
Haha thanks for the tips man, I kinda figured half that stuff out though :p The crowd is an under 18 crowd, and they only enjoy very coherent music, so my set's pretty precise when it comes down to it ; progressive house, big room, and a bit of future bass / house.
The skill of an opener. Bot a dj,, but I've read about this sort of thing. From what I hear some acts will even put in your contract details like this, such as max bpm you can play.
Hahaha that first line was hilariousAnd thank you, I'm only 16 and these types of events happen every so often and I was luckily chosen to open up for them, so although it's not such a big opportunity, it's a huge step in the right path :)
It'a never too late to chase your dreams, just call it a hobby and roll with it! And thank you haha , im so excited for tonight !
Thank you so much man, that's honestly one of the nicest things someone has ever told me. If I could give you gold, I so would haha. I promise I'll gild you when I get the money to, pinky promise <3
Yea, they're great ! What work did they do for LoL?
I'm playing Pacha U18 located in NYC :)
Thank you man! Never give up on that dream, no matter how hard it seems, just keep trying and pushing and getting yourself out there. I'll try to keep my ear out for it, but get ready for new music! I'll ask them a few more questions about it and I'll update the whole post tomorrow, I promise! 
Thank you man! The first thing I can tell you is to just get your name out there! Make a few different 30 minute mixes, different genres, songs, etc. Then email a bunch of clubs, promoters, facebook pages for events, and ask if theyre looking for opening DJs. Don't send them that mix unless they ask, and personalize your email so it doesn't sound robotic and stuff. Most importantly though, have fun with it!
Haha seriously ! I'm trying to reply to all of the comments but this hit the front page on my reddit at least, and I can't believe it haha
You went to their Dada Land Brooklyn Compound show? That's fucking awesome! How was it?
Hahahaha! That comment had me rolling in laughter for a good few minutes. I love that man, that's hilarious :p Guess it's DeanTheDJ - 1 / Dada Life - 0 for now, huh? Haha
That's awesome! Fucking DJ-bro! <3
No worries! I'm 16, turning 17 in May :)
That's awesome! I think you should just do you regardless of what your parents say. Mind sharing some of your work? :)
Check my post edit, I just edited answering a few questions :)
No way! Haha which one man? :pEdit : Wow, I'm dumb. Haha I loved that preview man! I used to listen to it on repeat for a few days after it came out, trying to picture how the whole song would go. Seriously dude, that's some good stuff ! 
Both producer and a DJ :)
Thank you! I appreciate the support :)
I'm 16 :) And yea, film is fucking awesome! Congrats on proving them wrong :)This gig isnt the biggest feat a new dj could make, and this doesnt mean Ill turn into a world class DJ, but it's at least a step in the right direction :p
It's never too late to try again! Get yourself out there, grab life by the balls, and say "HEY, FUCKFACE, IM YOUR UMF 2016 HEADLINER."
Never be scared to do it! Go to your local music shop and look around. Turntables don't cost that much. I use controllers, but a decent pair of turntables plus a mixer will set you back maybe $300 / $400. Look into it, keep looking, keep looking, and keep looking ! Look for used equipment, old donation equipment, etc. Don't get discouraged from trying out something you know you'd love because of money issues, man!
Music.Lots of it.Haha, all jokes aside, if you're new to that term, it basically means I spin a bunch of music in random genres, with the set starting off very mellow and chilled out, and by the end of the set, the music is very energetic and blood-pumping, as to get the crowd excited for the headliner. I'll be playing progressive house, big room, future bass, deep house, future house :)
There is a lot of skill involved in being a good DJ. Not only that, but OP said that he is a producer as well, meaning he composes music. Please don't downplay his achievements. P.S.: this sub is meant to be a place for conversation free of negativity. If you can't manage that, please don't spread your vitriol here.
Well, I had actual friends celebrate with me when we were all at the party, but I decided telling the internet would be cool too. But hey, fuck me right?
>I'm not that greatGet that shit out of your head. 
>I'm opening for Dada Life.>I'm not that great.I think you're pretty damn good, but dumb if you can't realise it. :)
I'm so jealous you get to meet them and I'm sure you will do great! Post and update afterwards and let us know how it went :)
Bring a bowl of bananas.
That's awesome! I always wished I could've pursued a career in documentary film making but felt my parents invested waaaaaay too much in private education to jeopardize it in such a niche field. Maybe I'll get to pursue it one day!
Dada Life to U18's? Lucky kids
> I'm only 16 That's the info I was scanning for ;) Absolutely fantastic mate, well done... and as some one up-thread said:   "make 'em proud they picked you".I look forward to your update and some pic.
That sounds pretty good 10/10 would buy on Google Play. 
enjoyed that! thanks for the share and good luck! Savour the moment :D
Do it dude. Flume used to regularly post on reddit, it's worth getting out there and getting as many tips as possible until you find your sound. 
Really liked the one around the 1:00 mark. Very nice. :D
I didn't give up the dream entirety, I just found something I was more interested in. I'll always be ready to run sound or play or a few sets, it is just no longer my main goal :) 
The latest ultimate skin, DJ Sona, has 3 soundtracks, and each track is a collaboration of 2 electronic artists/groups. They worked on one of them
Pacha, nice one! Congratulations :) U18 sounds fun too haha :D Anyway, enjoy your evening!
Thanks man i hope the gig went good :)
Thank you very much, very excited for you. 
Well your seem to be doing a good job,  wasn't expecting a reply!  :)
Their set was epic, but the whole venue was a bit to cramped for my liking 
Thanks. I'm glad that I've improved your mood. Have a great performance.
Wow im also 16, turning 17 this year. I've always thoughr of getting into djing but now i feel rekt :p
Thank you for the response! :D You can check my submitted stuff on my page. Sadly I still didn't get the pics from the shoot yet. :(
I'm on it as soon as I get home!
deciding whether i should release it as part of an ep full of prog house songs i haven't released, but I'm glad you liked it! I'll send you a link when it's out! (:
Ah, good. Carry on.
Oh ok wow, that looks super complicated. I've dabbled a little in Pro Tools but still find it a little difficult, so +1 to you bro
Was it hard making a name for yourself? If you dont mind me asking
Keep it up! The beginning is always a humbling experience.
I hear ya bro...and I would if it was still what I wanted I  life.   I had my fun and it was a GREAT ride... Congrats on your gig.
This really made me smile, so thanks. :)You're a good OP. I bet you'll smash the gig tomorrow!
Are you spinning records, or pushing buttons to play samples and such? I'm not as familiar as I should be with this stuff.
Hm what does the genres "mean" ie what would be classified as that?(Totally out of the loop lol)
Yea, insecurities are a bitch. I've got to have all the confidence and all the balls in the world to get on that stage, and it's gonna be hard but i'm gonna fucking do it and rock that stage, and if I trainwreck then so be it, ahaha
Haha I like that, I heard that somewhere too (maybe your teacher first started that line and it circulated worldwide haha), but it's a little different DJing, because if I mess up, people are gonna know, because the music's gonna be cut, or everything's gonna sound weird. If I trainwreck and it's noticeable, I'll play some spongebob squarepants theme music while I'm getting back on track to keep the crowd at ease :p
Yea man, these kids definitely don't know what kind of a treat they're in for tomorrow with Dada Life.
Shit man, I love Flume haha. Regardless of my fame (which I doubt I'll even receive any), reddit is forever my besf friend <3
Ah I see :pWhat do you now? Is it related to music, or something completely unrelated?
Interesting! I'll check it out tomorrow when I wake up if I have enough time before I have to go for soundcheck haha
Holy shit, thats a nice ass track. I've been looking to work on drum and bass / neuro-funk like that. Feel free to give him a call, let him know that I'd love to work with him sometime :)
Thank you! Just got back from the venue, will post an update tomorrow, but unfortunately besides from a quick handshake, I didn't get to speak to Dada Life. Their security was very tight, as they're world class DJs. Still alright though, because they put on a hell of a show!
Haha don't be! It's never too late to try :)
No problem! I tried to respond to everyone that commented on the thread / replied to a comment of mine, since they're taking the time out to comment on my thread supporting me / giving me tips / etc. Your stuff is awesome! Keep up the awesome work :)
Haha alright, no problem! :P
Hahaha why do you ask? :)
I don't mind at all! Thing is, I don't have a name yet. Nobody knows who the hell I am. On the club's facebook page, they had this ad a few months back asking for djs and stuff to email them. I sent them my email and thought nothing of it, until superbowl sunday where I get a text saying something along the lines of "Hey, checking up on your offer to dj. We have Dada Life. Are you interested?". And I just took it from there :)
So you mean OP wasn't a bundle of sticks today? Hahaha, thank you so much, I hope I don't screw up! I'll edit sunday morning with the story :p
How did you get selected for this? I don't think they pick some random dude off the street to open for a popular act. 
Steve Aoki is shit and he is popular and famous....so talent has nothing to do with it anyway...Seriously though, fuck steve aoki.
Dada Life did this themselves quite a few times if I recall correctly 
As a producer of music, being insecure about my own music is my biggest problem, but at some point you've gotta be confident in yourself. Congrats on getting the gig, you'll do great!
I doubt she started it, granted she was super old. She probably was there when the first coke came off the line...And if you mess up cutting just quickly fade and carry on. They *may* notice but are to fucked up on drugs to care enough to FUCK RAGE! WHOO!!! just wish I could come see you that'd be so bad ass hahCongratulations on the gig bossman. I'll send good vibes your way :)
Jeez, talk about a small world. I've had similar ideas except with the homeless population in Philadelphia, where I'm from. My biggest dream would be to do something internationally. I am actually planning on going to Ukraine this August to volunteer in an orphanage and teen rehab facility. Would love to bring my story back to the States. 
I saw them at GDF 2011. They were soooo hammered during their set haha. I ended up leaving to see gareth emery. I imagine they wont be chugging bottles of champagne and half gals of grey goose for u18s
I'm telling you right now, self pity is just waste of energy. Stop being condescending to yourself. It's a pit that only eats joy and returns nothing.Keep doing what you're doing, but stop saying negative stuff about yourself. Strive for greatness and be the best you can be. You're only human.
Pretty unrelated. I've taken a huge interest in 3d modeling and animation and would like to pursue a career in that area! 
Just a friendly reminder that Reddit supports VERY heavy-handed censorship, and that it is owned by a mass media company called Conde Nast, which has HUGE amounts of money, and does not need funding. Gold does nothing except put money in the pockets of those people, and Reddit has absolutely no need for more funding.
Very kind of you! Responding seems very rare now.Thank you very much and have fun DJing! :DD
I like it :) It seems mostly EDM and dubstep and thats not all my style, but I certainly dont find it bad. Keep at it, your doing great. Also, Im jealous as fuck :D
Because- and I say this as a producer myself- it's hardly impressive to be talking about how you're opening for Dada Life if all you're doing is playing other people's music. It's another thing entirely if you've written and produced your own tracks and are finally having the chance to play them in front of a crowd.
Ha, a gig is a gig! Rock out with your dong out 
Haha, there were plenty of bundle-of-sticksy OPs today but you weren't one of them :PI look forward to it!
Wow, BHPhotovideo and Sam Ash seem like great sites (I've used Guitar Center). I'm always on the look out of for good deals on gear, so thanks!!
tldr; you don't have friends in real life, so you post on the internet. your grandma was right, congrats on playing other people's music for a living and gaining satisfaction from reddit lol
Kinda just sent them an application with basic info, and they texted me a few weeks later. Yea, they pretty much did exactly that, haha
Hahaha, great point. Thanks so much, I'll definitely keep the good ol' filter & fade technique when I'm in a sticky situation tonight :p
Haha no doubt! If I get to meet them and actually talk to them instead of the 5 second "Hi, huge fan, love your music, I'm opening for you tonight, any song requests / blacklists?" then I'll definitely have them do that for you :) What's your name?
Hahaha nope, I don't believe so :p Were they good drunk or were they noticeably messing up?
Yea I gotcha man. Thing is, if I say "fuck yea, I'm so good and I'm gonna be a huge DJ on that stage", then I sound cocky and people bash me for it. Isn't that how reddit works? I hear where you're coming from though, and I didn't mean to sound condescending to myself, I was just weighing the two different ways this can go, lol.
...but...but he gets to go to /r/lounge :(
Haha no idea why an OP wouldn't want to respond to everyone, this is like my 5 minutes of fame on reddit and I get to talk to a bunch of cool people! Haha no need to thank me though, man, it's all good :p
>Rock out with your dong out Haha love that saying, but it might sound better by saying "Rock out with your cock out", idk if that was your intention ! :p
That's so fucking cool! Haha big props to that dude for being awesome in general. Now a days it's all digital and unless you had a USB with that song on it, you would have been out of luck haha.Did your boss get mad when he saw you on stage / Did your boss approve of you closing out the opener before you went up?
Exactly what every OP ever wants to hear :p But seriously though, I'm setting a reminder for 3 months and if you're not headlining EDC 2016 by then, we're gonna have a problem here! Haha :)
Then go make them proud!
You didn't have to send them a mix or anything? That seems crazy! 
Lol I can attest I've been on both sides of the tables :P usually house parties ~100 or smaller ^.^ you'll do fine. Can you record your set and paste it some where though? I'd love to hear what your mixing.
Just...just don't play animals.Seriously though, congrats. Dada Life is always a fuckin party and I can't imagine how excited you are. Also, that shit is gonna look REAL good on your resume :D
At the end when I left they were becoming noticeably sloppier but their stage presence was fantastic still
There's a great difference between being cocky and being humble. Choose the latter, appreciate your skills and your success, but people will like you more if you do it in a humble way.
I personally subscribe to the Fighter Pilot mentality... If you don't think your the best as a fighter pilot you risk getting yourself killed, you need that sort of thought process to think to not just survive, but to succeed. As long as you believe in yourself(as cliche as it sounds), you will truly be the best that you can be.
I got gold once, I went to /r/lounge and wondered why the hell that place was even a thing. >.>Then I never went back to it.
Idk, its just my experience. But really cool from you nonetheless. :)
LOL I wanted to say cock but I didn't wanna be vulgar 
Digital sure makes it more affordable.   When I was playing it cost about 15 bucks per track, and the good ones were hard to get unless you had a buddy at the record shop to put it aside for you.   Which make it really tough for a new DJ to get into the game.   Although there is still nothing like playing vinyl.
lolHonestly though if I learned to DJ I'd be perfectly happy with a club gig here and there (*assuming I get good enough, haha), here in Australia the type of music I generally like (mainly minimal techno type music) isn't exactly a huge scene from what I can tell :PGuys like Raresh / Ricardo Villalobos are some of my DJ idols, haha
Wow. Sounds like a huge dick. Fuck Steve Aoki. Only good song that came out of him was Turbulence with Lil Jon, and now that I listen back to it, it's shit, I was just young and naive :p
Haha I don't think that's possible man, I'll be spinning on CDJ200s, and aside from some 10 second videos of when the beat drops that I might take, I don't think I can record anything unfortunately
That's so cool! Holy shit, that definitely sounds like the experience of a lifetime. The only country out of the US that I've been to is Israel (I'm an American Israeli, huge part of our family lives in Israel so we frequently visit, and my cousin is also a DJ, which is where I happened to find my love for music haha), and my dream is to just tour the world and go to so many countries and document my entire trip and just be a huge tourist :pHaha if you end up documenting it all, would you mind sharing it with me? I'd love to see how your experience was :)
Is it that bad there? 
He also gets artists on his label to do a lot of the work even on non collaborations. 
You should be able to use a external sound card or a pass through that'll allow you to 'split' the signals to a recording device o.o; I'd recommend it if you ain't got it. Record your sessions so you can use it for promo! >*yeah I opened for Dada, this is my mix..*Pantie dropper lol 
Haha I've always wanted to go to Israel with my brothers on a Birth Right trip. It sounds so awesome!And definitely, whatever pictures,videos, experiences I bring back with me I'll for sure share with you!
It's not bad at all - it's just completely empty. People aren't bad, they're kinda nice I guess, but there's literally no real topic. It's just a bunch of random people very rarely talking about random things, with an extremely tacky and ugly "rich"-looking theme (gold background and whatnot). It's just a pointless novelty, not a real forum that people use.
Yeah, I can understand that, although it can never hurt to broaden people's horizons.Before I assemble the playlist, I was wondering: do you ever play hip hop at your shows or do you stick with electronic music?
I'm friends with a guy named Raj on FaceBook. He lives on the other side of the country.We send each other pictures of our lunches, and that is literally it. Of course we comment on them, but we've never had a discussion that wasn't about food. This has been going on for a year now.
I've been playing online yahtzee with an older lady every day for 3 years now. We've never talked despite there being a chat function, and neither one of us will quit playing. I feel invested now, and I worry one day she'll stop playing, and I won't know if she has died or fallen ill. Yahtzee grandma and I have an unspoken bond. 
A guy once paid me to convince him not to get circumcised. I thought it was just a hoax until I got $350 in my Venmo account.
When I was 17 I had texted a local realtor for nearly a day before we both realized we had the wrong numbers. I had sent out a lot of copies of my resume in college and job applications. They had been looking for a client. Because we were both saying things that could be interpreted as relevant by the other party, it was six hours before we realized what had been happening. 
I met a guy on a chat and we've been texting on and off for 10 years now. We've never heard each other's voice. 
I played an online game for a long time (5-6 years) and through most of it with some of the same people. One such person was a guy who is about my father's age (maybe a little younger). In-game we stuck to being 'in character' but eventually shared email addresses. After I stopped playing the game (real life + bullshit game "friends" drama) I reached out to him with my phone number. It's been a couple of years since and I talk to him every couple of months.
At 14 or so, I became friends with some dude who ran one of those popular meme pages on facebook. He and I talked a lot, became "meme buds". Turns out he lives in australia (i'm from california). Two years later, when we were both 16, he came out to california (with his family) to visit me. Nope, not a love story folks. Just two buds finally meeting irl. He is super cute though. And now, four years later, all he does is send me dick pics on snapchat. 
I have a pretty distinct last name and about 5 other people (who I'm not related to) do too. One of them added all of us on Facebook and we all are in a group message together and periodically update each other on our lives. We have everybody from a divorced mother of 3 in California, a wonderful hockey dad from Canada, a US Marine and a slutty 16 year old. It's fucking great.
I live in an apartment and have a pet cat.  i routinely come home to find my landlord has left gifts and notes addressed to my cat. i met my landlord once to obtain keys. every time she leaves a gift for my cat i text her a thank you and she seems like the sweetest human being to walk the earth. i guess this is more an unusual friendship for my cat, i am more of a bystander.
I have a very close friend across the country that I met on a 4chan thread where you were supposed to add someone on Steam if they had your same birthday.I also have friends that only know me for a text-based Harry Potter role playing site.  That one doesn't get mentioned often because I rarely share the fact that I used to basically write multiplayer Harry Potter fan fiction.
Throwaway, in a D/s relationship with someone who lives on the other side of the country. Never met Her, never even heard Her voice. But being my Domme she has authority over pretty much everything I do in the day, what I eat, what I wear, when I go to bed, etc. I haven't told any of my friends about it because I think it's kinda weird, but one know the basics because I took my shirt off  and forgot I still had her name written in sharpie on my back lol.
I have "sword fights" with a "straight" friend of mine. He doesn't think wrestling with me and getting a hard on means anything about himself.
It's not as cool as some of you other people's posts and it might not be what you are looking for. But I dated this guy for three years. We broke up. It needed to happen. About two years later, after next to no talking he messaged me out of the blue and told me there was an opening at his company and that he things I would be a great fit. I nailed the interview despite being very very under qualified. Got the job. Nobody knows that we were anything more than friends. Our desks are close to each other. We have ended up as good friends. 
I have a whole group of male friends in rural India that I am friends with, I'm from California and have never been to India, but my name is the same as one of their friends, apparently I have a pretty common Indian last name, even though I'm as white as the driven snow, one of them sent me a friend request, I told them I wasn't that John and we had a good laugh.  As time passed I kept getting friend requests I started accepting them, now we all talk a lot.  We update each other on our lives, chat, comment etc.  Everything I do with real friends on Facebook.
One of my friends got out of an abusive relationship and is going to therapy. She's also a professional chef. She makes me dinner a couple times a week and in return I listen to her problems. She's got a lot of them. But I'm not complaining because hey, free food. 
That is the most awesome thing ever.  I always just ignore calls or voicemails from numbers i don't know, but you've made me rethink this now.
This has got to be one of the most interesting/funny stories I've heard on this sub.  Especially given your age when it happened.Props to you for giving this guy some good life advice instead of reporting him.  You probably single handedly changed his life for the better.
My best friend is 46 and im 22. Shes also my former highschool history teacher. I lived with her for a month this summer even. weve been friends since i graduated. She let me read her entire lifes diary last year and we are rather close. Like i dont even know how to explain to you.its kinda weird so we dont talk about it I guess?
Two friends I met online a year ago through CSGO. I probably have 400h playing with these guys. 
Most people don't know how close one of my closest friends and I are. I'm a guy and she's a woman, we're both straight, but we talk about things some people in relationships don't even talk about yet have clear boundaries on being platonic. 
Some of these stories sound super awesome. I should message someone with the same name as me on Facebook or just randomly call and leave a message. Maybe I'll get an odd relationship like this!
I know a girl from tumblr. It all started when she pm-ed me conplimenting my writing there. We talk about mundane stuff mostly and we just keep it there. Both of us never show pictures or anything. Heck, i didn't really know her name. What makes it weird? We always text after 2am. I nicknamed her The 2am Lady. 
I added a guy on Facebook about 5 years ago because we have the same first and last name. He's a battle rapper from New York (I live on the west coast) and its interesting to watch him progress. We like each others statues and wish each other happy birthday but that's about it. 
This is a great story and reads like something out of Raymond Carver's brain. 
I became friends with this girl with the same last name as me because we both thought we were cousins. Turns out that her family is so distantly related that it hasn't had contact with mine since like the 1700s. We kept talking and I started to really like who she was. We hung out a few times and I later found out that we had a few friends in common. Everyone always asks if we are brother and sister only because of our name. We're still friends on FB but that's where its basically gonna stay. 
Someone please link the story of a telemarketer calling a redditor and them getting into belligerent heated exchanges of insults on a regular basis. It ends on a sweet note. 
I've been friends with someone for 17 years. I've only met her once. 
In high school I would pass by this random dude everyday in the halls. We eventually started greeting each other with a different fake name every time we saw each other. It was hilarious. The weirder the name, the funnier it was.We never talked or became friends in a traditional sense, just two strangers calling each other funny names everyday.
I play board games at the library once a week.  The only other die-hard regular is a 70+ former IBM engineer, so we bitch about tech together as we play.
Two weeks ago, I met up with my D&D group's dm for a night of movies and maybe casual sex. I wound up staying at his place until yesterday. I had only met him in person twice beforehand, and we didn't really start talking a whole lot until the day before I came over.I may have also willingly gone into it with no contraception, so I might now be carrying his child. He knows it, too. Woohoo.
Thank you for sharing that story. I was moved.
How it start? Did he just PM "Send lunch pic."?
I'm friends with a guy from across the ocean that has the exact same first and last name as me.  He friended me in like 2010 when he was a teenager.  Now he's like 22 and I'm 34.  We chatted a few times, it's fun to see how his life is going.  Handsome guy but, like Zoolander, he has one look.  It's hilarious.
Hahahaha I love this! The thought that two people across the world's only interaction is the sending and receiving of lunches absolutely cracks me up. Thank you for that. It's stories like this that make me come back here. 
Now I want a lunch picture trading friend.
Does Raj live in Everett perchance?
I would absolutely try that chat function! Wouldnt you hate it if she dissappeared and you wouldnt know anything about her?
god that's gorgeous.
how do you know she's an old lady if you've never chatted her up? don't the kids a/s/l anymore?
One might say that you are... two of a kind. 
So how'd you convince him?
Damn I'd love a job like that. Not about circumcision in particular, but being paid to go on impassioned rants.
Where did you find this person?
If cell phones had been around I would have tried to call you too.  But it was 1964 and I was only 3 days old and couldn't speak or dial a phone.  You would have thought I was some creep.  But I wasn't.  I was just a baby without a foreskin.
Did you get the job? Did he sell the house?
My name isn't super common but common enough that the person with my firstnamelastname gmail was taken. So mine is firstnamealastname (middle initial). I emailed her once when I was job searching at the end of college just to let her know that I was job searching and sorry in advance if anyone emailed her by mistake but please forward it to me if she didn't mind. She responded that my aunt sometimes emails her.
I have this same situation!  It's been about four years now, and I always get a christmas newsletter and photo album.  I fondly refer to them as my midwest family.
Whoa that's remarkable
I'm actually in the same boat. I've got a friend that I still talk to through last.fm after 5+ years. We have JUST started mentioning the possibility of Skyping in the near future.It's a really interesting phenonmena when reflecting on it.
Search for him! See if he's still doing soccer. :)
This is a great story but man that was a mistake on the kid's side. Do you live in a small town where everyone knows each other or something like that?
I love how online gaming destroys social barriers. I used to play eve, small gang combat, we had a pirate outfit, and it was real trial by fire stuff. If you didn't kill 10 times more players than you died, you would lose money and not be able to afford losses. in our gang we had a 70yr old Norwegian guy, and a 12 yr old Australian kid, we respected their skill and ability equally. 
When I was 14 I played online games with a group of other people my age, or a little bit older. One of the girls and I connected and we still live on other sides of the country but we meet up when we're in the same city (maybe 3-4 times). I'm 27 now, she's had turkey dinner with my family and my cat has been at her house.
I just realised I have a Facebook page sitting on 50k followers even after sitting in a dusty corner for like 5 years. Is it *ever* a legit thing to sell them off to one of the weirdos in my inbox? I could use the extra cash.
So romantic. 
> And now, four years later, all he does is send me dick pics on snapchat.Almost every guy friend ever.  :(Edit - What's with people implying that it is MY fault that men feel like it is okay to send unsolicited dick pics.  All kinds of guys do it from all social circles and walks of life. It's not "oh, you have crappy friends."  It's more "A lot of people think this is perfectly okay, when in reality it's sexual harassment."
Dank meme buds, or regular meme buds?Also, sorry to hear it went the creepypms route.
Opposite gender platonic relationships seem increasingly rare, because it seems to me that guys and girls are pressed to "be with" anyone that likes them as a person. I'm glad you've got her, and I know I'm glad to have my three main girl friends who I know wouldn't ever date me. Good on you, and I hope things stay good between you two.
Did you ever find out the story behind the knights armour?
That reminds me of another friend I have.Before Facebook got really strict on names, I made a joke account of John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt (spelling?). I searched, and found another one. I messaged "Your name is my name too!".We messaged back and forwarth for two years before learning our real names (her name is not my name too) and many years later we're good friends who confide in each other. We have yet to meet in person.
I have a Facebook friend that comes from my LiveJournal niche role playing days. She's pretty awesome but we've never met irl.
how did you write her name on your back with a sharpie? 
Wtf? What does "D/s" relationship mean? So confused 
I'm more curious as to how you got her name on your back 
Hey, that's pretty gay.
> opposite sides of the plantAre you guys actually bees? 
Exes who you can remain on good terms with often make the best of friends, I have found.There's a certain trust that can't be found elsewhere.
I've been friends with a lot of people where all I really do is *listen*.  It gives them a chance to get everything off their chest, and try to find a solution to their problems.
People in the kitchen industry are often mentally unstable. Being a chef also has a high correlation with being a sociopath, coming from some random google research I did several years ago, so you know it's accurate.I hope you enjoy the drama, at least. When I worked in the kitchen industry I had some great friends on the outside who loved to hear gossip. :)But also, thanks for listening to your friend complain about her problems. You're awesome.
Is this the plot to John Greens new novel?
Thanks. They actually named me godfather of their kid, even though I've only ever facetimed with the kid.
do you fuq
That's messed up man but interesting af
Your modesty slays me

-puts on tinfoil hat-
> a bit worried I didn't know that she used a bit of sarcasm in that discussion earlier.How subtle/glaringly obvious was the sarcasm though? Like, a child could see it obvious? Borderline maybe someone could miss it? Or so subtle people only realize years later what it was?
I've been friends with someone for four years and never met her. Hope I can someday though.
Sounds like a smart decision 
Were you a gym leader, or a pokemon? Which one(s)?
Before taking my father's last name, I had an extremely common name. He got the wrong guy. He sent me a picture of a quesadilla and from there it snowballed. 
I did the same thing with a guy from India.  We are now friends, I have a bunch of his friends on my FB, we all chat in messenger or post on walls etc.It is always funny when someone says something that makes zero sense without cultural context.
I have a random same-name (and same middle initial) friend on FB who lives in Hungary (I'm in the US). She doesn't speak English and I don't speak Hungarian, but we comment using pics. Been friends for about 9 years now!
I think it would be strange if you *didn't* want a relationship like that.
I'll send you a picture of my breakfast tomorrow mate 
He does not. I live on the West Coast, he lives on the East coast.
Sounds like some oddity you'd see in a slight indie movie or something
A series of links, personal anecdotes, videos (Adam Ruins Everything, Penn and Teller's Bullshit) and reassurances.
Craigslist. 
I got into college. I never heard back from him. 
It really is, most of the online friends I've met have talked a while after meeting and I know some for 4 years now.
I was expecting married or still talking, at least. This made me sad. 
Tbh, it was winter, and it depends where you are, but the kid could have literally died. Depending of course, but it has happened numerous times before.
Ehhhh theres moments that kinda transcend the don't get in the car with strangers rule, especially if you are 13.Child kidnappers don't exactly drive around in vehicles and ask to give kids rides.Once I was riding my bike around a street corner and there was a bunch of gravel across the sidewalk. The tires slid out from under me and I ended up sliding across the asphalt with super bad road rash. Someone offered me a ride and I took them up on it.
Same here. I wish I kept in contact with a lot of the people I played Halo with back in the day. I've kept in connect with a few of them or randomly found a couple in other groups/forums. Some of them are doing well and others have gone far off the deep end. 
Nice to see a smeg head in the wild!
memes, dick pics. gosh, some girls just get it all.
I think people have a problem with you implying that almost every guy who makes friends with girls is guilty of sexual harassment. Hence why they're saying you keep bad company- they're trying to tell you those people don't represent men in general.
Wtf? Where do you live, so I can never make friends with those people?Seriously, either you've had terrible luck or you keep bad company. I'm sure most of my guy friends don't send random dick pics to girls.
What age group are you in? Ive not heard any stories like that from the girls I know, maybe they just don't mention them?
well, if i was 15ish, i would've just been coming out of my rage comic phaseyou do the math And nah he and i are chillin actually
Thanks! She actually came to my job and brought me a coffee right after I posted this, which makes a solid 2 times we've ever seen each other in person. She's a great girl, and it's so relieving to be able to talk to her as a friend without the "pressure" of trying to look cool. Especially as someone who's struggled with social anxiety, it's been a real help. Plus I get a buddy to talk about Game of Thrones without it devolving into "I'd ride Danny's dragons wink wink" like my other friends
Does one need a reason to own knights armor? Pretty cool decoration imo
> her name is not my name tooBut can you imagine how frickin awesome it would have been if it was?
Maybe it was just a short name like Eve.
I ask him for a lot of advice on personal things. We have even been able to calmly talk about our relationship and what happened. 
That would make sense, she's one of the most troubled people I've ever met. She's basically the living embodiment of the paranoid parrot. She's also very needy and I've had to set boundaries with her.Thanks for the kind words. Admittedly, it's been good for me too. I wasn't blessed with a lot of empathy and I don't have a nurturing bone in my body. My experience with her has been a good opportunity to learn how to be empathetic, and how to be encouraging.
Um that's a harsh generalization. The job is intense but have never worked with a sociopath. Everyone I work with are hard workers and family oriented. We are wives husbands moms and dads. 
Sounds so much like a prelude to a Haruki Murakami's novel to me. As the story develops, the old man could be a benevolent spirit of a WWII soldier who died in a blue pickup truck who'll only appear in this plane of reality past midnight, and the 22f boss could end up being a kitsune who is in an abusive relationship, and didn't see OP as nothing more than friend, because she knew they're soul siblings. 
We are really great friends, its just instead of casual pranks, its sincere attempts at black mail, extortion and entrapment. We never actually break the law, its more about getting the other into a place of check/check mate. Glad you liked it anyway.
Yeah how we joke with each other generally would be considered "hardcore flirting"
Actually I think we need to get r/SCP on this one.
Man, it's a cool thing. I met her probably... 12 years after we became friends. It was the most natural thing in the world. 
I was a gym leader. All the pokemon were ones that were in the original 150, as that's when this chat was started / popular. 
This is fucking brilliant!Do you only send lunches? Is it all lunches, including the average boring ones or just the more interesting ones?
Do brunch or mid-afternoon tea pics count, or are the two of you traditionalists?
/r/indianpeoplefacebook is pretty great.  That sounds like fun.
PS that is a fantastic username dude. Bravo.
yea, casually mentioned and maybe a little shown on camera, but otherwise forgotten. of course, it could be the main theme too. maybe something along the lines of this relationship, although odd and perhaps unconventional, helps the protagonist cope emotionally. or, maybe the games stop one day and the protagonist finds her and meets her on her death bed. they look into each others' eyes and share a bond unlikely. 
Nice. How long'd it take?
Ah, that answers all my questions
"Not all men" or not, it happens WAY more often than anyone is willing to admit.  This is a problem.
I can guarantee that they aren't mentioning it.  I'm 34, but I know women from the ages of 14-50 who have had this happen to them on several occasions.  I'm really surprised that more dudes aren't aware of this.
Bro you talk like a fuckin' californian lmao. I know this is late but i'm browsing top of all on this sub rn, so yeah. 
I need a game of thrones friend
Admittedly, I was slightly disappointed.But my IRL name is pretty unique in that it comes my first name is of Hebrew, middle name Latin, and last name Norwegian origins.So I'd actually be shocked to find someone with my exact name.
That too, it's pretty short and I've gotten really good at it over time.
...so she's your life coach?
You missed the part where OP has sex with every other character 
Don't forget the random talking cat, the bizarre dream sequences, jazz music, and detailed recipes.
Either she's mistaken or you're mistaken
What's that sub about?
How active was the chat? How many members?It sounds like it would have been fun.
Every now and then it'll be more than lunch. But primarily it's lunch. And usually just the interesting ones. That's how we met. He didn't send like an average quesadilla, he had basically combined barbeque ribs and a quesadilla. Mainly we just swap recipes for bad food back and forth. 
Just whatever. But it's mostly lunch. He made chili recently for dinner, and instead of using saltine crackers alongside it, he used cheezits.Inspiring. 
Is it Catch 22? I am not great at doing maths in my head but I think that's what the binary is.
Holy crap, exactly what I was thinking, but I struggled to define it. !! I want this movie
It was over a period of two days, right around New Years this past year.
It was an unrelated post
That's the thing with this one I know -- She didn't have to lie about anything. No one cares, really. Or at least, what I mean is - No one thinks that some elaborate backstory like that is needed.Her oddly elaborate lies just kept compounding. I don't know how she thought I bought all the dumb stuff she claimed.
I mean the issue comes when literally none of my friends acts like they do it, and they usually admit some oddly intimate details about themselves. So to guys like me, it just seems odd for it to be common.
I'm a guy with a lot of female friends and I'm definitely aware of it. I think it is the minority of guys who do it, but it is a significant enough number to happen disturbingly often. I just don't get how some of my peers aren't aware that this is basically sexual harassment. Not okay at all. 
Not exactly, though that's how I pass it off to people that get too nosy lol. I'm not totally familiar with what exactly life coaches do, so I may be way off. But I just get immense pleasure from making Her as happy and fulfilled as She can be, and am absolutely willing to give up whatever it takes to get Her there. I can't explain why I feel that way, I just do. Also not sure how sexual life coaches are, but there's a lot of that.
it would be a nice movie!
Nice.Sounds like a sweet way to make some holiday cash.Though it reminds me of the pranks people play where they put up adds saying "Win an XBox" and then they require a credit card number. They then take a camera crew to the houses of people who actually "fell" for it.You could have easily been feeding some dude's fetish.
Huh, that's fascinating to me
I agree completely! I would donate ten bucks to it, if i could do it easily in person lol.
My first thought was that he was jerking off to whatever I was sending him, but the more I got into links about body positivity and the origin of why circumcision is a commonly-accepted, non-medical trend, the less I cared. Then the money showed up. He didn't have any information that could have been compromising for me, so I wasn't worried.His rationale was that he'd rather spend money on getting someone to talk him off the edge than on the surgery and pain of recovery. Worst-case scenario, he was jerking off. Best-case scenario, he didn't get the surgery. Either way, $350 is $350.
lol same. idk even where to start making a movie.
You're a cool person.
Well now this almost made me cry. 
Yo man that was deep, there's only two things I ever cry about anime and this shit. 
It wasn't just your father who you made cry...
Man, moms get all the credit but dads are lowkey the real heroes. My dad has done so much for me, he's given me such an amazing life, there's literally no way to repay him other than to live up to his expectations, and to do anything I can for him. Today I saw noticeable a noticeable wrinkle under his eyes (idk if it was a wrinkle or what, but it was a deep line a little below his eye, I thought maybe it's from glasses) and I was like what's that, and he said "I'm getting old." He's only 48, not old in my opinion, but it was so weird to realize my dad can get old. 
Lost my father from cancer last few months. If only I got more time with him to buy him something he loves. Cherish him OP. Some people had time robbed off them. Too soon. :'(
Holy shit you are the best child ever, I hope a reincarnation of you appears in my testicles and finds my future spouse's egg. That was kinda fucking creepy but you get the idea! YOU'RE NICE!
This made me cry :( <3 Kindness costs nothing. 
this made me more emotional than I want to be fuck man
I feel all bubbly inside. Send help.
Anddd I cried. Last week would have been my dad's birthday, but was also when he died. He wasn't a great person, but he was still my dad when he was sober enough to be.   You hug your dad for me, damnit.
God dammit this is awesome. I wasn't a very good son to my dad after their divorce, and now that he is gone I really, really regret it. He was such a good dad to me.
My parents went through the same thing. Do me a favor, spend a lot of time with your dad. Just a surprise visit to sit and watch tv makes all the difference.
OP is a fucking legend.
Oh man, I just made it out of /r/sadcringe, then I read the story of Pawpaw and his 12 burgers and now this ;_; SO MANY TEARS TODAY ;_; thank you for being there for your dad, I'm sure he appreciates it very much.
Sorry to be nit picking but are you saying that you are siding with your dad against your mom or you are neutral ?
You're the best Gis.
It did made me cry. Can't stop my tears D:
I totally agree about the Anime, it's weird how I'm fine during the saddest scenes in normal film/tv but the moment that slow piano marks the beginning of a sad scene in an Anime, the waterworks begin.
Same man. Your Lie in April is on Netflix and past the sixth or seventh episode, every single one is a tear-jerker. Sometimes I cry so hard I tire myself out :(
Well - anime can indeed be deeply emotional for some.
Don't you cry.. tonight..
Sometimes we forget that they also age. I can't and don't want to imagine a world without my dad or my mom, but of course it's inevitable. All we can do for the time being is cherish them and let them know that we care and love them. Once they are gone, you won't live your life thinking that you could have done more.
I am so very sorry for your loss.*Nana internet hug*
We meet again!I warned you when I added you as friend. This *will* happen!
Can I get a hug too? :'( let's all have a hug party.^(lost my dad recently) 
I am so sorry for your loss.*Nana internet hug*
I am so very sorry for your loss. Maybe you weren't a very good son as you think; however, we generally are much too self-critical when it comes to our own actions. I'm thinking he not only loved you but thought well of you too.You take care.*Nana internet hug*
Now I'm cying.
I cried over yesterday's Sailor Moon Crystal. You're right about the music!Although not just anime. I was practicing the piano the other day and made myself sad by playing through the music from a certain scene in Final Fantasy VII... 
Nah my man white album two trust me. You thought your lie in April was bad. 
Hi (Reddit's) Grandma! I always smile when I see you in a thread.I hope you are well.
My dad passed away just over a month ago. My addendum to the well wishers has been: go make some more good memories with your kids/parents. 
thank you hiyo, for the Nana internet hug. *hugs back*
AYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY LUCKJESS!!*I have ^missed ^^you*
*big hug* I know how you feel, it can be really rough. The first year it very much feels like they're just "on vacation" and will come back, but they don't. Let yourself grieve, don't hold it in. I lost my dad in 2008 and I still get sad about it each year during his birth/death dates - especially hard when they're only 2 days apart.  My advice is to find happy ways to remember them and try to focus on those thoughts. Focus on the positive energy from them, and do things that would make them (and any older deceased relative) proud.
Awww thank you. May have shed a happy tear. The gesture is very kind of you.  :')
Thank you :) I know he was proud, but man I wish I could do it all over again!
Great, now you've all made me cry. 
Is it the one where Sephiroth dies? 
Shigatsu, WA2, Ano Hana, 5cm/s got me to tear up a little, Sakamichi no Apollon and Plastic Memories almost had me, particularly Sakamichi with the music.
Me too! But my aim is getting better!
Well, now everyone's crying. Are you happy now?
Nope. Aeris! 
What you have to understand, you see, is that those aren't tears of sadness, but of joy. OP made his old man happy today. Now dry your tears and go give your father a call or, even better, a hug.
Wtf? Spoilers! 
Is something still a spoiler after more than twenty years?
Lol you really love to amplify your comments with videos.
That reminds me of what louis ck said when he spoiled Lord of The Flies in one of his bits>sorry but you've had 40 years to read it
All. The. Time.
I get more of these than romantic crushes, honestly.Some people just seem so fucking cool that I just want us to be bros. I have these elaborate fantasies in my head of how we'd meet under weird circumstances and both just stand out to each other. Or if we've already met, how we'd find something in common that would make us friends.
Oh I call those a "squish" as opposed to a crush. And I get them all the time, even with people that are already my friend :^)
Every fucking time damnit
I think that's happened to me a few times. But half the time I don't know if it's a crush, or if I actually wanna be friends with them. Besides, I'm a really quiet person so going up to them is like furst trying to cross the Grand Canyon on a wire.
this thread is pretty wholesome, i want to be your friend!
There's a girl who works at the bakery counter at the supermarket who I would *totally* bro out with.  Like all I can think of any time we talk is how she would be the most fun person to like, have some drinks and shoot the shit with.  Unfortunately, I can't think of a good way to present this situation without any risk of her (and/or her boyfriend) thinking that I'm trying some funny business.
Teach me your ways please. I have a crush on someone but I know we would never be able to be together so I really want to befriend her. :( I'm just too scared to talk to her...
Never actually, I didn't know it was a thing. It must be great to have it though, because you can actively go out there and make a friend. 
Constantly! it's actually my weakness, always wanting to have a friendship if a person is nice.
I get these kind of crushes on friend groups. Like when you see a group of people talking and joking and having fun and all, and you want to be part of that as well.I recently started becoming more involved with this one group at my uni, but when I'm sitting with them I know I'm not really part of it :/. It sucks, but maybe it'll get better, idk.
Hahah YES! This happens to me a lot especially since I am quite introverted especially around new people. There is a whole Seinfeld episode based on this actually. It's definitely common!
You just convinced me to text someone I kind of clicked with a while ago! So... Thanks!
Skateboarding is a huge part of my life. When I meet someone who's really good/much better than me at skateboarding, I instantly want to hang out with them and be their friends. Though this remains to be the case, I've found that quite often these people can be poor friends, similarly to a relationship based mainly on looks/money. I suspect this stems from my wanting to be a better skater and that skating with these people will push me to try more challenging things. 
A couple weeks ago -I was at the theatre and there was a woman around my age and her mom- they had this long conversation at intermission that related to all these interests that I have too - even reading books by the same author. It was interesting. Is there a way to "ask someone out" to be your friend? I was too chicken to say anything :-(
Yep! I also ship people non-romantically. It makes me really happy when two cool people know each other and are friends, even if I'm not in the picture. 
Yeah, but for people out-of-reach.  I reckon Prince Harry would be a laugh to hang out with. Also Jonah Hill
Just had it. My friend was over for new years with his family (had some other friends over too) and I suprisingly ended up spending most time with his younger sister (3 years younger), she's a great person and I had exactly what you described for a few weeks until we got closer
I thought I was the only one who did this. 
Yes. And she said she would be in my area for several months with nothing to do. I commented on that post and said "hey if you're ever in town let's hang out!" No. Response. Which is super embarrassing to be because I feel like I put myself out there and got rejected pretty hard. By another girl. That I wanted to be my friend. So now I hid her from my time line so I don't cringe at myself everytime I see her name.
Pretty often. I have a bit of an anxiety problem that sometimes makes it hard for me to reach out to even people I know moderately well and try to strengthen/keep up a friendship. It's probably daily that I'll see someone I friendlike or have even hung out with a couple times and wish I could figure out a way to keep in touch more.
It used to happen frequently in my teens, but as I came into my twenties it's really leveled off and quit being such a distraction. I realize this will sound like a bummer but I've had so many disappointing friendships that ended really unfortunately that I'm pretty reserved these days. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy talking to people and like spending time with friends, but these days I keep my expectations low and take things as they come. 
I don't know if I've ever had this feeling. Makes me sad :( 
Same here! I've also had romantic crushes turn into these. Once all the "OMG DATE ME" feelings had faded cause it didn't look like it was going any further, it became a "man, they're really really cool. I wish we were closer." I'm pretty good at getting close to people, but terrible at convincing myself to make the first couple moves. I've got the tricks up my sleeve, just lack the confidence to pull them outta my sleeve! I wonder how close we would've gotten if I just tried a little harder. Oh well. Better luck next time, right?
It's pretty cool that you still wanna hang with him. It's sad to think that some people simply vanish or don't want anything to do with someone like him, even after they've already known them for a bit.
That's kinda adorable.I'm pretty bisexual, and I have this recurring problem where i'm not sure if I like someone, or I *like* them.I'm not sure if it's a bromance or a mancrush.
Who was your latest friendship crush and why? :)
People and socialization is scary. As generic as the thing Im going to say now, it does get better with time. Do one thing every day which would help you with it :)
You seem very wholesome, I'd love to be your friend!
Thats definitely a tricky one, such a shame that there needs to be immediate assumptions when it comes to socialization between girls/guys. 
Aww! Don't worry. I guess I just kinda merged myself into conversations etc? Isn't that easy I know. Took me a year and a half in my last school, but ended up being so worth it. Making good friends is such a trial and error kind of process. However though, just be nice to her and be the kind of person you'd want to get to know :) Have you ever talked to her/how do you know her anyway?
If you find the "hey, how are you?" convos don't go much farther than "good, you?" "me too, thanks" social media can help. Maybe message her about a post she's made or reply to her snap story. Do you know anything about her at all? No? Perfect! Ask her where she's from, what her family's like, what her hobbies are, if she has any pets, etc... 
This is very true, making friends is tricky lol. But seems like you're doing a well good job, through working with them you can probably seep in some bonding conversations. :) 
Never really had it either. Sure, I have plenty of times when I'm like hey he seems to be a cool dude I should try to talk to him more. But to get really excited about the idea of befriending them? Not really.
Do I know you lmao
What's the plot to it? I'd like to watch this.
Finally, I find a comment like this.
Happens all the time to me and haven't been able to form stable relationships because of it, I just set myself to fail every time. I've been really afraid to fail all my life, and I felt that was one of my subconscious mechanisms to cope with the unavoidable despair. These days? I just don't really care, you can't control your life to the extent you want to so just "try the best you can, the best you can is good enough"
Not at all!
My romantic and friend crushes seem to always be separate, but it makes sense how they'd overlap.I wish I knew how to get close to people. I don't have any trouble making friends, but that's because it's never a conscious thing for me, they just kind of develop without my choosing.
Hang with him> I see what you did there
{I'm a guy} Just yesterday, I became really good friends with this girl that I have had a "friendship crush" on for a while. I use photography as a way to enter people into my life. I just asked her if We could hang out to let me take photos of her. I've only talked to her a couple times because of mutual friends. It was supposed to be for around an hour, but we ended up hanging out for an entire day in Princeton, and it was a ton of fun! 
I met her at a birthday party, we only talked at little bit. Only later I realized how cute she was. Also, I'm friends with her sister which makes it double-weird. She's one year older than me and graduates in two months or so, my time is running up. :(My problem is that I get really distant and cold when she's around because I don't know how to act. I'm kind of socially anxious. Don't want her to think I'm weird.Sorry for hijacking your thread, this isn't really what you wanted to know haha.
No but you seem cool! Let's be friends
> "try the best you can, the best you can is good enoughDid you just quote radiohead? 
That sounds very familiar damn, love finding people like that who seem so insightful. Maybe you could send him some of your thoughts on a post he did, it could create a nice conversation around the topic. :)There is this person who I really often see around campus, has a tattoo which references a band that I love. Not only that, I've seen the guy reading really interesting books in our library on geopolitics and generally social/history stuff that I've also read and I'd love to know what they thought about the content. 
I've found the best method for breaking through to the close stage is to let your guard down a little. My favorite method is sharing a funny yet embarrassing story, like showing them pictures of my scene phase. By showing a sliiiightly more personal side of you, it shows you trust them - which typically leads to them trusting you too. 
Im actually going to get back here and check on you in a month. You better have asked the guy by then!!!
And love can be all sorts of different things, of which romantic love is just one flavor.
Yasssss well done! Im glad to hear that. I've noticed people with cameras and good photography skills often gain a lot of friends through it, probably because it seems so engaging and also "can i take photos of you" is such a flattering question. :)
I think your "Rightttttt" can be construed as either sarcasm and not believing the other poster, or as enthusiastic agreement and wanting to hear more about the others posters experience.Sort of like a sarcastic "Sure you did, buddy." 
You said slightly personal. I'll only show those once my soulmate is legally bound to me through a state approved marriage.
Oh dear. Well I guess I'm bound by the sacred internet law of no bamboozles now!
Gonna be a bit narcissistic here, but I have this awesome line that I love using:"Hey, why would you ask me out of anyone to take photos of people?""Well, that's the issue with portrait photography; I can do everything correctly, but I still need someone attractive for the picture to be perfect."
>Do you have people around you into the same stuff?Not really. I used to when I was in school but since then I can't find anyone interested in the things I like. It doesn't help that I usually like the less popular option. Lots of people like video games but very few like the games I like. Same goes for TV shows/movies/music/etc...
Also I love the little quotes that appear when you upvote!  It makes me want to do it way more :-)For your post it said "Quest complete".  Woot!
I like to think I'm not a karma whore, but it isnt true.
Can I get an upvote? Really need some of those :(
Upvoted for your upvote of a commenter's upvote that upvoted your post because you upvoted a commenter's upvote that upvoted your post
Oprah, is that you? 
Hi everyone. I heard they were giving away upvotes in here?
I gave people up votes jus to see those quotes. I'm seeing nothing maybe because I'm on the phone... Meh, have some upvotes guys! 
Maybe I could get an upvote?
So this is what this sub is about? Seems nice. I actually might come visit from time to time then. 
Have you ever gilded anyone before? You should try it 
Enjoy the upvote and upvoting
Here to collect upvote.
I used to never upvote...then I remembered it doesn't cost me anything and if it makes other people feel like it makes me feel, then upvotes for everyone!!!!
Sometimes I forget to upvote too, but then I see that one thing I wish I could upvote twice because it was so funny or touching. I remembered to upvote today though!
Can I have an upvote?
The first rule of being a good OP: Appreciate your commenters, and upvote them liberally (assuming they aren't being jerks).
I always upvote replies to me/my comments and posts unless they're mean or insulting... Or plain wrong. That doesn't happen too often though. I dunno, I kinda trained myself thinking it was standard reddiquette.
*I always try to upvote the thread I'm commenting on...* 
Me too, me too! :)
dont hug strangers, even if they offer candy
I'm late to the party but here, have my upvote! :-)UPVOTE PARTY!!!
Hello fellow human. Im not exactly sure what upvoting is. is it a reddit thing?
**There should be an UP-VOTE ALL button.**
Even late comments?
Free upvotes still going? 
I don't get the point of up voting. I do up vote posts I like, but I really don't see any point in it. If Reddit was like YouTube where people got paid for up votes and lived on up votes then it would be different. 
Scrolling through the comments it makes me happy to see how a little up arrow makes people's days ^_^
I thought this was u/GallowBoobSeriously this is some next level karma farming
The power is yours haha 
It doesn't do that for me
I demand to see these quotes on my Androidophone.
Is this only on the actual site? I don't see anything from Mobile
I don't see that! Maybe it doesn't work in mobile?
Admitting it is the first step
I've been found out!
Yep, Oprah. I can't pay the taxes on the car you just gave out. Thanks though.
You heard correctly! I'm giving them away at least.
Really what?
I haven't! That costs real money right?
Upvote dispatched.
That's what I've been trying to do! Haha I've upvoted every single comment and replied to probably 75% of them. I'm about to go to sleep though so I'll have some catching up to do. 
All I can give is an upvote. I has no gold.
"Your heart is a strange little orange to peel." Not sure how I feel about that one.
Yeah, it's a CSS thing, only on PC.
That doesnt work if you do it through someones user page. Only works in a comment thread. Its to prevent brigading.Nice gesture though :)
I've always been curious how much the taxes on those cars were.  *Edit. I found it. Some audience members had to pay up to $6000 in taxes to keep the car. Yikes. 
Idk upvoting is just easier for me and it encourages people to produce more content :)
we all get upvotes?
How are you?
That's some fine work there son. Keep it up.
That is so adorable :)
I have had a long day, and I am now sick to the bone. Don't believe that 5 hour energy will work for you.
I casually understand.
I also got the orange one. I wonder how the quotes are distributed.
/r/ProCSS 
Pretty standard.  I used to work at a dealership that "gave away" a contest car occasionally and I think most people just took a cash prize (sold the car back to the dealership, really) instead because they weren't prepared for the tax hit.  Everybody pays that tax when they buy a car but it's built into the payments usually.  Paying it on the spot when you weren't really expecting it can put a real dent in your wallet if you can afford it at all.
Everyone who comments on this thread at least lol.
I'm good! I'm super pleased that so many people appreciate this post. I've never had one get so many upvotes and comments. How are you?
I really need to get around to watching that movie.
You're adorable! <3
I've never had one. How do they taste?
every comment has its own ID you can see when you permalink it, i think it's generated off of that ID, so everyone gets the same message for the same comment.
At least I saved you a couple minutes/hours in the future.I accept beer, cash and credit cards as payment.
wow srsly??
I'm doing well, glad to see the wholesomeness in this thread thanks to you! : )
Haha. Can I ask you about your story on how you're ending up in hotel eating canned veggies? 
Horrible as hell. They just taste like a bunch of vitamins and minerals.
Hey I appreciate that information. Thanks for that.
Yeah I just up and moved 13 hours away from where I grew up. I did have a plan for where I'd live with some family but that fell through. I couldn't get an apartment quickly enough (plus I didn't have enough saved for first, last, and security deposit) so this is what I fell back on. I'm working two jobs so soon I should be able to turn it around eventually!
yuck. I usually just take caffeine pills if i need a boost, but for some reason i've lost my ability to swallow pills recently so that hasn't worked for me. Pure caffeine tastes awful, it's got to be more bitter than a switch cartridge.
Yes! the 5 hour was so bitter, that was the description I was looking for. It has over 1000 mg of "energy" they say.
wow! thats a lot of mg of energy lol. theres surely no way its worse than pure caffeine though. the second the stuff dissolved in my mouth i almost threw up. i literally gagged for minutes.
I really enjoyed those, thank you! 
1000 mg = 1 gram.I would not recommend that anymore then.
Yay!  There are good people in the world.  And you, u/saraarass, are one of them <3
Excellent outcome, good folks are around. I came out in the parking lot a few months ago to find my VW Golf had been hit a good one, wrecked a tire, wheel and about 3 thousand in body damage. Also was a note and phone number on the windshield. Guy told me he was really sorry and would pay for it. A good twist is that my car is on the recall and VW is buying it back, no penalty for body damage. So the kid picked the right car to hit.
Now you understand why old or poor folks keep cash stuffed in mattresses instead of in a bank. Because in truly bad times thats the only place that is safe.
I left my wallet with about 200 bucks in it at a gas station. I didn't realize it until I went to work, but when I called the worker said they had it, all the cash inside, in the safe. I had to wait until the supervisor got there to get the safe opened and get my wallet, but I got it back.
I felt so much anxiety when I read the title but your story turned out great. :)
Congratulations on getting it all back. I left my wallet on a shelf in Walmart this week. Took ten steps and saw a man bolting right through where I was. I instantly checked and no wallet. First thought, I'm fucked. May as well leave my car right here seeing how I can't buy all this shit now. Told first store person what happened. That guy running turned it in. He was trying to catch someone else who he thought it belonged to, but handed it to the store. Couldn't be more appreciative. 
I am so glad you got your wallet back. I had lost one on a ferry boat in South Texas. Almost a year later it showed up to my house. I had moved, but the address on the license still had forwarding. There was a note, it said "sorry, I had to take out $12 for shipping". It had close to 300 in it. I mailed back $200 of it. 
Good to hear!I once dropped my wallet in the Subway parking lot. The individual who found it was kind enough to drop it off in my mailbox (I was unaware) -- all my cards and everything was still in there, except for my $40 cash. I was slightly upset but oh well I was happy I got it back..
I lost my wallet yesterday morning. I live in a less than ideal part of Las Vegas so I'm never going to see the wallet again.  I don't care about the $89 I had in it, what bothers me is that now I don't have an ID and can't cash my paycheck. 
The debt is not your fault, the system we have in place is to blame. Educating yourself should not be a sentence to debt slavery.
Did you find out the name of the people at the register?  You should contact the store manager and tell them the cashiers did a great job!
That's very neat! =) The abusive house/relationship part is awful. I hope you get everything sorted out. All the best 
I would donate to a gofundme for you if someone else made it. 
>I did not know this, but if you're behind on debt to a state University, they can take every last cent from your bank (or in this case, credit union) accountwhat the fuck is thishow is that okayhow is no one saying anything about this
This is exactly the scenario I imagine every time I find money.Someone needs that money.  I have to get it back to them. 
Over the course of a few months, I stayed at this one discount business hotel in Kaohsiung City multiple times. I didn't go back for a few more months. When I arrived, the hotelier behind the counter recognized me and handed me the equivalent of $7 USD. It fell out of my wallet weeks ago and they found it and held onto it in case I came back. Very honest.
Maybe don't use the word "rapey"...? Like really? You weren't raped. Losing money, having money owed taken from your account is nothing in comparison to rape. I'm so tired of people in this sub using this word lightly. 
Hurray!! I'm glad everything worked out for you! I love hearing stories that remind us that there's still good in the world. :DCelebrate with ice cream!!
I suppose it makes sense, but it had never occurred to me that it was possible for them to just reach into your bank account like that. I would have done the exact same thing- cashing your check and keeping it in cash so that it can't be taken. I'm so glad that this situation worked out for the best though. Next time I see someone do something shitty, I'll let this good deed cancel it out.
Good thing you did there with your client, OP! It's almost a rare thing nowadays to see wallets got returned back without anything stolen from it.But..what about that honest soul who turned in your wallet? 
It is a good world sometimes, isn't it?  I left my purse hanging in a stall at the Calgary Stampede and someone returned it with everything intact from wallet to phone.  I was so relieved!  I couldn't believe I just left it hanging there, I thought for sure it was a goner.  
A couple weeks ago my housemate and I were climbing a tree around 3AM. A Bit drunk but just dickin around. Woke up the next morning and couldn't find my wallet. Immediately checked under the tree. Was still there. Not close to your story but j had about $300 in there and was relieved to see it still there. Moral of my story is maybe I should get a chain wallet or not be an idiot. 
I was getting nervous reading that.  I'm very happy everything worked out.  For the future you may want to consider a fire safe for storing large amounts of your money at home... Assuming there isn't concern with someone at your house taking it.
Wait... you've got Aldi over there?
You need a Swiss bank account or something now. Carrying around your money isn't the safest thing in the world. Is there any appeals process or a payment plan or something you could set up so they won't take your money again?
One time I find someone's credit card on the sidewalk. Obviously I couldn't figure out whose it was so I took it home and called the number on the card. They shut down the card, thanked me and told me they'd inform the women. I cut up the card and threw it away. It feels nice to do the first thing. I'm Really glad you find your wallet. I was worried this was going to be severely sad.
I'm so glad someone was honest and turned in your wallet! 
I'm not sure how it works in the country that you live in, but in Canada, you can file a consumer proposal with your bank that lines out an alternate repayment plan (most banks are quite lenient with this as most of the time they decline this, people end up in bankruptcy and then the bank doesn't get paid at all). This could buy you some time until you get some things figured out. 
I left my purse in my local work cafe this morning. Completely forgot and panicked at the pub when it was lunchtime and noticed.                          Luckily it was handed in and all fine :)
First time I've heard of aldi existing in America too. Are they still a discount supermarket over there?
That plot twist happy ending having read the title, had me palpitating. On all seriousness I'm glad everything worked out. I think most of us here would agree $450 definititely would be a hit.
I'm so glad there are good people out there.  I'm sorry you are having a rough go of it now.  If you ever need someone to proofread a paper I would be happy to do so.  I got a BA in British and American lit.  I'm rusty but will help if I can.
Reminds me- I had left a personalized bag of my stuff at an ihop, and when I returned, only my wallet was there. Everything was in it, nothing was touched (I had my credit card on me) but the people behind me had taken my bag.It's weird though. Why take the bag (that had nothing of resale value) and leave the wallet (with the money still intact?)
At least you didn't leave it in El Segundo.^^No ^^one ^^will ^^get ^^this ^^reference...
Have you looked into income-based repayment? If you have federal loans, you are eligible to pay back as little as $0/month.
Needed some Faith in Humanity, thanks for the story :)
Some guy at my Wal-Mart found some guy's briefcase that had $4,400 cash inside. Every cent was returned, and the police took a photo with the dude. I think this happened last week, actually.
I once lost my wallet at a country club, under a vending machine. It had over $150 in cash, plus all my information and debit card. Luckily another member called us and we got it back. I'll bet it would've been stolen had I left it anywhere else.Anyway, my point is to NEVER keep over $100 in your wallet, because if you lose it, it's gone. You can always disable a credit/debit card to prevent someone from paying with it, but you can never prevent someone from paying with your cash. Just a tip. 
>only to find Every. Single. Dollar. still in my wallet. All four hundred and fifty four of them! Ahhhh!I was really expecting to see "every single dollar GONE", glad it wasn't that way!
Wow!!!! That stinks about your bank account but holy crap! Bet you thought you wouldn't see that cash again though! Bet you're glad!
Awesome to hear it's there and good people in the world are smiling on you.Honesty is always the best policy. You never know what's going on in a person's life. You might be the difference in a rent payment or more.
A few weeks ago I was tubing with some work friends. Saw something floating down the river so I grabbed it (there were lots of people tubing so we were trying to grab the empty cans that we found). Well, it turned out to be a wallet in a plastic bag. With $374 in it.  Anyway, there were business cards in it so when we got back to the cars I called the dude and mailed it back to him.  And he said I could keep $100. Win-win I suppose.  
  I guess whoever found it was a very noble soul
Maybe don't use the word "rapey"...? Like really? You weren't raped. Losing money, having money owed taken from your account is nothing in comparison to rape. I'm so tired of people in this sub using this word lightly. 
You got this shit Sara. 
As an european: Your poor people get $12 a month for food? Is that your so called welfare state?
God I felt so bad for you reading this. Glad everything turned out OK. 
I'm so happy that everything turned out okay. I work in a pub and whenever a wallet is handed in a couple of the regulars ask why I don't take some cash out and pocket it myself. It's unbelievable, they think that if they found it they'd be entitled to the contents of the wallet! Handing a wallet back to the owner with everything in it untouched is a reward in itself.
This is part of the idea for /r/bitcoin - decentralized means you're in control.
My bankruptcy was final on a Friday which was payday.  Both my wife and I had direct deposit.  The court cleared out our checking account.  Cut rate lawyer didn't warn us. 
I used to have to drop off a bank bag at a night deposit box and once, it appeared that the person that used it before me had dropped 2 bags on the ground. They were full of cash. I took them to the bank the next morning and turned it in. I'm familiar with the bank staff so I trusted they'd get it sorted out properly.Later that day I get a call saying no one was missing any deposits and the money was mine. Turned out to have been small bills, but I got $1700 out of it. For doing the right thing. Someone must have been a bit shite faced
So glad that worked out for you. Id be devastated 
Well, nowhere to go but up from here lolBy the way I like your writing style, it's really cute.
I used to deliver mail for my university as a works study. Really casual with us all taking turns delivering mail and doing homework. One day I found a girl's wallet in one of the mail bags. Had her ID and about $100, cards and normal stuff. I go back to the mail office and find her sitting at one of the desks with her friends doing homework. I ask her if it's hers and she yanks it out of my hand and glares at me without a word.Sorry for returning your wallet I guess.
I love how you put the dollar sign infront of the Mexican pesos but just say USD when talking about actual dollars 
People know you're a decent person? How *embarrassing*!
When I was poor in undergrad and working shitty overnight shifts in the dorms I found a wallet on my rounds with a fat amount of cash. Trying to be a good person, I lookedup the owner, and took it to him without taking any cash. He grabbed it from me, looked through the bills immediately, laughed and said "you didn't take any? I would have taken this", and then slammed the door on me. 
Would it make you happier if I told you I find this incredibly common? Heard of so many instances of wallets being returned intact. Mine too, fell out of my pocket on a highway, truck driver calls up next day, returned it a week later on his trip back that route. Money intact.
Same here but thank you, me too!
Ugh I once did that: accidentally bumped another car, and left my contact info. Then they tried to screw me over, sending me huge estimates for way more than the damage could possibly cost, and claiming additional damage that I know I didn't cause. 
You took his money anyway, right? Right?
Ah, great stories!! Love it, love it, love it! 
Unless there's a fire.
There's always money in the banana stand.
> Credit union literally had no choice. Credit unions are very forgiving but when it comes to the government, they have no choice. No, but the debtor did. Show up to court...don't just ignore debts they don't go away. Know your rights. I've fought and won against credit card companies, loan companies and more...and I'm no lawyer. Just minimally show up...or you forfeit your rights.
What a great story! 
I've dropped my wallet countless of times here in Vegas and people always point it out to me if they notice it. I've never forgotten it though. 
Oh my goodness; I love this story! The finder handled that so perfectly! 
That's very sweet, but there are far more deserving folks out there than me! 
I wondered about that too. Usually bank accounts can only be garnished with a court order, which the account owner should be aware of...
At some point while she registered for classes she probably signed something that said they could do this. My university had my bank account info because I would get my financial aid checks direct deposited. You sign so many things and don't really go through everything unfortunately. It honestly doesn't surprise me
Maybe don't take debts you can't repay lol
The USA is one of two countries that tax you, even if you're not actually *living* in the USA (And thus not really using any of their services that are paid for by taxes). The other one is Eritrea, a dictatorship.
Taiwan is literally the best. Everyone is so chill and nice there.
Haha, yeah, I'd be the only one with  $400 in my offshore account! Yes, going forward I can and will set up a payment plan to prevent it from happening again. It's just... I scrambled so hard to save that, and now my escape plans are dashed. Just feels like a punch in the face. Totally my fault, it just sucks. 
I do my weekly grocery shopping there. $1.99 gallon of milk is unheard of.
Thank you for your kind words and kind offer. I appreciate it! 
I have not, but I will look into it, thank you! That payment amount is awfully affordable! 
Yeah, great point. Probably not the best word choice. I should have said I felt violated. 
Well, we have a governor who gutted the program, so his (any many other's) benefits went way down. It's terrible. 
Yeah, for sure, wish I would've jumped on that ship years ago. 
This seems really strange to me...when I declared I was able to keep what I had because all that I had paid my bills.I'm not saying I don't believe you, just saying I'm confused as to how they could?
Wowwww! Props to you! You could've taken the money and felt guilty about it, but you did the right thing and still got the money! 
I got so annoyed with the girl in this story that I had to stop myself from reflexively downvoting your comment. That's really irritating that she reacted that way!
Some people don't like being the center of attention.
:( Good on you though!
My aunt has a policy that any money she finds goes in a jar and gets donated at the end of the year since it was never hers to begin with. It's a nice idea
I think people just talk about it more when it happens that a wallet is returned. When a family member lost his wallet, it was not returned and the thieves charged as much as possible on the cards in the wallet.  We didn't post about it or talk about it much, because it's kind of what we expected.  But maybe I'm cynical.
Whoah, what a sassafras! 
Thanks me too
And I absolutely know that you'll have the same experience in the future when you find a lost wallet or purse. :) 
Or attack by manbabies
Until it goes up in flames for the (nonexistent) insurance money! 
Unless I'm wrong I believe this was levied by the state, school tuition? If it's the government you are screwed. 
Glad you enjoyed it! We were all very impressed at how well the guy who found his bag handled it.  I'm glad my friend let him keep the goodies because the finder was the real MVP of the weekend.
Nobody can donate to them all. 
The credit union could be owned by the university itself.
Or they could have sent OP a letter about it that be ignored, because it was just one of a more than weekly letter saying OP owed money. When I owed money to a private college, they sent me so many letters.
There are valid reasons one could fall behind on student debt, especially considering universities in the US never stop taking money from you.
> And thus not really using any of their services that are paid for by taxesThe US military provide worldwide service. Shipping without the USNAVY would be fucked. 
I just read the article and if you had less than 100,000 euros it was only 6.75% which is still pretty fucked.Still a bad idea for anyone in an economy that isn't in the shitter to stuff it in their mattress tho. For example I live in Aus and with an annual inflation rate of around 2.5% any money you had stuffed around your house loses 10% of its purchasing power every 4 years when it could be earning >2-3% in the bank or 5-10% in the stock-market 
For people who have the means and opportunity, they really should consider visiting. They won't be disappointed.
Man that sucks. The fallout from me missing my student loan deferment ending notification mailers was a kneecapped credit score, but that's better than a kneecapped ability to be independent. 
I know, it's fantastic! I bought 2 dozen eggs there this summer for 39 cents each! 
Anytime.  Pm me anytime if you'd like.
You really should look into it. I pay $5/month and I make a decent-ish income.
you know you can make edits...
Bitcoin is on sale right now ;) it'll be back up in the coming months
different states have different laws
I believe in karma, but what's funny is when I counted it the night I found it, there was $5400. *shrugs* I wasn't going to say no to a free envelope of money.
You were supposed to PM him the financial tips, as per his user name.
Huh, didn't know that, thought it was only used for Dollar dollars (CAD, USD, AUD and such). I even did a quick google search before posting and i saw some some weird P with a line through it and just assumed that was used for the Peso haha (apparently it was the sign for phillippine peso i saw)
Milwaukee! Well, the suburbs, but city adjacent! 
Yeah, at least your_ex_girlfriend isn't an asshole
Whoah, you don't catch flies with hostility. 
Oh I found $8 and then I bought starbucks :/ Maybe I should be a good person.
I love that word, sassafrass
Me too thanks
Or babymen
Yes, I absolutely did ignore letters, though they didn't state that this was in their arsenal.
Well I mean if this person could set $1,400 back I'm pretty sure they could pay *something* on their debt. Usually creditors will not straight up take your money if you are at least putting something towards it, even if it is below the minimum payment. 
Why not charge *everyone* then? Absolutely everyone that uses any forms of shipping.Just because I was born there and moved away doesn't mean that I am more reliant on the military than someone who was born in the UK.
The Barnes and Noble on 76th?
Asshole? No. Stupid bitch? Yes... I miss her so much. 
This is weird but I love the way you said that.
It might've been in one of the ignored letters.
Did you not read why was he saving that money? Trust me I would rather own 1 million in debt than leave in a abusive house/relationship
You don't just give them the title... You at least need a bill of sale, ideally signed by both parties and notarized.
Unless I'm missing something, according to the About Us page they aren't actually owned by the college, just have a lot of their employees as customers. And I still think there are regulations protecting bank accounts, even if the bank is associated with someone the account owner owes money to. Usually bank levies don't just come from nowhere is my point, at least without court involvement.
It is so ordered. Damn, that was well written
This is a very good day for me, a lesbian. RBG IS THE BEST.
As a straight guy my life and the ENTIRE world is totally ruined by this! How can life possibly continue in a normal way now!? /sBut seriously, **awesome** news!!! :D
For someone reason I'm just confused about all this. Like there wasn't any public vote or something. I went to bed last night where gay marriage was not legal. I wake up this morning to a text from my friend saying it's now legal. Glad it happened, just confused how it all went down.Edit. I'm not mad it's legal now. I'm ecstatic. Maybe I came across as against it but I'm not. 
Cheers! I usually don't post my political opinions on Facebook, as I live on the Bible thumpers section, but today is a different day! All my homophobic facebook friends/family are gonna be pissed and I might get burned at the stake our something, (It's gonna be fun going to church tomorrow :P.) BUT TODAY WE MADE A LEAP TOWARDS EQUALITY! Anyway, super happy for everyone! /u/iwinalot7 was definitely on my mind when I saw the news, congrats! 
My upquote was "Thanks Obama." Seems appropriate. 
I'm an American living in New Zealand. I made sure to stay up (it's now 5 am ) so I could see if _Obergefell_ would be announced today.When I saw the words "there is a right to marriage equality" I cried. I can't believe the amount of positive vibes from the president, the administration, friends, family, etc.So proud to be an American today. It's just fabulous!
Mexico beat you. Mexico fucking beat you. I'm sorry, but I can't stop bragging. For two glorious weeks we were more progressive than the United States, and no one's gonna take that from me.Congratulations and suck it!
 I have a sudden urge to marry 75 wives and 3 turtles. ^/s
As someone religious I'm against homosexuality, but whether gay marriage was legalized or not didn't really matter to me. What did bother me was all the hate generated by this issue.The matter of love was a joke when both sides would resort to offensive dehumanization and demonizing on the both parties. While I'm glad that its over and that humanity can finally focus on moving forward for other issues, I know that just by seeing the state of reddit right now we didn't learn much about respect for *everyone's* beliefs and opinions. This is the one and true barrier to human peace.
Here's to all the people moving to Canada to avoid this law. Should we tell them?
Well, that's gonna piss off conservatives and religious, which is always nice for me to see. I'll get the popcorn for the butthurt.
I'm so happy. The only thing that would make me even prouder of my country would be our women's national football team winning in tonight's match. ~~*secretly dreads my state's backlash towards it*~~
"Hey I want to get married!" -"Gay or regular?" "Nope, just regular marriage please."
It's great. Gay marriage was legalized in my country a while ago and the current Pope opposed it calling it an "attack on the family" and a "war against God". I have no idea why Reddit seems to like him so much.
I hate to be a downer, but I'm also worried for the LGBT+ kiddies in the bible belt and other unaccepting places. I hope they don't face any extra discrimination or violence because of this :(I'm still hyped af though!
WARNING: Your facebook feed is probably cancerous at this moment.
My wife and I recently got married in Vermont, because we weren't sure when Texas would finally be on the right side of history. It looks like they had to be dragged kicking and screaming, but it's nice that our marriage is recognized in the state we both were born and grew up in. 
Very happy about this. Gonna have to sit through a shitty ranting sermon on sunday at church. To make things worst, a Mosque was just built across the street from the church I go to, and my priest is already whining about limited parking now.Help meI don't wanna go to church anymore, especially this upcoming sunday lol
Good day because I found out that my boyfriend won't get laid off due to the bad oil industry atm. :) Also happy that America finally got some common sense and joined the same-sex marriage countries.  But I also feel bad because of the terrorist attacks today.
I wish that it was the whole world. *Sigh* My country is not generally influenced by the changing of US laws.
Please, stop, CC. You are already making me sick.  What happened to that cute pineapple header??
As someone who lives far away from western culture, i've never understand (i don't mean in a negative way) about all these stuff. As in, i don't understand why it's a huge thing....but i'm pretty open minded than most folks where i live. And plus, everybody's happy about this!
So am I the only one who doesn't care? 
"It's just marriage now"What about churches that will refuse to marry same-sex couples?
Well just because it is legal, doesn't not mean anything for the acceptance of gay marriage.  The supreme court just saw that there was nothing legally different between man and woman/ man and man/ woman and woman in marriage.  Many people will still hate the LGB community.  While it is nice that the government supports it, the nation still has quite the distance to go before gay marriage is seen as equal.
I got that too...
It's like so totally ordered. 
> RBG Red Blue Green?
This is a very good day for all compassionate human beings. 
Hey, not really relevant, but what languages do you know?
I like lesbians.
Do you feel we can stop saying lesbians or straight? or other connotations? Or is that just an absolutely silly and stupid thought?
Time to get a divorce everyone /s
A lot of people are saying on twitter that they'll be moving to Canada.. but they legalized gay marriage in 2005! That'll be a surprise. But seriously I want to see what the reaction is from the more conservative or religious individuals. :)
Wow congrats! 
It was declared a constitutional right by the Supreme Court.  Supreme court issues don't get voted on by the public.Any same-sex ban at the state level is now illegal federally. edit// yo, don't downvote the parent, they asked a legit question 
Same here.  My parents are anti-gay marriage so I heard all the hubbub when it was voted on here in Minnesota and then it's *bam* and oh when did that start.
> Like there wasn't any public vote or something. That's actually one of the core arguments from the dissenting judges: that the supreme court has essentially robbed states of their democratic process and invoked constitutional precedence over the issue of marriage equality.  That said, it was a judicial ruling that was made...so in effect, yes -- it did change overnight. 
It's been in the news for months. The hearings were in April. We've known for months that this case was being taken on by the SCOTUS and would be decided by the end of June 2015. I mean, I'm sorry. Pay attention. 
I was? Aww... 
As a straight Briton, this in no way applies to me, but this is still great news to me! A nation as great as the U.S. embracing marriage equality must surely have ripples across the world - and I sincerely hope they are good ripples.
Please I'd love to see some highlights of your Facebook news feed. All I'm seeing is love and tolerance.
> What's most impressive to me is that it didn't take a Constitutional Amendment.Well, technically it did: the 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law. It's just that that amendment came in 1868. It's taken us 147 years to get a case to the Supreme Court and let them apply that amendment to the issue, is all.Better late than never, I guess?
Canada's had marriage equality since 2005, what do we win?But seriously, congrats to both of your countries.
The ***Irish*** Catholic nation of ***IRELAND*** beat us. Join the club.
Poor ol' Donatello never gets any love.
What I don't get (and I'm an atheist) is why even bother with marriage as homosexuals? Marriage is a religious concept and all major religions are against marriage other than between man and woman, so why do they want to be part of something that denies them by definition? It confuses me.
My upquote called you a "cutiebutt".
Who are you playing against tonight?
You make it sound like your ordering a drink.
So don't go.
If the complaint about the mosque has to do with parking, that's progress.
Which country is that?
I love your flair.
Doesn't care like it affects you not at all, or doesn't care as in you think it shouldn't have been legalized?Because the first one I understand, I'm not sure I would care as much if this wasn't going to make people I love so much happier. Otherwise I think I'd just shrug and click over to another news article.
Are you saying that churches should be forced to break their religious laws?   No one is forcing gay couples to get married in churches that don't agree with it. 
dammit. oh well. I guess it's time to stop trying. Pack it up guys. we're done.
FYI the quote code is not random; the quotes change corresponding to the first letter in the post title.Source: we have the same kind of system in the subreddit I moderate.
You gotta admit that's a baller way to close any decision. Also the entire majority opinion (admittedly I haven't read through the whole thing yet, but still) was fantastic. Definitely one of the best written opinions of our day and age. 
Could it *be* any more ordered?
Damn that made me tear up a little. That's absolutly beautiful. 
RUTH BADER MOTHAFUCKIN GINSBURG
Damnit OpenGL, what have you done this time...
German, English, and Korean 
Don't we all.
I think we need those labels because people have an inherent need to be labeled
You forgot the part where you're fleeing to Canada.
> informed conservatives are coolThank you so much for this! So many people don't know that informed conservatives exist.
If I was still on Facebook, I would see the above, sans sarcasm, all fucking day.  Anyhow, today's truly a great day for equality and dignity and we all must continue to extend these basic concepts to *all* people.
Your upvote comment was "DESTROY THEM WITH LASERS".This is appropriate.
This is a great victory, but I think it's important to remember that marijuana is illegal federally, and some States have legalized it anyways. I think there will still be struggles to face for people in more traditional States. It's a HUGE step, but the fight isn't over yet
Jesus fuck dude, calm down. Just because one person is aware of things doesn't mean someone else is. Some people like cake, other people don't like cake. 
Totally, I'm not gay, but you are still an inspiration to me. Always happy seeing you share your life's ups and downs, stay awesome.  
You get the maple syrup.
Is that so surprising? We're not some backwards little theocracy here you know.
Props to you guys doing that with a popular vote, no way in hell would that work in the US.
Marriage comes with a ton of legal benefits, such as the right to visit your partner in the hospital on their deathbed. The right to be a legal guardian to your partners child. It is not a religious construct and hasnt been for centuries. 
But... but our circlejerk...
China. It's quarterfinals so I'm hoping it isn't our last game.
I'll have a medium gay Sprite please, no ice.
Thanks. I suppose you got the reference?
The first one. And really I just don't care at all so I can't be happy for anybody.
Yeah, I just hate the idea that something is inherently good or bad; sort of like guns, it depends on how and what we use them for not the fact that it is a gun that is bad.  Normal for the society is much more agreeable in my mind.  
The post title? How does one letter determine an entire thread's worth of upquotes?Or perhaps you mean the first letter of the comment. Still, the two parent comments of yours begin with the same letter and lead to different quotes (for me).
The Notorious RBG!
CMYK masterrace represent
That lack of space in "Trekkie.Polyglot" in your flair bothers me a little bit.
which, as a Canadian, always makes me laugh because *gay marriage has been legal in Canada for years*.
It's a lot easier to fight for the right of marriage now that the Supreme Court has ruled it a matter of constitutional law. If a state tries to deny a couple their right, that couple fights them on the federal level, and the federal government wins.Marijuana is a whole different ball game, because the federal level, the trump card, is being played against you, rather than in your favor.
It's been pretty much the biggest news story of the last six months. Unless you've been on another planet this whole time, you really have no good excuse for being unaware of this.Even more embarrassing, though, is that you seen to have no clue how your own government works. I'm torn between trying to convince you to educate yourself and trying to convince you to never go near a voting booth. Which is to say, I'm not sure if democracy would be helped or hindered by your participation. If you think that court decisions are things we vote on, probably the latter.
The Mexican above me is speaking in caricatures and I did the same. I was raised in the Catholic Church and was told I was a sinner. This country has so many different and popular religions and we can't agree on anything and yet a country I was raised to believe was the holy motherland, Catholics are Catholics and that the US is somehow full of Cafeteria Catholics. Just the irony of it in my mind.
Oui!  My place or yours?
But isn't there already a type of contract which can be signed that pretty much gives you the same benefits? at least in Europe most countries have this.
I hope Morgan can pick up where Rapinoe's head left off. 
Wow this is amazing.  Thank you for my new obsession.
you murderer!! 
Yeah, I read that book over and over again. 
I'm sorry but I don't understand how you're relating the gun argument to the issue of same-sex marriage.
Yes, same goes for parent comments. Quotes tend to stay the same throughout a whole comment thread with the quote corresponding to the parent comment.
Well who wouldn't
I never got into CMYK. Always been a RGBA guy.Why does CMYK exist?
When I saw the "I'm moving to Canada 'threats'" all I could think was "ya' know it is legal there, right?" and "oh, ya' know how you hate paying taxes...umm..."  Canada is going to send you back COD, covered in maple syrup and poutine, with a puck in your craw.  ;)
What? We don't need to "fight for" marriage. We just *won*. That fight is now over, for good.
No excuse. Lol. I gave my opinion on the issue. You're taking casual conversation into a different area. 
What's it like in Canada? Is it worth a visit?
If you're into tropical climates, you'll love my place. Also, I cook ;)
> ...grow up with the assumption that same-sex marriage being legal is normal and good...  It relates to the idea that marriage is bad, or could be bad, or is inherently bad.  A thing is neither good nor bad, but it depends on how it is used that makes it good or bad.
What's the A for? 
I want to flee to Canada if THAT'S the outcome! I fucking love poutine.
Your opinion is ignorant and uninformed, and you should be embarrassed.
You're in Mexico?  I found a giant hermit crab there once xD
I take it that you don't subscribe to Plato's idea of an absolute truth?
XD our crabs do tend to be huge.
It's my favourite TV show. So, yeah.
Our are always so tiny!
Where are you from?
Yessssss keep it up! With a poor diet like I've always had, I'm fortunate to have always been a healthy weight.
Very proud of you and all that you've accomplished. Keep being a champion!
Good job! If you don't mind me asking, how tall are you? 
Husky is a terrible name, because it doesn't even necessarily mean you're fat. When I would buy school uniforms by around 6th grade I had to buy husky. I wasn't fat at all in grammar school, I just hit my growth spurt early, so I had to buy bigger clothes. Young me just thought it meant I was fat.Unfortunately I basically stopped growing though. I was like the 4th or 5th tallest in my class in grammar school, and now I'm just a shorter guy lol.
Good for you! You should feel very proud. Congrats!
Man, I was a fat kid in high school, but fit as fuck in my early 20s. In my late 20s... Well, whatever the opposite of fit as fuck is. Lesson here: good job on losing the weight, but you gotta watch that shit and keep on it. 
/r/fitness accepts progress pics and such.then theres /r/brogress.
Another place to possibly share your journey is on /r/loseit
Congrats! Great work! Let this success snowball into greater things. Nothing feels better than achieving goals.
Congrats! The sub you're looking for is /r/loseit Everyone there would be stoked to hear this story :-)
Hey good job. That stuffs always hard to do. 
For fun, you might also enjoy:/r/ketocirclejerk/r/congratslikeimfive
Congrats! Really proud of you. I'm like 20 Kgs underweight and really want to get into shape but have been procrastinating for a good 3 years now.
Proud of man. I am a MMA fighter who's 16 and weighs in at 155 or 170 and it's tough finding fights. As at 145 I look like a crack head. Keep at it bro. And you will get there 
Congratulations!!!!!
Congratulations! That's a ton of work, and a huge accomplishment!
Whoooooooo!!!!! Go you! Always room to improve. Keep it up. 
Congrats with the colossal goals op! Health is definitely a lifestyle choice and it sounds like you are doing well.
Woohoo, congrats! That's very inspiring - you sure sound like you have a ton of motivation. Keep being awesome! 
Congrats! I also weigh less now than I did at 12. It's weird to think about because typically people get bigger when they grow up. Instead we're lighter, wtf?
YOU ROCK! CONGRATULATIONS! Time to treat yoself and buy some outfits to go with that rockin' bod. 
Thanks for sharing! Congrats from some stranger from New Brunswick, Canada! Just started back at the YMCA myself. Was getting overweight and decided to, at 40, get back to it. Never too early or late! :) 
Just wanna say congratulations on losing the weight! 
That is just amazing!  And so are you!
This is so awesome!!! That's SUCH a huge accomplishment and you should be so proud of yourself. The amount of dedication and hard work that must take is incredible. :)
Keep it up!!!  I'm so happy for you.  Things are a little stressful for me right now, so I just want to say that even if things seem complicated and difficult, you will find a way to turn all of it into strength and confidence.  I believe that you can do anything you set your mind to, and I don't need to know you to believe that.  You're awesome, and next time I am procrastinating on my practice sessions, I'll think of your post.
Im tryna get to an obese BMI myself totes jelly of your former glory.
Congrats! It's funny because 145 is actually my goal weight. Started at 176 this year and down to 163 as of this morning. Over the past three years I've gone from a healthy, yoga and cardio-loving 145 to a depressed, binge eating 176. I knew what successful weight loss looked like, but for some reason I couldn't get the wheels back in motion. Well, they are now and I'm feeling great about losing weight again.If you ever feel in a slump or you feel like you're gaining weight again, just remember that YOU CAN do it and you have the proof to show it.
Dude, you're totally me! I was super overweight in high school and the beginning of college, and I hit a 'normal' BMI last year. Gained a few pounds of it back (just enough to tip me back into overweight :/ ) but I'm working on it - gained some muscle mass, too.  Eating a whole foods plant based diet helped (aka being a healthy /r/vegan instead of eating oreos) a lot, especially cutting out added sugar! Keep it going! 
That's awesome!   I've been trying for years and recently found out I have a thyroid issue.  On meds now and have lost 5 lbs.  doesn't seem like much, but it's a start and something I haven't been able to do before! 
I'm so happy for you! Judging by your use of semesters I'm assuming you're in college and I know firsthand how difficult it can be to maintain a healthy lifestyle during that time. Good on you for getting your friend involved too!! Best wishes - keep going!
nominally healthy?  what does that even mean?  healthy in name only?
I'm currently age 19, 5'7" and 185. My heaviest was 215 at the same height. I'm working my way down and you're motivating me to keep going so thanks for that. I saw you put up a comment saying you're lighter than 12 year old you and I realized I'm lighter than 14 year old me.
I've recently decided to start to lose weight, so my first step had been to stop drinking fizzy pop/soda. 4 days in, going well so far
Great job! I recently lost weight from my heaviest (178 lbs) to my lightest since right before I hit puberty (148). Now I'm trying to build up some muscle mass after losing most of it during my period of weight loss (I lost weight in a very unhealthy manner).Keep up the momentum! Weight loss is exciting, especially when you get used to your new body. Have you had to buy new clothes? I had to refresh my entire wardrobe! I still need to buy new t-shirts and sweaters.
Please don't use BMI as a measure for healthy weight for yourself without understanding that it has severe limitations. Calculate your body fat % and just strive to keep it in there lower 20%s. That is all.
Remember to throw those scales away! Can't see your weight go back up if there are no scales ;)
Misleading title. Was expecting a post asking for advice on where to brag. Found bragging instead.
Definitely gonna keep it up now that I have momentum.Now that I think about it, it's ironic that I've picked up metaphorical momentum now that I've lost physical momentum
Lol same. I'm so glad I play a sport, because my sleeping and eating habits are TERRIBLE.
Thanks!5'4" or 1.62m depending on what you prefer. According to BMI, <107lbs is underweight, >145 is over, and >175 is obese
All the short guys I know at work are happily married to smart, funny, attractive women, have kids, and pull down really good salaries. I honestly don't know any short guys who are failures in any major part of their lives. Granted I'm a sample of 1, it's still interesting. 
Will keep it in mind. Once I feel I've lost all the weight I need to, I'll post before-and-afters
Thanks dude. I used to do judo and I know what you mean. I was the youngest one by 3 years and I was at a >20lb. deficit to whoever I partnered with.Just remember, you're at a disadvantage inside martial arts but one of the beauties of martial arts is that short people can learn to use their height to their advantage. So if you get into a legit fight you have a huge advantage.
I know a lot of people use the thyroid as an excuse to never lose weight. But you're basically doing what I'm doing on hard mode. That's way cooler than what I've done! I'm proud that you've seen at least some results, keep it up :)
Thanks and congrats to you too! My first round of weight loss was 4 years ago so I've had to buy new clothes. I went from between a L and XL to a flat M. Hoping to get to S by the time I'm done. I'd recommend keeping one of your largest t-shirts around (if you still have any) to wear when you're feeling down.In terms of pants, I believe I've gone from a 40" waist to ~32. It's bittersweet when your favorite clothes are falling off all the time :)
Yeah, I know it's not perfect. But for me, I feel it's fine. I'm not particularly muscular, so it's at least some degree of numerical measure of how well I'm doing.Good luck with your lifting btw! I'm hoping to start up on it in a few months or so.
Won't resent the scale if they just keep up the good work though. Gaining the weight back will only happen if one goes back to how they got fat in the first place.
Put that on /r/showerthoughts haha.
Which sport?
Congratulations! I'm a fellow short person, I feel like it's a lot easier for us to get unhealthy since you can put on more pounds relative to size. I'm still a couch potato but I hope I can be where you are. 
Well now you know one lol. Although I'm not that short I'm more in the below average category lol. Maybe that's why I'm unsuccessful.
I look forward to seeing your progress!
How many years did you train before you reached black belt?
I could see that happening pretty easily though. Hopefully I can keep up the hard work forever
Didn't think of that! will do lol
I play soccer. Nothing too serious, just joined the local rec team and it's a ton of fun!
Idk if my height had to do with it but for me it was years of junk food and overeating.If it's hard for you to start working out or dieting like it was for me, just try baby steps. One of the most helpful things I heard when I started was "if you're dying after a 100 meter run just remember you're still beating your past self."
On the flip side, it's much easier for you guys to look shredded as well. It takes less muscle mass to achieve the same level of definition of someone taller. 
On the upside, when we do lose weight it's a lot more noticable. Even just going from a higher to a lower healthy weight became visible pretty quickly (especially if you're a woman and wear tight clothes).
Give yourself time. :) Nobody starts out a complete success, as long as you're consistently working towards your goals you'll make progress. :) 
It was a volunteer thing for me. And I do miss it but it's good to be away and do my own thing for a while. Though I definitely think it influenced a lot of my habits and my life in general.
Don't listen to 'em, *I* believe in you! Practice a healthy lifestyle long enough and it just becomes the norm.
Your thread has blown up a bit wow. Nice!
Are there tryouts for such teams? I like soccer but I haven't played in about 15 years lol
That's encouraging! I'm hoping to hit my goal weight where I don't look fat anymore, then start some lifting.
I would love to know the trick to that!
Didn't quite expect it! but cool nonetheless
Well I'm just a high schooler. Idk if this is a thing everywhere else, but we can join teams that play against each other. Usually around 7-8 teams each with 15ish players, from 8th graders to seniors, but it's really relaxed for high school (elementary schoolers and MSers take it a bit more seriously). Tons of fun, especially since I can join a team with my friends!
To losing weight?
To be honest high schoolers would probably slay me. Are the teams you join public or are they just school teams?
I'm not as young as I used to be.
I wouldn't have been able to make class a lot of the time. I realized later that my career advancement probably kind of pushed me that way. I need to be available when I'm needed, simple as that.It's not the kind of school that has classes all the time. Class is 3 days a week. You go and train or you don't. I'd like to try another school but they'd never take me back, and if they did it'd be way awkward. It'd be way awkward at all anyway. I'm just rambling lol
Congrats. I'm 27 and I wish I had the courage to go back to school. I think you'll do great!
WOOOO OP can give us free healthcare
Here's the thing: in 2 years you'll be 2 years older.  So you might as well be 2 years older and a nurse!  Go get it!
You got this!!! I'm joining you in the exact same career change at 30. Feel free to PM me to commiserate! :)
Nice! Good luck! I signed to join the military and I'm 30. Well, provided my medical stuff comes through. It's never too late, right?
Good luck! I have a few nurse in my family and they all love their careers. It is very fulfilling from what they tell me. 
I'm also about to start nursing. How much can you potentially earn per year in your country?  I have no idea how well it pays
On a side-note, I like how you check your yoga pants for quality!
What's stopping you, if you don't mind me asking? 27 is nothing. I was at college with people in their 40's, and back in uni days one of the mature students was in his 60's easily.It's never too late to go back :)
Don't hold back! I work at a college in Canada and most of our students are considered "mature students."   If you are even thinking about it, contact someone in counselling or at my college, we have a department that can do program advising to discuss the many program options with you.
I might just do that - but only for my fellow redditors.  There's only a few of you, right?
I got my nursing degree at the age of 30. Great career! Both of you will do great!
It depends on where you live. The average annual salary for RNs in the US is $71,000.
Sounds much like the information I was given today.  Mine is in southern Ontario - perhaps it's the same school... do you know Steve? ;) (all but that last part is legit)
Thanks - this might just aid me in my next quest, finding the right fella post-divorce ;)
Yea, I've certainly thought about it. I've got a BFA in art and would want to go back to get a teaching degree. Might do it within the next few years. I'm getting married this June so my funds are a little tied up at the moment lol My plan (eventually) is to go into the Junior College near my home and sit down with someone to explore my options. 
UhhYeahYeah just a handfull
I was recently married too. I know the feeling! When you are ready to go to school, make sure to contact their financial aid department to see if there is any way to secure some free money - scholarships, bursaries etc. We have a lot of people that don't take advantage of them and have literally $1,000s left over. I can't say the same for whatever school you're interested in, but it can't hurt to find out.
More info on this? How would I approach asking about this as a student? Would I ask at the begining or end of a quarter?I am interested in asking about this but don't want to come off as tacky because I'm not completely sure what you're saying.
I do the same thing. It's kind of like a 'Thank you for taking time out of your day to respond to my post' kind of thing.
That's the courtesy upvote. The old guard here still does it.
I do the same!  I think there are more of us out there than we suspect.  
I do as well unless it's a non-contributing reply such as an insult or a really awful joke...
I find myself trying to upvote those that respond as well, but I still feel that the comment itself has to encourage more discussion as upvoted comments are supposed to. It's because of that most of the responses, both to my stuff and my own responses, should be adding to the conversation to be upvoted.
I do the same thing! There are times where I'll be posing a question that has multiple options and as long as the opinion is expressed in a respectful and clear way (aka not trolling, etc), I will upvote the comment because even though I may not agree with it, it is a nice addition to the conversation and it is good to hear what other people have to say about a certain subject.
I'm really bad at up voting :( it's not that I don't want to I just forget to all the time. I need to practice that more.
Same here, whenever I post a thread I do my best to answer to EVERYONE and to upvote their post. If someone replies back teh cycle continues :)I am one of the last I guess. 
Same! I always appreciate the little orange envelope 
How to karma:Step 1 - Reply to each one of /u/ultracrax's comments.Step 2 - ???Step 3 - Profit
Uugh, not getting an upvote when replying to someone's question or comment is annoying.  Frankly I think it's rude.
I have basically the same thing. I actually posted here about it and it was my top post for a while.
I'm going to start commenting on all your posts now.
Looks like I'm getting an upvote
This is why the people on CasualConversation are awesome!  I do the same thing, it's cool seeing that it's a somewhat common thing.  The only stuff I will ever downvote are really hateful or uncalled for comments.
I submit topics on CC fairly often; I always upvote anyone who comments. They're adding to the discussion, so they should be upvoted!
Let's test this!
I did until I had a post that got a lot of attention. It didn't make it to the front page, but it made it to the top ten of the "hot" category within its sub. It was a little overwhelming. 
Yeah whenever someone replies to my posts or comments I upvote them, but undo it if they're really mean.
Me too, unless it's something insulting or troll-y. Otherwise, thanks for taking the time to respond, friend! Here's an upvote :)I also upvote all posts that I comment on, as a general rule. 
I do that too if I remember. Just seems polite, unless they are being arse holes. 
I'm like you too. I know upvotes are anonymous, but I do it as a way to acknowledge I've read their comment.
I usually do the same on all of my social profiles, like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and so on... I think it's a way to thank the people that took their time to answer.
I'm just posting for a free upvote from /u/ultracrax.
Testing your theory 
What if they're just like, "Shut up, bitch"? You upvote that?How about "This" or "."?
What if it's a negative response, you piece of shit?
Isn't that just common courtesy?
I do it too but it's not a thank you. It's my acknowledgement that I got the message. It's disheartening when you write a comment and there's no indication that anyone has read it.
Me too!Just before looking at this post, I checked a comment I got in reply to me providing some advice. They said thanks but they didn't upvote. :(
Whenever someone answers one of your POSTS.   Plural. 
I do the same thing...but this post must be keeping you busy :P
I heard you were giving away free upvotes.
You are the best.  Plz send upboats this way.
My threads usually end in null. The simple fact I get any upvotes or comments means that it was given even a small bit of recognition, good or bad. I feel like any message I get or post reply message I get could potentially be someone tearing me a new asshole. It's nice when it's friendly, so I upvote.
I just figured it was common courtesy! 
Here's something even more rare: I never downvote. Never.Why would I downvote? What does it matter? If I don't like or agree with something, I go do something else.
Hi OP, im just here for the free upvote :)
Most people should. I kinda get upset when I comment on a TOMT or WtW post and they don't even acknowledge my comment. You're one of a kind, my friend. Keep it up. 
I bet you upvote everyone who comments in this thread too. Anyone who comments on my posts gets an upvote. 
Oh yeah? I bet you also give gold to people on occasion..."wink wink"
Is there a way to check and see if someone commented back? I feel like there should be. Maybe I am missing something. 
Have you upvoted all 281 (at this time) comments in this thread OP?
I also like to upvote the parent comment of any comment I upvote, just seems right to propagate credit upwards. 
I'll take my upvote now thanks
I'm relatively new to Reddit so haven't quite got into the swing of up/down voting. I've upvoted a few posts because I agree or because I like it. What do you do if you disagree with a comment? Still upvote because they interacted or downvote because you disagree?
I usually upvote the ~~posts~~ comments which are needlessly downvoted.
I wish everyone was like you! Reddit would be a better place 
Whenever someone phrases anything like you did in your title, I downvote it.
Same here. Even if they are disagreeing with me so long as they aren't flat out insulting.
What if I do it for my own satisfaction?
Redditor for 9 years.. You earned my respect sir!
Im only on reddit for a month or two and does that haha I've always been old school though!
It's a weird habit, but I use it as a way to keep track of what I saw and read on reddit. I rarely ever downvote anyway.
Yep, these are the only exceptions.
Oh, my friend is just like this. Now matter if Facebook, Instagram or whatever. And when it comes to answering messages.....However, I criticized him a few times, and now he's already getting way better.
Old School ;)
Lol me too 
Oh, I just found it and tried to upvote it ;))But it seems to be archived.
No it doesn't look like you're getting an upvote. You ARE getting an upvote.
What is CC?
Yes totally! Once I got downvotes in a Black Ops 3 comment section for a simple question. (-30 something). Then I asked why I earned so many downvotes: The result were -40 on my next comment.
Yes, I had posts like these too. However, I tried too.
Test succesfully completed.
I would upvote "this"But not the other two. As long as it's somehow connected to the post or is no insult.
+1No way out of my upvotes.
I know. I regret it.
Gold in my language means "downvote". You still want Gold?
Plz no probz+1
You're a legend!
All you have to do is be civil and I'll like you. In fact, having a civil discussion with those who disagree with me can be a really pleasant and even memorable experience. 
Even insulting and rude, no downvote. I'm just glad someone replied.
Well, sometimes, you end up being considerate of others by mistake. And they thank you. And you're being akward about it. And then you try to tell them you didn't try to be nice to them, just that you felt like saying that thing. And they thank you again. So at that point, making a dick joke, is the best option, so you won't look like you're fishing for that "i'm such a good person" compliment, or go to much the other way, and make an akward dick joke. 
I'll hit ten years next month. :) 
If you loved Ghost as much as I love Ghost, you wouldn't throw that word around.  :P
Exactly! That's another benefit from it. I realise this on posts that come out BIG.
I feels ya, I will practice some more. 
Yes. Why do you do this? Just curious :)
Haha yeah it's an oldie. I was pretty surprised it got so popular, I guess people are attracted to threads titled "I upvote almost everything" haha
Haha sweet, I thought you were gonna burn me for a second
Casual Conversation!
Me too. Different sub but I still got downvoted for asking an honest question. Not as bad as you, but it still hurt. Questions should never be downvoted unless they insult or belittle something. :(
I don't think I have ever had a post have so many replies it overwhelmed me, but CC replies are the best replies.
>I would upvote "this"I wouldn't, in that it doesn't contribute to the discussion. So why would you?
What if I got super unnecessarily mean?
I see that you have used "posts" correctly in other comments in this thread, so it was obviously just a typo...My bad for pointing it out.  It just seems like people are suddenly having a difficult time pluralizing certain words. Enjoy your afternoon. 
What about silver?
<3If we just replied to each other all night and upvoted each other you think anyone would notice?
Absolutely. I would never learn anything if I only listened to people who agree with me. 
Thank you.
Wow I always wanted to meet a veteran. How many meme wars did you survive?
Never saw it. Does this make me a bad person? 
Plus, another benefit of using RES is it keeps track of your upvotes. So if I ever see another user with a green +1 next to their name, I immediately think I must've already read/liked something s/he said before! It's always a nice surprise.
I already anwered it in my post.However, for me it just shows appreciation for taking time and means "Thank you for interacting with me!" in my eyes :)
9 months ago  you must have felt the same way like me at the moment. I never imagined it would get so many upvotes ;)
There's always a reason for being mean.If you have depressions or any suicidal thoughts, please feel free to contact the suicidepreventionlifeline.org !I hope I could help!+1
No probs dude.Thanks you too.But: *night
I do the same. I just did an ask reddit about this. We need to upvote those with contrary opinions to us or else the comment tree will not show up. If we upvote those we disagree with, the whole thing will be more likely to be read, and replied to.
Lol. I actually wasn't particularly active in the community aspect for a long time. Just as a source for information. So I missed out on most of it.
Looks like you've only been here a year? First and only account? Liking it so far?I've been here about 8 years. Was a lurker for a long time before finally making an account.Some days I feels like I've been on the website forever. I've been thinking recently of letting it go and finding something else, but it's been a huge part of my daily routine for years and years. Cheers!
No, but it is a good movie. Watch it with the wife. 
> green +1I've got people in dark green, +200s on here. :)  
Isn't that what you already mentioned? Oh I just googled what RES is. Wait, does RES make upvotes green, or are you colourblind? The upvotes are red...If not, go visit r/colorblindEdit 1: Ohhh, never mind! I just read your conversation with u/puttysan . Now everything makes sense.Edit 2: I just downloaded RES. How can you see the green upvotes?
To me this is how I pay respect to the other individual. Small and symbolical gesture. Where are you from?
Haha yeah but now I have a few posts that scored higher :p free updoots!
Maybe where you are, but here, it is just after 2PM. Afternoon.
T_D's mammoth sized leak makes me way less willing unfortunately. They ruin so many threads 
Alright. Yes just like me. But you know, here and there I visit some funny subs. A few memes never hurt nobody.
>Some days I feels like I've been on the website forever. Tell me about it!   
I will keep that in mind.  But we are making our way through Harry Potter first! 
Nice :) I'm surprised you're only at +3 for me. I see you everywhere.
Regarding the second edit, the upvote count only includes the times you've upvoted someone while using RES, so you won't start seeing it until you've used it for a bit.
Austria!Where are you from?
It's a shame, really. T_D started out as trolls that were actually making fun of the fact Chetto Tinyhands was even running. Now it's just bots and shitposting for easy karma. 
Trickle down ecoreddits.
>A few memes never hurt nobody. except for getting that one guy elected
Holy, 11 years over here! And very little karma. Is this an alt or you're just more into lurking? I've only started contributing comment-wise over the past couple months, myself. 
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. :) I'm by far the most active on this sub, because I love the community. 
A little south-east from you - Bulgaria :) 
Pepe Donald..
I use it mostly for the custom front-page but contribute occasionally.
Cool! You grew up in a rather rural area right? ;)
>Was a lurker for a long time before finally making an account.Hey man!Yeah i was a lurker for about 2 years.But interacting with the community is just way more joyful and I love it. I'm not a regular redditor. But from time to time i love to make a few post and comment on other posts. And I'm obviously fond of upvoting ;)Cheeeers
Actually I was born and grew up in the capital - Sofia. Though ?I live in the suburbs it is still an urban area. What made you think I had been living in the rural area? 
came from Askreddit, seems like my kinda place.**INITIALIZING: MEGA LURK**
I feel like I've walked into a room with a bunch of friends to hang out
EVERYBODY IS SO NICE
Welcome everyone, do not forget to be nice to each other. :)
im new. hi everyone! :)
Thanks to guibmaster for pointing out this nice subreddit. I think i'm going to like it here :D
Hi everybody new! I'm makin' bacon pancakes. Warm, meaty, cakey goodness for all.Unless there's a bunch of you. I only have two lbs of bacon. 
A sub that might help bring me out of my shell! Hi everyone, keep doing what you do cuz it's cool :)
Finally! A place where everyone is nice and I can feel safe. Hello, have a beautiful day :)
indeed ! i came here via askreddit and i'm loving it already
I was lead here from AskReddit.  Hey all! This place is so Amity from Divergent. 
I'm new and definitely need more positivity in my life. Hoping to stick around. :) 
Came here from the askreddit, I love you guys already! *group hug*
How do you create a new post? The "submit link"/"submit text" buttons in most other subs aren't here.
So many people from AskReddit. Heeeey guys! What's up?
Hello all.
It's all ogre now.
Oh my God this is my favourite sub ever. Anyone wanna start a conversation? I like dogs
Already had some lovely conversations on here. You guys are bloody great
I'm also new, ello :) 
And again today.
New here as well. What's up everyone? :) 
Definitely want to check out this sub, seems like a neat way to start the day.
I'm here specifically because it was mentioned. I've been looking for a sub like this for a long time. Probably gonna stick around.
Looks like it's going to rain for a while here. How's the weather where you are?
I don't know how any of this works even after I read a lot of it. 
Hi, I'm from ask reddit. I hope everyone is doing fine today :)
Senpai notice
That is how i found this subreddit, I think ill stay for a while.
That's how I found this!I'm so glad I did! :)
I discovered this Subreddit with it, seems like a nice place, I'm gonna stay here :D
HELP THERE'S TOO MUCH POSITIVITY
Bad askredditor, no lurking. Mandated chatting for all. 
Hahahahahaha, dude that's funny man, you are funny.
I do too, also, I'm new (:
Hi friend!
I don't even feel like swearing.
I know!Is this what Canada is like!?
One of the reasons I really like this sub :)
My kind of place!
Is anyone even capable of being mean when everyone's so nice? What's the worst this sub has seen?
Hello! How ya doing? :)
No, thank you for visiting! This subreddit is awesome!
That's only enough for two pancakes! 
Bacon pancakes? Wait, that's a thing? Why have I not heard of this delicious food before?   
I'm glad you're enjoying your stay! :)
Good and yourself?
Not much mate, you?
I have two!Both Shih-tzu mixes. How about you?
Hello there!
Hello! How are you doing?
Nothing much. You?
*clears throat* FUCK YOU YOU FUCKING FUCK AND YOUR FUCKING COMPLAINING ABOUT THE FUCKING AWESOME POSITIVITY!! There, better..?! 
I'll try. 
*casually pulls down lurker cloak* but social conversation scares me. 
So do I! Also new
**FUCK**^^^^^sorry
Mostly!  We get mean in a passive aggressive way, it's funny going to the States and seeing everyone so blunt and honest, makes me smile.  
I`m good :)how are you?
Oh noes, can we (please) stop this british prettiness?
Thank you Guibmaster for your work! :)
Such a good show. Can't wait for the new season.
Pancake batter on the hot griddle. Sprinkle chopped, crispy, bacon on top. Cook. Smother with butter and syrup. Die happy.Also good with grape or strawberry jam on top. Another variation is bacon *and* banana slices in the batter. 
Thanks! how long have you been here for?
Nothing really, chilling with a beer and watching the Scotland football match. 
How are you, OP?
How are you? :) 
this sub reddit is everything i love about ask reddit minus the negative folks
Just woke up, too lazy to get out of bed and my bro is back from Uni for Thanksgiving weekend (Canada). Life is good :) 
you're not /u/subvertedai!
That sounds like what I'm doing. Look at me, mom, I'm replying.
I'm just going to join this train I think. Peer pressure wins!
It's ok no one cares that much that you swore.
Where aboots in CAN? Calgary  here :) 
Can't complain!
sup nigga homie?
I wouldn't call it work XDI just made a comment.
I think it is a bit too staged, i really like it, but some things are a bit too much. 
Ah, you're from the UK too? Whereabouts, if you don't mind me asking?
I think OP is a fairly cool guy.
You too mate!
I want to say things too!
You didn't write something in your green dot. :o
Hey, don't speak for me! I fucking care!
I'm gonna like this sub.
What it is bruhh
Shetland Islands originally, but moved to Aberdeen a few years ago. What about yourself? 
Well, it was directed towards all of us.
I'm new too look at me!
Let's all say things.
I'm sorry. :(
Aww no one's ever cared about me before!
I like you
Yes.. yes it was. 
I love lamp.
*Was sort of hoping that you'd stay*
And I like *you*.
I guess we might as well join in then.
I love weed.
And I like me :)
Hey! Cool username
This is a really good idea, you're a pretty swell OP.My resolution was to start getting active, and I did! I'm in much better shape than I was last year, but I've kind of lost it all over christmas :( It'll be easier to restart this year than it was to start fresh last year though which is a plus.
OP this really touched me for some reason, I'm very cynical by nature and don't believe in New Years resolutions, but this year I just might make one... AND follow through on it.
This is the best damn post I've seen on reddit. Thanks for the dedication OP!
First kiss, check. Lost my virginity, check. Got an amazing and loving boyfriend, check. Lost over 100 pounds, check. Worked on my social skills majorly, check. I'm in a much better place than I was last new year's, and I couldn't be happier. 
You god damn big pimp you, thanks for doing this!
I'm piling more gold onto your haul. Reddit can be a very negative and discouraging place sometimes. Thanks for bringing so much positivity into the world! You've uplifted more than just the people with resolutions from last year. 
Wow, all these people you're following up on... This really makes me want to think of a good resolution and do it, but I'm terrible at making up goals.
OP, this is an awesome idea! I'm curious about something though. You had to post a lot of these on this thread, and the formatting is super consistent. Did you use a bot to make the comments here?
I started and finished my novel. So yeah. :)
Will /u/_kashmir_'s resolution be to make another one of these threads for 2017?RemindMe! One year "Message /u/_kashmir_ and ask if they achieved it!"
Will you be doing it again for this year. If so here's mine:Go to the gym moreEat healthier. Stop masterbating. 
Yep. I stayed out of the hospital this year (I really hope the fireworks won't be so bad in Hawaii this year, that I might have an asthma attack and break that record). Next year's resolution is to continue to stay out of the hospital and lose/keep off weight.
Yeah. Lost a lot of weight. Haven't been this thin since high school, which was a while back. this year, I just want to lose 15 more pounds, then tone.
A lot of it didn't get achieved. Things didn't go according to plan, some backfired terribly, and others just never came to fruition. I'm gonna make it my goal this year to be relentless! 
Well shit. I'm making the same goal again this year. This is the second time my porn account has been gilded. 
Somehow, I managed to achieve this goal, and will be attending the University of Pennsylvania next fall.Also I love you for doing this
Well shit 
Not quite, but close! My daughter is due in about 2 months.
Thank you! I was so close to achieving this goal, even made it on the team at a D1 school, but due to roster issues, I couldn't run this year. :( I'm glad I made it this far
Oh I forgot about this! Yeah I acheived this over this summer with a girl I liked a ton. You made my day man, happy new years!
Haha I totally forgot about that!!Currently weigh 168lbs so not too bad! Thanks for the reminder of that, made my day!
I actually did get a job! My self image is improving but I'm not quite there. Thanks for doing this!
Damn. Some wake up call this message was. Forgot I shared that goal online. Unfortunately the editing took a lot longer than expected and it's currently being read by beta readers now. I did however write a second novel instead of just waiting around for my beta readers to finish. So it does suck that I still haven't gotten it to agents, but I'm glad that I adapted to my circumstances and made an instantly new goal of writing another full novel in thirty days and I did accomplish that, thankfully.
Whoa. Thanks. I indeed started living. This past year i went out of my comfort zone, I'm in a relationship. I've been to different places in the world. Reconnected with family. I'm very grateful for your gesture. 
I did! I relapsed once in the beginning of the year, but I'm now a healthy weight due to swimming! Thank you for reminding me about this <3
Oh, wow, a year already? How quickly time flies! I actually did join a Skype group that helped me learn some Chinese and I was able to hold a conversation (albeit short) in Chinese! New Years goal partially accomplished!
Lol wow forgot about that. I am closer to taking his job, but also applying towards other positions with other companies. So sadly, still close to where I was, but only slightly better. Thanks for the message, it made me realize how little I am getting done. A bit depressing, but a good kick in the ass. 
Completely forgot about this!I'm glad to say that I passed my gcse's with an A in the course I'm studying (graphics) and at least a C in all of my other subjects. Now I'm studying the course I wanted to, although at a different college as the one I planned on going to cancelled my course before I started.I hope you had as great a 2015 as I did and I wish you an even better 2016!
I failed hahah
Interesting goal. 
Yep! I actually have surpassed that which is good, 2016's goal is to finish writing a book!
We are still waiting on that EP /u/MyPrivateNation189
Last submission: 2 Months ago, :(
Way late but I do have a very wonderful boyfriend, we've been together for a year, and we are currently apartment hunting. I lost my job then worked a shitty job for 4 months and have now been at a wonderful new job for a month so the apartment got delayed but we are looking. Hoping for an April 1st move in date!
/u/sawakonotsadako1231 san, kono tsuite ni oshiete kudasai ne.
A lot can happen in a few weeks...
I have done, basically, none of it. I am terrible at goals.
I'd just like to let everyone know that I'll respond to op in private as I'm not completely comfortable with the amount of attention this thread got. Op, I'll get back to you. 
Not exactly. I did start the project I wanted but the part of making my own life is on hold atm. I can't believe you remembered but thank you. The fact that a year has passed since I wanted to do this is making me think of more stuff. Hope you have a happy new year 
Wow! I totally forgot about this! Unfortunatly I had to undergo knee surgery before the season (yes as a highschooler) and I was unable to complete this resolution.
I completely forgot about this! 2015 has had its ups and downs but all in all it was a much better year than last year was for me. Met a lot of awesome people and did a lot of awesome things. Here's to a good 2016 and beyond!
Man, thanks for posting about me! I feel like I've learnt a lot, and adopted a lot of new positions. My years been alright, I haven't been doing anything too crazy, but I've booked a trip to Tokyo this summer, and while I technically wanted to do something insane a bit out of the ordinary last year, I think this will count, even if it ended up being  2016, rather than 2015!
As a matter of fact, I've had a very successful year. Thank you for this, it's a great way to reflect on how life has changed in the last year. How was your year?
I've got to say that's the first time I've been called a god damn big pimp, but I like it! 
Why stop masterbating? Is there a specific reason?
My pleasure!I will check in with you next year and hope to hear you've reached your goal weight. Best of luck!
Good luck brudda.  I managed to lose ~30 pounds by changing my diet (smaller meals and more often small snacking), next year will be (hopefully) the last 15 pounds
I will be checking in with you this time next year ;)Best wishes for 2016!
I have some bad news for you....
Congrats! Welcome to Penn :)
Yo, could I PM you if I decide to go there? I'm applying in a few days.
Hey! I like you.
Aww that's wonderful, congratulations!
Put more effort this year. Congrats!
I'd say that counts. The baby is "made" just not ready for general release.
I would say you did make it! Getting pregnant was the key, having the baby only gave you 3 months to get pregnant.But congrats!
Absolutely, you've come a long way and you should be very proud. Hopefully you'll be able to run next year!
Do It! Just Do It! **DO IT!**And share the damn thing already.
Two lbs in 24 hours - get to eating!!!
>But I still have the lingering feeling that any girl who likes me has some deep emotional flaw in her.Eh, we are all flawed. It's just a matter of finding someone who's flaws synchronize with your flaws.
Your first paragraph was one of the best written,most well balanced and uplifting reviews of a moment in someone's life I've ever read. It showed progress, maturity,  happiness and a great outlook on life.Your second paragraph was a kick in the teeth, negative thinking that you don't need and will set you back.I don't know you but tell second paragraph guy to sod off and get his head out of his arse.Be first paragraph guy, he's awesome.
Come join us over at /r/flying for advice and encouragement on the PPL!
Very glad to hear that everything is going well for you :) Keep up with the studying, happy new year!
I won't be online tomorrow (traveling), but I'd appreciate if you could add me for next year- lose 20 pounds - don't smoke tar cigs again (starting e-cigs in a week)Thanks :) 
I'm subscribing to this sub because of this. It's a fantastic thing you did. Look forward to replying tomorrow. 
2016 is the year to find a balance hahaPractice makes perfect, 60 words per minute can be your 2016 goal! I am curious as to how many words I can type, I am going to try it out later on!
If it makes you feel any better, it's actually 2/3 
Glad to hear things are going well for you! Where did you travel? One of my favourite quotes is: *Life begins at the end of your comfort zone*.Happy to be of service :)
Slightly better is better than stagnant! You're welcome, hope you either get your boss' job or get another great job in 2016. Best of luck!
My floors thing was 'swole is goal' I think we all failed lol
Big congrats to you! Good luck finishing your book, I've got no doubt you'll do it :)
You can do it! :) I'm on schedule to finish my first EP by April :D
He got the SO then
Since it's impossible to quit reddit, there really only is one thing that could have happened. RIP!
2016 is your year! Choose two or three goals instead to make it more manageable :)
Sure thing! I will remove your goal if you want?
That's unfortunate about your knee, but hopefully you'll be able to complete it in 2016!
You're most welcome.It definitely sounds like you've come a long way from last year! And absolutely booking a trip to Tokyo is rather crazy, I would know as I went there myself a few months ago!! It is AMAZING, you'll have a blast.
I've been to japan.  That place is the shit and you're going to love it.  Lots of 7/11s.
Maybe they've been running for 5 months! ;)
This sounds like it could become a tradition, then get really fucking depressing.  And I'm selling the screenplay!
Hello other numpad pattern username. 
The confidence is strong in this one
Man give me all dem uighurs
You just gave him a member of a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority that mostly inhabit the Xinjiang region of China.
I love the word uighur.
lol thanks for the laugh
As a part-Uighur I gotta say uh thanks for the exposure?
Ah, that explains the flair
TFW being well liked isn't realistic. Jks yeah SMART is a good system 
If I put all the people who like me in a room, you'd get pretty bored being alone after a while. Jks it's not that bad luckily. 
Thank you :)!

Yeah, do not share your bit on reddit. At all. Your sharing needs to happen at a club, not on here where something that could propel you into a different career path could be stolen at whim. Just two cents from someone who has walked that road :)

At some point it just stopped changing letters and just threw the same nonsense words with q in them at me repeatedly. That got old pretty fast.
I got a higher paying job with more hours so it was more achievable! How did your resolutions go?
What's an EP? Sorry for being out of the loop.
It's a she.
I'd prefer to believe he got the SO earlier this year, but she was actually crazy and they broke up after a month or so. She then went on to reddit stalk him and he had to jump ship for a new username. 
Will do. I know i can finish ASOIF, watch  more movies, and read more books. This is the year.

You have a pattern that's easier to remember.
I only had one, sorry. They're super hard to catch.
Huh. TIL I'm a human trafficker.
Dude you just answered a huge question for me.  My new boss seems like he's afghani or something but he's not, and someone said he's from China or that the Chinese took his family's land.  Maybe he's one of these guys.  An upvote.  
You're totally welcome. Thanks for being cool about me using your ethnicity for karma!
I'm confused. What flair?
Wait, so you have a baby, you just can't hold it yet.

Sounds like a great year for you!Mine went very well thank you, I went travelling and ticked quite a few things off my bucket list (travel solo, Tokyo, bullet train, Kyoto, Rome, Vatican City, see the Pope, Florence, Vienna) and I graduated with the highest marks on my degree course. Here's to 2016!

Ask him about the food.  The Uigher community has their own style of cuisine and it is delicious.
Trust me. You can impress people with this knowledge!
Untill it's time to pee...
Wtf you're like the resolutions wizard
The slotted spoon doesn't hold much soup. 
Hey man, the one Uighur per comment law is intended to help preserve their population for the future.  You don't want Mick Jagger to have to explain to your great-grand children what a majestic Uighur once was using only drawings and crude hand gestures, do you?
He often goes on about food and said European food sucked.  He said kebabs and Turkish food was good but for whatever reason he's never really said where he's from.  He speaks something that doesn't quite sound like Arabic.  He's definitely Muslim and has family all over the world.  I think he's one of these upvote people.  
You just need a big bowl of very salty soup followed by that liter of water. The salt will make you retain water and the weight will stay on for a couple days. 
We'll he cant be following up on everyone else resolutions if he didn't complete his own. Just gotta take it one step at a time. 
Uh guys uighurs are an ethnic minority in chinaAnyways happy new year everyone
Why not just drink the water salty? I guess it's for weaklings who don't like the taste of salt...
Apparently this post is now Sparta
They do indeed! It's something we've had in the works for a week or two now, and it's finally a part of the sub :) Glad to hear you like it!
I really like upvotes now because you see something funny when you upvoteAyy Imao
I actually never even noticed that :oShame that it doesn't work on reddit mobile apps :c
Upvoted every comment because I just now saw this. thx
Must. Try. This.
Woah, who put these in ;) 
Just for that, I think I'll just hand out upvotes in this thread! This is great. And just noticed the snow on the banner too. :)
Upvoted everyone to see it. It works! COOL!!! Now I'm wondering if everyone sees the same message for a particular comment. Probably, since I'm pretty sure /u/ahampster saw "THIS IS SPARTA!" as well as me.
I asked you guys for quotes yesterday ;) upvote some comments, look around and try finding your submitted quote!
Batman upvotes too
Woah, people may start to upvote posts more often!
Just upvoted absolutely everything! Also, Merry Christmas guys! :D
Beautiful feature. Thanks mods!
Feel free to try it out on this comment!
I was upvoting this post and listening for it to speak, shit. 
I'm so entertained right now
Batman upvotes too lol
Tis the season for it :D
You're super cool!
Dude, it's sweeeet.

This is seriously cute and just makes me want to upvote everybody for the little message :O
Yours said ayy lmao when I upvoted lol.

I'm glad I'm not the only one who did this.
Ohhh that's what those were for! Hahaaha I'm going to up vote everything looking for this is sparta!
We have the best mods!
You're cool!
lol u silly
Tiz the season *
Thanks! I doubt myself a ton though. Loving this update 
same here. I upvoted venv's comment and it said Noice as well.. :D
When I upvoted you, it said "my precious"
I can't personally take credit for some of the awesome recent CSS changes, but I can tell you as a part of the mod team it's really great to hear you're enjoying it! I love the snow too - perfect for getting into the spirit!(I also won't be having a white Christmas - it's just rain, rain, and more rain here!)
thats why i put ayy imao

Thanks for the upvote!
you got an "over 9000" from me - merry xmas holmes :)
Apparently, every comment gets a specific comment, because that's what I got, too. Also, if you un-up vote and reupvote, it shows the same comment.
Because you knew what the upvote on yoir comment would say?
You are so kind
What are these words?
squares...
/u/CrashWho is p cool, apparently
You got a CJA > GoA from me lol. Poor /u/GodOfAtheism...
if you take away the upvote then upvote again the message pops up again
Windows emoticons ;)
Upgrade your fonts! They're Santa Clauses, according to the recent versions of the Unicode standard.
We have a long lasting rivalry.
Wow, didn't realize that was in there. Thanks.
You get an upvote. And you get an upvote.
Oh god...Guys, fix this please.One of the upvote lines is "You're genius is showing!"FIX. THAT. NOW.It's "Your", not "You're". How do people make it out of school without knowing this? This is basic grammar....Sorry. Please fix it though.
It's okay, shes just jelly because I mod high quality discussion subs like /r/circlejerk and all she mods are terrible maymay based subreddits like /r/casualconversation
Nice upvote.
They're not Windows. It's a standard that Windows, iOS and Android (among others) implement.
I shiver you?
I was not the mod who actually wrote in any of the comments, so I'm not responsible! ;) Perhaps /u/tizorres can change that for us?
WOOMP THERE IT IS!!
Oh, weird it doesn't show up for /u/TruthfulDeception then, and I assumed it was a Windows thing, because I only see them on my Windows Phone and laptop (windows 8) I used my brothers macbook once and it didn't show them :O
Change what? 
One of the upquotes is spelled in correctly - "You're genius is showing!" should be "Your genius is showing!"
My very special cat has been missing for over 2 weeks now. I live in a pretty small town but no one has seen any sight of him. I miss him so much, I keep hoping he'll walk up on my porch and everything can go back to normal. God I miss him so much...That's so cool you have your cat back, 6 years is a crazy long time. I hope my cat comes back sooner then 6 years..! 
He looks in very good shape. Do you think he had other "owners" in the interim?
Awh congratulations! That's amazing. I would cherish him so much. Does his brother recognize him? Does he recognize you? 
That's amazing! How did the vet recognize him? Is he microchipped? I'm so happy you were able to be reunited!
Our outdoor cat (more of a farm cat than a pet) got hit by a car a few months back. Basically disappeared for a week.Then one day, bam, she shows up at, like, midnight when I'm hanging out with some people. Slight limp, cut in front of nose. A week later, no limp, cut healed. As far as I can tell she didn't even break anything.That cat is twenty two years old.
Why don't you post this story to r/Cats also?Is he chipped?I know you said he ended up in the back of someone's van, but how did you even find that out, and what was your Mom told when he answered the call and then went to pick him up?
I hope your cat comes back :( waiting and hoping for him to walk back through your door must be terrible. Good feels your way :)
If you haven't already, sprinkle some used litter from his litter box around your yard. Also set out a box with your worn clothes in it. Scent plays a huge part in finding lost pets.I lost a cat a few years back, and I read through hundreds of pages about finding lost cats so I have lots of advice if you want some, just let me know.
I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope he makes his way home soon. Is he microchipped? Have you asked neighbours to double check garages? Missing a pet is the worst feeling. 
My dog went missing for three weeks. We hung posters and all that, but also kept the door open. Three weeks later she came in the middle of the night and opened the door. Best fucking moment of my life waking up and seeing her. 
When this happened to me, I left tuna in bowls on my porch and around my house outside with water and would check at night to see if it had been eaten or see what was eating it until I got my cat back.
See, now I feel a bit bad.  My dog was found on the street and no one came to claim her at the pound after several weeks, so we got first pick for adopting her.  What if her family still misses her and wants her back?Then again she was found without a collar and is a breed of dog that tends to be abandoned according to Wikipedia.
Holy shit. When you said he came running up the hill, I instantly had flashbacks of Homeward Bound. Thanks for making me cry this morning, jerk.Seriously Congrats! I can't imagine how your kids must feel! 
He's been very hesitant around the other cats and there has been some hissing so I don't believe they do which is sad. I think he does? He certainly recognised my Dad, none of the cats really like my Dad as he's loud and Benjie wouldn't go near him, and to me that says he recognises us? I can't get enough cuddles he must be sick of me! 
I swear farm cats live longer than other cats I've heard of. I've read a lot of Reddit comments about their barn cats living super long, with or without veterinarian assistance (shots, etc). 
Yes he's microchipped, it's so worth getting done. We asked around and the carpet fitter had rang the neighbour whose house he was working at as a cat had bolted out the back of his van but we only found this out by asking around. My Mum thought that they had either found Benjie dead or he was alive as its not the vets we normally go to. But it turns out he's alive! She was given the details of the lady who had been feeding him and we went up to go see her and thank her. She was a little upset to see him go as he's a lovely cat but we're going to send her some flowers and a photo of him 
Thank you for this wonderful story.
Sadly I got rid of any litter he used before, but that would have been a great idea. I've been out every night shaking treats and calling his name, I've attracted all sorts of other cats except him..I have hung up posters of him but no one has called about it. If you know any other tips please let me know! I miss him so deeply. He's been an indoor cat most of his life, he adjusted the outdoors really well but it rained one night when he went outside and I had unfamiliar family over and I think he lost sent of home, that's my guess at least.. 
Oh lord my heart aches thinking about him surviving through the winter without me. Don't scare me like that :( But you give me hope, people are right when they say they are good at taking care of themselves, I love him like crazy I just have worried mother syndrome lol 
Look at it this way, you've just taken a lost dog home so even if he is technically still owned by someone else you're still doing the right thing by taking him in and giving him a home. You are his new family and I bet he's happy with you. 
What breed is that?
Hey OP, maybe this is my app but it says page not found when I click the link. Is it working from your end? I'd like to see your kitty!
Nah, the hissing is them figuring out his place in the hierarchy is all. They probably remember him.
Yes. I'm not sure why I'm being downvoted for suggesting a spiritual sister sub. But oh well. lol 
Someone in the neighborhood may have also taken him in. I hope you find him. I've experienced something similar and it's a horrible feeling being separated from a pet so abruptly. 
A Maltese.  It's a small, white, yappy lapdog breed.
My app thinks the comma is part of the URL, that may be your problem
I never knew cat hierarchy was a thing. I always presumed the cats got on or didn't. How does it work with cats?
I'd never seen that sub before but now that I've checked it out I can see why you'd suggest it. Just based on the name it sounded like you were taking a jab at OP.
A lot of people have been saying that and I'm starting to think that, I would rather someone be taking care of him then he's hurt or stuck somewhere hungry :( And if that is the situation I hope they give him back to me! He's very affectionate and unique, a lot of people love him..
Like the other person said, it might be worth going around and asking your neighbors. When our cat went missing, it turned out a guy on the other street had taken him in. Our cat is mean, however, so he ended up bringing him to a shelter haha
I have a cat that likes to sneak out door when it's open. He'd run out and I'd try to chase him, but he's too quick. Usually he'd be back in an hour or so, but one time he was gone for three days. I called the shelter and the vets, but nobody had seen him. I live in a city, so I assumed the worst. On the third day, he was at my door fatter than he was before. I can only speculate that somebody thought he was a stay (we have a lot of them) and tried to take him in. Only he pulled the same BS he did with me to them. I hope that's what's going on with your cat.
Ah, makes sense. It's a shame he was trapped for so long. When he leaves at 7 with the cats, do they walk your son to school? It would be cute if they left when he did.
He doesn't wear a collar or anything, he's so incredibly adorable anyone would want him as a pet. If that is the case, I'm hoping he's being fed and taken care of and he's dry and warm. I hope whoever brought him in their home gives him back to me ): I wrote on my 'missing' posters that "he is very much loved and missed and we want him to come home"
Mine doesn't wear a collar either because he hates them. I hate that people have to do this, but offering a reward might prompt people to return him faster if they are keeping him.
Haha, nice job man. I'm kinda in the same boat except I have yet to tell her. We hang out regularly though, so some day soon I hope I get the courage.  
Hell yeah, bud. Congrats. I accidentally read "art fair" as "air fart" and said what the freaking fuck? But then my brain unfroze and all was well again. Have fun! Don't worry too much! 
Men like you are the reason I get up with a smile in the morning and a spring in my step.This made my day.This here proves traditional yardsticks to measure a person  mean fuck all  when your character and gut to keep trying outweigh everything else.Congratulations brother
I hope you don't mind but I'm totally stealing the phrase "holy fuckamole" for future uses. That's awesome though!
Congratulations to you dude! It seems like these feelings following a 'confession' never changes whether you're a teenager or an adult. Also, kudos to you for letting your feelings known instead of rejecting yourself and thinking you're not good enough. I'm glad you didn't text her in the meantime when you waited for her reply. Have fun at the fair and just be yourself!
Way to go, op. Just remember that she's going to be as nervous for you, so that's something else you have in common besides classes and taste in art. Everything is going to go wonderfully.
Nice job man. Just keep being you and everything will be fine. Just a bit of friendly advice, don't put too much pressure on the date. *Almost* treat it as if you guys are still just hanging out, that's what did the trick for me when I got some unexpected dates. The best thing is to just continue being yourself, don't try to change any of that up. She said yes for a reason, if you change shit you won't be able to find out what that reason is.
Nice job dude! Im sitting here in a full train with a big fat grin on my face, but they will never guess that I just read some amazingly uplifting news. Thanks for that :D!
Awwwww, congrats! Hope it goes well :)
I only hope you dont get too worked up over it. Obsessing over a girl or putting her on a pedestal is a good way to scare her off. Dates are a good way to see if you guys can have a laugh together. Take it easy and try to enjoy each others company and see what their made of. Enjoy yourself, dont take it too seriously! Remember, if you guys cant laugh and smile together, it wasnt going to work out anyway.
Okay. That's fine. I'm fine.
Congratulations!
Honestly no time like the present, strike while the iron's hot ya dig.  Just don't be one of those freaks that lashes out like a complete asshole if you're rejected cuz that's not cool at all.
i hope it all goes well for you!! tell her face to face cause she might be waiting for an answer as well heehee! :)
Same for me, we really got close over this past semester, but I'm not going to see her until school starts again. I don't know where I'm gonna find the courage to tell her how I feel
I have almost exclusively been calling it "the fart air" so don't sweat it
I did the same mistake, and now I feel less stupid. Thank you.
Holy shit that's gotta be one of the nicest things I've ever read.  You rule.
LOL all yours dude, it's one of my favorites
Well this is probably by far the most embarrassing thing on my Reddit account so that's alright LOL
Thanks for the good vibes man.
Oh yeah totally.  We talked a little bit about the whole "don't want it to get weird if it doesn't work out" scenario so I wanna make it as easygoing as possible.  I'm a simple dingus so all I know is how to be myself anyway, and like you said if that was good enough then hopefully I'm all set.
Oh no I totally agree.  I learned a long time ago not to do that.  I'm definitely nervous but not... freaking out I guess.  Let's say cautiously optimistic??We've hung out 1 on 1 enough that I'm already sure that it's gonna be awesome.  Just a matter of not doing something catastrophically dumb I guess, whatever the hell that could even be.
I wasn't planning on telling her over text messages so it'll have to wait a few days haha. She's coming over next Thursday, maybe I'll tell her then.And no worries on the anger part, I'm not like that thankfully. I've been rejected before by someone else, I can handle it! 
I don't know how long that means you won't see her, but why not invite her to meet up somewhere to do something fun together? Thinking back I've done that too. We had a two week break so I invited her to go play pool and it was really fun! Plus, you can use that to gauge her interest in you a bit. 
I like to bring in the cannoli element, personally. holy fuckannoli.
Yeah.  Smart.  The text message thing was dumb as hell on my part.  All it did was amplify the anxiety of the situation like tenfold.  Plus I'm better with my mouthwords than my... fingerwords?  Whatever I'm dumb but you got this man it's gonna go well for sure.  FOR SURE
Did you do it??
Well she lives about 2 hours away from me, but she's gonna be volunteering at a camp all summer, that's about 8 hours away. I did manage to meet and have dinner with her day before yesterday (I was on my way out of town and was passing through where she lives) and we both had a good time. She leaves for camp this week, and gets back two weeks before classes start. 
Well this is interesting, around here my friends use "holy fuckaroni", with macaroni. I had no idea there were other versions haha
Just wanted you to know that I'm totally stealing "fingerwords" when talking about things like this. That was awesome! 
Yeah, I already kind of shake when I ask her to come over, I don't think I'd survive telling her I like her over text without a heart attack. 
Oh hey! Nah I didn't. When it comes to moments like these I get scared at the thought of even saying it. It's a fear I'll have to overcome very soon! As for our time together though, it was really fun and sweet. Ended with us laying side by side, my head on her shoulder, playing Life is Strange. So it's not all bad :) 
Aw, that's not easy. I guess beside texting there isn't much to do. All I can think of is video chatting maybe. Be sure to make use of those two weeks between camp and school :) 
Only if I get to take "Mouthwords"
Ahaha I feel that dude.  When I finally hit send I literally threw my phone down and went for a run without even checking to see if the dang message sent because the idea of sitting there waiting to hear my phone beep was making me borderline nauseous.
I was just browsing the top posts and came across this, I was intrigued, if a bit late :PThat does sound like a lot of fun, I can see why you'd be nervous about doing anything when it seems like you've already got such a good gig going. However, that does sound like youre already pretty close and maybe she wouldn't totally against the idea anyway... If you really do want something more, do yourself (and maybe her) a favour and don't wait too long, you may regret it. I'm nobody to tell you what to do, but that's definitely what I'd say to myself if I could speak to past me. Good luck :)
Screw you guys I'm stealing both of them
Top posts huh, I didn't realize this thread got so big haha. But you're absolutely right, I shouldn't wait too long. I'm still figuring out the how and when and where in my head, but in the meantime I'll just keep having her come over as much as I can. After next week we won't have to worry about college anymore either for a few months, so that should give me all the time I need for that!But I appreciate the advice! It's in line with what some friends have been telling me. I just gotta do it. 
Always happy to help :) Nice long summer without college, plenty of time to make your move. Good luck man, I hope it goes well for you :)
Thanks! Since this thread is apparently so high on the top posts I'll leave an update here once I've made my move. I'm forgetful as hell though so if future readers here don't see any update, don't worry, just pretend it all went well and I just forgot to update :)
How in the fuck was PresidentObama not already taken?
What are you going to do to end the corrupting influence of money in politics during your second term?

It's been stated that your favorite television show is The Wire. How do you think the war on drugs has affected America, and would you work to end it?
My question is this: Why would you sign the NDAA when it included language that would allow the indefinite detention of Americans without due process. I understand that this was the de facto case for awhile. Now it's law. This passed by overwhelming bi-partisan support, despite being hated by most citizens. It feels like the government, including the Executive branch, no longer work for the citizens that elect them. (By the way, I fully supported your first campaign, but I'm now disillusioned and disappointed.)

The decision to surge our forces in afghanistan.  Any time you send our brave men and women into battle, you know that not everyone will come home safely, and that necessarily weighs heavily on you.  The decision did help us blunt the taliban's momentum, and is allowing us to transition to afghan lead - so we will have recovered that surge at the end of this month, and will end the war at the end of 2014.  But knowing of the heroes that have fallen is something you never forget.
Duck-sized horses sound incredibly cute.
Hey! I saw this comment on TV! 
Internet freedom is something I know you all care passionately about; I do too. We will fight hard to make sure that the internet remains the open forum for everybody - from those who are expressing an idea to those to want to start a business. And although there will be occasional disagreements on the details of various legislative proposals, I won't stray from that principle - and it will be reflected in the platform.
For proof, did he send you a picture of him holding a dated index card? Or did the Secret Service land a helicopter on your house?
Welcome to Reddit, Mr. President.
Win or lose, I'll be thanking everybody who is working so hard - especially all the volunteers in field offices all across the country, and the amazing young people in our campaign offices.
It seems like each new President brings a new direction to the Space Program. With Bush we got Constellation, and you brought us more of a focus on Science missions. Do you have the ability to give NASA the power to choose it's own direction and not be hampered by whatever the President and Congress are feeling like that day? Let me be clear, I love the direction that NASA is headed in currently but they could do so much for. I think that just as much as NASA clearly needs a larger budget, they need the power to use that budget effectively.
Making sure we stay at the forefront of space exploration is a big priority for my administration. The passing of Neil Armstrong this week is a reminder of the inspiration and wonder that our space program has provided in the past; the curiosity probe on mars is a reminder of what remains to be discovered. The key is to make sure that we invest in cutting edge research that can take us to the next level - so even as we continue work with the international space station, we are focused on a potential mission to a asteroid as a prelude to a manned Mars flight.
As a girl about to finish my aerospace engineering degree- Please? I promise to spend my life creating the first black hole probe... You know you're curious too.
How the hell did you guys pull this one off?
Good luck with an answer for this one. So far the Obama administration has skirted this conversation at every turn. It's really the biggest flip-flop Obama has committed as president.
Of course this goes unanswered. That REALLY infuriates me. Why does everyone in government just avoid this? Is there some secret reason they keep it illegal? God dammit that pisses me off to no end.
20 bucks says he doesn't address this
Why did you include a link? Did you think he would not know what the metric system is?
The president must be so nervous right now...he just got a comment from shitty_watercolour.
Specifically by persecuting people involved in state sanctioned medical marijuana programs ( which you and Holder promised your administration wouldn't do?). 
He probably has something to promote. 
I am a Canadian.... Just want to say that George Bush took 8 years to wreck your country... You should give Obama 8 to fix it.... 
I'm actually surprised he was able to answer *any* questions after breaking Reddit.
Not to mention the site issues. It still took me a while to get to this post hours after it was supposed to have finished.
Get us out of there. Place is a damn nightmare.
I saw it on reddit, as a picture of it on TV.
I'm surprised the username PresidentObama was even available. Or is the man powerful enough to just take it over anyway? I'd hate to see the leader of the free world reduced to taking a username like TheRealPresidentObama or POTUS69 or xx_BarackObama_xx or something.
9 minutes and already 200+ comments.Good luck, Obama. You're going to need it.
Hey Mr. Obama, can you tell us something we're not supposed to know?
ONE OF US. ONE OF US.
You must have enormous balls to admit you do illegal drugs on the one thread that the FBI is definitely monitoring.
I'll take that as "Poppin bottles of Cristale like it's 1969"
>a asteroidan asteroid, Mr. President.
The meme has become self aware. 
Ladies and gentlemen: the President of the United States of America referencing his meme.Good night and God bless.
"- NOT BAD!"It was at this point, Reddit ejaculated in glorious unison.
NEXT ON FOX NEWS: DOES BARACK OBAMA NEGLECT HIS DUTY AS A PRESIDENT, SPENDING HIS TIME PLAYING GOLF IN THIS ECONOMIC STATE? STAY TUNED.
So honoured that the President of the United States has responded to a question I asked him.
Obama approved beer. The best around.
He should count his blessings. I'm quietly relieved the top comment isn't from POTATO_IN_MY_ANUS.
"omgomgomgomgomg!!! THE Shitty_Watercolour!"-Leader of the Free World
UGH. I hope it's not some kind of fucking cologne or miracle supplement. 
He's got access to presidential bandwidth :)
This too. This thing crippled reddit for about an hour and a half. Honestly, it's amazing that the President managed to get through enough to post what he did.
Tell me about it.   I haven't gone a day without thinking about it and I have been home for almost three years now.
It's a shame he didn't answer. I'd have liked to see the response.
Dude what. I'm internetfamous now.
I was very surprised by this as well! But I bet if the president wants a reddit name, there are ways of obtaining it...
POTUS_IN_MY_ANUS
It's pretty funny because people used to get scolded for doing a request for Obama because he'd never do one. 
Thank you for showing the president of the United States how classy us redditors can be.
I'm still waiting for learning cursive to pay off.
Ahaha... I can just see you telling everyone you know tonight "I corrected the president on his grammar today."
You're about to get a knock on your door. 
A grammar nazi's greatest dream... *"an... Mr. President... An.."*
Even the president isn't safe of Reddit. 
That's it. Shows over folks. All the grammar nazis can go home now. Forever.
The secret service will be at your door shortly. Remain calm and do not resist. 
If the president says it's a asteroid, it's a asteroid.
don't correct the President, neckbeard.
/redditWE'RE DONE HERE.
I feel a disturbance in the force, as if millions of redditors were silenced in awe.
Gotta love a President that quotes his own meme
Dude, you can't reply to President Obama and type "ejaculated". Dick move bro.
Hey. That's my boss. Don't use the "E" word. He'll think I'm a pervert for being part of this site... and then he'll block it on military networks. 
Only on the Internet will someone actually respond to the president of the united states with, "damn right you are".
you mean: damn right you are, Mr. President.
This may be the most appropriate use of this meme in reddit's history.
As a member of the non-US free world. Did my vote get lost in the post?
Let's stick to questions about the movie
Correct me if I'm wrong but it doesn't matter if you have a 1000 GB/s download speed, if the itself site is down you're gonna be seeing jack shit.
I'm loving the idea that the president was sitting around frustrated by the 503s like any other redditor. Would have been even funnier if it resulted in a double post...
I was wondering if somehow they gave his username priority access, or whether POTUS had to hit refresh.  "These servers... are getting hammered!"
TIL Roseanne Barr and a dude named Merlin are both running for president.
I'm sorry, man :(If you live in NYC, I'll buy you a beer.
Is that Socks?
that would be the first lady's
If Obama made a "Nobody cares Apostolate" post, I would retire from reddit, realizing that nothing would ever top seeing that.
I read this, and immediately got a knock on the door. Shit myself.Found myself eating pizza 2 minutes later.
I'm a total grammar nazi.  My favorite joke:Knock, knock...Who's there?To...To, who?To WHOM...
This is the best grammar nazi-ing he will ever get in his life. Correcting the sitting president of the united states. Let him live the dream.
Let's just be thankful the guy that corrected him didn't have a screenname like i_rape_cats
Pack it up people, our job is done.
THE INTERNET IS OVER! EVERYBODY OUT!
Joe Biden?
And get upvoted more than the POTUS.
PRESIDENTIAL BANDWIDTH!! *hand waving*
Am I the only one that read every one of his posts in his voice?
He was reading this.
Did you clean up the shit first?
A riveting story...I laughed, I cried, I came.10/10
We had a good run, but its time to move on.
..I want to watch the credits roll, and I need to finish my drink. Give me a minute!
I think the White House would be happy to know Biden's only into reddit. It might keep him busy enough not to talk to the press, and the worst leak that might come out of it is to know Biden's subscribed to /r/mylittlepony or /r/gonewild. 
That would be a lot of work though...
Pack up the accounts, you too Apostolate. Yes, and the novelties. Our journey has reached its end. 
I'll drink to that!
Do you remember the last time a fired Reddit employee did an AMA? I highly suggest she take all this online goodwill and get a high paying, lucrative PR job. 
"Victoria will be helping me out today!"
Her doing an ama would unleash more popcorn than when the last employee got fired 
Holy shit that was fast. I totally support this request. Maybe she can get help from Victoria :)
I doubt that she will. I'll bet that when she signed her contract to work for reddit she signed a non-disclosure agreement or something of that nature which prohibits her from discussing her firing. 
Surely the first question has to be "why were you fired?"
IM trying to find her contact info since her email wont work most likely. anyone got a lead?
She almost certainly has a confidentiality agreement
What the fuck?! I leave for 3 hours and this has dropped from 10k votes to 5k?Uhm... something's fishy, here.
Holy shit...14532 and 97% upvotedNever thought I'd see that unless Snowden and Assange announced they were getting married. 
Did this post just go from 17k to 10k upvotes?
/u/chooter, you're our only hope.
I just want her to do an AMA so we can salute her o7
Now do one for the creator of secret santa too. It's not just Victoria. Reddit wants to gut the heart of the company apparently. Apparently having a popular site isn't enough for them, and so they want the real fans that helped build the site, get stepped on until they fall in line. 
Guys, can we please stop buying Reddit Gold for a day. I feel like that'll make more of statement than the blackout bullshit. That money goes to support Reddit's higher ups. 
Why the hell would she want to come back to add publicity to the site she got fired from? And why would we want to demean her by asking her to do that?
How did it go from 16k upvotes to 10k in 2 min???
Wtf the upvotes went down ?
1. Why are you so awesome?2. Will you be my friend?3. Considering all you have done to help the reddit (AMA), community, how would you like to see the sub evolve, grow, or change (or not)?4. Coke or Pepsi?
This topic had 17K votes a a little bit ago? With 97% upvotes, how did it lose almost 50% of it's votes? seems shady.After I posted this, it went back to 10k, now back down to 7k. Way to make a bad situation worse. Is Reddit tampering with it's vote system? The entire basis of it's existence. Great job EP.
Butt stuff.
I want this AMA just for that line
"Victoria will be helping me help Victoria today" - new AMA intern.
popcorn tastes good
Could you shed some light on the "last employee"? Don't think I was around for that one. 
You either die an admin or live long enough to see yourself host your own AMA
#karmatrainBut in all seriousness i want to see her side on this issue, as its the most important
I know her number. I'll try to call her. Haven't talked to her in a while though.
RIP my reddit account 2014-2015
I bet Pao is already making sure this happens 
"i stole monitors"
I'd be surprised if it wasn't 
Presumably, it's /u/chooter ? 
Which they can, now. It's one, big, gay, whistleblower wedding!
YEP apparently
Ne questions, it just gets gilded like a million times. Actually that would mean buying gold. Idk. Some shit along those lines. 
My guess is they are prepping for 1. Sale to an outside company.2. Pay access. And ditching people with issues with 1 and/or 2. But im wrong a lot. 
We might be taking a break from "Reddit Gold" for a while AutoModerator.
What if she liked Dr. Pepper, ever thought of that smart Guy? 
Back when the CEO gave a shit
That's the exact string of comments I want to see on this. A question of "what happened/why were you fired" then Victoria's perspective and reddit's perspective.On one hand, I feel like *maybe* Victoria wasn't 100% innocent in this, but on the other hand if that were the case then someone at reddit would have explained how she screwed up. Until we have that answer, all we can do is guess and that's not working out in reddit's favor right now.
And the verification picture is just her holding up a mirror.
Hey. I wanna see Victoria helping herself out!
God damn that was such a ridiculous response from him. It's a perfect example of the serious disconnect between the community and the company.
But who verifies the verifier? 
>Host your own AMAAt this point it would probably feel more like giving your own eulogy.
I would literally have to delete my Reddit app to do this.  It's just common nature now to tap on it, sometimes I instinctively tap it right after I've just closed it.  I am willing to do this however.  
Ill do it, but I will suffer the entire day.
>July 10 has been suggested as a no reddit day. Don't post, comment, or even load the site. Go through the weekend if you can.Also known as Best Chance To Make The Front Page Day
>July 10 has been suggested as a no reddit day. Don't post, comment, or even load the site. Go through the weekend if you can.On the first day free agents can officially sign contracts in the NBA?Yeah right, /r/nba is going to be poppin'
But...but I have a four hour train ride with wifi...
I really hope she didn't have to sign an NDA to get a Severance Package or something.
#ONTO THE KARMATRAIN.#CHOO^^ter CHOO^^ter
Yes please. Potential top AMA of all time. 
She's most likely not allowed to speak about it.
If she needs time to recover from the stress of being jobless and such, tell her there is no rush whatsoever. her well-being is the most important
Don't do it reddit!! It's just a baby!!! 
Who said that?!?
Watch out for the Paolice
Keyboards. /u/Airz23 worked for reddit all along. 
Yes exactly. No buying gold until all of this has been sorted out.
Yishan was far from a good ceo
That wouldn't be very professional. Even if she had done something terrible, it's in everyone's best interest to say nothing.
Why did you post a pic of Zelda?
Wow, she's helping with the AMA of the 2006 Time Person of the Year? 
... why does that sound really dirty to me?
I wonder how much he actually meant that apology, or if he was advised to make it. 
Would the verified become the verifie-ee?
Or one for Reddit. Word on the street is there are some Redditors in the works of creating a whole new website, similar to reddit, without the bullshit administration issue. Cough cough
Id have to move it off my homepage to have the same effect lol
Same here. The second I have nothing to do, my phone comes out, I swipe 3 times to the left, then click in the bottom left corner. Commence an hour of me staring at my phone, then randomly gigglesnort every 15 minutes. People think I'm weird.
Or make it an "explore the rest of the Internet" day.
I'll be browsing voat. If the guy on the bike powering it is awake that is
I'll do it but complain
It would be very impressive if it became an annual thing where the site just goes dead for a day 
Why not just do it on Victoria Day?  I mean, it's not exactly near the date, but it fits.  For your own personal blackout day I mean.
If you make the front page but no one reads it, did you really make the front page
Public masturbation existed before the internet you know. 
NOJOB NOJOB!
If it reaches top AMA post of all time i will eat a pair of my underwear (washed of course but still fairly used)I will film myself too. Screenshot this comment if you want but im serious
She said this wouldn't be an optimal time until everything settles down. Maybe she will get her job back.
You have been made moderator of r/Paoyonyang. 
Reddit is literally ISIS. 
Maybe i'll get lucky?? ***knocks on wood***
Fuck the Paolice
Finally some fucking closure on those keyboards
If that doesn't work try @happykid
You know that Reddit has a few years of gold more than required? /r/thebutton paid 6,5 months of gold in 2 months. So we'd have to give no gold for a very long time.
But he gave a shit, and that's the difference.
LPT: How to get a good reputation for being a medicore CEO: Hire Pao
No no... Zelda is the horse. Link is the sword. 
Look at me   I'm the Time now!
Had to look that up. Really cool cover by TIME, clever I'd say!
As long as she doesn't get gold, we're good.
You have reddit as your homepage? How do you accomplish anything? 
Dang. Three pages over? I have it right in the middle of my home screen. It takes up way too much of my life I think.
Now I wanna make vacation brochures for other websites.Tumblr; come and explore your SJW side!Facebook; everyone you hate!4CHAN; The Department of State warns U.S. citizens against all but essential travel to 4CHAN. Travel within 4CHAN remains dangerous given the security situation.
There's more to the Internet than reddit? ^(mommy im scared)
Well blame FPH for the bike idea.
Canada:  So nice they gave Victoria a day before she was fired.
How can the front page exist if Reddit no longer exists?
Have you properly researched health hazards of either eating underwear or not delivering on a promise to the people of Reddit?Either way, too late. You're on the hook now.
Tagged.Not that it will ever beat Obama's.
lol like that guy on the League of Legends subreddit who ate a dick
OP DELIVERED! Hope she verified it was her.
I stopped reading months ago, has he seriously never resolved any of that shit? What happened to VP?
It's about the symbolic gesture in these dire times, not about the actual money acquired. I'd say that until we receive a proper explanation and a ***sincere*** excuse over all of this, we stop giving gold altogether. 
That's actually a good tip. You don't need to be the best, you just need to be better than the worst.
He implemented the policy of forced relocation to San Francisco for all Reddit employees. He tried to implement Reddit Notes which was going to be a bitcoin clone. Considered by all to be a bad idea. Then there was the reddit marketplace that did nothing but sell horrible t-shirts and other crap. Also a horrible move.
Just being honest, is there any reason to trust the CEO over the employee? Has either's claims been substantiated? 
Snape kills gandalf on the bridge of the enterprise.
Time keeps slippong.
You can't see me, I'm the Time now!
My last semester's 2.75 GPA would like to show you how i do it
did you stumble upon the app?
There's so much else on Tumblr besides "SJW stuff" though. How it works is, you only see what you choose to follow.And the porn is GREAT.
There is but it's a disjointed fucked up way to internet just opening Google.com and thinking of things to internet. Life before reddit on the internet is a blur. 
Tho I think having "having one of the biggest social media websites almost completely blackout in my support" on your cv might even that out. Also whoever hires her might even like reddit to get some bad press.
I have enough heart problems where i'll probably die before 40, 30 if i continue my current diet  :p
/u/sygnus Ate a sock on /r/AMD
I totally made this up and don't know her.
That's how US Presidents are elected.
Okay with the exception of the SF move (which even that I guess I can understand) those are dumb ideas in hindsight but i'd take someone being enthusiastic and trying their best over this.
BERNIE SANDERS FOR REDDIT CEO
I can't tell if that's supposed to be good or not. 
They better fucking not.
Ironically I did not.Is that ironic?
Can confirm. Source: it's where I keep my flick bank.Edit for grammar fuckery. 
I seriously can't remember anymore. I think there was Neopets? And Yahoo?
Are you implying you would eat said underwear regardless of reaching this milestone?
You're not cool until you've eaten something for karma. 
Risky click of the day.
And how musical chairs is played. I think we're on to something here
Even the relocation doesnt seem too unreasonable as a business decision.  I was expecting to learn what a shitty person yishan really was, not "uhhh he made a bitcoin clone and sold some reddit t-shirts"... 
Karma and votes will be equally distributed. 
It's impressively average. 2.0 is passing for most American universities, while 4.0 is all A's.
They don't.
Didn't it work for Jeremy Clarkson?
Yeah, it's hard to monetise a site like reddit. I'd rather they merchandise than try to sanitise the site for sponsorships and ads.
Many programs require maintaining a 3.0 or 3.25 in your major. 2.0 passing would be pretty rare I think.
2.75 is a few too many Cs, though.  
Victoria confirmed for her own Netflix show.

KBone !! When you coming thru tha doggy den 4 a little chit chat ?? I got something special at tha crib for u ! 
Bone Dawg! I'm a struggling, drained medical student. Can you give me your best pep talk? 
What was Ken Bones senior (HS) quote?!
Hey Ken! I'm a huge fan and fellow Missourian. I'm so happy that you asked legitimate questions about the environment and brought a lot more happiness to the debate. You're a national treasure and I legitimately want to bake a cake for you and your wife. My question is: how did you meet her? Thanks for making the world a little bit nicer! :)
You seem like a nice guy, but I've heard speculation that you are bad to the Bone? Thoughts?
Some people have said they want to write you in for president. If this were to actually happen, what would President Bone's first action be?
Do you and your hot wife live the hot wife lifestyle? 
Did the little shits that called you Boner in school think they were clever?

Do you prefer bone in or bone out chicken wings?
Did you happen to know you would be asking a question or how was it decided that you would have the opportunity?  Did you submit your question ahead of time?  Thanks again for bringing so much joy during this time that has been very annoying, difficult, etc.  You have handled it great and brought a lot of fun to the election
Where did you get your pictures developed?
How long have you had your mustache? Have you ever experimented with other facial hair-styles?
What is your spirit animal?
What led to you asking about the environment? Is that your biggest concern with these candidates or did the topic just feel unaddressed?
Everyone on the stage wrote their own questions.  We shared them with the moderators, then the mods got to as many as possible while maintaining the flow of the debate.
Too many weird, wild things to count.  The most surreal was hearing back from @midnight which I love.
Fake internet points are the best compensation.  Except money.  I likes money.
Gallup does a random sampling of undecided voters in the area in which the debate is held.  This time it was my home town and I was lucky enough to answer when they called.
Between that and what South Park might turn me into I'm pumped.I know Bobby Moynihan would crush the bit, but maybe go Leslie Jones for shock value or something?  I don't know.  I'll get with my writers.
I am dying for Bobby Moynihan to get a shot. He needs a new recurring character (not that I don't love what he is doing already). 
St. Patrick center provides temporary housing, job training, drug counseling, and help with mental health issues.There is a severe homelessness problem in this country.  Most of us are one or two paychecks away from being homeless as well.  We need to start seeing and intervening on their behalf.  
I'm already the sexy Ken Bone so I'm thinking bust out the old Jedi robe / lightsaber combo and be Obi Wan Kenboni
We need more clean plants like mine to be approved for construction.  Older plants can't retrofit to be best in class environmentally because it would drive them out of business. That means we need newer ones manned by the displaced workers from those being retired.

Be who you are.  If people don't like who you are, they're not the right people to have in your life.
Several companies have approached me for endorsements. I have 2 rules for working with them.1)It's a responsible company that I believe in and that I vet to the best of my ability.  I will do my best not to associate with any companies that hurt the environment or their workers.2)  10% of all money I receive must go to my local preferred homeless charity the Saint Patrick Center in Saint Louis, MO.Same rules for paid appearances.
My uncle called me today and seemed genuinely star struck as if we hadn't been drinking beer together the week before.
As long as it's all in good fun I'm happy to laugh along with all of it.
Radiohead is my all time favorite, nobody blends genres like Thom Yorke and the boys.
I know I look old cause I'm fat and bald and dress like it's 1954, but I'm only 34 and ineligible to run!There are over 2000, yes 2000 legally registered candidates.  One of them must have something to offer.  Get your voice out there for one of them. 
Obviously reducing energy usage in the winter by providing everyone with stylish red cable knit sweaters, duh. 
Blah blah blah Steel...Blah blah blah ISIS...
I will defeat ISIS.
He talked to me about the peak of the coal industry in the 20s and how it has evolved with the nation's infrastructure over the years.  Then his security team reminded him that it was time to go yet again.  I think his wife was waiting on him.
"Wanna be my wingman?"
On soft ball and hockey rec teams I wore 18 for the great 60s era Saint Louis Cardinal Mike Shannon.  He's been the voice of the Cardinals basically my whole life.Stan Gibson is for Stan Musial and Bob Gibson.
Your wife. 
He sort of? answered this on his Jimmy Kimmel appearance I think, basically said he turned on his cell phone as soon as he was allowed and had a thousand+ messages lol
Porque no los dos?You don't fill out a sweater like this by doing pizza anything half way.
I'm sorry you're confused, Ken Bone is the cable knit sweater wearing a fat guy.
Cosby Sweater drops roofies into Stewarts drink, Stewart Sweater shivs Cosby Sweater with a sharpened tooth brush as it slips into unconsciousness.  Fred Rogers OG sweater game wins by staying positive and not getting involved in the fight.  Just like Ken Bone.
Maybe his wife's name is Anita. 
Ken Bone does not ask.  He commands by his imposing yet cuddly presence.
Yes, definitely.  Being undecided is not the same as being indecisive.  We just have a lot to consider this election.  
Sandwiches are bread on top, bread on bottom.  Hot Dogs are side to side with a wrap around.  Doesn't count.
Sorry bro.  Wish I could help with the ladies but I already got mine.  Good luck getting yours.
My power plant supports a robust drug testing policy, sorry Dogg.  My dad on the other hand is all in.
I'm close, but I will not be announcing my decision.  I want you to all make up your own minds.  Don't rely on my opinion, just the positive message.
It's been unreal, both the good and the bad.  Everybody has responded to the positive message with the exception of a few nuts.Some of the stuff makes it tough to stay positive, but I try to spin it for the good.For instance, I've had almost a quarter million new Twitter followers, and only 3 death threats.  Great ratio!Seriously though, thanks to my home town PD for making me feel safe when the creeps come out to play.
It was a bad call.  I need to fire my agent, except I can't because I'm my agent.
Even his porn comments are vanilla as hell.
It's flattering, but please don't.  I cannot serve since I'm not old enough.
Somebody set one up on my behalf, but Jimmy Kimmel is buying me a new one since I did his show.  I guess if go fund me sends me that money it'll go to the charity.  You'll see me wearing it on his show next week.
I'm gonna be swamped with election stuff but PM me something and I'll get you a birthday greeting.  Here's hoping I don't forget and look like an asshole.
Only if you advertise your party as the "Bone Zone Bonanza"
1) Biggs for pure awesomeness, Lando for longevity.  Get it, I'm undecided.2)  Phasma lead, Rey, 5s, Chewie, Lumi.  Swapping Lumi out for Barriss after I can farm her, but it might be a while.  I'm a little busy.
Follow up, which character would look best with an awesome red cardigan?
I had this weird hallucination where all the sudden everyone gave a shit what I had to say.  Bizarre.
I don't even go to HOA meetings,  but if I really thought I could effect positive change I'd consider it.
If only I were that clever.
I'm in LA late next week, maybe we can hook up. Big fan here. My dad wants to roll wit da Dogg big time, you me and him could do some tight stuff.That didn't sound cool at all, did it?
People say this election has been a disaster, but Snoop Dogg just replied in a Ken Bone AMA to ask him to come smoke at his house. All because of this election.How is that not an unqualified success? 
I'm witnessing history
I love it.  It's not fair to have a painting be so much more attractive than the real me!
Without our future generations of doctors we can never solve the healthcare dilemma in this country! You are the future! You are going to improve the lives of your future patients and their families every day for the rest of your life!  Stick it out, I know you are sacrificing a lot, but they need you.
What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while remaining environmentally friendly, and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?
We both worked at a bowling alley in Granite City called AMF Bowland.  I was a lane attendant which meant I walked around cleaning, throwing away beer bottles, and getting stuff from storage over to the bar and snack bar to restock during shift.She worked the snack bar, which meant I did none of the stuff listed above.  I just watched her clean the grill cause when she bent to scrub it I could see dat ass was fat.
Only the head nurse was able to speak up about it.  
Any president would be instantly twice as good for the country with this one simple step.  Appoint experts in each respective field to cabinet positions.  NOT political donors or old friends I owed a favor. 2nd action, get blasted at camp David till I pass out.
They have been thinking it since the days of my great grandfather (swear on my life it's true) Bentley Bone and his son, my great uncle Oriel (pronounced Oral) Bone.
Only if you are me.
"24 reasons Ken Bone is voting for Clinton / Trump"431 clicks, this asshole still not telling me who he's voting for.
When it's cold in your jail cell.  I'm not big on stripes.  
What's an NFL?  I'm from St. Louis, something called an NFL has abandoned my twice in my lifetime already.  That's more times than a typical dead beat dad and still they want my money.  Not happening.
The camera is still in my bag undeveloped.  I'll tweet some of the pics out when I get them done.
Had a goatee for a while, full on neck beard for about a year.Clean shaven for a long time.The stache is for my grandpa, the first Ken Bone who tied in (not lost, it died too) his battle with cancer two days before Christmas last year.  His stache was unparalleled.  
The flow of the prose and the consistency of language are beautiful.  Writing in that style is so hard to do without being over the top; you did so flawlessly.  Great writing, superb content.  I love the gentle humor.  You have perfectly captured the mix of dry wit, energetic humor, and underlying kindness that I hope has defined me my whole adult life.  Thank you, brilliant.
Wear a sweater, for a while...huh...nudge nudge.I mean the sweater gets you laid.
When I was 17 I spent a winter homeless. Even as a young white female very few people were willing to help me out, there were nights I spent out in 3 degree weather because I didn't make it to the shelter on time. It was one of the hardest things I ever went though in my life. Now as an adult I do everything I can to help the homeless who want to, get out of their situation. People like you give me hope. 
WE LOVE YOU TOO, KENNETH. It actually delighted me to hear you read my tweet. Thank you for doing the show, encouraging people to vote and being an all-around good dude! PS - Team Mystic
Jesus. It's like you've spent a lot of time on the Internet. One of us. One of us...
And the gold. Can't forget about reddit gold
I hope if South Park does feature you its in some completely crazy random way, like you are a galactic invader with the Bone-ers.
Man are you seriously that good? Wow!! Insightful, conscientious, super funny, compassionate and intelligent. Why the fuck couldn't you be our president?!
Paging /u/AWildSketchAppeared or /u/Shitty_WatercolourWe need a mock-up of Obi Wan Kenboni.
How do you feel about nuclear power?
I feel like this comment perfectly sums up why we needed Ken Bone. Everyone is so exhausted from all the hostility, hyperbole, and factionalism this election has unleashed. We thought we were getting a meme and ended up getting a refreshing reminder that there are still chill people in this country.
That is incredibly kind of you to share your good fortune with those in need. Thank you.
You changed
I think you are making a lot of people happy in a good way.
How can someone possibly be so likeable
You absolute legend.
So you're saying that a 2020 candidacy is possible? 
We need to get you on the "Get Out and Vote" tour.
Classic Ken Bone
This is the moment I went from undecided into a Ken Bone fan. A Boner.
I was never a huge Bill Clinton fan, but this is textbook Bill. Used to see him do this all the time on TV. He loves talking.
I'd watch that sitcom.
Your answer is better than any I could think of.  
This guy gets it.
I could not imagine having so much attention drawn to me in only a few days
we're not worthy. 
This guy fucks
How are you so perfect?
It's actually Ivana.
You're like Mr. Rogers and Ron Jeremy mixed together
This is a man who understands that no matter who he supports, the internet will turn on him. 
THE BONE HAS SPOKEN.
Hey it's me, your dad. Can I get Snoop's number???
Aww come on, give the Dogg a Bone.
>  I want you to all make up your own minds. Don't rely on my opinion, just the positive message.Translation: I don't want you all coming after me with pitchforks.
Who the fuck gives ken bone a death threat.  
Not hiding behind throwaways to comment on porn subreddits, you are an inspiration to us all.
I never knew who the people who commented on porn subreddits were. Now I know, it's the undecided voters.
Is this one for fucking real too? 
re: J.Law:Maybe she should have been more careful with her pics, but the bad guys are still the ones who sought them out and looked at them. By which I mean guys like me. I saw her butt hole. I liked it.Bravo!
We'll keep Obama until your 35th birthday, then it's the Bone Show.
The day anybody thinks Ken Bone is an asshole is the day we really are in trouble 
ST Han > Chewie
You say this, and we're all creeping the shit outta your post history like "he was among us the whole time!"
You would have the honesty appeal of a Bernie Sanders, the outsider appeal of a Donald Trump, the foreign policy experience of a Gary Johnson, and you'd be up against likely incumbent Hillary Clinton.
Bone apple teeth
We need a tv show Give A Dogg A Bone where you and snoop are detectives. His old partner (one day from retirement) is gunned down and you're his new partner. It's like a photonegative Miami vice. 
You made it cool. You goddamn beautiful disaster
It's weird seeing a post where you immediately know it's going to the best of reddit.
The Halloween candy, Ken! The Halloween candy!! 
You need to be the 5th face on Mount Rushmore
Listen, how is every one of  your responses perfect? How is it possible? Great people can be at a loss for the perfect response, but Bone, never. 
Dang. Before I was joking, but you're actually a viable candidate. 
We're gonna need some pussy pics Ken
wait. IS THERE A KEN BONE JR?
Hey it me, your me
Ken's too big for you now. Won't even you hit u back up in his AMA. 
Gooble Goo
This current season has so far had a strange lack of any sort of sci-fi element. What gives?
You are my new publicist. 
I certainly haven't changed clothes.
Power corrupts, man.
Authenticity, my man.
This AMA is when dreams become memes
Make America Bone Again
I did a video shoot for Jokes for Votes today, check them out.
Can we all agree this is the greatest AMA ever?
Dude, as a formerly undecided fan of yours, I've decided now to endorse you.  Bone2020^(TheYear^NotHisVision)
Do you feel, Your Boneness, that since your notoriety, you've remained just about the same Bone as ever/
Holy shit!  u/dicklemytick is talking to me!!!
holy shit, is that /u/dicklemytick?!
we have entered the memeverse.
It's a good thing I'm not running for office.  I'm just trying to get you all to vote, you don't need to have another fat guy trying to convince you who to vote for.
I wonder if John Hodgman is going to be annoyed at our new consensus after years of getting pushback on his hard-line hot-dogs-aren't-sandwiches stance. 
Dad? You're back from getting smokes?
God damn people here are clever 
Translation: Pretty decent dude not using his position to influence people's decision based on fame.
Those who are jealous of his glory.
Ken is a straight shooter with upper management written all over him.
I made a comment earlier today. It was in regards to a guy with a two-tone dick. I'm locked in on my vote.
I added a link to his full comment. Real as can be!
Oh my God. This'll probably make national media. Hi mom! 
This is closer to the real me.

I'm voting for you.
Hahahaha holy shit
Spicy memes, Ken
How can you clap with your burned hands?
Theres just a lot of us so when we are clever it gets a lotta upvotes. We're all dumb as bricks, dont worry mate

I will eat a sock if this hits the fucking news
I want to be closer to the real you.

I say he is the new leader.
I'm a former Scientologist and Sea Org member. I was raised in Scn and joined the SO as a 15-year-old girl and was in for six years. I'm still dealing with the effects of the abuse I endured in the SO. I just want to say thank you for being brave and outspoken. I feel like even when people are rightly negative about Scn, they still don't really get it, and it's difficult to talk about. So, thank you for doing what you're doing, and for being an example for someone that gets it.  What has helped you get through the leaving process and the intimidation from the church?
Is it true they record your meetings and blackmail you with the recordings?
If all Scientology's secrets were revealed tomorrow, which do you think would be most shocking?
Can you imagine a scenario where you may be cast alongside a Scientologist or would it not be allowed?
Are you still in contact with any friends that are still part of the church?  
When you were a scientologist did you ever get any weird reactions from other famous people?
Was there a secret group of people or friends you had in the church that doubted it? Or did you feel alone.
Do you think there are members of the cult of Scientology reading this AMA?
How are they able to recruit intelligent people into what appears to be an obvious scam and cult? 
Considering that Scientology is consistently painted in such a negative light how did you maintain the commitment to Scientology for so long?
What is something the average citizen can do to help prevent Scientology growth?
Do the higher ups know it's a scam or do they really believe this crap?
Was there a single breaking point that convinced you to leave the church? Or was it a long term struggle with the decision?
Are people actively being held prisoner against their will?      If so, how upsetting is it that the government and law enforcement does not act?
What odds do you give of the whole thing collapsing once Miscavige dies?
do you remember what your initial reaction was upon first seeing the course materials for OT3?
I've been a huge fan since the early days of KoQ  (was watching at 11, now 24!). Did you ever find that your religion interfered with your work in a way you would turn town any potential jobs, either for your own religious reasons or advice received from members?
Why do you think there are so many people in the entertainment industry in the religion?
What do members actually gain from being a member? How is it made worth all the money and time they invest?
Are there any sexual malpractices that occur in the church?
Do you personally feel like you're being watched/tracked/etc by the church for doing everything your doing?
Have any other actors come to you for support or help?
You are so brave for telling the truth about Scientology. Why are so many other people staying quiet? What can we do to help?
How are children treated in Scientology?
Are you safe?
What's is the single most horrible thing you encountered in the ""church""?
How different would you say your view of Hollywood is now compared to when you were on Saved by the Bell and did your experience with Scientology effect these views versus if you never joined them? 
What is your overall opinion on organized Religion now? Did your view on say Christianity change?
From what I've seen of Scientology, it seems like there is a major difference in treatment between celebrity "followers" and folks in Sea Org who are tortured, locked in the Hole, beaten publicly by Miscavige, etc. Did the news of this mistreatment find its way to celebrities and general "members" of the Church who weren't in Sea Org?  Or were people left completely in the dark?
As a psychologist, I am curious what you observed as mental health 'treatment' with Scientology?  In addition, I am aware the 'church' is against psychology; how was this opposition demonstrated within or by the 'church'?  Finally, in your opinion how prevalent are mental health difficulties with the Scientology community?Thank you for your time.
Did being a Scientologist help your acting career? 
How can we destroy scientology? 
What was the first red flag you noticed about Scientology?
Are you an theist now or does another religion seem more appealing?
Goddamn this post has gotten over 5000 dislikes in the past few hours, this was over 12k upvote at 5:00.Major shout out to Leah for putting herself out here to answer are questions, and anyone who is down voting, why?  Scientologists who follow their doctrine should not be on this site, so I am assuming mist of the down votes are other people.How do you feel on this issue? What do you agree/disagree with?
Former Sea Org member in recovery here.What do you hope to accomplish with your expos'e?Edited to thank some kind people for PM's and also to thank the angry people that doubt me. The fact is I'm telling the truth, but wish I wasn't. I was born into a church that ruined my family, took many of my good years, and hard earned cash. Believe what you will.
So, Xenu. When do you first learn about him when you join the church?
Hi Leah,What are your thoughts on Louis Theroux's recent ' My Scientology Movie'? 
What drew you to Scientology in the first place? Or rather, why did you stay with the church for so long?
Is there anything GOOD about Scientology?
Congrats on getting out, and best of luck on your recovery! I would also love to read your AMA if you ever feel up to it. 
Are there ex-scientology rehabilitation groups? Just curious.
Yes, every "therapy room" is equipped with cameras and listening devices, as admitted by the "Church."  Do they use it for blackmail? No, they use it to discredit you when you speak out. 
When you reach the top of The Bridge (OTP 8) you will be told that God is a lie for LRH, and there are more levels ahead, that will cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars. There is no end to Scientology.  
That would not be allowed from their end. 
I am an SP (supressive person). You are not allowed to be in contact with an SP. I would love to talk to my former friends and see my goddaughter. 
Weird reactions? No. I got appropriate reactions, "Why are you in this crazy shit?" 
Do I think? I know. Hi Karin Pouw and members of OSA! If any Sea Org member is currently reading this and works for OSA and wants to leave, I will help you... including Karin. 
Most Scientologists are 2nd or 3rd generation, they were born and raised into an ideology and have been surrounded and isolated. It is all they know. They are victims. Most of the original Scientologists are all out and have spoken out. Unfortunately, their children were indoctrinated by them.... are still loyal, faithful and have cut off communication due to the policy of disconnection. 
Because i was taught to believe that the controversy was due to people being unaware of what Scientology was truly doing in the world which was good things. I also felt the press was focused on making fun of Scientology and not what was important, so it was easy to turn away from the information. And also a major part of Scientology is learning how to fight your critics. If i wasn't fighting I wasn't being a good Scientologist. 
Speak to your local councilmen/women about cracking down on the abuse of its citizens. I believe people have influences, they know judges, lawyers, police enforcement I think everyone bringing attention to these abuses can help. It takes a community to police itself. 
The higher up is singular. And he definitely knows. however I believe most parishioners and Sea Org members  (people who work for the "church") are int he dark and believe that they are doing amazing things for the world. And David Miscavige is directly responsible for that fraud. 
It's very upsetting. I'm only an actress with a short window of interest. So it is up to the authorities who have to do something about it and the judges who are hearing cases of abuse, coerced abortions, being held prisoner, fraud, mental and emotional imprisonment. They won't look at cases to decide its a religion. They have to separate and look at the law. Your doctrine is abusive. It mandates that you abuse people. 
The policies of the "Church" are the policies of the "Church." They will not change, and there will be someone right behind him ready to pick up where he left off. 
Yes my first reaction was "Are you all fucking nuts?" and then I looked at my mother and said "What kind of bullshit did you get me in?" My only option was to leave, but at the time my family was not ready to go. The "church" told me I didn't need to believe it, just do it. And they always pose this question: "Are you ready to leave everything you've ever known?"
I was punished for doing Stuff magazine because it was too racy. They would not want us to do anything that would be considered not "becoming of a Scientologist." I see they have since changed their stance of what they believe is "becoming of a Scientologist." 
If you really look at the numbers at the entertainment industry, in comparison to the small number of scientologists that are celebrities, the number wouldn't even register. I think Scientology has done an amazing job convincing people that there is a great number of celebrities in the "Church." 
They gain a purpose. They gain a group. They gain a sense of accomplishment (awards, certificates). They gain an education that in the real world LRH states would be equivalent to getting a "PHD in life." You become an elitist. That you have all the answers in life. If you have a question about life, you are made to think that Scientology has the answer. 
I am. I'm okay with it because I knew what I was getting into and I knew the policies of the "church" and what would happen by my speaking out against it. 
After watching a few documentaries about Scientology, I would bet money on the fact that she is being watched and followed by them. 
The policy of the "Church" does not allow them to come to me. Former high ranking Sea Org members like Debbie Cook and former members like Katie Holmes are forbidden to speak to other SPs. Certain members are forced to sign agreements that does not allow them to speak to ex members. 
As old spirits in little bodies who have returned to Scientology... children are treated as adults. 
Yes, I feel very safe. I have the support of my family and friends. And, I feel strangely protected by the world at large. 
I would say the "church's" Fair Game policy, and how they systematically go after anyone who publicly speaks out against them. Anyone who speaks out against the "church" is seen as an enemy. 
No, and if they did hear about it, we were told that those claiming abuse were lying. Then I would have been interrogated and even punished for asking. 
The "Church" doctrine thinks that fields of psychology and psychiatry are a sham. They deny mental illness and afflictions. They promote that you can heal your psycho-sematic issues with their "technology." They will get in the way of people taking medications. They will prevent people from getting the real medical help that they need. and in some cases have caused suicides because of it. Scientology is mentally abusive because we are all taught that we are responsible for everything. 
I don't want to destroy Scientology. I only want them to admit to the fraud that they promote, to not deny the confidential upper levels of the religion, so people can decide if they want to spend $250K and their lives doing it. That they admit to the policies of Fair Game. That they allow people to decide for themselves where they get their information. That they admit to disconnection and leave families the fuck alone. 
I don't what rumors we're referring to here. I haven't read anything that has been inaccurate. 
Doesn't look like got to this comment, but she said in another response that her first step to leaving was how quickly the "church" would turn on anyone who wronged them, even people who dedicated their lives to Scientology. 
Greater awareness. Exposing the truths. Not letting to continue to let them bully people into silence and submission. 
They don't tell you about Xenu until you're at OT III - Operating Thetan level 3. You won't get that far until you've spent many thousands on auditing and classes. Most people never make it that far.The thing is, Xenu is actually an incredibly important part of the religion. It's the explanation of why there is so much suffering on earth. It'd be like if Christianity didn't let you know about the crucifixion until you'd donated egregious sums of money to your church.
from what little research I've personally done, it seems like the super early "getting your life on track" and "self help" seminars and such they promote are actually useful. It seems that after that it starts to go all crazy and over bearing. They have to bait the hook with something anyways.
I'm trying to figure out how I'd provide proof. 
> Millions.It takes real courage to admit something like that so publicly.  You really are not pulling any punches.  Thanks for being such an open book.
Hello it's me your new church
> Do they use it for blackmail? No, they use it to discredit you when you speak out.If they make it clear that those are the consequences beforehand, that is indeed textbook blackmail.
Oh fuck... So will yours be released?
Jenna Miscavage Hill's book, Beyond Belief, is an incredible account of what it was like to grow up in the "church" as a child of high ranking Sea Org members. It's fucking scary. So happy for everyone who has left. 
How difficult would it be for a parent to leave with their children? Have there been instances of the "church" fighting custody battles to try and get the children back? 
Do they just make this shit up as they go?
>and see my goddaughter.Awww man.  I'm sorry, I hope you get to see her again. :(
And what was your response to them then?
Everyone say Hi Karin!!
Oh my gosh, just reading through all your responses...you're going to save lives, if you haven't already. Good for you. You should be so proud of your bravery. 
That account was created a day ago, has only posted comments in this AMA, and all trying to discredit Leah, hmm...
I was raised in the Jehovah's Witness religion cult. I've gotten the same question and my answer is very close to yours lol. 
What "good things" does the "church" think it is doing?
What is the PTS/SP course?
That's some next level shit, boggles my mind that it exists 
So how do we stop them?
Can someone eli5 what ot3 is?
How do they punish you? Financially? Physically? Psychologically?
People have accused the Church of blackmailing participants, perhaps by using incriminating/ sexual photos or secrets that come out during auditing.Hollywood has been accused of doing the same thing to "starlets" and child actors, as a grooming process.  Do you see any similarities between how young actors are "controlled" and how the Church of Scientology treats its members?
More power to you!
Your strength and poise through this is really something. You are so calm and self-assured.  What a complete and total badass.
Which is why in her autobiography she spilled all her (and her family's) dirty laundry so they'd have nothing to hold over her head
I imagine there are people from the "church" here right now monitoring every comment and question along with any response from her.
we are in this thread you mean
> And if they look on the internet, if they read time mag, they will be met with punishment at their expense. And, as a Scientologist...you have to confess that you've read outside materials, and that will be met with punishment at your expense.What are the punishments?
What punishments? Financial? Physical?
> former members like Katie Holmes are forbidden to speak to other SPsI may be interpreting this wrong, but why TF would a former member care about the rules?
> children are treated as adultsThat is freaky as fuck.
I have tremendous respect for you and what you've done since leaving the "church." You have a lifetime fan in me just for that...and for playing Stacey Carosi on Saved By the Bell.Keep up the good fight!
Well we know you're doing this and if you suddenly go silent, well.... That'll be suspicious. 
You just made the list.
This is comically evil. How can any member of such an organization still convince themselves that they are "the good guys doing whats necessary"?
How is it that you are still able to speak out against them?  What is different about your situation than the others that have tried and been shut down?
"Those claiming they were abused were lying! Here, let me abuse you to prove to you that you are wrong to question if abuse happens here!"
That, itself, would probably destroy the "church"
Well... that's kind of a scary answer.
Accurate enough for the "church" to put people on Matt and Trey to find dirt (the two are actually quite boring) and then enough to squeeze Comedy Central to never air the episode again.
Loving this AMA. I'm surprised the government hasn't cracked down on these psychos by now. Then again depressingly enough, it's probably because the feds and states side with them.
Seriously, I used to be ashamed admitting I blew a $20k settlement in my 20's on bullshit and weed. I can only imagine coming to that realization. 
They probably don't. What I think she means is that they don't sit you down and threaten you before they do it, which she doesn't consider technically blackmail. It's probably what their legal team argues too, but I still think it's blackmail.
I think one of the scariest things about Jenna Hill's book is that if he let his own niece be treated like that, imagine what happens to everyone else not related to him!?
She is an amazing person and, honestly, I knew her for quite a while and never knew the connection. Truly one of the most genuine and sweet people I've ever known. 
Hmm... nobody has gotten this far, quick, make up some more shit, we've got a real sucker this time. 
Probably more than you think. All cults are very similar in the environment they promote. I read the ex-Jehovah's Witness subreddit quite often and there are constant posts by people who are still in but scared to do anything about it.
#HI KARIN! COME ON OUT.  WE HAVE COOKIES! 
Getting to this level used to be an accomplishment. But now you can get there just by buying enough mountain dew and doritos.
I like how not even wikipedia knows how much the OTs cost beyond OT III
Yeah yeah, we totally saw her... She was hanging with Kim's wife, honest
Seriously... I keep reading through all of her comments and keep seeing the word, "punished." Wtf are they doing to people? 
I think in Going Clear it said they were using his homosexuality to blackmail Travolta to keep him in check. 
Yup get it out of the way so nothing else is surprising. "But you had a!....wait...OK but certainly this!...hm..." makes your credibility way harder to take down.
More scientology
Check out the documentary Going clear (2015) . The punishments can get physically and mentally hardcore  (beating, humiliation...)
They would lose their status in the cult or have secrets revealed about them. It's blackmail. They can't stop them from doing anything as evidence by Leah being here now. 
The cult still has dirt on them that they don't want released. My question is what kind of shit could they have on someone that the public would really give a shit about?
Explains a lot of the weird stuff around Suri Cruise.Also, Leah said she hasn't read anything that is innaccurate. I wonder if that includes that claim that Scientology believed Suri Cruise was LRH?
This sci-fi writes itself. 
*2 years from now*TIL Leah Remini was last heard from after doing a Reddit AMA about Scientology 
^ I Found Jericho's Reddit account!
Hell of a lot more visibility and fame than a regular person. 
This was literally her final response. What have you done?!
They tried, the IRS attempted to take them off tax exempt status and in return the "church" infiltrated the IRS and threatened the life and well being of the IRS director and his family.
I wish I could get a $20k settlement to waste on bullshit and weed :(
It was almost like she was abused worse *because* she was related to the leader. It makes no sense.
Scientology run by Wizards of the Coast confirmed...
What is LRH?
It appears she truly does want to leave as she hasn't responded. The only logical conclusion is she is being held against her will 
Karin leaving Scientology confirmed.
I live near the "Celebrity Center" and see a lot of Sea Org members. Another couple groups they seem to prey upon are immigrants and actors. Especially actors. They are constantly offering free "acting classes" which they promote heavily around Hollywood, targeting areas where they know new actors wind up. For instance, if you register at Central Casting, a company that casts extras for film and television, there is always a group of Sea Org members handing out pamphlets for the "classes."
Wait... There are people who think Travolta is straight???
It has to be more than that, doesn't it? Would anyone really care if Travolta came out?
A great way of disarming someone is to be entirely candid and honest about oneself.
The beatings will continue until morale improves
Read the book. It's even more detailed and frightening. RPF (Rehabilitation Project Force, I believe) is nothing to fuck with.
Have they ever revealed secrets of any celebs before?
> Explains a lot of the weird stuff around Suri Cruise.Care to elaborate?
Oh, wow, that would make so much sense.  Think about the name.  They call her Suri, like the surrogate bodies in that Bruce Willis movie, Surrogates.  She is a surrogate body for LRH's soul.  Freaky.
> This sci-fi writes itself.This Law & Order: Special Victims Unit episode writes itself
During an investigation, police suddenly decided it was a suicide for sure
Something something stupid idiot, something $750 scarf
Being a celebrity has its perks. But I'm assuming she has to have some sort of protection, right?
> Laugh all you want about Anonymous and 4chan being superheroes for a minutethey just memed their way to the white house. no one is laughing anymore.
I take personal pride in having been called a suppressive person by a church handler, though luckily I don't have a .45 shaped hole in the back of my head for my trouble.
Gotta stop that power creep
L. Ron Hubbard. Dreamt up scientology 
Leah didn't believe Artie Lange was in Old School because she was in it and never saw him. Meanwhile he was totally in the beginning and end of the movie. They just never had a scene together.
Shall we round up the mob, pitchforks and torches, maybe go bust her out?
Pool's closed?
Scientology - When a movie script gets mistaken for a religion. 
I...I did...up until this thread...
The B Rabbit tactic. 
Yea, I'd rather fuck with Wu-Tang than RPF
There were claims made by ex scientologists that her bedroom was prepared for LRH. They had his favorite books and his robe laid out on the bed. That she was served his favorite meals. Things of that nature.Then you have the stuff the media grabbed a hold of where she was dictating major decisions for her parents, more or less controlling every aspect of her own rearing. If Scientologist children are treated like adults, Suri was treated like an adult with authority. Allegedly.
*DUHN DUHN. Duh nuh nuh nuh nuh-NUH*
$15000 JACKET
scientology is going to get...IT!
Very different populations. The 4chan of 10 years ago is nothing like the 4chan of today.
I got ID'd, followed, harassed, and shoved by the local OSA head (hi, Cathy!) when I was part of Chanology back in Houston and Austin in 2008."Always attack, never defend" was not something they were prepared to have turned back on them... nor was the rasterbated poster about how female Sea Org members were forced to have abortions.
You obviously havent seen any of the mission impossible movies. Tom Cruise will kill us all. Please Mr.Cruise spare us!

Scientology - When a movie script gets *rewritten* for a religion.
OH MY GOODNESS. I had no idea. On another note, I find hilarious that arguably the worst movie of all time is based on Scientology.
if i recall, Will Smith donated to scientology out of respect/friendship with Tom Cruise, and donated at the same time an equal or larger amount to a Christian organization.  No actual ties to the "church".  Dont quote me on this...I have never spoken to Big Willie Style personally.
I remember laughing at Katie saying Suri picks out all of her outfits for her, but now D: Glad Katie was able to get away, and if that means Tom not being in Suri's life it's worth it in this case. 
oh I didn't know you upgraded the Jeritron 5000
Pffft. All I have to do is put my hand on his forehead to hold him back. We've got reach that Tom could only dream of!
Jesus Christ Karin get your shit together
Rob Schneider is... DAVID MISCAVIAGE
But... but... it's so *sophisticated*. Did you not notice all those Dutch angles?> In the words of film critic Roger Ebert, "the director, Roger Christian, has learned from better films that directors sometimes tilt their cameras, but he has not learned why."

I wonder just how damaged that kid is. 
Take them out maaaaaaaan
Honestly, that is a deep burn.
what a great bot, doing God's work.
Don't quote me on this. 
Seeing as she seems to believe she is the reincarnation of L Ron Hubbard? Geez, was anything in the South Park episode wrong?
Do you ever disguise yourself and just walk around incognito?
If you could give 19 year old Bill Gates some advice, what would it be?
Hello Bill Gates. What is your idea of success?
I am sure you have traveled to all types of famous places.Do you have a favorite vacation spot?
Where do you see yourself in 15 years?
What kind of technological advancement do you wish to see in your lifetime?
What are the limits of money when it comes to philanthropy?  
Ok, Mr. Gates, what's a typical Bill sandwich consist of? I'm talking breads, meats, cheeses, condiments. if you could only have one sandwich on earth, what would it be?
Hi Bill, what's the biggest 1st world problem you get? 
What do you think is the most pressing issue that we could feasibly solve in the next ten years?
If you could create a new IP and business with Elon Musk, what would you make happen? 
Did you copy Steve Jobs or did he copy you?
Mr Gates! Any thoughts on the current state of the U.S.? 
Hi Bill,I'm going to become a father this summer.  Do you have any advice you wouldn't mind sharing, from one dad to a dad-to-be?Thanks!
What do you think about Universal Basic Income?
Hi Bill. How often do you get to cook a meal for yourself?
STEM, or STEAM?
Given the current state of technology, what career path and/or interests would a young, just-starting-out Bill Gates persue if he were 16 today? 
Hey Bill, have you considered running for president in 2020?
Good morning Bill,What are the little things that you take pride in or make you happy?
Mr. Gates,What's your biggest flaw? I get asked this all the time in job interviews and it seems like a trap of a question.
Do you own any Apple products?
What phone do you use as your daily driver? iPhone, Google Pixel, Galaxy or Lumia?
Any advice on beating procrastination?
Mr. Gates, how do you feel about President Trump and his views on global climate change?
Hi!Favorite TV shows? Food? Video games?
What has been your favorite version of Windows?
I sometimes wear a hat. For example when I did college tours with my son I wanted the focus to be totally on him. A lot less people recognize me when I have a hat on or else they realize I am trying to be incognito.Mostly when people do recognize me they are super nice so I don't feel it is a burden to be noticed most of the time.
IE calls it "InPrivate". You are thinking of Chrome.
I would explain that smartness is not single dimensional and not quite as important as I thought it was back then. I would say you might explore the developing world before you get into your forties. I wasn't very good socially back then but I am not sure there is advice that would fix that - maybe I had to be awkward and just grow up....
Warren Buffett has always said the measure is whether the people close to you are happy and love you. It is also nice to feel like you made a difference - inventing something or raising kids or helping people in need.
Australia is particularly nice. It is summer there when it is winter here so going there in December and January is especially nice. I spent Thanksgiving there last year.I have gotten to travel to a lot of great places like the Amazon in Brazil which I recommend.
I will be 76 at that time. Hopefully a grandfather. The Foundation with its partners will have eradicated a number of diseases and health in poor countries will be a lot better - specifically instead of 5% of children under 5 dying it should be at 2.5% which is still a lot.I hope I can still type fast enough to do Reddit sessions without someone transcribing for me.
The big milestone is when computers can read and understand information like humans do. There is a lot of work going on in this field - Google, Microsoft, Facebook, academia,... Right now computers don't know how to represent knowledge so they can't read a text book and pass a test.Another whole area is vaccines. We need a vaccine for HIV, Malaria and TB and I hope we have them in the next 10-15 years.
you cannot buy time. 
Good question. I think having parents and teachers reinforce your curiosity and explain what they are fascinated with makes a big difference. A lot of people lose their curiosity as they get older which is a shame. One thing that helps nowadays is that if you get confused about something it is easier than ever to find an article or video to make things clear.
Cheeseburger, Cheeseburger, Cheeseburger.
I would say education is the key problem. If you can solve that then it helps with a lot of things.Maybe I didn't understand the question - maybe it supposed to be some idiosyncratic thing that bothers me....
A lot of people feel a sense of isolation. I still wonder if digital tools can help people find opportunities to get together with others - not Tinder but more like adults who want to mentor kids or hang out with each other. It is great that kids go off and pursue opportunities but when you get communities where the economy is weak and a lot of young people have left then something should be done to help.
We need clean, reliable cheap energy - which we don't have. It is too bad the sun doesn't shine all the time and the wind doesn't blow all the time. The Economist had a good piece on this this week. So we need some invention - perhaps miracle batteries or super safe nuclear or making sun into gasoline directly.
No. Perhaps a small chair - a stool. I do exercise and ski but my main sport is tennis which doesn't involve jumping. Some people jump over the net but that isn't part of the sport.
Please Mr. Gates.  I owe my entire college ambitions and career choice in the History field because I spent long, long hours as a kid playing AoEII until odd hours of the night. 
A contribution to Rotary to help end polio is a gift I would appreciate. Also any great book you have read and found interesting.
I missed it, what did Bill Gates give as Secret Santa?
One thing to make sure the people who create the first strong AI have the right values and ideally that it isn't just one group way out in front of others. I am glad to see this question being discussed. Google and others are taking it seriously.
Microsoft is one of the companies that have fought for net neutrality. I'm sure Bill shares the same views. IE this is bad.
The one question I really wanted answered and of course it doesn't...
The main "copying" that went on relative to Steve and me is that we both benefited from the work that Xerox Parc did in creating graphical interface - it wasn't just them but they did the best work. Steve hired Bob Belville, I hired Charles Simonyi. We didn't violate any IP rights Xerox had but their work showed the way that led to the Mac and Windows.
He famously once said "It's more like he broke into Xerox's house to steal the TV only to find that Steve was there before him." Or something along those lines.
If Bill Gates spent his own time to pack that box and prepare your gifts just know that your gifts are worth their value and about $5 million in labour costs lol. 
TIL Bill Gates knows how to gift. 
I just went on a trip with my 17 year old son to see 6 colleges. He is a junior in High School and trying to figure out where he should go. Trips like that have been a great way to spend time together. He reads even more about politics than I do so I let him pick books for me to read.Melinda is very creative about helping me find chances to spend time with the kids. Even just driving them to school is a great time to talk to them.
Over time countries will be rich enough to do this. However we still have a lot of work that should be done - helping older people, helping kids with special needs, having more adults helping in education. Even the US isn't rich enough to allow people not to work. Some day we will be but until then things like the Earned Income Tax Credit will help increase the demand for labor.
This seems a lot more important than any dumb question I might have thought up for him. 
Tagging /u/thisisbillgates .
I am not sure if Steam here means the gaming platform or adding Arts to Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. I have always been a big STEM fan but I have nothing against either STEAM.
 I know he's said in the past that he has no interest in being President, but we *desperately* need a science minded President.  If we're going to start electing businessmen to the Presidency again, I'd at least like one like Bill Gates, who is forward thinking, pragmatic, and best of all, compassionate. I'd be honored to vote for the man, personally.
I would def vote the Gates/Buffett ticket.
There are so many great TV shows now I can't keep up.I thought someone might ask specifically about Silicon Valley which I love. I can relate to Richard.Silicon Valley captures a lot of how crazy it is to start a new company and the dynamics of success. All the employees of Pied Piper remind me of people I have known.I love This is Us, The Crown, The Knick, Homeland, Downton Abbey, ...
I can't believe that actually works. We all made fun of Marvel movies for using this as a disguise but here we are.
It's edge now you heretic
Wow, it's like we're the same person with just 60 billion small differences.
I hope you realize that while so many people wish their entire lives to become rich and successful, the truly wise wish to be able to do something wonderful with their money. You win on all counts. Please continue to make the world a better place. We are all indebted to you.
I really needed to hear this right now. 
In that case my life is an abject failure. Thanks for telling it like it is, Mr. Gates!
I feel like Gates and Buffet are like Obama-Biden level bros.  Mutual admiration and respect for miles.
You're going to have to change the culture I think. Right now people think of politics like a football team and that is dangerous. 
Now more than ever perhaps we should focus on teaching kids in schools about critical thinking and history. And often people confuse critical thinking with "making sure they think like I do." But perhaps by focusing on presenting differing viewpoints and fairly analysing them, especially in the context of history, they might get a mindset which is a bit more open and understanding of others' viewpoints. You can't control what they do on facebook but school will always be there.
> Hopefully a grandfatherNO PRESSURE GATES KIDS
silly Mr. Gates, in 15 years voice recognition will (finally) be good enough that you won't have to type.-me, 15 years ago, probably.
>  Right now computers don't know how to represent knowledge so they can't read a text book and pass a test.TIL I'm a computer
I've seen some comment threads claim he doesn't do enough charity because he still has nearly a hundred billions so clearly he must not be throwing enough piles of cash at the problems! People are idiots
Sure you can. My employer is buying my time right now.Edit; got some interesting feedback from this one. I'd like to add a quote I like, for your enjoyment.If you don't build your own dream, someone will hire you to build theirs.-Michael scott
What are you most curious about, Bill?
wow i just awwd at bill gates 
"First world problems" are things the fortunate people in the first world complain about. For instance, while a third world problem might be that your water is contaminated with malaria, so you go to another pond and find out that one is contaminated with another virus, in the first world, it would be something like you have an iPhone and go to a friend's house, and the only chargers they have are Android chargers.So in your case, it might be that your Ferrari is out of gas, so you have to take the Lambo to the store that day ;)
It's pretty sad that in an age of technology and communications such as ours that one of our biggest and growing issues is the disconnect we have with each other.  
Bill Gates reads the Economist too. I feel so smart now. lol
\#StoolJumpingChallenge to raise money for people with colorectal cancer, anyone?
Let me guess, now you hate the game?My love turned to hatred for the movie Dead Poet's Society six months after I graduated with an English degree and remained unemployed.
Nah, that's the third in a slate of new expansions that were being worked on prior to his response. People were asking about another AoE game altogether.
Have an update 
> IE <= this is bad.FTFYj/k Bill
One could say you both *Xeroxed* the idea.
I think this is a great response. Thank you for being professional with him gone. It would be easy to just start throwing out trash with him gone and it speaks a lot about you to remain respectful even now. 
Reminds me of when /u/neiltyson explained that in order to justify Bill Gates stopping to pick up money on the street, it would need to be at least $45,000. Otherwise, it's not worth his time.
So after a couple of years in college. What will you say if he wants to drop out to pursue some crazy dream of starting his own company?
Piggybacking on that question, what's the best dad-joke you've come up with, or one you've felt particularly proud of?
>  Some day we will beAnd then what? I'm genuinely curious about what our society will look like and whether or not people are already actively preparing for or thinking about it, because it will cause a change like we've never seen before over the course of history.
> When you use a hot dog bun then it is ambiguous.Hence the question Bill, c'mon! We don't need this PR-shit, we need to know your real opinion on this.
I wonder if he saw this - Was this after he went offline?  That'd just be pretty sad.
Bill Gates loves Steam confirmed. Still a PC person.
confirmed: bill gates is in kahoots with Gabe Newell
Interestingly Bill Gates was despised through the 90's for what many considered his monopoly on OS's. Reddit in the 90's would not have been very kind to Bill Gates. 
Former Human Resources here.  There's a great book that explains all types of interview questions, what the employer is usually looking for in answers and how to answer base don your unique experience. It's called Knock 'Em Dead, and is printed new every year with updates including navigating new situations brought about by technology etc. That said, if you don't want to read a book, boguskudos' answer above is a good way to answer that question.
Silicon Valley! I love that! It has inspired me to consider pursuing a career in developing! Can you give me some tips?
Everyone notices it's Superman, but they're too polite to point it out. 
Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.Don't know about the playboy part but I'm sure he could get most of us in his bed if he wanted to. Not at the same time, probably, but then again he's really rich so he might be able to buy a bed that big.
Who the hell are any of those people?
Your dad is Bill Gates, man.
Well it was IE for the whole Gates era, he had nothing to do with Edge so I think it's ok
I think you meant 86 billions small differences.
> We are all indebted to youEh we all made him the richest guy in the world. Let's call it even. 
I'm proud of you, and I love you.
Keep in mind the closest people to you is yourself.
I think, if we really want to promote critical thinking, we need to teach it divorced from present real world politics. Because it's *always* been Partisan BS in my experience.
Well, you were kinda right.
how did you pass CAPTCHA if you're a computer ?checkmate, "computer".
1. People are idiots.2. They don't even know HOW stupid they are since the Gates' have already pledged to donate their entire fortune to charity when they pass.I believe their children will get a very modest inheritance (very modest by billionaire standards) and the rest goes to the foundation to improve the lives of people for years to come.Bill Gates and Warren Buffet are the Carnegie's of this generation. Buffet has already given over 30 BILLION dollars to charity, and Gates will give that much or more by the time he's 'done'.Amazing people.
Money well spent I see. 
Lookin good! 
As if Bill Gates doesn't know what a first world problem is. He's just smart enough to not answer the question while answering the question and endearing himself to people at the same time.
You both read Reddit as well
I can see this going very poorly. Stools are not very stable, and many people are terrible at jumping. Broken legs/arms/collarbones.... 
Actually no I still have the game and play it occasionally though most of my time is spent on games like CKII, CIV V/VI, and EU4
Yep, I've been waiting for AoEIV ever since the infamous instruction manual pic...
Well no one here seems to have played aoe3 because all I ever see talked about is aoe2 nostalgia- why put out a 4th if the 3rd is so ignored? 
Microsoft and Bill Gates ... are not the same thing. For example, Microsoft and Bill Gates had two hugely different views on the whole FBI/Apple fiasco under Tim Cook. Remember that? Yeah, Gates thought it'd be fine for Apple to disable the security.. and the FBI would only use it "just this once" and all that. 
In the IT department for medical billing and collections here.Even just everyone on EPIC is not a fix. We have multiple clients on Epic, but the record formats vary from clinic to clinic, and state to state. Hell, even in the same hospital system, depending on city, we have variations in records and they are on the same EPIC and Meditech systems. Credit reporting is way easier. They use the Metro2 format and I can pull/place files and know what to expect no matter where and how they came in. Medical records are a nightmare from an IT standpoint. On the bright side, it keeps us busy!
Anyone who is still seriously trash talking in their 60s needs to grow up. 
Whilst it offers an interesting perspective, those kinds of calculations assume that Bill Gates stopping to pick up money somehow makes his corporate earnings drop by 45k. The truth is that his constant attention isn't necessary for Microsoft to continue generating profits.
"Here's a small loan of a million dollars..."Actually I would love for that to be the case.  
I know what it is:  Why are PCs like air conditioners?They stop working properly if you open Windows!

lol yeah who wants to be in bed with bill gates with a bunch of guys hahaha that would be super silly. lol tho if this actually is happening let me know just cause of how silly it would be lol
That's actually Gill Bates.
OP is missing out on that sweet sweet inheritance.
Maybe that guy has 26 billion dollars
Yeah Bill, hook us up.
I must say, it is really beautiful seeing you respond to that. You just made that person's day.
uhh, I love you more!
I mean, I rarely ever get them on the first try. Maybe I'm just brute forcing them. 
I think there is probably a little bit of both. You need to teach a man how to fish, but if he is going to die of starvation today knowing how to fish in the future isn't going to help him much. There is a hierarchy of needs that need to be met. Which is why I think the Gates Foundation work is so important (Vaccinating against preventable illness, breastfeeding, trying to decrease infant mortality, etc) It's tough to get solutions to bigger longterm problems if half the population is dying before age 1. 
I remember when I was growing up, Bill Gates was the villain. Times sure have changed.
The brain trying to understand itself is the most mind-boggling thing. Like a mirror trying to see its own reflection.
*snaps* yes!
> play pool and they fuck me in the ass and sometimesNo need to be redundant. 
I feel smarter now too
Did somebody say, broken arms?
>CKIIMy man.
In my subjective experience, I have more nostalgia for AoE2 as that's what I played when I was a kid, and AoE3 introduces fairly fundamental differences in game mechanics to the previous two iterations. I enjoy AoE3 in and of itself, but it doesn't FEEL like AoE2 or the original AoE. 
It's interesting that we have videos that can play on thousands of different devices using hundreds of different video players, but medical records have yet to be standardized in any way. 
Dude, you don't google stuff, you bing it.
Haha just googled it up. Interesting. Are there Mac ports for all Windows games? I was suggested by a friend to try out one for Dark Souls when my Mac was my only running computer, although I think that was just a mod.
Especially if they've been elected president...
I believe the calculations actually show that the 45k is roughly  equivalent to your average person stopping to pick up a penny and that's why it isn't worth his time. An average persons earnings won't be reduced by a penny to pick up a penny but it's still probably not worth the time and effort.
I'm sure Bill's kid would do many great things with that small loan. 
Feel like we deserve a picture of this trashed mac!
Smile more
"Let me get this straight, you think that your client, one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in the world, is secretly a vigilante, who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands, and your plan is to blackmail this person? ....Good luck."
He's RAMing me with his eyes. The 5.25 inch floppy is a lie.
Lol, yeah, if anyone has a place and time send it to me so I know in what direction and when to laugh lol.
Bill isn't dead yet. Jesus christ.
That's the most likely scenario. Time to go on forbes and find out who is worth 26 billions dollars.
Dibs on secret Santa this year!!!
He didn't say it back :(

The whole hero worship of Steve Jobs and shitting on Bill Gates thing has never made any sense to me. People are weird.

Any developer sitting at home on his laptop can change/modify/distribute video files of interest to everyone and anyone.Medical records aren't really consumable or open.
Dark Souls is a pretty shitty console port on Windows, requiring third-party mods to even properly work in a lot of cases. Seeing that mess run through another layer of fuckery on a Mac would be glorious.
Maybe even become president someday...
Lucius Fox. I loved Morgan Freeman's fox. Come to think of it, I generally love Morgan Freeman. 
george soros
I wouldn't either to be honest. We know Bill Gates is Bill Gates and he does amazing things. This other guy is effectively anonymous for starters, and could be the world's most evil person for all any of us know.
I failed it once.
Yes I did lol, thanks
With a father like Bill Gates, who pretty much exemplifies that adage 'With great power comes great responsibility', I think that this would be a good thing.
And he loves you too
Still waiting for my paid protesting check mr. soros 
I'm a ok person
What else can you come up with? 
Let him rest dude he did his job.
In ten years? One can only imagine.
Can you explain what your life in Moscow is like?
Dear all,how can we make sure that people still want to leak important information when everyone who does so puts the rest of their lives at stake?
Laura, in your recent interview with David Carr, you expressed your commitment as an artist to convey the emotions you feel as a target of state surveillance. Do you also consider yourself a journalist? If so, do you think there is a tension between artistic expression and journalistic integrity? I also would like to thank you for a wonderful film, Glenn for your commitment to no-bullshit and adversarial journalism, and Ed for having the courage to do what was right. We are all in debt to you. 
Hey everyone - thanks for the questions, I really enjoyed it. Sorry, but I have to run. Hope to be back soon!
I'm out of time, everybody. Thank you so much for the interest, the support, and most of all, the great questions. I really enjoyed the opportunity to engage with reddit again -- it really has been too long.
Laura: Will you release more footage of the meetings held with Snowden in Hong Kong?
/u/PresidentObama do you have anything you want to ask?
Edward, a friend of mine works for the NSA. He still actively denies that anything you have done or said is legitimate, completely looking past any documented proof that you uncovered and released.  Is this because at lower levels of the agency, they don't see what's going on in the intelligence gathering section? Or do you suspect he simply refuses to see any wrongdoing by his employer?
Very exciting to see you here Mr Snowden.We've now known about the scary stuff happening at the NSA for quite some time. And yet from what I've seen, there's been no real effort to stop it.What are your thoughts on what we, as regular citizens, can do now?
Mr Snowden, do you feel that your worst fear is being realized, that most people don't care about their privacy?
Do you mind people pirating Citizenfour?
I have a filmmaking question for Laura. I'm sure this was probably answered in an interview somewhere, but what kind of legal issues did you run into with this film if any? Was there ever the threat of the footage being seized at customs?
Mr. Snowden: what was the last thing you did as a "free man" before you had to go on the run? 
Laura Poitras- Loved the film. Saw it when it came to a theatre in a nearby town. Any hints on when it may be available on BluRay? I'll be recording this on my DVR this evening, but would still love to own a copy.Laura Poitras, Edward Snowden, and Glenn Greenwald - Thank you all for the work on the film and thank you Mr. Snowden for coming forward!
Moscow is the biggest city in Europe. A lot of people forget that. Shy of Tokyo, it's the biggest city I've ever lived in. I'd rather be home, but it's a lot like any other major city.

Whistleblower protection laws, a strong defense of the right for someone charged with political crimes to make any defense they want (currently in the US, someone charged with revealing classified information is entirely prohibited from arguing before the jury that the programs were unlawful, immoral, or otherwise wrongful), and support for the development of technically and legally protected means of communications between sources and journalists.The sad truth is that societies that demand whistleblowers be martyrs often find themselves without either, and always when it matters the most.
They're trying to release it, but 7 billion names takes a while to upload. 
That article doesn't quote him saying he is going to release such a list, it seems to be an assumption on the part of the reporter.
Thanks for the kind words. I definitely consider myself ajournalist, as well as an artist and a filmmaker. In my mind, it's not aquestion about whether I am one or the other. Documentary films needs to do more than journalism - they need to communicate something that is more universal.
>with reddit *again*Was he involved with reddit before this? 
Yes, I do plan to release more footage from Hong Kong shoot. On the first day we met Ed, Glenn conducted a long interview (4-5 hours) that is extraordinary. I also conducted a separate interview with Ed re: technical questions. The time constraints of a feature film made it impossible to include everything. I will release more.  I also filmed incredible footage with Julian Assange/WikiLeaks that we realized in the edit room was a separate film.
Thank you for asking. My main question for Mr. Snowden is a technical one. How did you get so many questions planted in your AMA so effectively? With my presidential resources I was only able to get about a dozen questions prepared in advance and upvoted in my AMA along with my canned answers. (There are only so many interns in the White House.) You must be utilizing Russian intel to manipulate reddit so effectively. How do you do it? Tell me and I'll knock 3 months off your supermax prison life sentence. Thanks in advance. -B
ah yes, one of the worst AMAs ever done on reddit, bullshit answers, crashed reddit, and a few of the questions he answered obviously done by his staff.
/u/falcon4287 have you considered the implications for your friend if he were known by his employer to have said something significantly different from what he's told you?
One of the biggest problems in governance today is the difficulty faced by citizens looking to hold officials to account when they cross the line. We can develop new tools and traditions to protect our rights, and we can do our best to elect new and better representatives, but if we cannot enforce consequences on powerful officials for abusive behavior, we end up in a system where the incentives reward bad behavior post-election. That's how we end up with candidates who say one thing but, once in power, do something radically different. How do you fix that? Good question.
Hey guys, sorry -- the reddit mods are being a little weird. My account is /u/SuddenlySnowden. Mods: Can you pull back the ban?  I can't post from the primary account. Thanks.
"Not living in an American prison." would be my guess.
You should ask the US Government:1) why are you putting whistleblowers in prison at record rates?2) why did you revoke his passport when he was trying to transit through Russia, thus forcing him to stay there?3) why do you put whistleblowers in the position of having to choose between asylum in another country or decades in prison?
brb becoming a whistleblower
I don't have a commercial interest in the film, so I can't speak for the filmmakers, but I know what it's like to be a student with no money.
Asking the important questions 
Given the fact that I had been repeatedly detained at the U.S. border because of my work on previous films, I moved to Berlin to edit Citizenfour. When Ed contacted me in early 2013 I gave him my assurance I would never comply with a subpoena. Before going to Hong Kong I met with many lawyers to assess the risk. I ignored some of the warnings - for instance the Washington Post urged me not to travel to Hong Kong. Another lawyer said not to bring my camera. In the end I decided I could not live with the decision to not travel to Hong Kong. 
Is winter harsh? Do you ever want to go out, but wake up and find yourself suddenly snowed in?
Don't you fear that at some point you will be used as leverage in a negotiation? eg; "if you drop the sanctions we give you Snowden"
When you get back to America, we will hold a parade and give you a trophy good man! Thank you sir.
Isn't this, in of itself, a perfect example of how mass transparency of information can fight against the very ills of secretiveness? By effectively displaying to the world what's been happening to you - the "powers that be" are intimidated to stop?
What can be done to prevent this from happening to others (unjustly), in your opinion?
To tag on to the Putin question: There's not, and that's part of the problem world-wide. We can't just reform the laws in one country, wipe our hands, and call it a day. We have to ensure that our rights aren't just being protected by letters on a sheet of paper somewhere, or those protections will evaporate the minute our communications get routed across a border. The only way to ensure the human rights of citizens around the world are being respected in the digital realm is to enforce them through systems and standards rather than policies and procedures.
Why did you wait so long to release such an important finding?
> currently in the US, someone charged with revealing classified information is entirely prohibited from arguing before the jury that the programs were unlawful, immoral, or otherwise wrongfulI've heard so many people say "if Snowden didn't do anything wrong then why doesn't he come home?" That's good to know.
I've watched this talk and have used it as an example to others on why this matters and why we should care. Sadly most either refuse to believe it, or will just argue back. What other suggestions do you have to combat this argument?
"NSA, who have you spied on?""Yes"
If they released it all the public would forget about it in a week. By constantly and slowly leaking documents there's always a new and outrageous revelation that is being discussed.
> Don't let it happen in your country.God dammit - Canadian 
Considering all that's happened, that's the most admirable answer possible. A follow-up, if you don't mind: if Americans could start changing the political acceptance of intrusive spying by government agencies, what would it be? I personally am not sure if any candidate up for election next year would truly care about the issue beyond campaign promises, so I'm a bit afraid of not being able to use one's vote to enact change. I greatly appreciate this, Mr. Snowden. I work in the federal government in Washington DC, though I am in the DoD, and I know many of us personally are concerned. 
This is why there needs to be a movement to get all logical voters to switch to Independent and vote 3rd party. I swapped mine a few months ago, and wish more people would do the same. It doesn't matter if you agree 100% with the 3rd party - we need an alternative because Democrats and Republicans have been strangling democracy for far too long. 
Edward Snowden just called for civil disobedience against the US government whilst also arguing for the legalization of marijuana during an AMA. This is quite possibly the most reddit thing ever.

Oh man, I would absolutely love to see the whole, raw footage you shot. It was very interesting to see how things unfolded before the world knew a whole lot about who had leaked things.Is this separate film with Assange in production currently?

I get to reply to an Edward Snowden comment -- the internet is fucking **great**.
What's your favorite Dank meme?
Hey admins, this is a pretty big AMA, how about you cut Snowden some slack with the reply/submission rules for a few hours?
Did you confirm your email?
> Think about how badly you want to believe that. Everybody wants to be valued and special, and nobody wants to think they've perhaps contributed to a huge mistake. It's not evil, it's human.> That makes sense. Sometimes, I wonder if that's what it all comes down to.
> I want you to look around and decide for yourself what you believe, independent of what people says, indepedent of what's on TV, and independent of what your classified emails might claim.This x1000
I completely understand him not wanting to say something over the phone... but when I brought up Edward Snowden, his defensiveness about the subject was not "feeding me the company line," he was genuinely upset about what Snowden did and was angrily calling him a traitor.  Given that it was the day before the guy's wedding, I didn't want to get into it with him by mentioning my views that Snowden is a national hero. He was already irate at the mere mention of Snowden's name. That's far from just telling me what he's "supposed to" say. He genuinely believed what he was saying.
Yeah but it makes for a good netflix show.
Thank you very much for the reply and sharing your thoughts.
Mod here - really sorry for the confusion. Your colleagues set up the OPs account for you and when you started replying on a different account we had to assume it was a fake.Your new account /u/SuddenlySnowden is good to go.
"Not dieing in a secret American prison" has to be up there as well.
Why do you think Obama had been so aggressively jailing whistleblowers and censoring journalists? If I recall correctly, he stated whistleblowers were essential to democracy (I'm paraphrasing). Was his earlier attitude simply pandering to his base? 
> lol no.*--Edward Snowden*
Amy Adams, Toby McGuire. IN. SNOWDEN
And then you get painted by the American media as a rapist and sex offender through their common character assassination plots.
You should put it on Netflix ASAP though. More people will watch it that way as well.
Much better than the ones asking how the food is in Moscow or how cold the winters are.
Canada, Sweden and North Dakota have pretty harsh winters, too. As does Boston.
Sometimes I wake up and find myself suddenly Snowden.
It is very realistic that in the realpolitik of great powers, this kind of thing could happen. I don't like to think that it would happen, but it certainly could. At the same time, I'm so incredibly blessed to have had an opportunity to give so much back to the people and internet that I love. I acted in accordance with my conscience and in so doing have enjoyed far more luck than any one person can ask for. If that luck should run out sooner rather than later, on balance I will still - and always - be satisfied.

I think more than voting third party, we need to change our vote system to the alternate vote.  Meaning you rank your favorites. If your first vote doesn't get any votes at all, but your second vote was for someone who had a chance, then your second vote would go towards the election.   That way the third party doesn't take away from the main party that most agrees with your beliefs. Because unfortunately, right now a vote for a third part is essentially a vote for one of the major parties.  
I can imagine some student in the future having to read Thoreaus 'Civil Disobedience', Kings 'Letter from a Birmingham Jail' and this Snowden response from 4 hours ago.
damn that's relevant

Except,  it's not just a reddit thing.  Virtually anyone who actually follows current and past politics will realize civil disobedience against the government is the way to get things done quick...  
Can imagine the call. Hello Mr. Putin, could you please put our new president on a plane and send him to us?
Dude that "where would we be if the British crown had perfect surveillance and could have locked up the founding fathers" argument is probably the most succinct and impactful demonstration of why surveillance is bad that I have ever heard. I think it will most successfully break through to people who are stuck in the "I have nothing to hide" mindset. Because it raises the question, "Yes, but what if you DID have something to hide, not because you're a criminal, but because your government is?" 
By voting in the primaries for the guys who talk about it.
I think Paul has a decent shot at winning the GOP nomination.  He's very competitive in a lot of states and polls well against Hillary.  He also appeals to younger folks and minorities much more than his counterparts.

I have the impression that a lot of NSA people think they are doing a great thing for protecting the country, defending US interests.And to a certain point, they are right. They just don't realize that at the same time, they're destroying everything the US prides itself about (individual freedoms, democracy, ...).
You got gilded in 30 seconds. Wtf?
Thanks! Feel free to prune this part of the thread.
The disclosures really changed me personally. Information security and cryptography is something I somehow was just not that aware of before, and now I can't get enough of it, it's the perfect confluence of all my interests. As someone who graduated college not sure what to do next, it feels so empowering to have a real goal now, I want to work on the tools that will protect people's rights and help people to use them. So thank you for everything you've done, I'm still amazed at how well planned and executed it all was.

Agree... it's just tough to get people motivated when they aren't seeing the impact right in front of their faces. With most successful movements that I can think of, the boot was felt on millions of necks to a point it interfered with their lives.
And by making it THE campaign issue. It's important that voters know where the candidates stand. Safe to say Hillary and Jeb are pro spying on Americans. Let's make them say it publically over and over again.

Snowden said in an interview about what you just said is the most scary part now. The circulating jokes about how 'you're on the list' or 'I don't want to do this because I might disappear' is the very evidence that the Police State and their invisible army of fear has already engulfed you. To claim that one lives in a free country when one fears to type certain things on a Google tab in his own home is a joke.

It's not just Harper.  Trudeau is supporting the bill and says he'll change it a bit to add oversight once he's elected, but oversight has proven useless at stopping these violations everywhere else and it's doubtful that he would do it anyways.The Liberal Party has always been just as bad and probably worse on privacy issues.

A friendly reminder that the NDP is taking a hard stance (so far) against the bill. Honestly I was pretty surprised that the Liberals aren't, and if I had been considering voting for them this time around anyway this would have instantly changed that.

What? Why?
I think Sam Jackson should play Snowden in the inevitable biopic.

Hi NSA! Do you like dank memes?
It's a deal breaker for me as well. I'm definitely not voting liberal
As someone who would have never voted NDP before. I sure as fuck am now. They may be misguided. They may be bad money managers. But if the conservatives cant manage our budget who says the NDP cant. I believe they will actually tax the resources heading out (which we desperately need to start doing) Its not about any of that anymore. When we are goose stepping our way to fascism... We have to vote for the people who will stop it.

**Why are you guys buying Senator Bernie Sanders reddit gold? Why not consider donating that few bucks to his campaign? It's far more meaningful and useful.**   Lol, smart ass gold. First time I've seen that. 
Hi Mr. Sanders,When Obama first campaigned, he brought a lot of optimism and many voters truly believed that he had good intentions of being a different kind of politician than we had become used to. So, if you win, what will be different that will allow you to get done what is best for the country and not fall in line like other candidates?
What is the most useful thing we can do to benefit your campaign besides donating money?
Senator Sanders,I am a transgender US Army Soldier with a decade of service. A recent study revealed that there are approximately 15,500 transgender personnel currently serving in the US Military. Current Department of Defense policies prevent us from serving openly, but the policy is under review.What are your thoughts regarding transgender rights generally, and open transgender military service specifically?
Senator Sanders, as a Conservative I can say with conviction that I admire your authenticity and dedication to principles, notwithstanding the fact I don't agree with a great deal of your policy proposals. My question to you, sir, is approximately how much money will your spending policies (infrastructure / free tuition, etc.) add to our nation's debt?  Does the potential for increasing our already staggering deficit concern you?
Hello!  Thanks for doing this AMA, and for all you do in office.  With your presidential bid becoming official I've started to sense some measure of hope returning to this country.  Win or lose, you're doing great things.  Please do keep it up.There's been a lot of talk lately about your stance on gun control, all of which has been sensationalized to the point of complete confusion.Can you outline your general views on gun control for us?  Be as specific as you like, I'd just like to get something that hasn't gone through the media's spin factory.Thanks!
If you get elected president, what is your plan for NASA?
Huge issue for me because I feel my vote goes to waste living in Oklahoma most of the time.
I believe that climate change is perhaps the most significant planetary crisis that we face and we have got to be extremely bold in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels and towards energy efficiency and sustainability. The fact is that investing in solar, wind, geothermal and energy efficiency is far more cost-effective than nuclear plants. Further, I do not support more nuclear power plants when we do not know how we get rid of the toxic waste from the ones that already exist.
My first effort would be to rally the American people to demand that Congress pass a progressive agenda which reverses the decline of our middle class. We have got to create millions of decent-paying jobs rebuilding our infrastructure, we've got to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, we've got to overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision and we have to transform our energy system in order to protect us from climate change. If the American people are politically active and demand that Congress act on their behalf, we can accomplish those goals and much more.
I voted against the USA Patriot Act and voted against reauthorizing the USA Patriot Act. Obviously, terrorism is a serious threat to this country and we must do everything that we can to prevent attacks here and around the world. I believe strongly that we can protect our people without undermining our constitutional rights and I worry very very much about the huge attacks on privacy that we have seen in recent years -- both from the government and from the private sector. I worry that we are moving toward an Orwellian society and this is something I will oppose as vigorously as I can.
I voted against the war in Iraq and I voted against the first Gulf War. I am strongly opposed to sending American combat troops into Iraq and Syria. At the end of the day, the war against ISIS will only be won when the Muslim countries in the area fully engage and defeat ISIS and other groups that are distorting what Islam is supposed to be about. The United States and other western countries should be supportive of the efforts of those governments, but cannot lead them. The nightmare, which I believe a number of Republicans want to see, is perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East.
1. Well, that is a very big hypothetical. Yes I do believe that there can be just wars. But, you are talking to somebody who opposed Vietnam, who voted against the first Gulf War, who voted against the War in Iraq and who believes the United States has been far far too aggressive militarily in the last many years. We have got to work with the international community not only in trying to create peaceful resolutions to conflict, but to address the underlying causes of war. This is not easy stuff. But that is the direction in which we have to move.
Great question. Our legislation not only would make tuition free at public colleges and universities, it would also cut student debt in half. It is absurd that millions of college graduates today are carrying debts of $50,000, $60,000, $100,000 or more. Our legislation deals with the issue of student debt in a very significant way.
Uh, senator I believe you may have done a boo boo. I don't see any parent comment that poses any questions.
Confirmed first time reddit user.  
I am supportive of NASA not only because of the excitement of space exploration, but because of all the additional side benefits we receive from research in that area. Sometimes, and frankly I don't remember all of those votes, one is put in a position of having to make very very difficult choices about whether you vote to provide food for hungry kids or health care for people who have none and other programs. But, in general, I do support increasing funding for NASA.
This is an important question. Many young voters these days still have the young kid mentality when it comes to space. Space travel has never seemed so probable. 
What I'm most interested in is how realistic he thinks a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United is. He's mentioned it several times, and I feel like once corporate influence is minimized in elections some of these other issues become a little easier to tackle.
Let me just say this -- the state of Vermont voted to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana and I support that. I have supported the use of medical marijuana. And when I was mayor of Burlington, in a city with a large population, I can tell you very few people were arrested for smoking marijuana. Our police had more important things to do.Colorado has led the effort toward legalizing marijuana and I'm going to watch very closely to see the pluses and minuses of what they have done. I will have more to say about this issue within the coming months.
Any such fears are unfounded, since poll after poll shows that a growing majority of voters supports legalizing marijuana. Even larger supermajorities support medical marijuana or letting states set their own marijuana laws without federal interference. These days, the greatest political risk is in endorsing the current prohibition that voters no longer support.
As somebody who has consistently voted to end discrimination in all forms -- who voted against DOMA way back in the 1990s -- I will do all that I can to continue our efforts to make this a nondiscriminatory society, whether those being discriminated against are transgender, gay, black or Hispanic.
I respectfully disagree. It is not my view, nor have I suggested, that GMO food causes health problems. What I have said is that the people of our country, as well as people around the world, have the right to make choices in terms of what they eat and have the right to have labels telling them whether or not food is made with GMOs. As you know, GMO labeling exists in dozens of countries and the state legislature in Vermont also passed a bill requiring that. I support that effort.
Not saying this is your point of view, but I have found that most people who are concerned about the deficit are also staunchly against cutting the defense budget.  If we halved the military budget, we could easily afford to free tuition, complete overhaul of our infrastructure, shore up social security and pay down the deficit.  This would still leave us with the largest military budget in the world, by a very large margin.  Given Sen. Sanders record of voting against wars and being staunchly against our use of military solutions, I can see this as a viable solution. 
He's going to avoid talking about guns  completely, which probably is smart. He already has far left voters probably, but if he wants center votes he can't hate on guns.
Look up his voting history.  He appears to be "anti gun".  Supports banning so called assault rifles and all that.
He is a socialist. The problem is that the people you're talking to don't understand socialism or are confusing it with communism.
Please join /r/StudentsForSanders. Maybe we can help you with this and other questions... :)
Hate to say it but this sounds like a very generic Democrat talking point ("The Koch brothers and Republicans are who we need to fight!").  What about more fundamental changes like moving beyond the First Past the Post format we're currently using?
In OK, 1,600,000 eligible voters didn't show up to the polls in the 2012 election. Republicans won the state by 440,000. It might seem hopeless; it might be a long shot, but vote anyway. If enough people decide voting is important, maybe next time the election is only lost by 100,000...then 10,000...then people see it as important and you change the system. The only time your vote doesn't count is when you don't cast it.
Is it really true that dollar for dollar, we get more energy out of solar wind and geothermal than nuclear? Seems too good to be true. Does anyone have a citation on that? Or is he just saying that the investment is more cost effective down the road?
But would you support nuclear as an alternative until innovation in solar and wind make them realistic sources of energy for the entire nation?
A lot of your answers depend on rallying the American people to previously unseen levels of political participation and activism.In the case that that remarkable transformation did not occur, what would you still expect to achieve as President?
Funny how by voting against the Patriot Act, you are more of a patriot than if you would vote *for* it. Nice going senator.
If only some president would have warned us about the increasing influence of the military industry in Congress.
This response moved me. I've realized recently that I've become totally cynical and hopeless with the state of politics in this country. I haven't felt like my voice is being heard, even though my voice is matched by that of my under-35 year old peers.It's just made me so apathetic, and I know that that's the most dangerous thing that can happen.Thank you for reminding me that there are actually sane, rationally thinking, honest individuals out there that want to represent me. Now if we can just pull together and get you elected!!
Do you think we should have a similarly large military presence globally, but focus more on community building, or scaling back our presence entirely?
Thank you as a college student
As a non American, please America elect this guy president. Please.
I think you should stop using the word entitled if you want to argue this point because it has grown to have a negative connotation in recent years.  You should speak about these things as basic human rights.  While these phrases technically mean the same thing I think you're more likely to have people actually listen to your ideas if you state it as having a right to health care vs being entitled to have health care.
Bernie, as someone who gets their paycheck indirectly from that NASA funding, you've got my vote (and already donations from both my wife and I).... just don't cut existing programs.. _please_.
Exactly, people have to remember that gold also gives exposure and most important supports Reddit.
I don't think you answered the questionLets say you get this 80% of the vote.>What, specifically, do you feel you can realistically accomplish in your first term as President that my age bracket can get excited about?
People are organizing meetups across the nation. Be on the lookout to show your support in a city near you.
Part of the problem is we can't have Nordic-like prisons when we have such an enormous ocean of prisoners. If we're going to fight mass incarceration it's not just about legalizing drugs (though that's the most important thing, because the illegal drug market breeds crime), it's also going to have to be about leniency, and that's going to be politically toxic, to openly advocate treating criminals less harshly, to say that maybe more people need to get off with a slap on the wrist, community service, but not jail time. 
It's important for us as citizens to tell the DNC that debates are important for the population to make a choice on candidates. We shouldn't just sit down and let a party that some of us identify with choose such a low number of debates.
> Our police had more important things to do.That's really the most important take-away from this answer.
This perspective is completely reasonable. Thank you for having an open mind on the issue.
Colorado has made so much money in marijuana sales they're actually investing it in the public schools.Why don't we do that on a national scale?
Wait, did a politician just say he wanted to think about an issue before answering? That he wanted to review the evidence, see the facts, and then make an educated decision?Do I have a fever?
I fully expected you to be extremely selective with what you'd answer in this AMA. It's awesome seeing how real you are at answering all these questions.
Wow, I respect the fact that you can answer the hardball questions. This says a lot about your character 
No, it's not. Not with current technology levels. The other issue is space. It takes a lot less space to make a lot more power from a nuclear plant that from solar or wind farms.
I could be wrong, but I believe that since Nuclear is such a large capital investment there's a fair chance that a similar investment into renewables could be more useful in the long term.
To reiterate: a stepping-stone technology? That is, energy-demands must be met one way or another. And while R&D continues with alternative energy resources, is nuclear energy better than coal or other fossil-fuel alternatives?
If Bernie can't make that remarkable transformation happen, he's not gonna be president. The ONLY way we can get him elected is if large groups of us start actively participating in government.
This shouldn't be news at this point, but they name these things like that on purpose.  Calling a bill that digs into constitutional protections the "patriot act" was very much by design.
Or maybe if a President had warned us about foreign entanglements in general, and told us to stick to solving domestic problems. You know, like maybe the very first President.
> My strong belief is that it is imperative that we maintain our vision of what American can be, and that we fight hard to make that happen. DO NOT GIVE UP.I think I just felt my heart start waving an American flag. Beautiful reminder to cynical old me.
serious question, if we want to focus more on community building, is that really a job for the military?  Wouldn't there be organizations that are designed specifically for this we could send instead?  No matter how kind our troops are, most locals would be off-put by people carrying assault rifles around them.
Gotta be careful with these kinds of answers though.  Obama ran with a campaign promise of giving free tuition/cutting it drastically (can't remember which atm) based on students doing so many hours of community service per year.  Didn't hear a word about that after the election.
He's going to need a lot of people talking about him and spreading his ideas around. I basically asked all of my family, coworkers, and friends what they think about him and basically no one really knows about him yet unfortunately.
I'm sure he's gotten in trouble before for that one, entitled is a hot-button word. You're right. I hope someone on his campaign reads that. I might also suggest using "deserves" in place of "is entitled to" in his answer. >But, if we can develop a strong grassroots movement which says that every man, woman and child in this country deserves a minimum standard of living -- deserves health care, deserves education, deserves housing -- then we can succeedI also like 'deserve' in this case because it implies people are worthy of these services rather than  'entitlements.'
Well you can look at it this way, if he becomes president, there'll be one less person in the Senate voting for budget cuts to NASA.
The people who are giving him gold are probably *also* donating to his campaign. 
Can anyone provide a serious counter point to moving voting day to a weekend/holiday? I've yet to hear one
I second this, Senator. I feel you tiptoed around the question. Is an elaboration possible?
they also shouldn't be allowed to ban candidates from debating anywhere else, otherwise they get banned from the dnc debates, and yet they have done exactly that. 
When you compare recreational cannabis to the other issues that he is fighting for, it is more than reasonable to focus energy elsewhere, especially when the movement already has so much traction. Agreed.
I haven't followed Bernie's political career for very long but the one thing that I noticed right away is that he answers questions directly, and often bluntly, without dancing around the topic and playing political double-speak games. Ask Bernie a question and you'll get a straight answer.
I don't think there is a way to make a label that doesn't imply some sort of warning.
I am a rather flaming Libertarian and I have to say that I support almost none of his positions. I'm not sure the OP of this question really understands what Modern American Libertarianism is really based upon. Now if she was a Left Libertarian from the 50's, it would make a lot more sense, but then she should just be identifying herself as a Moderate Progressive nowadays.
Vermonter expat here. Despite living in England now, I can verify. I'm only back at home 2-3 weeks a year and have usually bumped into Bernie every time. He always has time for you (he's heard my grandma out so many times) and he never bullshits. He talks straight. I like him a lot.
That was 2007, solar has drastically dropped in price
We need to start outvoting our grandparents.
Kentucky had primaries today (I voted) and they are estimating, at the high end, 10% participation. Thats not 10% of the Kentucky population, just 10% of those *registered to vote*. Until we are able to increase the number of people who vote, we will be stagnant in our political changes.  Make days where we vote national/state holidays. Encourage people to vote, and make it easy. Right now, so few decide for the many. And it shows.
Yep. It's like the pro-life/pro-choice debate. By opposing one side, you're suddenly "against life" or you "don't like choice."Similarly, if the general public hears a senator is against something called the "Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act?" Obviously, they want the terrorists to win and will have bad PR for a bit.
The difference between Obama and Sanders though is that this isn't just a campaign promise. It's an ideal he's been working toward for years. He's not saying it because he hopes it'll earn him votes; he's saying it because it's sound policy. And unlike Obama, Sanders won't be bought out by large corporations telling him, "Nah, we don't wanna pay for everyone's college."Obama had to worry about a second term. I don't think Bernie has that interest. He wants to get in, get as much shit done as possible, and let the 2020 candidate worry about 8 years.
Political capital is a very real thing for a senator to balance in the day to day.
Don't make a judgement until you actually see the full bills that he voted against. It's very likely that in a foreign aid bill a provision or rider was added to decrease NASA's funding
It might not be that he wanted to vote against NASA, but that he really thought the funds were needed elsewhere. 
What if his whole campaign was a ploy to get Reddit Gold?
People with service/lower wage jobs don't get weekends/holidays off.
A better option is vote-by-mail on a federal level. Oregon has mail-in-voting and it's made voting much easier on me. My current job wouldn't mind if I took time off work to vote, but I have previously had jobs that would force you to use a sick/vacation/PTO hours if you wanted to vote.
Making it a national holiday or moving it to the weekend severely limits the time.Instead span it out over a week and make the employer give a paid day off that the employee chooses during that 1 week (agreed upon before that week.)5 days + weekend to find some time to go to the polls and you don't miss out on money?  Seems like a good idea (to me anyways.)
The more people between 18-35 who vote, the more the Republicans lose.
Wow. I just opted for Democratic party over Independent, just because of Sanders. Never realized Oregon had a closed primary. TIL. 
You could have it listed in the ingredients. INGREDIENTS: Water, High Fructose Corn Syrup made from genetically modified corn^11. short description or name of the strain or modified gene on the footnote.
Nobody is going to see this, and we're going to continue seeing that misquote everywhere.
And we need to start in the Primaries
or "citizens united".their entire wording is the exact opposite of what they do.
Because he knows that if he gets in and gets shit done, the people who like what he did the first time around will vote for him again.
Yeah, that's how policy makers get their bills through. Want to deregulate the banks, attach it to a bill that targets sex offenders. If anyone votes against it, they are pro-sex offenders.  That why Bill Clinton had it nice. Line item veto was the shit. I think the benefit of it far out weights the downsides. Would prefer if the line item veto could be overturned with a simple majority though. That way its truly more fair. 
Isn't NASA's budget like 0.1% of the national budget? Doubling it won't have much of a cost.
The way these riders work is pretty obnoxious - you could be fully in support of a bill to outlaw kicking kittens, only to have someone add a rider to exterminate those pesky unicorns.  Either way you vote, it becomes an attack ad in the next election cycle.
Or hospital workers!
I dunno how they would apply it in the USA, but in my country, the election day is a mandatory holiday, your boss cant overrule it.There is of course some absence, no method is perfect, but we do get more than the 40% USA gets. Last presidential election (Which were rigged as hell so many decided to say 'fuck it') we had an 80% of participation.
Early voting already exists in the US, but it isn't publicized at all. There are lots of early voting polling places open for like two weeks before election day. However not every state allows early voting, which is a shame.
The more big money loses, you mean. Let's not make this a partisan issue.
Iowan here. Looking into caucusing. 
God damn that gave me chills. I knew he was a good president but that just raised my respect for him so much. 
Never saw this before. Why didnt anyone listen?
Opposed the military industrial complex AND levied huge taxes on the rich... Are we sure this man was a Republican?
Well I understand that, but let's be realistic. He's gonna be 74 on election night, so that'll make him 77/8 come campaign season. I'm pretty sure by then he'll be ready to retire, unless by some act of God his first term goes so incredibly well that a second term is inevitable.
Not even that. Senators will negotiate by saying "If you support my bill to defund NASA I will support your bill to feed hungry children. You will accept this deal because without my vote your bill wont pass."
Wouldn't hospital workers still have to work on national holidays?
Iowan here, looking into corn.
A five star general, a Supreme Commander of Allied forces in Europe, who became President, and subsequently retired to the family farm leaving a warning that the Military Industrial Complex made him fearful of the future of the United States.  Definitely an interesting person.
He also liked to install dictators after removing democratically elected governments. So, he wasn't all good. 
It could be worse, /u/kyle8999. You could be Warlizard. 
Or a week where you can vote?
We can be like Oregon and make all voting be vote-by-mail. But then that would make it harder to prevent  black and poor from voting. 
Must be tiny right? I live in Des Moines so I'm no expert but didn't planting just take place?
"Operation Enduring Freedom"
I really wish I lived in Vermont now.
Gordon, how do you like your eggs?
Hi Chef,Are there any really strange food combinations that you enjoy?  
Is there any food that you won't even try?
Do you have any food recommendations for a college student on a budget?
Hi Chef, I'd like you know how you got into running and triathlons? 
Hello, Gordon! I'm very excited you're doing an AMA!Regarding food, what guilty pleasure do you have that most people would be shocked at? Fast food fries, frozen fish sticks, etc.Mine is spaghetti in a can. It's repulsive and I know I shouldn't eat it, but I can't help it.
Good afternoon, Chef. Do you have a favorite cocktail?
Hi Gordon! I'm a huge fan of yours, and enjoy watching all of your shows. I especially enjoyed your 'Home Cooking' series, and I want you to know that they sparked an interest in cooking for me that I'll never forget.Anyway, on to my question:What is the best meal you have ever had? And what about the worst?Thanks!
Are you willing to voice a GPS system?
Have you had any contact with Amy's Baking Company since their Kitchen Nightmares episode? How do you feel about the fact that they basically became a meme?
Hello Mr. Ramsay!My question is this: How do you feel about being a meme on the internet? 
What are the odds of you and Anthony Bourdain getting drunk together and arguing over what the best omelette is on YouTube?
Will you please, for the love of all that is holy, record a GPS navigation voice set?I would piss myself with joy to have my TomTom scream "Did you miss that Fucking turn on purpose, or are you simply that stupid?" Or similar encouragement.
What is your opinion of Guy Fieri?
Very good question.I have to say, scrambled.Over a slice of sourdough bread that has been grilled, and then sort of doused with Worcestershire sauce.Now scrambled eggs, I did a video a few years back with my youngest, Tilly, showing how to make scrambled eggs, and I think it has 10-11 million hits?And the nice thing about scrambled eggs is that they don't have to just be breakfast - you can have them in the evening, with some nice mushrooms, some tomatoes. You can have them as a snack at midnight, or at 5 o'clock in the afternoon. 
I had an amazing doubled pork chop with rhubarb. Now rhubarb is something we literally eat with desserts, but this dish was incredible. It was in Spain. It was a double pork-chop that had been slow-roasted over an open pit fire with rhubarb. Absolutely delicious. This was one of my mates that was trying to show off cooking in his back garden in Spain when we were out filming for KITCHEN NIGHTMARES. I didn't think it was going to work, to be honest.And then when I started tasting, I thought *Shit! This is delicious!* 
That's a really good question.I would recommend that you get adventurous with pulses - chickpeas, beans, lentils. And you know, cooking these is incredible. Brown rice? Phenomenal. You don't need expensive proteins. Just make them incredible with how you cook them, or prepare them - a pressure cooker is a great way of making these foods go a long way, is to cook them deliciously. Chilis, garlic, definitely. 
Good question! I got into running & doing triathlons - first of all, I've run over 15 marathons and doubles (ultra-marathons) in South Africa. So I needed a bigger sort of commitment, to spend a little bit more time to myself. So - listen - I love running, but it's given me quality time to spend on my own. SO I got into triathlons about 3 years ago, and it's helped me to stay even more focused in my day to day job. 
Well, first of all, you need help.***Spaghetti in a can!!?!*** That kind of shit we grew out of on our 8th birthday. I still remind my mum that she taught me how to spell with alphabetical spaghetti in a can.You need help, big time.My go-to sort of fast food snack... it would have to be In-N-Out Burger.*Oh my god,* honestly, it is, when I eat Double-Doubles. I am *terrible.* And I always bring it back on the airport when I'm flying from LA to London, I'll sneak it into the first class lounge at BA!
 OMG I worry about Victoria's ears when he sees that you eat spaghetti in a can. 
I have an amazing cocktail, which, you know, we're in Atlantic City currently, because we just launched the Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill here, which is where we're calling from now. It's with Tanqueray Gin, and it's called "Wake up you Donkey!" I mean, hahahahaha - it is incredible. And also, it's quite sort of spicy, and fragrant, and it's absolutely delicious. 
Wow, that's a great question.Well, negative - the WORST meal? There's been too many of them to tell you about, because the last ten years, working on KITCHEN NIGHTMARES, I've eaten a lot of crap. I think I've drank about THREE and half litres of Pepto-Bismol! And in terms of, you know, good meals - I had an incredible meal at the Black Liquor Market in Studio City. The most amazing Scotch eggs, deviled eggs, and then these short ribs that were braised in beer.*Incredible,* just incredible. 
"Make a U-turn, you *fucking* donkey!"
Jesus are those guys still in business?!
I was almost in tears when I clicked on the blue scrambled eggs....and then I clicked on the next link. Oh god, that was funny.
the positives in your post got me to click into the sub.the negatives are . . .1. that bologna cake looks phenominally horrible. 1. the blue eggs look like scrapings from a paint can that was left open. scrambled eggs don't have a uniform color. the perfect uniformity of color makes it look like it has no taste.
I will never eat normal scrambled eggs after making Gordon eggs.On Stove - Off Stove - On Stove - Off StoveIt's like magic.
"if you wanna be a good boy, run upstairs now and give it to her in bed....the breakfast." Gordon Ramsay.
/u/chooter please tell me how he pronounced "worchestershire"
>I thought Shit! This is delicious!I love that that's how you respond to a good meal.
The service is just as important.From a Michelin star restaurant maitre, thank you
>I don't cook for the guide, I cook for customers.We need more chefs - and restaurants - that abide by this premise. Thank you so much for doing this AMA.
That's really interesting.  For the adult Master Chef, do the contestants also get those kinds of lessons/techniques in advance?  Or is that unique to the MC Junior?
"You disappoint me, Ramsay"James May is amazing.
"You disappoint me Ramsay."That would keep me up at night.
Wow. James was either exceedingly drunk already, or he's even manlier than I thought.
And also, it keeps that little bit of, you know, appetite there, and that keenness to perfect what you're cooking.Someone said to me last night "Never trust a skinny chef."And I said "That's bullshit, never trust a fat chef."And she said "Why?"And I said "Because they've eaten all the good bits."Yeah!
Fucking hilarious. Good job, dad.
Isn't it true, though, that the "persona" gets played up for American audiences?  Your Channel 4 programs show you to be the most soft-spoken gentleman.  American audiences, I'm American myself, seem to be incapable of paying attention to anything unless there's some played up drama involved.That's all "reality" TV is ... played up drama, and very little actual education.
We must hear Victoria say bollocks.
I'm super interested in this.> The night before, put 3-4 bananas in the oven on a pilot light.So, just put them in the oven and leave it off?
>porridge, which is oatmealHehe, Gordon Ramsay thinks we're dumb.
> And the River Thames now, in London, is TEEMING with eels That's oddly terrifying to hear
GG Gordon Ramsay promotes other people's upcoming work in his AMA. 
that might be because Bradley did a tv series in 2005 based off of Anthony Bourdains book called Kitchen Confidential 
I have so much respect for how hard you work.
How do you still have hair
I'm sure you can actually cook that !
I've always found Mexican food to be a great cuisine in terms of getting a lot of flavor and nutrition for relatively low cost.
Also, I have to say in a HUUB wet-suit, I look like I've got a fucking 8 pack. Which is unique about a chef in a wet-suit. It's incredible how toned you look. I recommend every chef put on a wetsuit. It makes you look like Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
Well you can now check "getting yelled at by Gordon Ramsay" off your bucket list you lucky bastard
This seals the deal: In n Out has been publicly endorsed as Gordon Ramsays guilty pleasure.  Brb, gonna grab a 3x3 and a shake
You've got a new show idea now, "Stop eating canned spaghetti you disgusting fuck."
I've never seen an AMA where someone put so much effort into their replies.
As somebody who grew up In California, I love you even more for choosing In n Out. 
I can't say I disagree with you! There should be a garbage food anonymous program out there. I swear I can make a marinara from scratch. Promise!Thank you for answering my question after I embarrassed myself. I'm looking forward to the upcoming season of Masterchef!
Even Gordon Ramsay loves In-n-Out... I really need to make a pilgrimage to one of these someday. Sometimes Iowa sucks.
Ha! That seals it, to all those east coasters who think us Californians are overhyping the greatest burger franchise in the U.S.    In n Out For the motherfucking WIN
Aww!  I live in Austin, that makes me happy! 
As a Cambodian, I approve. 
WHAT'S IN IT
Wow, you really do say fragrant and delicious a lot. I love you even more now. 
> Black Liquor Market in Studio CityThought you must have meant some great place in the UK and not the city three minutes away from my house. But you DID mean Studio City in Los Angeles! I'm so excited to go try this place!
Do you think that the restaurant was actually a cover for money laundering? I feel like that's one of the theories that'd make more sense to how they act
I like how I can read this in your voice just perfectly. Tone, accent, pauses and all.
Just goes to show there's no such thing as bad press 
In all your Kitchen Nightmare episodes, midway through it always looked like you were going to throw the towel in. Damn, I guess this one was really bad. 
Summary on IMDB :>A couple finds it hard to listen to Chef Ramsay's advice.
Fuck, I forgot how terrifying she was.
They're essentially living off of their negative press.  They're an internet meme that you can rather easily visit in real life and so they actually benefit from it.
I literally do not think I could eat it without puking several times. Like at least 10 times.
Aha, THAT'S why those eggs are so horribly off-putting.Thank you for identifying what has been disturbing me for ages.  I couldn't put my finger on it.
Thank you for the response! I've actually been using Just Mayo for awhile now, and it's the only "mayo" type product I actually enjoy eating. It's nice to know that you think it tastes great, too :) 
You are literally the zen master of cooking. I love you. 
/u/alfredo_linguini, you've got to do this. This will be the best OP's deliverance *ever.*
> Listen - if you send me your resume, I could look at putting you into one of the restaurants as a work experience, if you want to see something different, in order to make sure you don't come off the rails, to see something different, to create that level of interest.Holy shit, that just happened. 
> Listen - if you send me your resume, I could look at putting you into one of the restaurants as a work experience.HOLY FUCK! YOU FUCKING SERIOUS RIGHT NOW GORDON!?I'll PM you my details, chef. Holy FUCK!
I have it saved up for months and months...wait you ain't Gordon, the fuck?
"Worshter."
In America, we call lice eggs "Nits". Well, the southern part anyway.
You saved me 4 seconds of my day.   Thank you.
If you can give master chef aus a watch. It films more of the actual cooking and less of the drama, but it also shows that they get help with recipe cards and lessons as well. Sometimes when the camera zooms out on the U.S. Show you can see their hidden recipe cards too.
"*its so fucking raw the Wu-Tang Clan asked it to be on their next album*"
Norm McDonald's AMA is littered with comments about Victoria. It's great that she includes them in.
Given his comments about Clarkson a few weeks back, I'd probably lean towards the former.
This is so far my favorite AMA of 2015
Apparently I am. 
I fish a small stretch of the Thames, between Staines and Shepperton. Hundreds of eels. 
Ya it was actually really good, I was hoping for a season 2. 
Explains why he's pissed off.
Reminds me of my life, except the work part.
Damn, I wouldnt be able to survive with only 3 hours of sleep and workinig so hard. I would really probably die because of exhaustion.
Very true.  You should look into Indian as well.  You can get TONS of flavor and nutrition for very low cost.
Gordon Ramsey's famous pot brownies recipe, I can see it now.
This is a good AMA
/r/shitramsaysaysBut really, that's hilarious. 
If you wanted, just act bat shit crazy, own a shitty restaurant, and you too can have your dream of getting yelled at by Gordon.
In N Out is a great example of the philosophy that Gordon preached at a lot of confused, bad restaurants on Kitchen Nightmares: figure out what you do well and focus on it. You don't need 50 menu items to be a good eatery. In some cases, you only need 1. 
It's also Anthony Bourdains favourite fast food joint as well. 
Thank /u/chooter
In-N-Out MASTER RACE!
Gordon has probably visited more food trucks than me. : (
I love the idea that this place is gonna get ready for another night and suddenly get absolutely hammered and have no idea why.
I can't wait for Victoria to transcribe Christopher Walken's AMA.
I remember when I was a bit more interested in the story a few years ago that I found that Sami was banned from France and Germany for drug (maybe human as well) trafficking. I found it on a few sources but if it's true then it really wouldn't surprise me that he started a restaurant to launder money.
It's all /u/chooter. Victoria's a wizard.
Have you not seen this episode? It's nothing short of infuriating, it's literally hard to believe. Glad it's out there, though, it's what got me back into KN. 
That line was so weird to me because that's exactly the kind of thing I'd say as a joke.  "We have three children, they're just trapped in cat bodies." *big smile and acknowledging chuckle* When someone says something in dead seriousness that is something you would readily say in jest, it throws you off.  It would be like someone saying "I don't trust them homosexual types.  I hear they sneak around licking spoons in restaurants to infect people with their gay." and completely meaning it.
That and I'm convinced Samy is laundering money through the restaurant.
Never thought I would hear somebody say Gordon Ramsay is a "zen master" haha
Reminds me of how Gordon hired that talented young chef from the shitty restaurant in Paris, in Kitchen Nightmares. Gordon doesn't want to see talent go to waste, it seems!(Piccolo Teatro episode of Kitchen Nightmares UK. s5e2.)
I'd recommend sending him a DM on Twitter as well, because I don't think he's actually controlling this Reddit account.
"Ohh how was your day honey" "Ehhh was alright, Gordon Ramsay offered me a job.... Idk, I think I'm going to take a month off instead, maybe go to London and try some jellied eel... Idk. How was your day sweetheart"
How gutted would you be if that was Gordon's response.
Strictly speaking, "nits" is the name for the spent egg-casings of headlice in the UK too. In recent years, "nits" has just become a catch-all term for the lice and their eggs.So you're quite right.
Then you ruined it by spending 5 seconds typing up that thank you note
Wow masterchef Australia has less drama? I've never actually seen the US masterchef (it's hard to find here in the UK) but compared to UK masterchef the aussie one is so full of drama! The uk version is literally just bare bones cooking. No drama whatsoever. 
Shimmy shimmy ya
First AMA ive readand who is Victoria?
Heck I think it is up there with one of the best AMAs ever!
Sounds like you need to get your hands on some jelly
and the money, respect, power, etc, etc
Yeah if I go a few days with with less than 6 hours of sleep, RIP my immune system.
INCREDIBLY...   damn, those look impressive for their simplicity.
Maybe if you can't come up with a name,  name the restaurant *ABC*? 
Thank YOU guys.Also, he's very, very nice. 
> This is my first time doing a reddit AMA, and I'm looking forward to answering as many of your questions as time permits this morning (with **assistance from Victoria** from reddit).What tipped you off?
Last year my best friend came out to visit, had her first taste of In-N-Out. She made me promise we could get it again next time she visits. Nothing like converting someone to In-N-Out. 
He said it has tanqueray gin though
a tangible reddit hug of death!
Well... ^thank you. *for* the question... Little girl
Is Victoria single? I've always wanted to date a wizard!
Sometimes jokes come off weird when you have cameras on you.
Just watched the episode and that fits remarkably well. "I am the gangster here"
Shortly after all that, they claimed they were hacked and didn't write any of it.
I PM'd you Vicky, thanks darlin! Holy Fuck! Just the fact that Gordon even responded, and his advice is on point! It's such a relief to hear from an accomplished cook telling me everything will be all right.Thank you once again, Victoria, and Gordon. Thank you.
A subtle point: It doesn't seem like Gordon looks for talent, but grit and hard work. Gordon knows nothing about this guy's ability to cook besides his incredible passion.
Someone we don't even know! I wish he didn't delete his account...I want to hear what happens!
Not a chance /u/chooter forgets to let Gordon know about his response, haha! 
I'm sure /u/chooter will take care of it. 
you missed the part where he doesn't have a girlfriend 
Damn you and your logic
TIL You have the best job in the world
I don't think he's ready for this jelly
dignity, pride, hygiene...
Thanks for your effort, it really enhances AMAs. Do you have a post or video somewhere detailing the process you use and the hands on deck needed to run this process quickly and smoothly so you don't waste your guest's time? It's fascinating to think about!
My cousin came from ireland and tried it. Said he preferred mcdonalds. I havent spoken to him since
Maybe he subs gin for tequila?
"Ah time for a nice relaxed Sunday evening... What the fuuuuuuck where did all these people come from?!"
I'm laughing so much at this. It will be the world's longest AMA, due to all the time spent formatting.
*Squeals* it's her!
I put on my robe and wizard hat...
Yeah, he has a criminal record for drug trafficking and claims to invested over a million in the restaurant. Plus, he doesn't let the servers enter orders on their system so I think he's generating fake receipts.
That's because they were, you slutty bitch.
OP if Everything works out then can we expect your own ama too? ;)
Oh, I'm so glad!
Lots of people have talent. Not enough people have the determination to put it to use. That goes for lots of pursuits, not just cooking.
Please don't let us down /u/chooter!
I've already sent it up the food chain!
There goes another three.
Milwaukee, Wiscahnsin. 
He is from the UK, that would make sense.
Why are they wearing fedoras?
That's me! 
Yes, he's using fake orders, and miscounting tip income to launder money that would be one of the ways you do it, he probably also only takes cash for payments? This shouldn't come as a shock to anyone, unless you've never worked under the table or for a business that could have laundered money. 
Because the food is so bad you'd only feed it to a pet.
Man, if this shit works out we gon do all kinds of shit
Agreed - determined people will obtain talent, and they will always be determined.  Lazy people may be talented, but they'll always be lazy.
All american reality shows are drama and commercials. I've never seen UK or aus master chef but on US there's always someone who's hated, someone who's stubborn, someone who's extremely talented and selfish, and for some reason an old grump guy fighting with a hot spoiled girl. The hot spoiled girl lasts way to long cause hot and spoiled of course.
I'm not hearing a "no".
But what kind of idiot broadcasts his money laundering setup on reality TV?
Fuckin' A tweety, bro. Good on ya.
Not as smoothly as I would like but we're working on it. Apparently the restaurant needs to know who wants to eat what, or something (I would love to have gone with a taco truck)... 
I thought the look of disapproval was like a more fully-realized "absolutely not" along with a Dame Maggie Smith-type facial expression. 
the reason they wanted to be on Kitchen Nightmares was to show the 'haters' on the web (bad reviews on yelp or something) that the restaurant was good. What better way than to make Gordon Ramsay say so on television. When it was obvious he would not do that, I think it stressed her out.Ultimately, I think he did it for his wife, cus she couldn't handle being criticized. Ironic.
Did he just delete just account?
Chutiya please
What is the funniest thing you've ever seen someone dressed as their character say (Like someone in costume saying something that sounds ridiculous cause they said it in character)?
Do you prefer parents playing it straight or interacting with you "in character" so to speak?
What's the strangest thing you saw in the back of house areas?
What is the weirdest request that a visitor ever asked you to do?
You said at one point you worked in merchandise. Would that possibly be in the Magic Kingdom side? There is one older gentleman Bud, who changed my life. He held me while I cried and he cried with me about me recently deceased son. If he is one that you keep in touch with please let him know how thankful I was for him that night. He saved me.  
Are the stereotypes about people who play different characters true?
If Goofy and Pluto are both dogs then how come Pluto has to live in a dog house while Goofy plays golf with Mickey?
Any good stories of playing Goofy around the time "A Goofy Movie" came out?Bonus question: Have you ever met Powerline?
Where do you go in your career from here? 
Could you speak to people while in costume? Can you do a good goofy voice impersonation? 
What's the worst child/adult tantrum you've witnessed?
how do you survive on really hot days?
Why did you quit ?
I know this is going to get buried, but that's me and my sister in the photo you posted playing before the parade. That picture would have been taken in 1996. Will post proof if I can find another image of my 10 year old self.It really is a small world after all. 
Is it true that someone gets fired if two of the same characters appear in the same area of the park?
How did you manage the Goofy chuckles?
Don't know if it was you or not, but my 2 year old son was terrified meeting the characters. He wouldn't get near you guys for a picture but when goofy played peek-a-boo with him from a distance he loved it and talked about it for months. So thanks Goofy! Did you have any other favorite techniques for dealing with reluctant or scared little dudes?
Do you smile in the costume when you're taking photos with other people?
Hi, thanks for the AMA!Has a cast member's head (or glove/shoe/something) ever fallen off while out in the park? How does WDW deal with that if it happens?Also, can you talk about the process to learn to do Goofy's signature? I guess I've never compared them across multiple members but are the signatures standardized and do you have to have your ability to sign as your character tested in any way?
What is your favorite Disney movie?
I don't know if you'll read this, but Disney *lost* an irreplaceable asset when they fired you.  The person that fired you, *hurt* the company.Would you consider going back there?  Surely, someone at Disney could reinstate you.  Considering how this has blown up, I can only imagine someone with that ability has read this and is thinking the same thing I am.I haven't come close to reading all your replies, but 2 of them moved me to tears and I'm not a very big fan of Disney.
Is that dog in the picture a good boy?
What, exactly, is goofy?
When I was young I got lost at Disney world and refused to speak to anyone except goofy since he was my favorite and I didn't consider him a stranger. The whole time he stayed in character He ended up finding my Mom for me and it always was a great memory for me. Probably wasn't you but did you ever have situations like that?
Ever bang someone in the costume?
What are some secrets about Disney World logistics that we may not know?
My daughter was having a tantrum, a character appeared and alleviate d the situation. Is this a coincidence or the patrons being watched that closely?
Have you ever accidentally given the ol' Goofy Hancock when signing for something out of character?
Where's Walt's frozen head?
Howdy! Thanks for the AMA.My question is: How does one move on after termination from Disney? Can you not work at any other Disney related attraction? What do you do now?
How does the signature process go? Are you taught the "correct" signature, or does each Goofy have a different one? Also, how long did it take you to perfect the signature? 
What is the casting process like?
What is Disney Jail like?
Was farting in your goofy suit horrible?
What was the most unintentionally Goofy-klutz moment you've had while working?
What are the coolest aspects of Disney that a visiter will never see or know about?
1) How did you get through when you were having bad days but had to keep up a jovial, lovable character? 2) Did you have to keep your "identity" hidden from family/friends or could you openly tell people you played Goofy?3) Any women/girls try to hit on you while you were in character? 
Goofy! My brother (9 at the time) punched you in the nether regions back in like 2000. We almost had to leave hehAnyway, how often does stuff like that happen? And sorry for my brothers actions!
How was it bringing in the 737 at the airport?  I'm sure a cool experience since not everyone gets to. I work for an airline and think it's quite fun to do on a daily basis. 
How goofy does one have to be to qualify?
What are most of the staff like at Disney World?I know a woman who uprooted her and her husband's entire lives to move to Florida so that they could work at Disney and fulfil their dreams. Do other staff share that kind of grandiose opinion of the place, or are most people just regular folk doing a job?
I got lost at Disney World when I was younger.  My parents tell me that Goofy ended up finding me, tying me to a tree and going to fetch the park security and subsequently my family.  Was that you? If so why wouldn't you just take me with you?  Being tied to a tree is very embarrassing for a kid. :D
Would you rather fight one hundred Donald-sized Philippes or one Philippe-sized Donald's?
I'm leaving for Disney in 48 hours exactly. Any tips or tricks I should know before leaving?
"I just farted" - Cinderella
For the most part I appreciated when parents would stay in character. I hated when people would tell their kids "It's just a guy in a suit, don't be scared", which scares the kids even more. What I didn't like was when they would drill me with trivia questions and make me act out the answers. That used to be fun in the old days but toward the end we had to see as many guests as possible and there was always pressure from management to go faster and faster.
Oh my god I could go on for days about that. One thing that stands out was a special event where they needed 16 Mickeys all set out in various rooms and seeing all of them backstage was really weird. 
A guy once asked me to choke him for a picture (I didn't). That's a hard one because guests routinely do stupid weird things. I think the worst of them is when people bring their newborn infants to the parks and ask us to hold them for a picture. I can't see shit in Goofy let alone other costumes and I'm wearing giant gloves or paws or whatever depending on what character I am. Why would you let me hold your baby? Yeesh!
I worked for Disney in merch at Magic Kingdom, do you remember where in MK he worked? I'm still part of some Facebook groups for Cast Members so I might be able to find him.Either way, if you want him to get recognized, write a letter or email to Guest Relations. It'll help if you know around when you met him and where he worked (so they can find him easier) but it means a lot for a CM to receive a guest letter. We get to take the letter home and get a certificate and it's a really big deal that means a lot to CMs
If you're talking about the "face" performers the answer is yes and no. Some of the break rooms are like the high school cafeteria where the "cool" princesses (elsa and anna) sit on one side and make eyes at the "old" characters (snow and poppins). It's really childish. Other face performers think they're on Broadway and demand respect and they hate not getting it. But those are extreme cases of a few bitches. For the most part the face performers are as much a character as any of us. Some of them are the sweetest people I've ever met in my life.
Goofy is better at golf.
We are NOT ALLOWED TO EVER TALK IN COSTUME IN FRONT OF GUESTS. EVER. Backstage however, anything goes. I used to love telling dirty jokes to unsuspecting new hires. I do have a good Goofy laugh but it took me years to perfect.
I once saw an adult beat the absolute living shit out of a pre-teen boy on set as the Queen of Hearts. We're told never to interact when something like that happens so I had to leave. I've seen tons and tons of guests lose their shit in Guest Relations, particularly when it involved people not getting their way. I wish I had a camera sometimes. I would get so much delicious karma from /r/PublicFreakout
Practice actually. It was absolute torture the first month (and especially the first parade) but after a few months I got used to it and after a few years I would forget I had the costume on.
I was fired. To make a complicated story short, Donald Duck was, as usual, being a jerk and wouldn't leave my area because I had signed "Luv, Goofy" right over the bill of a Donald Duck hat. He threw a temper tantrum and as I was dragging him across the floor to get him back to his position a little kid ran out from behind the curtain at Pete's Silly Sideshow and we knocked her on her butt. The kid was fine and no one complained but Disney didn't really appreciate me dragging the costume on the carpeted floor so they terminated me. 
It would depend on the situation. I've met my double on set by accident a few times over the years (it happens to the best of us) but it was just that, an accident. The only way someone would get fired (I'm only guessing here) is if they did it on purpose.
Almost every time.
...i need to know this. 
They have to attempt to mimic the character's signature to the best of their ability. You sign so much though, it becomes second nature. Wife was sleeping beauty for 3 years. 
Tough call. I'm really partial to the Little Mermaid because of Ursula but I think all in all it has to be Ratatouille. That movie has some of my all time favorite quotes, especially Anton Ego's (sp?) speech at the end of the film. I also loved Dumbo (as racist as it was) but that's because Timothy Q Mouse is probably my favorite character of all.
That's my dog Max (named after Goofy's son). He's a very good boy. :)
He's an anthropomorphic dog. Yes, we get that question a lot.
No, and contrary to popular belief there aren't many furries in the character department. I know there are a few (I knew one of them) but it's not something that's out in the open for sure.
Hmmmm... One is the Automated Vacuum Assisted Collection System in the Magic Kingdom. There's a "tunnel" underneath (it's actually the first floor, the second and third floors are what you see in the park) and the AVACS is a series of tubes that connects all of the restaurants to the main dump that's behind Splash Mountain. The trash is whisked away under the park so the guests don't have to see it or smell it. It's pretty cool.
I frowned once after opening a lanyard I'd bought and found to be frayed. Instantly a cast member appeared. It was creepy.
The patrons are watched that closely. 
Under the castle in a box marked "beware of the leopard".
We used to be able to sign our character's autograph any way we wanted (except Mickey) but then a guy named Chris came up with standard autographs which are consistently used no matter who the performer is, which is way better in my opinion. We have a small summary of the character that has the autograph on it and we try to make it look the same when we sign. Goofy is easy to do but I can write it upside down which would totally freak the guests out. :) That took a while to learn. I can also sign it behind my head and with my eyes closed.
If you mean the audition process, it's like any dance audition you've ever been to but there's an animation part that's fun (wait tables like Donald Duck, mow the lawn like Pluto, etc.)The casting for everyone else depends on what role you're applying for. Some require a math test, some require multiple interviews. It used to be kind of hard to get hired by Disney but now they'll take anyone who doesn't have multiple felonies on their record. They just got too big.
In my case, they measured you, and then you had to do a simple dance routine.  If you made it through, you'd get asked to do a harder dance routine.I fucked up the first dance routine, and still got the role, and about a year later I was cast in parades.
I once misjudged a step and ended up in the mud up to my knees at a park once (it was a special cast member event so I got away with it). I've tripped countless times and was always able to make it part of the act so to speak. I almost cut off a guest's toes once (I was Baloo and she was wearing open sandals) which was disgusting because of the blood. I also fell down the stairs on the castle stage as the Queen of Hearts once. Not my proudest moment.
Not OP but lived in Orlando and can answer the second one. They're technically not ever allowed to say that they ARE the character, they're supposed to tell people theyr'e "friends with" the character. A college friend of mine was "friends with" Belle. But most people who live around here know someone at Disney and so we all know what the code means. 
When my daughter was 4 she made Pluto cry. We were at the Disney Hotel in DL. Pluto ran over to me and my kids. My eldest daughter wasn't ever afraid of the characters but my 4 year old never wanted anything to do with them. (Wouldn't even sit on Santa's lap at Christmas time) Pluto ran over and waved at us but my 4 year old ran away from him. He chased after her a few steps in a way to plead with her but when he wasn't able to win her over he ran over to a bench and laid down and sobbed. My heartless toddler didn't give a shit if she made that dog cry. 
LOL! :-DIt doesn't work that way. Personally, there were about 16 characters I could play, from villains like Queen of Hearts to angels like Gepetto. Most of the cast were awesome but you have bad apples in every barrel.
The former. Donald is a tiny bitch.
Wear comfortable shoes. Book your restaurants in advance. Try not to bring your busy life with you. Enjoy the scenery while you're waiting in the queues. It's a good opportunity to people watch. Don't expect to do half of what you want to do. Prioritize and get the most important stuff out of the way **on the first day**. Don't wait. And know that part of the fun of Disney is discovering things as you go. Ask your fellow guests in line what they think is cool. You'll make some friends and uncover more about the park than I could ever tell you! :) Have fun and say hi to Goofy for me okay?
>That used to be fun in the old days but toward the end we had to see as many guests as possible and there was always pressure from management to go faster and faster.Thats really depressing in an odd way
> they needed 16 Mickeys all set out in various roomsComing from Ireland (and UK too I think?), that sounds like an entirely un-Disney kind of a night.
Holy. What a small world I actually knew this story from some coworkers at the hospital I work at
Sir, you are a scumbag. First you warn me in your opening statement that I will lose my faith in Disney magic and then you tell the most magical Disney story ever.
That is the saddest story I've ever heard. Incredibly touching. :(
I'm crying here. Bless those nurses and you and the other characters and employees that day, trying to help two children in the midst of horrific tragedy. I hope those poor girls are OK now.
Not all heroes wear capes. 
/r/bestof 
> Some of the break rooms are like the high school cafeteria where the "cool" princesses (elsa and anna) sit on one side and make eyes at the "old" characters (snow and poppins). This is the most amusing thing I've read in the whole AMA. Disney princess cliques. I worked in an amusement park where the rollercoaster ride attendants were cooler than the kiddie ride attendants. We all do the same thing for minimum wage guys!Why would you give this gold instead of OP.
> the "cool" princesses (elsa and anna) sit on one side and make eyes at the "old" characters (snow and poppins)If anything, the "old" princesses should be the ones making eyes. They're the superior characters... What makes Elsa and Anna think they're so special?
> one time I had to tell a guest that their son was in jail for stealing from one of the storesSince characters don't speak, I'm imagining Goofy explaining this in pantomime to the upset parent.
> (This post is not for those who wish to preserve the Disney Magic)You're wrong.> I will never forget that hug. It was one of those hugs that last with you. He was crying in my arms. He had given me this which is a pin they give to family members or friends of POWs and MIAs. It's become one of my most prized possessions.That right there is magic, my friend.  
> my life threatened at a Grad Night party one timeThis is reddit, you can't just leave it at that. we need details. 
The Great Goofini was trying to get one of our kids to "fly" with him for a photo a few years back.  The boy wasn't following the plot until Goofy whispered "You.  Fly!" in his ear.He still talks about it with wide-eyed wonder.
> NOT ALLOWED TO EVER TALK IN COSTUME IN FRONT OF GUESTS. EVER.Like, even if someone collapses from a heart attack, and you're right there and are trained in CPR, you can't intervene at all?
So what do you do to get out of awkward situations where children or other guests ask you pointed questions? Like if a kid asked you "goofy whats your fav color?!?!" you're obviously going to point to the nearest colorful object and pretend that's your fav but what if they are like "Goofy where do I go to find X?" or "Goofy, what do you think of Donald Duck?" I guess for the last one you can sort of make an angry face/emotion or w/e lol 
Shit, that had to be traumatic for the kid. Not only he is beaten in public but his childhood hero Goofy sees it and decide to turn around and walk away... He must felt betrayed.  
do the suits get washed regularly?  like daily? i would think they would get pretty rank after a few days in the Florida heat
There is no cooling in the suits?
After 20 years, you were fired over that? Was it a full on fight lol?
Was Donald Duck fired as well? 
OP, blink twice if they are standing behind you.
This actually happened to my 5 year old son. There were 2 Minney Mouses in front him him to choose from.  He took the gun and shot his sister in the leg and then turned the gun on himself.  
That's what Tiggers do best. 
OP delivered ! Our lives are saved !!!
Thank you for preserving the Grocery Store Magic.
Some coworkers and I were talking about Disney as our CEO was taking his family there.  Sometimes you remember things as a kid.  I said "Oh you have to go on the haunted mansion ride.  The floor slowly rises up and scary things pop out of the walls and then the light goes on and one of you is a plant and they pull them out on a stretcher!"Everyone stared at me.  Then it clicked.  When I was a kid, I had watched a man have a heart attack in the haunted mansion ride.
> Wife was sleeping beauty for 3 years.I hope that's not a euphemism 
These are weird ways to say Lilo & Stitch and Atlantis: The Lost Empire.
*Please tell me he knows how to skateboard*
So whenever you're standing next to Pluto do you ever feel anthropomorphicdog dog masterace proud?
I don't think it would up for debate as much as it is if not for the existence of Pluto.
> I know there are a few (I knew one of them)It's you isn't it.
David sounds like a total cockweasel
I wonder how many naughty kids have been thrown in there?
My friend dropped an ice cream cone while in a bathroom stall, and moments later a broom came under the stall door and took it out...
I met you as Goofy around 2001!! I had completely forgotten this memory until I reading this, but I distinctly remember Goofy signing an autograph behind his head! You have completely blown my mind
Damn, Gooby, tell us how you really feel.
> Have fun and say hi to Goofy for me okay?This made me very sad. I am sure you will be successful and find a way to help people in a fulfilling way - but for now, that made me sad. 
That's the kind of park layout that helps you discover elements for your arc reactor.
It was a 'Disney - Eyes Wide Shut' crossover
Har har. The way it looks like now I'll never be done. I don't know how to edit my original comment and I have 20+ pages of comments to get through! 
If you don't mind me asking, what happened to the girls?He says in the story that they didn't know anyone from the girls family or how to contact them because they were foreign. Did they just go into foster care or did they eventually contact someone related to them?
Yeah, what an a hole.  PS.  I'm not crying you're crying.
NOW I'M CRYING AGAIN
The best idea. All the play-doh.
Full grown man, sitting on the toilet at work, with tears rolling down my face. Thank you for sharing.   
I'm a grown ass man, I'm not crying.>Oh my mommy loves roses! I mean...Boom waterworks.    
I'd guess that they get more attention from kids, who may have never seen the older movies but have certainly seen frozen. That may falsely lead to the actresses believing that they're better at what they do, since attention often is the result of talent for entertainment types.
You motherfucker
I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT ENDING! 
OP - "So you were in combat? Well I've seen some shit too."Vet - "Where were you stationed?"OP - "Disney. 20 years..."Vet - "Would you like to talk about it?
Garsh, ma'am, looks like you sure do suck at raising kids
Also the comment about Goofy holding the Make-a-Wish kid.Also the fact that he dragged Donald across the floor to get him to stop being a jerk. If anything I feel like he's building up the Disney Magic.
My job that night was to check receipts at the door of the Emporium to make sure kids weren't stealing shit. One kid was walking out with a hat (he was a BIG kid) and when I grabbed it off his head he pushed me up against the wall and said "Touch me again and I'll fucking gut you". I just smiled and said "Be safe tonight".
That sounds... vaguely threatening.
You have to pantomime 9-1-1
He said he was the Queen of Hearts tho
Yeah man every. single. day. Also was a character performer 
yeah it's called sweating
It's literal.  The cast members play around ALOT in character, and apparently he crossed a line and Disney took a shot to fire him.  OP said there were other factors involved in his firing however.  But I dated someone for a while who was Mickey, and she did stuff like this all the time. 
That's a long and painful story. Disney still has no idea the pain and trauma that caused. There were other reasons I think I was not brought back, one of them being terrible legal advise from a lawyer I sought out before my final arbitration. I was also sort of a whistle-blower and I think that played a big role.
Disney doesn't fuck around. Many people want that job and they demand perfection. If you don't do it, they'll replace you with anyone else lined up. 
A-hyuk, a-hyuk, a-hyuk punk ass duck.
He already got fired lol
Were you the H-E-Buddy?  Its the mascot for a texas grocery chain named H-E-B
*Insert wildly inappropriate Bill Cosby joke here*
Jeez use your spellcheck, it's spelled, "The Emperor's New Groove."
*Please tell me he knows where Roxanne is*
They should team up to try and find the milk of human kindness.
The widely accepted theory are that clothes are what make the difference in intelligence. Pluto just has a collar. Chip and Dale are a good example. They can't talk in any circumstance but in Rescue Rangers, where they wear clothes.
Duh why do you think  he stayed 20 years 
That sounds like a dirty Disney character.
He's that little kid everyone knows, who goes on fields trips and used to complain about how unprofessional the frontier village people were, or how bad at their jobs the civil war re-enacters are.  
OMG.  this made me cry.  
So much of the Stark Expo reminded me of Disney World. John Slattery's Howard Stark reminded me a lot of Disney, actually. 
I CAN'T STOP CRYING IN THIS THREAD
I know I'm crying, you don't need to remind me. Such a touching story. Thanks OP made my day that much better
Thanks for highlighting this, I didn't know it was a 'thing' and I'm a Children's Nurse! (I really should know better!) I'm going to make sure our Hospital gets a wish list pronto if they don't already have one. Also can I make a plea for all the special needs children that can't necessarily play with 'mainstream' toys. Lots of musical instruments, touchy feely, noisy (yep us nurse types, love noisy toys because it gets smiles and laughter :)  balloons and things that make bubbles and gentle light changing toys too.This AMA is up there with the best I've read. 
Alarm fatigue sets in after twenty minutes - they'll be alright.
So I'm not the only one 
i'M WEEPING AT WORK AND i'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ON REDDIT !Just lied to my boss and told her I got choked on candy....Good Guy Goofy. and everyone 
I'm so cynical about Disney I can't stand it, and here I am bawling.  You are a good man, Costumed Goofy.
It would do Anna and Elsa well to remember that everyone was the most popular princess once
I haven't been gotten by a meme like that in a long time.I'm proud of him
It can't be anything that unexpected\*watches video*Oh shit, you're not wrong.
Scared the fuck outta me.
your son is now in jail **GUH-HYUK**
"Be safe tonight young one, you never know what can happen late at night in the park when someone can turn the cameras in the park off"
I went to Grad Night twice. 1997, and 1998. (small school had to let Juniors go one year for numbers)  I can concur that it was absolute anarchy.  Probably not helped by the fact that my group in almost its entirety of about 14 of us dropped acid on the way.  The one thing of note I remember was we were getting high in the Swiss Family Robinson tree house and realized we were only one of about 4 groups of people all doing the same.  The next year when I went again, Swiss Family Robinson tree house was closed off.  When I asked why I was told "We had some issues last year."
Oh fuck. Did they ever figure out who did it?
Every day - on rare ridiculously hot days, I'd personally go through two costumes a day.
OP gave 17 pictures as proof, and now this guy is answering the questions.
Florida humidity laughs at your sweat.  
sweating does not help much if there is no air circulation, though
Tell the truth - she ever get to bring the Mickey mouse costume home?  Were you Goofy, Pluto or Minnie?  
MICKEYLEAKS
whistle blower for what though?
So you were the snowden of the disneyverse? 
This mindset always baffles me from companies.  Seems like hiring someone new is a way bigger risk then keeping someone who made a mess up after 20 years of consistency.
BIRD UP! THE WORST SHOW ON TELEVISION!
Oh thank god yes
Lol what the fuck was he thinking
I don't know whether to quote Strong from Fallout 4 or Lady Macbeth from Macbeth
Nothing like railing Elsa with that damn goofy mask on. Ahuhuhuh-hyuck!
**THE AMOUNT OF MAGIC IN THIS THREAD IS OVERWHELMING**
He's a master clickbaiter.
I used to hear them in my sleep. Now I don't hear a beep. 
Sitting in a class in the military doing the same thing. Mostly because I'm not supposed to be on Reddit, but also because I can't let these other grown ass men see me cry, right?
Be cynical, but please be cynical about the company, not the people. The "boots on the ground" really make that place something special every day.
Almost closed it right before I got got. Kind of glad I didn't.
I can almost guarantee they did, I'm sure they had 5 different cameras capturing the event
I personally go through three in some cases. And I'm just a visitor.
Fart in the suit. 
Nah you can't leave with those costumes because they clean them every day, as a routine. My ex gf was minnie/mickie  
Snowden White
This is getting fucking intense.
It was to show that:1) Can't see shit as to where the titties are, so it was an accident.2) Can't really grope on purpose when you're wearing oven mitts. You just kinda flail around and sometimes grab some boob.I'm not saying as to whether or not that's all true, but that's why he wore it in the courtroom, to demonstrate those points.
I believe he did this to show that Tigger didnt have any awareness of his body due to the costume. 
**Strong disliked that**
A-hyuk, a hyuk, he's about to let it snow! 
Let em see. People confuse manhood, strength, integrity, honor and courage with being stoic.What I'd see is a soldier who I know would drop everything, his heart not diminished, to go help a child.There is honor in empathy. There is glory in love. There is majesty in compassion. 
There is a certain level of respect given to be memed so well and so sneakily.
I can't believe how many people in this thread dated Disney characters
And the 7 drone strikes
Can't hold it back any more. 
>There is honor in empathy. There is glory in love. There is majesty in compassion. I honestly think this is one of the most beautiful things I've ever heard.

Yes. Very soon. It's just my life is crazy sauce, so it's hard to do just fun stuff. Apart from reddit :)
Leon The Professional. 
well... a lot of the good ones have been taken, but I'd like to vie for Miss Marvel. 
I accept that I have NO control over my image already. So, I try not to let the state of my perception have any effect on my happiness. You can never truly know anyone through only media anyway. If anything I just try to keep in mind that I'm an entertainer and not a politician or Miss America.
Buffalo Bill. Him destroying the buffalo population of America also destroyed the Native American culture and coming from Jamestown ND, which boasts having the largest statue of a buffalo in the world, the plight of the buffalo is quite near and dear to my heart.
i always get super stoked when I see it's a Daenarys (the ANTI D.N.B.) chapter, and would get really bummed when I saw it was a Catlyn chapter. But for some reason my heart is always Team Stark. My sigil would be a Mew with Vegeta hair.
No, I've never seen it. But I wish I had now.
TaiChi Panda doesn't have races. I have a night elf hunter on WoW. (Yeah I know everyone starts with that but I also have a blood elf rogue that I'm working on). 
Yes. It's already set in motion. He's going to teach me the art of the full body boner via hemp rope training.
Donnie Baker. Legend. 
holy shit. i laughed way harder than i was prepared for. this dude is going places. 
Having the same conversation over and over reminds me of bar-tending, and I'm thankful for the training I received having to deal with stupid questions from repetitive drunks. I only do it because I know I'll receive tips at the end ;)
Bay Cities Godmother - everything on it.
Only in post.The advice: for any woman trying to break into a male-dominated career, I'd say the greatest thing you can do is always keep in mind that you always have the right to be there.
Well... try to be more self-sufficient and less cabana boy. ;)
I don't know but I'd imagine that Bluetista has a lot of patience. ;)
I don't think of it as "time" or "matches" left - I think of it more as fight time left. So... if I have a few 5 round wars I'm not going to keep fighting nearly as long as if I keep walking out of the cage with unscathed victories. So the faster and more efficient my fights are, the longer I can fight.
When did this happen
Definitely. I loved being in Wrestlemania and will find a way to get back in the squared circle I just have no clue when. And any real wrestling fan would want to be surprised anyway.
She didn't reply! ROUSY COMFIRMED FOR SUMMER SLAM!!
He has yet to see the light. I hope he does some day.
If your last name starts with a "T", you have to go with "Tuff Tiffany T*********" (whatever the last name is).  That, or "Tyrannosaurus Tiff".
1 Mew sized Mewtwo, 'cuz everyone knows that even though Mewtwo has better stats than Mew, 100 Mews totally overcome that.
Ooooooh. Since I've been playing from the beginning I have a certain affinity for the psychic type. But that being said, fairies seem pretty badass these days but I gotta go with the original 151 types and psychic was my fave because Mew is my jam. 
Say, 'fuck them' and do what makes you happy.
Sounds tempting.... but I prefer a man to have the balls to ask me through a medium other than the Internet. Good try though- you sound like a catch. ;)

This is by far the least predictable AMA I've ever seen.
How'd you feel finding out that a city named their football team after him?
The largest statue of a buffalo in the world? do they really boast about that?
Abe Lincoln 
You NEED to watch it. It really is a prime example of a great 90's movie. One of my all time favorites.It also has Ernie Reyes Sr and Jr, and early Rob Schneider which is a nice bonus :D*edit*All these quote replies are making me nostalgic for it, Surf Ninjas movie night it is!

Holy shit, I love you for answering this.
/r/squardcircle is going to implode. 
So at about 30 seconds a match, Ronda will be here for a while folks. 
Yeah, but what's your *sincere* opinion about her...
Recently. Don't forget about Miesha Taint
Not sure if you answered one question or all of them. 
Boy the Reddit beards getting Cardale Jones levels of thirsty in these Pokemon related responses. 
This woman could literally beat your ass in real life and literally beat your ass in pokemon.
Why don't I remember that scene from last of us 
How long did you try moving the truck to get Mew?
fite me irl
Getting called a catch by Ronda Rousey... Scratch that off the bucket list.
AMA request. The people Ronda beat up in a movie theater. 
If this were anyone else this story would go right over to /r/thathappened. I'm so happy someone is actually doing what I fantasize about while making passive aggressive comments under my breath and avoiding eye account.

Shameless self promotion... *I like it.*
You need to burn more calories - like goto the gym twice a day for 2 hours for 6 days a week for the next 10 months - burning over 5k calories a day, then you'll eat.For reference, when my 160lbs brother hiked the appellation trail, he would eat 10 things off the dollar menu as a warm up before he got what he actually wanted to eat - like a double big mac with large coke and large fries. A doctor told him he was burning over 4k calories a day and would need to eat more if he wasn't going to be to weak to continue, so he ate :)
And Rob Schneider....which is nice I guess. I don't know
Dude, she even uses the accented E. 
Something need doing?
So she answers that she has a night elf and a blood elf and you respond with the traditional Orc greeting as opposed to either of the elve's infamous lines?

Brief Question here from someone that is interested. SpaceX's current strategy revolves mostly around old style Rockets, even if they are now approaching complete reusability (Grasshopper rocks). Has SpaceX looked into Hybrid craft like the SABRE program happening in the UK, or look into the possibility of a space elevator (Even at a thought experiment stage) in the way that Google and NASA have done? Thanks for doing this AMA. 
Mr Musk,How will you secure the first stage of the Falcon 9 to the barge when it lands?  Gravity or some mechanism?
In order to use the full MCT design (100 passengers), will BFR be one core or 3 cores?  
Europa: attempt no landing there. True or false?
Previously, you've stated that you estimate a 50% probability of success with the attempted landing on the automated spaceport drone ship tomorrow.  Can you discuss the factors that were considered to make that estimation?In addition, can you talk more about the grid fins that will be flying tomorrow? How do they compare to maneuvering with cold-gas thrusters?
Hi Elon, I currently work for Toyota Tsusho in Fremont doing the wheel assembly for Tesla. I want to let you know how proud I am to be however minutely linked to such a powerful and positively influential company such as yours. Keep doing the good work, sir. You are an inspiration to not only myself but countless others around the world. My question: You seem to have had to deal with a tremendous amount of adversity in a few of your ventures. Do you have any advice for those dealing with seemingly insurmountable adversity? 
Hi Elon, I'm already saving up for my Model 3.  Can you share anything about the Model 3 that we don't already know?
Hi Elon, I'll leave the technical questions to the experts. 1) do you plan on getting any sleep tonight and 2) how will you celebrate if the test is successful? Best of luck! x
You are an early investor in AI startups like DeepMind and Vicarious. What was the most amazing demonstration of an AI capabilities you have seen so far? 
Hello Elon, **HUGE HUGE** fan here!! Question about the Mars Colonial Transporter:There has been a lot of speculation over comments about exactly how much mass you are hoping to send to the Martian surface with the MCT. Can you tell us how much cargo you would like to be able to land on Mars with MCT, not including the mass of the MCT itself?
Emily Shanklin indicated in late 2013 that the Raptor would be the first of a "family of engines" designed for the exploration and colonization of Mars. Could you elaborate on her wording, i.e. was she simply referring to a vacuum version and standard version, or do you plan on building multiple methane-based engines with significantly different thrust and size specifications?
1) What is your favorite airplane?2) What is your favorite video game?3) What is your favorite food?4) If you consume alcohol, what is your favorite alcoholic drink?
tl;dr: What spurred the AI concerns over recent months?As specifically as you can get away with, what spurred you to start sharing your strong concerns about general AI over the last year to 18 months? Prior to that time window you had never made public remarks on the subject and obviously something got you thinking about it. Was it Deepmind's game-playing algorithm?
Hi Elon! The hyperloop was an interesting idea that sort of came out of the blue last year. Do you have any other projects like that just kicking around in your head? Do you plan to follow up on any of them?
Hello Mr. Musk, I sold you a pair of hiking boots at the Sports Authority Elite in Corte Madera. I just wanted to know how your walk through the forest (as you described it) went? Also did you like the boots?
A few simple questions..* What year are you actually from?* How did the process work? Did you volunteer to travel back to help us advance? Was it predetermined by a time-paradox and you were already destined to be sent back in time at your birth? Did you and a group of peers draw straws/lottery?
If you want to get to orbit or beyond, go with pure rockets. It is not like Von Braun and Korolev didn't know about airplanes and they were really smart dudes.
Mostly gravity. The center of gravity is pretty low for the booster, as all the engines and residual propellant is at the bottom.We are going to weld steel shoes over the landing feet as a precautionary measure.
At first, I was thinking we would just scale up Falcon Heavy, but it looks like it probably makes more sense just to have a single monster boost stage.
There should definitely be a science mission to Europa
I pretty much made that up. I have no idea :)The grid fins are super important for landing with precision. The aerodynamic forces are way too strong for the nitrogen thrusters. In particular, achieving pitch trim is hopeless. Our atmosphere is like molasses at Mach 4!
I do kinda feel like my head is full! My context switching penalty is high and my process isolation is not what it used to be.Frankly, though, I think most people can learn a lot more than they think they can. They sell themselves short without trying.One bit of advice: it is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree -- make sure you understand the fundamental principles, ie the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to.
He's not necessarily doing the science math himself.  He's accurately regurgitating the calculations of his engineers and he knows his products.  That's an excellent business man. 
Actually, we could make the 2nd stage of Falcon reusable and still have significant payload on Falcon Heavy, but I think our engineering resources are better spent moving on to the Mars system.MCT will have meaningfully higher specific impulse engines: 380 vs 345 vac Isp. For those unfamiliar, in the rocket world, that is a super gigantic difference for stages of roughly equivalent mass ratio (mass full to mass empty).
The best teacher I ever had was my elementary school principal. Our math teacher quit for some reason and he decided to sub in himself for math and accelerate the syllabus by a year.We had to work like the house was on fire for the first half of the lesson and do extra homework, but then we got to hear stories of when he was a soldier in WWII. If you didn't do the work, you didn't get to hear the stories. Everybody did the work.
It won't look like other cars
Yes, but probably only a few hoursParty at Cocoa Beach! 
Thrust to weight is optimizing for a surprisingly low thrust level, even when accounting for the added mass of plumbing and structure for many engines. Looks like a little over 230 metric tons (~500 klbf) of thrust per engine, but we will have a lot of them :)
Aren't these the spacesuits where one of the specifications was that they must be "badass?"
Quick as always, Echo :P
Goal is 100 metric tons of useful payload to the surface of Mars. This obviously requires a very big spaceship and booster system.
> Have you played Kerbal Space Program?What do you think SpaceX uses for testing software?
Default plan is to have a sea level and vacuum version of Raptor, much like Merlin. Since the booster and spaceship will both have multiple engines, we don't have to have fundamentally different designs. This plan might change.
I really hope he responds to this post
SR-71Hard to pick a favorite. I tend to like FPS with a story, like Bioshock, Fallout or Mass Effect, but was also a big fan of Civ and Warcraft.French and BBQWhiskey
What is your name?What is your quest?What is your favorite color!?
There is no meaningful limit. We would have to replace a few parts that experience thermal stress after 40 cycles, but the rest of the engine would be fine.
Good school
He has said that some of the automotive regulations, like the requirement that every car have side mirrors and that they all display certain information in very specific places are cumbersome and unnecessary. Side mirrors, for example, could be replaced by cameras that would have no blind spots, have less risk of getting broken or fogging up, and would increase highway fuel economy by 5%.
Yes, he has talked about electric, supersonic, vertical take off and landing jets. He thinks that once batteries reach an energy density of 400 wh/kg, it will be feasible to have a range of 2000-3000 miles.He's also talked about making pre-fabricated freeway sections to speed up construction on the 405. (he has to sit through the traffic there almost every day).
Yeah, they were great
He actually invented time travel in the future, and realized by looking at ancient records of "The Great Modernizer" of the 21st century that this figure was, actually, himself. He knew from that point on that he had to return to push humanity forward.This would be make a great writing prompt. 
I'm a software engineer from Detroit.  I'm currently working in Silicon Valley but moving back to Detroit next month.  I would leave my job in a heartbeat if Tesla opened up a location in Southeastern Michigan!
Pretty sure you can count yourself in that list of "smart dudes" now.
Do you consider that the Space Shuttle program delayed the development of reusable rockets?
Nice to see you are doing things the Kerbal way.
> monster boost stage.This is how I play Kerbal Space Program.
Bro haven't you seen the movie? Awful idea. Octopus monsters.
So it was spoken, and so it shall be done.
No one wants to smell his natural Musk.
Please start posting to /r/showerthoughts. That would be glorious.
I'm kind of giddy and star struck, but I'm more completely at a loss that the guy that owns Tesla, the guy that owns a company that is putting a rocket into space tomorrow, just sent me a video of a cat riding a roomba chasing a duck.  What just happened?  I was having the worst day, and now everything seems alright.  Heck yeah!
So with all this talk about SpaceX... Have you ever played Kerbal Space Program?
You're officially my hero, can I buy some SpaceX stock now?
Can you help me with Kerbal Space Program?
> Our atmosphere is like molassesThen get a spoon Elon.
I wish more teachers took into consideration this method of teaching. Far too many I know just inundate their kids with information instead of building fundamentals.
So, he is daneel olivaw?
What kind of mass ratio do your upper stages have?
Thanks for answering! I teach high school astronomy in Orlando, and we always watch your rocket launches and talk about SpaceX. We're big fans. I'll get to work on my storytelling skills. 
Alright, I'll keep that in mind the next time I have an opportunity to be a soldier in WWI.
Uh oh, I hope you don't mean that it'll look dorky like a BMW i3 or a Toyota Mirai. It won't look dorky... Right?
aha no steering wheel!
Elon got the club going up on a Tuesday
Follow-up question: How much do you sleep per night, on average? 
Well it's definitely reassuring to know that he sleeps, just like rest of us.
Oh my goodness, I am so starstruck. You responded!! Thanks for the information, and thank you so much for responding!! You made my year!!By the way, might 27 be the number of engines you're talking about? ;)
>We are putting a lot of effort into design esthetics, not just utilityim glad we have top men ensuring the future is sexy
Way to go, /r/spacex. Thanks Elon.
> The Mars transport system will be a completely new architecture. **Am hoping to present that towards the end of this year.** Good thing we didn't do it sooner, as we have learned a huge amount from Falcon and Dragon.Wow... I think my brain might be leaking out of my ears right now.
You can curse on the Internet, Elon.
Really glad you're focusing on looks for #3. There are a lot of companies doing cool stuff from a technical standpoint, but many miss the point that spending time on presentation is really important for a business to stand out. 
/r/SpaceX denizens, do your math now please!
Kerbal Space Program!
Yeah I'd love to play ASP but it's just way to expensive to get into plus the lack of time warp makes it really time consuming to play.
Awesome, thanks so much for responding!
How do you find time to play video games?
Elon, are you trying to find Prothean ruins by chance?
Hell yeah Fallout.
Is a cycle a firing?
Awesome! Glad you enjoyed them!
He hikes! *swoon*
Yeah, if Elon succeeds with the whole cheaply and rapidly reusable thing, his name is going up there next to von Braun and Goddard.
Fair question: Does Musk design rockets or does he pay people to design them? There's a significant difference to compare him to Von Braun.
Kerbal is awesome!
Bill Cosby's nutsack called Elon Musk "bro".And with that, a very good night to all.
So say we all.
*I think I've solved all of the worlds energy problems*
I always roll my eyes at the guy in an AMA thread who freaks out when a self-interested famous person responds to them like they said they would. This though? This is way different. Put that shit on your tombstone buddy! 
He doesn't "play" it... he has his own.
I'm always happy to help with KSP.
I've always wanted to play but I'm constantly terrified by the fact that I more than probably suck at building rockets and will only get frustrated.Also, I'd probably cause the deaths of hundreds of Kerbals...
> I teach high school astronomy in OrlandoAstronomy classes in high school? What sort of amazing school is that? In my country this is unheard of.
start world war III.  profit.
He had me at It
This is the same guy who is making sure his space suits look sexy.  I doubt his new car will be a dorkmobile.  
Got your falcon on the ship and she choosay
I actually measured this with my phone! Almost exactly 6 hours on average. 
Or so he would like us to believe...
But do you think he poops or pees?
Play it cool man, play it cool.
What will aliens think of us if we aren't fashionable?!
This is a real AMA... Fuck OkCupid.
Poppycock!
Next year he's offering $10,000,000 to figure out how to curse on the Internet.Nobody tell him.
We're getting enough new numbers here for a dozen new discussion posts full of math :)
I am not surprised by this.
I imagine you give your engineers KSP .craft files and tell them to Make It So
The learning curve is something like 25 years.
He's probably hiding time travel from us.
He plays video games all day and then does all the urgent work in the last hour.
this is a valid question
He didn't even use a period, he must have hated those hiking boots. 
That easy huh?
Ya, revolutionizing online payment options and singlehandedly taking on the American automobile industry are more like hobbies anyways.
He designs the people that design the rockets.
In the off chance u/elonmuskofficial reads this, Elon, we think you're awesome, too. <3 All of us at Squad.
HE PLAYS KERBAL EVERYONE!!!
This answer will sure make a lot of people over at Squad very happy :)
And you're one of few people who gets to play it with real rockets! 
Any chance of an official SpaceX mod for Kerbal Space Program?
Used to develop KSP, feels awesome to see it all over the real space industry now.
Jeb is proudTHE REAL QUESTION: Have you done an Eve return? :P
Taint nothing
then sideways fast (for an orbit)
Here Lies /u/usa_dublin.  Elon Musk answered his question once.
He played it once and thought:"Yeah, this is *okay.*"
Now there's a tough choice: Elon Musk or Scott Manley for KSP lessons.
Join the club, I suck at it but I have a drink blow some shit up and try my damnedest to get somewhere :)
To which they will reply with a how-to guide on returning from orbit by Scott Manley.
Nah, we're into a new century now. Got to start again at 1
he had me at I
it better play La Cucaracha too!
Those two laughing about the BMW design sounds like something from South Park.
Phew. Ok good. I can't wait to see it!!
That's unsettling.  There's coincidences and then there's just weird.
###SO IT IS WRITTEN
Rocket goin, up
Hey, I hope you know that it is medically recommended that you get 7-8 hours of sleep **minimum**. If you don't, you won't become an^extremely^successful^billionaire
TIL Even Elon Musk uses Sleep as Android
Nope. And he does not have a butthole; he has no need for one.
but he *CAN* talk to dolphins, right?
Balderdash!
*rubs greasy math hands together*e: *rubs greasy hey-if-anyone-has-some-good-speculation-as-to-MCT-mass-ratios-they-should-tell-me-but-otherwise-I'll-just-guess math hands together*
that's about 2.5 times the weight of a Saturn V, isn't it?
Plot twist, rage quit.Decided to launch a real rocket instead.
Only so much he can reveal every year... :|
So has he already played HL3?
Sadly SpaceX predates Mass Effect. 
They were the only good hiking boots we had in his size, so he really didn't have much choice.
I mean they are a big deal, but hardly related to rocket science.  So it would be pretty unlikely to put your name next to two famous rocket scientist 
Elon Kerman added to crew name pool.Cheers :)
No You're Awesome too
He also plays Human Space Program.^(I hope the next update is good.)
He literally plays Kerbal IRL.
I am freaking out so hard right now.
Yup, SpaceX's FB page just posted that they're doing the weekly challenge and that tomorrow's F9 launch will start upside down
KSP CM here. So far, an official one is not in the cards, but if we had the opportunity to work with SpaceX on one, we'd do it in a heartbeat.
The mod I'm wanting most for KSP is stowable, functioning grid fins so I can try the landing.
Can confirm, am proud.
That would require more delta-V than necessary! 
Orbiting is just aiming for the earth and missing.
Why not both? A joint session
HULLLOOO!!!
This century is all about the reboots.
He had me at /u/ElonMuskOfficial
I found myself laughing with them
Come on dude it's Elon Musk,  the hell is he going to make something dorky for.  Also Breckenridge Bourbon get on it!
I had to go check if he was born Elon. Apparently he was. The plot thickens...
Elon Aladeen Elon! Elondeen! 
On a Tuesday. Fire stage one then jettison that caboose-ay.
He works so hard, he burns off energy from the inside.
The guy from Match.com and OKCupid did an AMA earlier today (I think?) and he blatantly ignored any difficult/good questions and only answered softballs. Maybe not Woody Harrelson-level, but it was bad.
*"Fuck this bullshit game! I'm rich, I'll build a real motherfucking rocket and show those little green assholes! I'm going the fuck to MARS!"*We later discover that Tesla exists because Mr. Musk got his ass kicked at *Gran Turismo* a few years back.
Fuckin struts, how do they work...
nothing predates Protheans
your boss just read your first comment and was ready to promote you, and then read this and slammed his fist on the table.
He'll combine them... rocket surgery!
Can I be awesome too?
Pretty much.

/u/DrewCEarthJustice I would like to know what your organizations policy on nuclear power is?
Aren't there already pipes in the area where the Dakota pipeline is being proposed?If so. Why is THIS pipeline so different/Bad?
Are you still litigating over Dakota Access? If you are, is that a prudent use of charitable assets given that the odds of prevailing are between slim and none?
Do you think anything would happen with this lawsuit, or will it just get added to his already massive pile of lawsuits?
Who pays you?
Where did you do your environmental law degree? 
What have you done for Flint?
Trump's EPA director is at odds with most environmentalist causes. He bases his official actions on economic rationale. Can't this be construed as dereliction of duty? 
What is your/organization's position on Nuclear power?
why argue against the dakota access pipeline when the oil is going to get there regardless. It's a lot safer by pipeline then by truck or train I would assume?
What is your stance on Nuclear Power? Do you feel like using Nuclear Power would help the environment or is the catastrophic risk, regardless of the probability, not worth the net gain in clean energy, even if it means less dependence on fossil fuels? Would lowering regulations against nuclear power, reducing operating costs for affordability and cost-efficiency, lessen the environmental impact of fossil fuels due to less dependency since Nuclear Energy is essentially better than fossil fuels as a source of energy?
I'm graduating law school on Friday. My career plan is to pursue public interest environmental law, with a particular focus on climate change. I just wanted to say that lawyers like you, and those who I have worked for, you are all heroes. As for a question: what skill or resource do you think environmental lawyers underutilize throughout their careers? 
Who pays for all these billable hours? 
Won't Trump just do whatever the fuck he wants while saying, "fuck you" no matter what evidence you find?
How/when did you first start to take on the president? 
How do you feel about the mess the Dakota access pipeline "supporters" left in my state? They caused an environmental disaster in my state. Any comments?
Is it me or does this thread seems be bombarded with Trolls and Astroturfing?
Thank you for your important work, Drew! Would you have any advice to someone looking to start in the environmental policy field? Working on an MPA in Environmental Policy now, would love to make an impact.
Why is /r/politics and various other anti-trump hate spaces allowed to use bots, brigades and otherwise manipulate reddit? 
Why didn't you take Obama to court for his part in the pipeline?
Do you enjoy wasting other people's money to merely signal your virtue?
When you lose against him what will you do?
What do you think about the fact that the protesters of the Dakota access pipeline did more damage to the environment with their garbage and human waste then the actual pipeline itself would do? How about the fact that there's more polar bears then ever? How about the fact that there was more recorded sea ice in Antarctica last year then any other year on record? How about that every doomsday scenario said by environmental scientists has been a lie? Look at inconvenient truth, that movie has just become inconvenient to the environmentalists narrative seeing it's full of so much BS!
Are you afraid of repercussions by the current administration? 
Have you considered how to make environmental lawyers have a broader appeal? Mainly among rural constituents you claim to represent? 
How can de-regulation be balanced with environmental protections'?
Is there a legal justification for preventing Trump from revoking National Monument status? I thought it was within his powers as president. 
This won't get answered
It is extremely frustrating that fossil types and solarwind hipsters both agree that nuclear is bad. I mean it's literally the cleanest most efficient way to produce power and these idiots are keeping the world a century behind because they are fucking idiots. 
Probably against it. Types like these only think wind and solar is the way to go. Probably hydroelectric too, but they might have problems with that as well. Lots of people misunderstand nuclear power
Thank you for asking the questions I wanted to, but in a much smarter way. Of course, there's no way he will touch this question with a ten foot pole. 
How have I never heard this perspective before, yet now it is the top comment in the Reddit thread?
Fucking crickets to this brilliant line of questioning.I love environmental lawyers.
I'm a layman and not even American so my knowledge of this is weak at best, but my guess is that there will likely be more to gained from the potential attention to the issues lawsuits like this might bring rather than the results of the judgment.
Good damn question
Also are you well versed in bird law?
I went to Yale Law School.
Good question.
They are never answering this question, this guy wants media attention and donations.
This person didn't do their homework and now looks dumb as fuck 
Quite a few yes. Many of which are just insulting the OP. Pro-Trump people seem to be upset because they can't defend the fact that he is actively harming the environment with his actions and orders.
Probably come to reddit and cry about it for upvotes and support 
Yeah like wtf? OP had one of the best non-answers I've seen. He *is* a lawyer. 
Seriously, I'm Dutch so in no way bothered by what that clown does, but I wish you the best of luck and I sincerely hope that somehow you'll shit all over him.
Can you explain exactly what he did that was illegal?
What exactly was illegal about his actions? If Obama had the authority to make those areas unavailable to drilling, doesn't the next President have the authority to reverse that decision?I looked on your website for info about why it's illegal, but all that seems to say is "artic drilling is bad, mmkay".
Also not the dude, but one more general point to consider is the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the government are specifically set up to check each other. The legislative branch can override the president with enough support in congress, and the judicial branch can override him by interpreting the laws written by the legislative branch. How they override him is up to them, but they certainly have the power to do it (given his actions are not lawful or he does not have the power to do).
> I would like to know what your organizations policy on nuclear power is? Probably because their law firm doesn't have any type of official "policy on nuclear power." Silly question.
From the standpoint of physics, that wouldn't work. Fusion power needs to convert light nuclei into heavier nuclei, and fission products are already heavier than iron (which is the binding energy minimum).
Types like what, exactly?I, for one, don't think anything ill of nuclear energy, mainly because I have a basic understanding of how and why it works (keyword: basic. source: brother is a nuclear engineer).  I also completely agree with basically everything that OP is fighting for that I have read in this thread.  So, I'm kinda confused why you'd think that "types like these" would be against clean energy that has some manageable side affects when combating completely unclean sources like coal and oil.
Pipelines are safer than shipping it by train correct? 
Sooooooo your opinion is your reason why it's bad. Got it. 
May I ask why the DAPL was chosen as something to pursue rather than the Trans-Pecos pipeline? It seems awkward that the TP line gets very little attention comparatively knowing all the similarities. Especially considering the ease at which a border wall can be constructed once the infrastructure gets laid down from the Alpine shale development. 
Assuming that drilling in North Dakota continues, wouldn't the completion and use of the Dakota access pipeline over traditional oil transportation methods actually help reduce the amount of air pollution and environmental damage?
I don't intend this to be a frivolous question, but if an action (say, dismantling the Clean Air Plan) has a negative impact on everyone who breathes, doesn't everyone with lungs have standing?  Can a lawsuit be mounted on behalf of human life?
It pisses me off that the OP can not respond to any valid questions or arguments against his beliefs, this is supposed to be /r/iAMA where you ask anything.
It won't be tops for long.Had the tribe gotten $20,000,000, the DAPL issue would be a moot point.
One of the reasons is that drilling in the arctic would 'add insult to injury'? Is that a scientific argument?
I wholeheartedly agree and we should probably be advertising your victories more. I think a lot of Americans feel like it's pretty futile to fight to Goliaths. We see the way Trump is pushing forward, say, in installing industry CEOs in the EPA, and it seems like we're passing a point that I thought the system would inherently resist. From your view does it truly seem optimistic? Do you think the process of law will ultimately win out for what the sane among us want?
What law related to this is Trump not following?I hate him and what he's doing as much as you, but I'm curious what claims your lawsuits make. I didn't think you could win a lawsuit against the president for doing their job badly.
Aaaah... *foundations*.
So the answer is anonymous donors and american taxpayers?
Were the Obama actions laws passed by Congress, or just executive orders? If just executive orders, why would they be exempt from revocation? Or are Trump's EOs also exempt from future review?
The actions taken by Obama were executive actions. Which was stupid of him to do because now look how easy it is to overturn. It's perfectly legal for a president to create or overturn executive orders. If Obama and lobbyists wanted permanent change you should have passed a law through Congress. 
This seems like a double standard, Obama's actions for these were also executive orders - what makes them better than Trump's, is it simply because you agree with them and don't with Trump's?
And one that they seem very reluctant to answer for some reason.  Probably because it's outside the scope of their current litigation efforts, but still.
Thank you for remaining a non partisan advocate for us and the environment.
I'm neutral on Trump. But OP mentioned a lot of Trump voters' are in favor of protection of the environment it seems the minority of the Trump voters are loud and vocal here and/or lobbying firms have paid astroturfers down voting and trolling much like the left has on r/politics and r/politcaldiscussion.
He's very good.
You remember the Jill Stein scam?
No... he can't. 
Works for a law firm that represents the interests of the renewable industry most likely so it's not going to get answered.  Renewable lobbying is just as much against a Nuclear solution as big oil
Also where are these fusion reactions occurring? If you know how to safely and efficiently contain a fusion reaction please tell us.
No idea about OP, but there are organizations like Greenpeace, who are - somewhat paradoxically - against the energy source that would perfectly fit to their goal of preserving the environment.
Of course they are safer then by train.  These trains currently flood the midwest along the pipeline route.  The tracks and bridges they are on are some of the oldest in my state and the risk of spill is very high.   Also... the trains use more energy (diesel) to haul the oil then pipelines use electricity (wind power etc) to pump.   If you look at the train routes many cross the same river the pipeline does.   At least have some common sense in deciding what to sue trump on.
Pipelines are safer than trains... but isn't clean energy safer than pipelines?  
Because people who don't care about environmental causes have heard about the DAPL but not Trans-Pecos. This is about gaining media attention, not using donor dollars effectively and intelligently. 
And for leaving a human body amongst the garbage.
The nature of an environmental dispute can affect the number of people who have standing to sue.  For example, a mining proposal that would harm a place that only a few dedicated hikers visit might have a relatively small number of people with standing to sue over it.  On the other hand, a wide-ranging proposal to weaken protections for clean air might have a large community of air-breathers with standing to sue. 
That's exactly right.  The elders in Fort Yates simply wanted more money.  The oil flows over the river in trains already so the water issue is moot.
I laughed out loud at it too. 
What are you implying?
They are executive orders which make it perfectly legal for Trump to change
Funny that /u/FS4JQ is not the one giving thanks for this non-partisan approach.   Well, they've just been a redditor for 14 days, so maybe they're just not used to things yet.  Yeah, I'm sure that's it.
I don't really think there are that many actual shills around on either side of the spectrum lately. There were likely a lot back during the election and primaries, but not at this point. It's just strong supporters by now. And, yes, a lot of Trump supporters support the environment, they support climate change, they support social topics. In short, everything that Trump and his cabinet aren't. It's quite perplexing.
This is the answer that I came here to find, thank you.
Doesn't the power of executive order give the president the power to repeal executive orders? It's not like he's trying to repeal the law with one. I get that this is going to be your legal argument in court, but is there any precedence for it?
Now you have even said yourself, Trump isn't reversing. Trump has merely pushed an executive order to halt the previous order from finishing. That's not reversing, it's simply putting something on hold. How is that illegal?
Jill stein scam? 
Of course he can.  How d'you think the legal system works?  If he doesn't have some reason to believe this was illegal then there would be no basis for going to court.
its almost like the "good" guys just want to kick out the "bad" guys so they can become the new "hey guys were youre friends guys were not going to do anything bad at all we promise" guys
Devils advocate: dripping trucks don't cause as much localised devastation than a burst pipe over a river would, right?
The automated system isn't full proof though. There was a story a couple months ago that reported a leak near the potential build site of the Dakota pipeline that was not found until 150,000+ gallons of oil leaked out. And it was only found because the landowner discovered the spill and reported it.
Isn't that the definition of using donor dollars effectively and intelligently though, since media exposure is usually what it takes to get things done?
When I die, just throw me in the trash.
Their lawsuits aren't based on the idea that it's illegal for Trump to overturn Obama's EO's, it's that the policies he's implementing show an illegal disregard for the President's sworn duty to protect America, including its natural resources, for future generations.
Personal opinion, at least for guys like me. There are more pros than cons. I'll fight Trump on certain issues with environment and such because I'm not spending all my time trying to fight for my gun rights or whatever. Come for my guns and artic drilling well take a back seat. Just an example
> I've probabky made some too.I've never made any.
I don't understand how his advisers cannot sit down and tell him how and why he will get sued, or he just doesn't care?
I think he's saying that Obama's protection of those certain areas was not done via executive order. It was done via powers granted by OCSLA, a law passed by congress. While the OSCLA gives the president power to protect, it doesn't give him power to "unprotect". So, because what Obama did wasn't an executive order, Trump can't legally repeal it by executive order alone.  
Lawsuits are in civil court.  You can sue people for all sorts of things that aren't technically illegal.
Can't wait to fight the renewable lobby in the name of thorium or fusion!
When it rains where do you think that oil goes? Right back into the water systems.
A lot of the time in scenarios like that (automated system failure) it comes back to human involvement. Whether bypassing alarms (happens more than you'd think), installation failure or poor maintenance causing equipment failure. 
Please don't apply logic when they just want to shit on people for acting on things they believe in. /s
yes it is. And it's a moral responsibility to fight as it infringes on basic human rights.
By this logic, Obama should have been sued in 2015 for not implementing the executive orders quicker.It really just comes down to "he's doing something we don't like but we'll frame it as a legal issue".
In the words of obama ,"so sue me".
Because this isn't clear as night and day. The OCSLA doesn't vest the power of reversing a withdrawal onto Congress or the President. It is actually unclear on that. This organization's argument would be that the power should be vested with congress. I wish he had been more clear than he was, it was actually kind of misleading and made it seem like they had the case in the bag. Which they don't
basically already had that fight what 30 years ago now the plebians whine about nuclear at every turn. why people who dont know what theyre talking about have any influence or say ill never know
And this is why people don't want it next to their water supply
Or, "I'll see you in court."
How stable is the planet configuration of the system? Has it reached a stability over long timescales like our solar system has, or is it a relatively young system were we would expect the bodies to still coalesce into larger objects over time?
Does TRAPPIST-1 itself pose any hazards to the planets like radiation or flares?
My question is simple... What's next? I mean I'm sure all the excitement of discovering and announcing this find is still fresh but what are the next steps involved in finding out more about this discovery? What information do you think is "discoverable" about this system in the near future?
What is the protocol if you do find any signs of life on any of the exoplanets?
Great presentation everyone!  When/how will you be able to determine if there are signs of an oxygen rich atmosphere?There was a lot of speculation before the conference that you may have already detected that.
Hey guys! Love this discovery, I got chills when I saw the headline.My question is regarding the orbits of these planets. How exactly do yall think the planets' gravity is affecting the other planets?If the innermost planets are tidally locked, would they get slightly disrupted by passing other planets?Are their orbits not entirely elliptic? Could they be slightly "wavy" due to other planets' gravitational pulls?Thanks for doing this AMA! I hope my question doesn't get lost in the masses :)
What are the most promising ways to search a planet that far away for life, assuming it is not intelligent enough to broadcast signals outward?
Hello, and congratulations and thank you for this discovery! You people are doing amazing work. I have 2 questions for you.1. Do we know what kind of a gravity compared to Earth or Mars appears on those 3 planets that could have water in them? 2. Can we expect to have the technology in the next 20-30 years that we could for see for sure that there would be life in those planets in form of vegetation? 
So if we were to imagine earth as the planet closest to this star, how many of the other 6 planets would we have visited with satellites, rovers, manned  orbits, manned landing, etc.? I am trying to imagine how close they all are together in a way that is fun. 
What are the primary impacts of being an earth sized world so close to a smaller, dimmer star?   From the perspective of a human on the surface of such a world, I mean.I read that all are tidally locked to the star - does that mean they'd only have habitability bands around the perimeter/twilight region?
Do we know the age of the system and planets?
What would be the temperatures on each of these planets and the most likely chemical compositions? Are they likely to have a magnetic field?
Would the relatively close nature of the planets have any sort of dramatic effect on surface tidal forces or would this somehow be offset by the star?My thoughts being that our Moon has a pretty noticeable effect on Earth, and if those planets are that close to each other I would have thought all sorts of weird weather nonsense would happen.
Any chance we could name these planets after the 7 dwarves? 
What information will you guys receive from these planets if the James Webb telescope is ready and functional? 
How is the habitable zone estimated for tidally locked planets? How does knowledge of this system affect theories of planetary formation? 
Detecting exoplanets by their transit of their sun presumes that our angle of observation of their sun crosses the path of the planet's orbit. Isn't that really unlikely? Or, are all planets orbiting on parallel planes?
How long have NASA known about the discovery?
Hi, and congrats on the amazing discovery! Although I'm aware we can't see the Trappist-1 star, where in the night sky would it be if we could see it?
Which one of the new discoveries is the one your team is most excited about?
In the presentation, one of the someone said that Spitzer was not originally designed to look for exoplanets and that it had to be re-engineered to do so. Assuming that the telescope stayed in space, how was this done? 
When the JWST is launched, how will it be used to analyze this system? What will it be looking for, and what will it be able to tell us about these planets?
Why does the lettering start at 'b'? What happened to planet 'a'? Thanks!
How can you know that existing life are in need of liquid water? We don't know anything about extraterrestrial life, do we? Just because we breathe oxygen and are dependent on water, does that mean that all other potential life have the same criteria?
Congrats on the find, and great work. Now the real question here, are you guys fans of stargate sg1? I sure got an itch to restart the series.
When should we expect the data/results around atmospheric composition to be released or published?
Can Hubble take a picture of these planets?
If these habitable zone planets are so close to each other doesnt that make them very hot due to gravitational interaction? What do we know about their temperatures now? 
How soon are we likely to have information on the composition of the atmospheres and who will be making these observations?
What does this mean for our understanding of the universe? What does it mean for us as human, in terms of how this could potentially benefit us? I am one of those who believe that even if they seem far from ordinary people, these discoveries tend to and usually will improve our lives.What is it like to make such a discovery and know you were an important part of it?I am so glad you are trying to share your time with us who are not experts. We support you!
Hello. Currently, Kepler spacecraft is observing TRAPPIST-1 system. How well can Kepler spacecraft detect planets around TRAPPIST-1 compared to Spitzer spacecraft? Are further discoveries expected?Also, is TRAPPIST-1h the first "cold Earth" to be a candidate for further observations?
Are any planets besides Earth in the Goldilocks zone in our solar system?
Good work team!Can I ask the daft question that nobody else dares ask!On that first day in the office as you take the bubble wrap off your nice new telescope - how you decide which part of the night sky you look at first? Do you focus your work on known stars that previous work has indicated might have a chance of exoplanets, do you focus on exploring specific clusters or is it it any more random than that?
Any ideas what the lifespan of the system's star is? Even if our technology were to advance, it would suck to arrive there only to have the sun go out.
Would you rather fight 100 earth sized planets, or one planet sized earth?
How does the telescope work? What do you actually see? Is it just a series of numbers on a screen which you interpret into a tangible image?
Has SETI been listening to this system? I would be really excited if we could hear anything from this system. 
Okay, this isn't specific to this discovery (sorry), but how does the telescope know which direction the exoplanets are orbiting the parent star? Aren't we just detecting a dip in light? how does that imply a direction? (I ask this after using the in browser: TRAPPIST-1 system in 3D)
The stability of the system is still unclear, because it is a complex dynamical system, the planets' masses are not yet precisely determined, we don't know yet the orbital period of the 7th planet, and there could be more planets. More on this soon!
TRAPPIST-1 shows one flare (eruption) every week and a strong one every 6 months. Its X ray activity is not yet very well known and could be also a thread for any life there. But if the planets have an atmosphere and magnetic field this could limit the level of high energy flux. This is still work under investigation to estimate those levels.
to bounce off this: will SETI start listening to this system, now? 
We do not yet have a protocol. Most likely we will make a tentative discovery, that will take longer to confirm. SS
It's going to be awhile before we find an oxygen rich atmosphere. JWST launch in fall 2018, so we will have to wait to try until sometime after that. It turns out some oxygen-rich atmospheres might exist that are not created by life, so to associate oxygen will require care. I hope we will be able to find, identify, and announce in a few years! --SS
We will look at the atmosphere for gases that do not belong--gases that might be attributed to life. We will not know if the gases are produced by microbial life or by intelligent alien species. --SS
The next generation of space telescopes, after WFIRST and JWST, to be launched in the 2030's. would be capable of actually getting a spectrum of the Earth, separate from the sun, using an instrument called a coronagraph or a star shade.  The current telescopes could measure the size of the Earth as it transits in front of the sun.  However, that only happens only once per year, so you have to know when to look, or look for a long time.  The latter strategy was adopted by the original Kepler Mission.  Michael Werner
I just want to say this is one of the best questions I've read on here today. Good job!
Answer to first question: Determining the surface gravity requires knowledge of both the radius and mass.  The uncertainties on the mass measurements are large, but our best guess is that the surface gravity of most of these planets is similar to that on Earth.  One exception is planet f.  It has the same radius as Earth but 68% the mass.  That means the surface gravity will be 68% that of Earth. - Natalie Batalha 
1. Compared to Earth, and based on our preliminary planet radii and mass estimates, the planets' gravity for e, f, and g would be around 0.7g, 0.6g and 1.1g. Farisa Morales2. The next step is to analyze the composition of the atmospheres (if any), which will provide information on the conditions and processes taking place there (past and present). Farisa Morales
All of them.  They are very, very close together  All are much closer to one another and to their host star than the Mars-Earth distance, for example.Michael Werner
Tidal-locking: we think as long as there is an atmosphere (even a thin atmosphere like that on Mars) heat will circulate around the planet. So habitability location should extend beyond the limbs.
Being close to the faint star puts the planet(s) in the habitable zone, but Red dwarf stars can be very active with coronal mass ejections for example, in addition to high doses of x-ray and UV radiation.  However, a healthy atmosphere and magnetic field around the planet can help protect any life evolving on it.  Farisa Morales
not precisely because such little stars evolve very veryvery slowly ! they live for hundreds of billions years compare to 10 billions for our own Sun... we can say that it is older than 500 million years, but it could be several billions years and even older than our own system (4,7 Gyear)
No, we just know that it is probably older than 500 million years.
Surface temperatures depend on the proximity to the central star but also on the composition and thickness of the planet's atmosphere.  Since we do not yet know anything about the planetary atmosphere's, all we can say is how much energy a planet is receiving from the star compared to how much energy Earth receives from the Sun.  However, because this planetary system is so nearby, scientists should be able to characterize the atmospheres with future instruments and observatories.  That's one reason why we're so excited about this discovery.  - Natalie Batalha
Curios as well. I live on the ocean and work on it for a living. I always dread full moons because of the bigger tides. 
That would be a lovely idea.. With the TRAPPIST team, we were more considering using names of the few trappist beers ;) !J.d.W.
The problem is that if we do find life on one of them, you can't very well have newscasters say "Life has been discovered on Dopey" with very much gravitas. 
NASA's upcoming James Webb Telescope, launching in 2018, will take over with a much higher sensitivity. It will be able to detect the chemical fingerprints of water, methane, oxygen, ozone, and other components of a planet's atmosphere. Farisa Morales
Whether or not the planets have an atmosphere, whether or not water vapor is in the atmosphere (indicative of a liquid water ocean), and possibly even signs of life by way of biosignature gases. We will be able to find out if the planets are similar to each other or different. --SS
The habitable zone is estimated based on the luminosity of the star and recognizing how far away can you be from it such that water can exist in it's liquid form on the surface of a terrestrial planet like the earth.  Too close and the water evaporates; too far and the water freezes solid.  Thus, the habitable zone is independent of whether the planets are tidally locked or not.  Farisa Morales
Kepler taught us that temperate (i.e. Habitable Zone), terrestrial-sized planets are relatively common in the galaxy.  The name of the game now is to find those near enough for atmospheric characterization.  Of the few dozen Habitable Zone planets that have been detected to date, most are hundreds of light-years away whereas TRAPPIST-1 is just 40 light-years away.  - Natalie Batalha
What is really important about these types of discoveries is that they are checked by other scientists and confirmed external to the original team this is called the peer review process and has to occur before any scientific work is made public, to make sure we are giving the best information available -HW
> the system of planets is relatively close to us, in the constellation AquariusSeems like that might answer your question!
Yes quite a few of us are.From the NASA HQ library, write a few people went for a big "YES!" to your question ;)J.d.W.
Hubble can't take images of these planets, but it can do something even better: take spectra. -- NL
Oh, Reddit. Considering the syntax of this classic question, I'd personally go with one Earth over a hundred. ;-) -- Stephanie
>More on this soon!How do you define soon?
> The raw data is going to be immediately made public to everyone (yes even you) as soon as it's downloaded from spaceThat's f'n awesome.
By "protocol," what we really mean to ask is, "how many shots have you each signed up to do if and when this happens, and what kind?"
How might an oxygen-rich atmosphere form in the absence of photosynthetic life?
You're searching for alien farts?
2030's seems like a long time away. What's the barrier to getting these telescopes sooner? Budgetary, engineering challenges?
When did my homework join NASA?
"Starshades". This is what I'm calling sunglasses from now on.
>It has the same radius as Earth but 68% the mass. That means the surface gravity will be 68% lower than on Earth.Wouldn't it be 32% lower than Earth's gravity or 68% of Earth's gravity?
32% lower than on Earth.Source: I live on planet f.
Do we have any idea how the human body would cope with 1.1g?Would it simply require 10% extra work (probably creating more fit people) or are there more complicated effects?
Paging /u/ElonMuskOfficial. Forget about nuking Mars man, let's go to one of these planets.
I imagine there will be more shot in this direction though soon. If you want to get funding just tell Trump he gets to name one planet. You'll have a check in the mail tomorrow. 
What if you use hyperdrive? I mean the Millennium Falcon did make the Kessel run in 12 parsecs....
And we've invented a bendy stick to shoot other sticks after 190,000 of those 200,000 years.
And Alpha Centari is about 4.3 LY away, while this is at 40 LY. 40/4.3 = ~9.3. So, this is 9.3x further away than Alpha Centari. If their predictions are correct (20yrs to Alpha Centari), then it should follow that it will take us 9.3x as long to get to this system. 20 \* 9.3 = 186 years. Still a fucking long time, but nowhere near as long as the hundreds of thousand + estimates.
Is it correct to say, that if they are 40 light years away, they are now receiving our radio broadcasts from 1977 ?
Interesting. There would probably be some pretty massive winds going from a hot sun face to the cold dark face. I imagine it would be better to be in the penumbra anyways to have some solid ground between you and any big CMEs.
Are tidally locked planets likely to have an encompassing magnetic field?
>  they live for hundreds of billions years keeping in mind that the universe is only 12-14 billion years old. . . (and this star is not-likely 1st generation)
500 million and 40 *
Now imagine those same tides, but a thousand times larger AND the sea is literally lava.
Why does the moon being full have an effect on the tide?
Is it likely that any of the TRAPPIST planets have a magnetic field? Can tidally locked planets have a magnetic field?
How does a telescope detect chemical fingerprints?
So what you're saying is that there's a real chance that we will be able to confirm or deny with a high probability the existence of life in the TRAPPIST-1 system next year. This is incredible.
Just 40 light years lol. We better get busy with near light speed capabilities. 
So, a while, then?
I will second this and so will my tattoos, my phone case, and my laptop case. - HW
Probably whenever they figure it out.
You mean how do astronomers define "soon"?
A shot of water would be fitting to celebrate it, right?
Giant sand worms apparently. 
This is TRAPPIST-1 - hopefully they're alien beer bubbles.
2030 starts in 13 years...thats not long at all ( damn, i feel old suddenly).
Hubble was launched in 1990, and its 'replacement' the JWST is launching 28 years later. 28 years after the JWST is ~2046
Around 12:00 AM
Yes!  Corrected. - NB
Heard nice things, but what is the commute like?
Exercise physiology masters student here - great question! For short term, I believe it would just make people more fit. Imagine sedentary individuals going to the gym. They have strength gains far above 10% which the body handles just fine. The only issue I could really see is the heart having difficulties producing the pressure required to pump blood against the planet's gravitational pull across a whole lifetime. 
Man don't blow his wallets on pipe dreams, let's see what we can do to Mars while we wait for warp drives.
Just tell the goverment there is oil.
Gonna have to get frozen for that journey!
So sad and true. Born on the trailing edge of an ideal truly modernized civilization. We're some clever primates for sure but we've barely conquered the most basic of technologies in the last 100 years...  That being said, progress has felt somewhat exponential since then. Still, we definitely need a much more educated populace
But won't the spacecraft have reached even greater speeds in the distance between, reducing that time? 
Oh god they're getting our disco. If there's advanced life there no wonder they don't want to make contact.
But then you don't get any energy from photosynthesis.  Sticking in the light has major advantages.
So how do we get 100 billion year lifespan estimate from something that can't be more than 14B?
Damn, they really do.    *Setting Hyperdrive Destination To - Zundert*
Engelszell? Very roughly, that is German for "Angel's Prison Cell". Pretty fucking awesome.
I think it's to do with the wavelengths of the light coming from them

Brb, trying it out in Universe Sandbox right now!
... and also did not detect a thing
I'm much too excited about this than I should be 
Would there be any way the government could silence the information? I know NASA is normally extremely open about information, I'm just curious if something this big could be kept under wraps. 
So do you call it the prime directive internally? Please? 
Yeah... Thats the spirit. Not. Don't come party with me.
Would it be possible for a planet to have an atmosphere of N20 (Nitrous Oxide aka laughing gas)?
Can't wait for YUENGLING-5 to be discovered.
What ? 13 years into 2030 ? Did i sleep like last 10 years ? Time is so fast :((
So what's the barrier to getting these telescopes sooner? Budgetary, engineering challenges?
That's just the VCR. It always says that. 
Thank you for reminding us all that even the most brilliant among us can make brain farts. 
jeez, now I envy that guy.. 
So just like Dragonball Z but instead of reaching super saiyan 2, your heart just gives out?
Furthermore, getting to Mars is seen as a proof of concept/test for going further into space.
We want to observe it, not invade it.
*Even if we do find ways to speed up ships to near-lightspeed (ion engines...?) how exactly are you going to avoid obstacles when you're travelling towards them faster than information about them can reach you?*That... is a hell of a thought. I had never considered this when imagining ftl travel.
Not sure a 1-hour 49-minute movie will keep you occupied for that long.
Or for *Mass Effect* to happen.
It's these trade offs that make me so jazzed to picture what kinds of crazy life forms might evolve on these planets.
Its been 16 my man where those numbers at?
Version 1 or Version 2?VR might help.
Which is a perfect policy to have.
womp wompppp. doesn't mean much, though. could be pre-radio or post radio, or just not use radios. could be microscopic life in a puddle somewhere. who knows. 
But even if they find something, the fastest means of communication we know of would delay any sort of response to minimum 80 years. It's kind of depressing to think of it that way. :(
For the government to keep incontrovertible proof of alien life from the public it would have to be significantly more competent than it has demonstrated itself to be (I'm talking long term). In addition, it would require that no one - NO ONE - who knew and had access wouldn't blow the whistle. Those in government are still in the end just humans and human nature suggests someone would feel compelled to let the word out.    
For me personally, inside my brain, sure. :) I guess that's very "internal." -- Stephanie

You're going to get so much oxygen. Maybe you're going to say, "Please, don't give us so much oxygen, Mr President, please, we don't need that much oxygen!" But you're going to have that.
That feeling you get when you realize 2030 is closer  to now than 2000.... :(
Now I dont feel so bad about the test I just bombed!
Pickup line : "Hey baby, i once corrected a NASA engineer."

Well last time we tried mars, Mark Watney almost died. 
I kinda wanna invade it
We can probably track and predict the paths of large celestial objects sufficiently enough to avoid them but I can't imagine wanting to take a trip on a craft that can be shredded by a little bit of space dust.So we can add some sort of future-tech shield system to the list of things we need before hitting up our cosmic neighbors for a cup of sugar.
Right I mean look.at what the hostile bottom of our oceans have made.
I gotcha now! ;)  I managed to muddle myself at one point sorry.

I wonder if all newly elected presidents make a beeline for particular archived classified documents.
If the latter is found rest assured I will rub it on my genitalia
If such intelligent life is capable of receiving radio then they probably would transmit it too, which would have been been picked up by now. I don't think anyone is expecting to find any type of intelligent life on these planets.
I used to think the government could hide the existence of aliens like in the X-Files. Then I saw what happened during hurricane katrina and realized the government can't do shit.
I just want to say that you are everything I'd hoped you would be, and please continue to exist.

I don't about your experiences, but this probably wouldn't work very well.  Girl:  "Oh a know-it all and a show-off.  Bye."
Bro you gotta science the shit outta this."I'm a web designer."
Yeah, fiction has us as the defending species, but we should grab the galaxy by the balls and just start invading 
Would a hypothetical Alcubierre drive solve that? Since space is bending around the ship a possible rogue space rock would never actually touch it.
I bet you could get through a full game of Civilization too on the way there!
I often think this also, i mean if i became president id be straight to the classified space section. 
We are literally talking to NASA right now, and you choose to talk about your genitals.  The future is strange.
homeboy fucked a martian once! 
Well to be fair there would be a long delay in time for them to receive our message all the way from Earth and then we would need to wait a long time to hear a response back. And anyway, even if it isn't intelligent, any extraterrestrial life would be monumentally important 
"Live long and prosper."
Underrated "pence is scum" joke
Well duh. How else did Mars get that massive scar across its surface, except by the Earth scraping across it, which killed the dinosaurs and created the asteroid belt? 
Correcting a president on his grammar seems like much less of an accomplishment these days.
>grab the galaxy by the pussyFTFY
Only one solution. Giant magnets on the front that repel anything! I will call them... magnetic shields.
Okay, I know this is a joke, but there is no way you could finish a game of Civ in only 160,000 years.
Only to discover they are classified merely because someone did something so stupid that its just too embarrassing to share with the public.
NASA has genitals
hopefully the enlightened ones here will not shame extraterrestrialiality
Even if we found a worm on one of the planets, it'd be one of the greatest scientific discoveries of this millennia if not ever.

One more turn...
What will it take to make this bill - or any slight variation of it - fuck off for good?
What companies want CISA to be passed?
When I called my senator to ask her to vote against CISA, one of the questions the aides asked me was, which cybersecurity bill do I recommend my senator support instead? Unfortunately, I didn't have a good answer.Are there any cybersecurity bills in Congress that you do support? If not, what would a good cybersecurity bill look like? If I have good answers to these questions, I'll call my senators again tomorrow and let them know what they should support instead of CISA.
If Twitter is in support, why is this not on their moments or news feed?
Why isn't there some kind of rule to prevent failed legislation from being reintroduced so often?
Am I the only one that noticed that Reddit was suppressing posts about the CISA Senate vote? Of course they let it through to the front page today, a day before the vote, to at least give us some semblance of uncenshoship. A day before the vote gives us little to do anything about it.
Who are you're main allies in Congress fighting along with you for this cause. We hear often about those who are actively campaigning for CISA etc. but who is with the internet?
Will this be affecting more than just the U.S.? e.g. will it affect canada?
Why do they do this? Do they actually think "maybe this time it will work!"? 
This is starting to get annoying as fuck. We already shut down the bill. It's clearly something people don't want. Isn't there such a thing as Double Jeopardy when it comes to passing bills?
I am sitting in a Q&A at a college with the director of the NSA. What question should I ask as a college student? I have like 10 minutes.
Senator Wyden,As one of your constituents, thank you for your opposition to these blatant surveillance bills. The amount of support these bills manage to get without a public outroar is alarming. What can we do to not only prevent this from happening *now*, but to stop these sorts of bills from gaining so much traction in the future?
What is the likelihood that it will pass? 
As an IT Auditor with CISA certification, every time this shows up on here, it always has me wondering what does Reddit have against Certified Information Security Auditors?  Then I actually read the headline.
Why would you say this is our one last chance when there have been many bills beforehand? You honestly believe if this gets voted down they won't try again? That's optimistic to the point of stupidity 
I am not trying to undermine your cause, but how do you find the motivation? It seems these bills are like Hydra heads, not to mention the effort needed to cut them off. On top of that, the majority of people willingly wave their privacy on social media while those who don't encrypt their traffic. Keep fighting the good fight regardless!
Who rules on these bills? Is it a senate/house committee or judge? This seems like something you could sue all the way up to the supreme court for unreasonable search type of deal. 
Didn't the Senate already pass give the thumbs up to CISA?  What is this new Senate vote about?
Who are the guys pushing this that I can vote for/against? Is there anyone who has attached their name to this that we can send down with this bill when the time rolls around?
Why can't we get a bill passed into law stating 'the privacy of the people on the internet shall not be infringed upon' or something like that?
I read somewhere that the EFF has no actual lobbying power and is just an 'awareness' group- meaning my money is better spent elsewhere. Is this accurate? 
What do you think of the corporate hold of reddit ?
Who has a plan to stop this shit from coming back ever 4 months?  The people have spoken and nobody wants this crapy legislation but the folks with the funds to keep it in play with politicians. How do we change that?  Doing these campaigns every 4 months for over 3 years is annoying.  I guess that's their plan,.... just wear folks down until they stop giving a shit.  
Why, when people clearly have shown that they don't want a bill like this, do politicians keep pushing this shit on us?
What is the truth to the assertion in The Hill article today that FaceBook is "secretly" lobbying for this bill?
Hey eff. Unrelated but important: why did you guys side with Greenpeace? Honestly I'm having a hard time seeing you as the good guys since then :/
My senator is fortunately voting to protect our privacy, would it do any good for people to contact other senators?
I think we can put an end to CISA for good. We just need to kill it so bad that it becomes toxic and no one in Congress wants to go anywhere near it ever again. That's what happened to SOPA, so we know it's possible. The companies behind this would no doubt continue to try to sneak it through in some other form, but making Congress afraid to touch CISA or similar bills would be a huge step in the right direction.
**I think the only sure-fire way of doing that is to stop electing idiotic puppets into Congress.**
Also, it's many of the companies that seem to know the least or are the most reckless about privacy and security -- Chamber of Commerce, banks, Target, Experian. The Chamber themselves are the ones that lobbied to take out real cybersecurity measures like having good security, and helped to create this bill that goes beyond strict cyberthreat data sharing to expansive info-sharing with 7 federal agencies for more than just cybersecurity purposes. 
>One of the questions the aides asked me was, which cybersecurity bill do I recommend my senator support instead?What a ridiculously condescending question to be asked. Tell your Senator that a voting against CISA does not require her to vote for something else.
This sentiment is exactly what supporters of this legislation want to hear. They'll keep bringing it up again and again until the public reaches the end of their attention span and stops paying attention all together. I read comments on reddit after the SOPA blackout thing that predicted this turn of events. Now here we are...
Got the same problem.. not only with them but others groups like avaaz etc.. all my emails were spammed with although important cases it was simply too much.. so one day I decided it must stop and unsubscribed from everything and now I am a bit of aware not to sign any petition or anything where my email address is required because I don't want any spam from any mailing lists.
The topic is CISA and reddit upvotes this frivolous comment to the top? pathetic...
Twitter, like most technology companies, is opposed to the bill.
Because people change their opinions, and not every piece of legislation introduced is evil. Where would we be if, for example, marriage equality was brought once 10 years ago, shot down, and never talked about again?
Wouldn't that require like a constitutional amendment?Might not be a bad idea.  Otherwise I'm not sure how you can pass a law that makes other laws invalid.  Of course the screwy thing about our system is that you can't sue until there are damages.    So unconstitutional laws can be passed, but then they get challenged and repealed I think.    I wish there was some way to reverse that process so that certain laws would have to meet the challenge of constitutionality before being passed and enacted.    
Baldwin (D-WI)Booker (D-NJ)Brown (D-OH)Coons (D-DE)Franken (D-MN)Leahy (D-VT)Markey (D-MA)Menendez (D-NJ)Merkley (D-OR)Paul (R-KY)Sanders (I-VT)Udall (D-NM)Warren (D-MA)Wyden (D-OR)
Yes, it will affect Canadians and everyone else, in some ways worse. The law encourages the capture of data, regardless of whether its from the U.S. or elsewhere. Lots of it will flow to U.S. companies, or through the U.S..Since you're not a U.S. person (we need a better term for that, if anyone has ideas) the U.S. government already cares less. There are a few weak protections for data from the U.S., and a few more will be written, but those won't apply.
Note that bills like Marijuana legalization and gay marriage would suffer from this as well. 
For you:- Your information is shared with the goverment- Prevents nothing for you (no proof that the NSA mass surveillance has stopped attacks.- Doesn't force you to do anythingFor Companies:- Can break the privacy policy so long as its sharing with goverment- Prevents them from getting sued for the breach of privacy policy by users- Doesn't force them to share???Other problems:- Hacker gets access to gov PC and they have access to all company data shared- HUGE security problems- People from around the world lose privacy
Ask him if, in his opinion, proposed "cybersecurity" legislation like CISA would have had any chance of prevent the major security incidents that we've seen over the past few years - the Target, Sony, OPM breaches for example. I believe you'll find his answer enlightening (spoiler: it wouldn't have done anything!)
Do you mean Admiral Rogers? This is really wonky, but I'd like to ask what percentage of data collected under 702 is from Upstream collection. Last Friday a federal judge cited it as 9%, but that number was from 2011 and I'd like to know if that number is going up or down.He probably wouldn't have an answer off the top of is head, but it is the question I'd like to know.
The likelihood is greater if we don't fight back. And even if they do pass it, we're going to make them pass a "surveillance bill". They won't get to sneak it through and pretend it is non-controversial. (Which by the way, they used to claim this bill was non-controversial all the time.)
As a sysadmin, i hate you for making me do more work 
Unrelated: my name is Will Cook and I am for sex. 
CISA specifically exempts itself from FOIA, so it will be impossible to know what's being shared and what personal information is included. That will make it much more difficult to challenge through the courts. 
Senator Burr and Senator Feinstein have been leading the effort in support of the bill.
The EFF has lawyers and everything on their payroll and has taken up fights in courts together with other similar organization.I wouldn't say your money is badly spent by using them on the EFF.
Why is there reluctance from Google to lend their weight to these causes?  Not as immediately business-destroying dire as SOPA/PIPA?
Ok so what happens when they just rename the thing to another innocent acronym and hope the Internet doesn't notice?
Isn't SOPA just back as a part of TPP now, though? Or is that not true? It's kind of hard to tell, there's so much conflicting information...Sorry to be contrary! Thank you so much for what you do.
I think we need to proactively lobby for an anti-sopa/cisa law.Can't we all lobby for it? Just like the big shitty companies? And why aren't we voting for congress reps and shaming the ones  who vote against our interests?We care, we keep having these threads, lets make one big push to end them all... please?
Too bad we only get to do that every few years.
Google has been completely silent on CISA.  Given the positive PR they know they could absorb by coming out against it, and the fact that they were supporters of CISPA, you can pretty much assume they're pro-CISA, just like Facebook.
Feinstein, Burr, McConnell. 
Yeah, i loved knowing about the shit that actually mattered. I hated hearing every five minutes about basically every political agenda they care about.
I was tired of seeing emails of "this is terrible" or "the worst thing to happen yet" first thing in the morning, I use my personal email for work also, so when I see these on my iPhone I start thinking "oh fuck what did I do". Just stop with the click bait titles, we are about the cause but just please stop that.
I think I signed on for their email chain after they did an "email your senator" drive. Every day then on it was blast emails along the lines of "Comcast sees what we're doing, AND THEY'RE SCARED WITLESS"
Why an app? This seems totally unnecessary and a waste of time/energy/$. Not everything needs an app. 
You pretty much just said you don't care what we think about email we don't want. I would prefer to decide what I think is important and what side of that argument I am on (if any).*a word
Enough people don't unsubscribe that we keep doing it because it's practically free to send emails and if one person donates, the campaign is worth it to us. We would really like to send you more and are trying to find ways to do so.\#sorrynotsorry
> Unfortunately there are far too many bad laws and policies that we are fighting in this day.if you spam inboxes for every single law people will lose interest and even for the most important/egregious ones people won't care because you send 123120938 emails a week.
Monthly newsletters is a much better format.  Tried and tested.No one likes spam.
They are hoping that EFF will not learn how to send emails in the appropriate time frames?
I have a gmail account I use only for spam for situations like this.
I believe what he is trying to say is that since twitter is opposing the bill, why doesn't he see more negative press about it in the twitter news feed and moments. 
But part of politics is convincing people and one way to do that is with legislation or attempts at it. Think about issues you might agree with that had to come up time and again before they caught on (like, say, gay marriage and marijuana legalization).
> demanding public accountability every step of the way using online and other means.I agree. The false issue that I always hear is "Psh, do you know how easy it is to hack that kind of stuff?" As if that ends the discussion. Let's just say it was *that easy.* considering how watch dog places like reddit are, potential hacking would be caught and the result voided. The only way to advance as a society is to try. Plus it's not like we'd be throwing it up there without paying attention to the results or planning ahead.
I agree, it seems that the level of precision that people desire is not something that could be written into law very easily. Some issues should be brought up again because they are worth fighting for and others just need to go away. But there's no way of easily distinguishing between the two.
One alternative would be instead of having a set of criteria that makes something banned from coming up again, make the restriction time based. Okay, this was rejected, you can't bring it back for two years.. or a year.. or a session. Whatever the decided upon length of time. This would work better for things where people just change their minds over time and also prevent people from just trying to constantly sneak something in.
You could argue for a time based limit, say no more than 3 instances every 10 years or whatever.
The introduction of something that's failed into something unrelated that's likely to pass should be outright illegal and should be prosecuted.
Is this insinuating that every other representative is actively for CISA or are there some that are just not actively against it.
I love seeing Paul up there, but sad hes on the only R
Yeah, they think they can wear us down. The only way to stop this for people to come out so strong against this that it becomes toxic and Congress never wants to touch it again. 
Oh, or about this one: "If China had the exact same capabilities as the United States, would you ask your children to change their personal behavior?"
Man, you people are worse than the politicians at giving non-answers to direct questions.
Would you prefer to be called President George W. Cook?
Cybersecurity information sharing act exempts itself from freedom of information act? How is that even legal? They want info on us but we cant get info on them?
Because Google is most likely pro-CISA.They were pro-CISPA as well, but found out the hard way last time that they need to stay quiet about that fact to avoid damaging the misplaced trust many have in them.
yup, until we start calling the bills by an acronym describing what they're all trying to do, so we can say "IT'S ANOTHER #### BILL! GET IT!!!"This removes the tool of cognitive distraction/differentiation of "but this bill is completely different, and it has a different name!"It will make the toxicity mentioned by the OP easier to pull off, give all the toxic a name, and attach it to other toxic to make the whole field of bills in the image of the abyss toxic.
There are pieces of SOPA in TPP -- compelling ISP's to block websites without due process. The whole intellectual property chapter, as well as patents, are all bad -- exporting broken copyright abroad. 
If I perform badly at my job my boss can come in tomorrow or even call me tonight and tell me I'm fired. We should be able to do the same.
Really would be great if we had another Wikipedia (SOPA) blackout day or the like.  I know these companies fear becoming political, but they are already in the game and they really have to stand up for privacy + people if they want to our business longterm.I'd switch off gmail in a heartbeat if there was an equally powerful alternative that didn't data mine.  I'm already off google (duckduckgo) so that is my ad info they are losing out on already.
I find that hard to believe
That's a pretty big assumption you're making, and you're projecting a lot.  It could just be that they are legitimately undecided on the issue, which isn't that hard to believe for any huge corporation of its nature.  Alternatively, they most likely have partners on both sides of the fence and can't afford to swing in one direction or the other.
This sort of makes you question whether they're really looking at things in an unbiased way too. I mean do they want to kill every piece of Legislation that has anything to do with the internet, or are they looking at it objectively in what harm it could do? Because we do have real cybersecurity issues.
Or like someone else suggested, maybe a monthly newsletter? That seems more appropriate and less invasive. 
Some people feel like it's the most seamless (not annoying) way for them to take action, it could be the most efficient way too -- see a notification, look at it, click to take action in one spot. It also means we don't have to depend on so many gatekeepers -- facebook, gmail, commercial email ISP's, etc. That said, we're wary of making something unnecessary and doing this in a lightweight way. 
This is not an accurate translation. Come on!
I even settle for weekly on some email lists. Anything more is overkill and instant unsubscribe though in 99% of cases. 
Yeah as someone who has voted primarily liberal, I loved the shit out of Ron Paul. 
Clearly we need harsh penalties for failed legislation.
Most recently, they seem to have come out as anti-CISA.  But it's more a whimper than anything.
Is there not some guidelines to how many times a specific bill could be passed? If SOPA has been refused before, can they technically just reintroduce the bill, try to get it passed on the second try, and so on, or do they somehow have to change it?  And while we're on the topic, any news on the TTIP and / or TPP? Read that Merkel supports the TTIP, but don't see any reasoning behind it.
how about a SHIT bill - Sifting Hoards of Intelligence Tyranically
Oh jeez, you *are* really close. Like, less than 2000 close. Sign, people!
And while it's not really a huge dent for them because of their size and market cap, I did read somewhere that google values each of their users somewhere around $250 each. So if more and more of their user base starts abandoning them as a result of the data mining it will eventually have an impact. 
You might be able to set up your own mailserver. No data mining, and is only $10 a year for a domain. (plus a cheap raspberry pi)
A monthly newsletter is good for a roundup but it isn't for taking action when it matters, as so much does change. It's something we'll most likely offer when we get a breather (we're smaller and a little younger but we'll definitely tackle this soon)/ We totally don't want to be reaching people who don't want to hear from us, so yeah we hope that only people who want to hear from us are on the list!
Given the power of social media, has consideration been given to starting with a simple Facebook plugin?It won't help if the titles are clickbait, tho. That's the biggest thing.
> see a notification, look at it, Right, because having my phone DING several times a day because of a notification isn't annoying at all.
Wow.  That is an insane leap of logic.EFF sunk their own boat when they decided to spam me with nonsense emails about how the world was going to end if I didnt donate to them.
I saw a report once where they actually gutted a piece of legislation, kept the same name but inserted new, completely unrelated rules/bills. That should be illegal.
There's not a lot of great things to say about Kentucky, but to it's credit the state constitution specifically requires bills to have a single purpose and a name that accurately describes its purpose.
it's a tricky subject, however. Often bills with meaning will get gutted when going through legislation, so the people who originally lobbied/worked for the bill will just try again until they get it through with minimal bullshit (like free riders or becoming a "christmas tree" Bill."
They just have to change the name and the wording slightly.
That's missing the forest from the trees. How do we elect representatives that vote in the interest of the people, and not of lobbyists and those who pay lobbyists? 
I second this motion. SHIT bill. Has a nice ring to it. Kinda like holding a one pound hammer. Feels right.SHIT bill. Mmm.
down to 1630 last time I checked. So close.
Neat!  I'll look into it.
If you can add customized email settings, would it be possible for users to subscribe/unsubscribe particular areas of interest?
> has consideration been given to starting with a simple Facebook plugin?EFF? Faceboook?How?
Isn't moving companies to Ireland a tax loophole of some sort?
How does one enforce something like that?  Does an outside body have to okay if before it comes to a vote?
So, half my essays in high school?
On the other hand, a two or four year waiting period wouldn't be so bad.
yeah, we'd like to offer this soon. 
I bet many EFF supporters still use Facebook. 
Turnitin.com/bills
TIL that congressman do not progress past high school mentally
Enforcement of that would very quickly become another political tool by which to kill a given bill.
That gives me an idea
Maybe high school mentality is just really effective
Kill it every two years? If they can successfully do that, they can do it without any exploitation. I mean, the bills *we* want don't get introduced every other month.
Could uh, could you do something *like* Burnout again? I mean not Burnout exactly, and certainly not something exactly like Burnout 3 - but I mean, something real close. 
When Sony became heavily involved, did they have any input (or say) on the final product? Is this still completely your vision?

How drunk were you guys in your live stream today?
Hey Sean, In an old trailer I saw huge snakes/wurms, are those still in the game? Also have a nice day!
Are ringed planets still in the game? Love ya Sean!
Will your glorious beard be shaved now?
Hi Sean. Hope you're well. Sorry. You've worked so very hard in bringing this game to life and put up with intense media & fan pressure very well (all for some unaccomplished idiot to write mildly humorous satirical erotic fiction about you). Would be interested to hear how you reacted. I hope you liked it tho.I do have to ask a question, so... Wanna grab dinner sometime? ;)
Any plans for VR support in the future?
Hi Sean,I've heard rumors of the possibility of an API at some point for at least Atlas data, will that be a thing?
Do you think our real universe is procedurally generated or perhaps a simulation? 
Can you say anything more about the base-building aspect yet?
Hi SeanDid the flood that struck your offices materially affect development? Would NMS have been a different game without it? Looking forward to tomorrow. I've been waiting for three years. Thank you for your dedication 
Will No Man's Sky on PC have FOV options? Or at least a higher default than the PS4 version? Literally the only thing keeping me from preordering...
Is the PC getting a midnight release?
Hi Sean, absurdly hyped for NMS! With NMS gaining so much traction - despite its indie status on PS4 it's being given the billing of a major AAA title - would you consider expanding HelloGames into a multi-project studio, or do you prefer more of a Pixar/Naughty Dog single-game style environment?
Is there any special piece of math in your universe generation algorithms that you think would particularly blow people's minds?
Favorite kind of tea?
How does it feel being the greatest con artist in the 21st century? 
Just curious why I can't get my money back after you straight up lied to me. Preordered the game before I went out of state. Came home to a piece of fuck game and I'm apparently not allowed a refund because it is out of the time frame. I hope you get class action lawsuited out of your ass for literally promising stuff that never came in the game. P.S. Thanks for stealing my hard earned $60. You ingrateful POS probably sitting on a multimillion oceanside mansion with all the millions you stole. So once again. Why did you lie and steal from so many people? 
Did space whales get in to the game?
Will there be random event such as stars exploding or large astroids etc?
Do you plan for any mod support on PC in the future?
How does it feel to know your game completely bombed??
Why was it so bad? What went wrong?
Ha! remember when you lied a bunch and then never addressed it? Yeah me too, i burned your game and will never purchase another digital or physical piece of content you so much proof read again. 
Given the multi-player connectivity features in the engine (which have very little chance of being used), do you guys have plans to perhaps expand on that side of the game after most people have had a good single-player experience?
How does it make you feel knowing that you are the reason gamers across the country are waking up tired for work?
Why did you lie to us?
Are you planning on adding gas giants, or any other space elements not currently included in the game? 
Are there ringed planets in the game?
Is it technically possible to cross paths with another player?
How many of those cupcakes did you eat in June that /r/NoMansSkyTheGame and I sent you? Who ate the most? :P
Why'd the game flop so hard? 
Would recommend any books/blogs about game launch?
Are there any/will we ever have any creatures with actual fur? I'd love some fluffy creatures!
I have a recurring dream that I am back working on Burnout 3. Normally that I'm playing the game, and we've made it so every race ends with a crash junction. Then I wake up in a cold sweat. Games dev does things to you.
To this day I'd still pay full price for a functional Burnout Revenge port to Steam.Hell I'd pay for it if the only thing it kept was Crash Mode. 
Sony has been super cool to work with, but mainly just because they haven't been involved in development, you know? We're still sort of the underdog with Sony, and in the general AAA (for obvious reasons). If NMS is a success, I think that probably will have a real impact in terms of how a lot of people in larger publishers view indie games. People generally think of NMS as a Sony title, but we're still just a self funded indie studio - it's kind of a crazy situation :)
PS4 and PC players are using two different servers. We are running a control experiment to see who names things the most juvenile things... Let the games begin!
The seed of the universe is the same but i don't think both can meet each other online.
Some of the team read it for sure, and then post me the weirdest stuff :) OK sso I'll admit there have been times, my lowest on the project, where I've looked at the subreddit and it's cheered me up and kept me going. But there have been times I've looked on there and despaired - and just thought "how can we ever live up to the expectations of people who having been waiting for this game for 3 years"
Yeah, so everyone thinks we were high or drunk :(Just hadn't eaten today, and am operating on zero sleep. It's an ok buzz. 5/10. Would not sleep again.
Control the spice, control the universe.
Oh man, I hate questions like this, because like wouldn't you just rather discover for yourself? Huge creatures are out there, and I haven't seen them on streams yet. They are rare.
Yes, I've seen them in streams, but they were glitched in the same way you sometimes see fish being glitched.
One of the people who got it early showed a space worm floating in the sky
What the hell is going on here? This is one of the fastest rising posts I've ever seen. 
Good question fellow Nivek
So basically my beard is a disguise. I'm totally going to shave it off when this game is done, and burn every check shirt I own (5?) and hopefully no one will ever shout "No Man's Sky FOV Slider?" at me in the street. ever. again. in. my. life.
Sure... where we going?
Simulation theory is pretty much confirmed. Fuck this world I'm gonna go live inside the No Mans Sky universe. 
Really hoping for this myself. Elite Dangerous was a whole new game in VR, and NMS seems like a great fit (minus some possible issues with movement on land)
aye, we need (what info we can get) on this for psvr & pc based vr options, the game *begs* for it to me, but that seems to be a very minor % of us.
It could be for sure. We were talking today about just having a twitter bot that tweets discovery names at random. We've just been glued to the screen all day, watching names come in. Game isn't out... but we had like 160k discoveries uploaded today... so... :o
So Elon Musk asked me this (NAME DROP!). I said if I was Elon Musk, then I'd be pretty sure it was right? Like load up the holodeck with the disk where I get to colonise mars and make self driving cars... So I think he almost certainly is, and then I'm an AI bot I guess? In his simulation? Controlled by a giant AI that's smirking to itself whilst I give this answer....
Hahaha, "how nihilistic has the development of No Man's Sky made you?"
Sean created us all.
This excites me. I want to build a zoo. Why build a base if you cant shove it full of insane creatures :|
Didn't he release a trailer for the game and then after the flood he said he would have cancelled the game if the trailer wasn't out?
We have found TotalBiscuit's Reddit account. 
The reality is that we're still here working on it right now. There's no conspiracy, we're just racing to get all the extra options and stuff we want. PS4 comes out tomorrow and we'll just try to pretend it's a normal work day! Best guess right now is 6pm GMT on Friday, but we'll keep you up to date as we get closer.
Initially I think we'll all be supporting NMS. But there are other ideas we've got rattling around in our heads too. I think video games is just such a largely unexplored field. There's very few studios that pull off the two game thing, but supporting one game and then kicking off something new - that's doable right?Sh*t, I just remembered, we've got another thing we're already working on that's unannounced. It's a small experiment, but hopefully you all might like it :)Maybe we can be the Johnny Depp of studios :D - do a mixture of big stuff and indie stuff? :D
Nice try, Genicap.
An Irishman, it has to be "Barry's Irish tea!"
Whenever devs are tight-lipped, it's normally just because they literally, legally, can't talk about a thing. Man, you would surprised how wrapped up most devs are in contracts and nonesense. Often for instance lots of devs will have a clause that says "you literally can't say the name of platform X". Knowing this it's really funny watching interviews where devs are squirming trying not to the word Wii or whatever when being asked about some industry thing :) - you see us say things like "well the thing about supporting... that particular console is..."
I know you're trying to prove a point and everything, but I would love being the best con artist of the 21st Century tbh.
Hope so, but you would probably be forced to play offline if that was the case.
He made more then $45m I don't think he considers it bombed
Why would you burn it when you could've sold it? 
You burned your digital download? Did you... did you burn your computer? Because I think Sean may have beat you again.
If not full multi-player, are you at least considering ways for you to "find your friends" in-game?
you mean disappointed that they spent $60 or more on a shitty game that was sold to them on lies?
He has stated on previous interviews that there would not be gas giants. 
You already know better than to ask that.
Does "Lazy Generation" play on repeat in your dreams?
Unsure what you worked on in BO3, but that's seriously the best racing game ever made.I skipped so many college classes my soph year to play it.
DICKWORLD I awaits colonization for PS4
Won't informing us of the experiment bias the results?
Meanwhile, at Valve: "That's cute."
Don't worry. We're behind you the whole way
Hey Sean,How often do you and your coworkers read the Steam forums for No Man's Sky?^please ^stay ^away ^theyre ^dangerous
Please take care of your health, if you die we will all have a suicide pact...
So the real question would be how drunk are you GOING to be once this all gets released 
Did...did you guys eat? We'll order you some pizza if you need it. 
From the post:> It's a very, very chill gameFrom someone looking for games that are the opposite of competitive adrenaline rushes, you just sold me
>  Feeding them correctly will yield... pooping valuable resourcesmelange confirmed!
DUUUUUUUNE <3
SPACE WHALES HYPE
Everyone wants to see him put a ring on it!
This game has been injected with liquid hype since it has been announced, and it's release date has been pushed back several times, making people extremely eager to play it. 
It's the guy who made "No Man's Sky", one of the most (over?)hyped games of all time. He didn't even need to write the name of the game in the title apparently. 
My god, it wasn't just you... the plaid was getting more intense too
If anyone does have a suggestion for new look, I'm totally open to that. Beard and check shirts is pretty much all I got... same as everyone else who works in games :)
"And he shaved his beard off and it was Peter Molyneux THE WHOLE TIME."
Well he's obviously not gonna tell you. That would ruin the fun of discovering the restaurant!
And pack it up boys, AMA has jumped the shark.
*sigh* (I apologise in advance for the joke)... Uranus
Fuck this gay earth
How many of them are Harambe?
HOLY SHIT. Do you know the scope of how many players have contributed to that? That's a massive number for the game not even being out. Please tweet what the first day discoveries number is, I'm curious to see how many millions it hits.
The tweet bot may be a mistake... depending on how many of the names are silly 
With an even bigger beard then the one you've got. God their dev cycle must be huge 
I don't think we're in a simulation, at least not one overseen by any entity. There are too few people named Cockhammer for it to be true. 
Found the MGSV fan
The game *at worst* will prove that an indie developer can make a game that not only looks like a AAA title, but also takes risks that only the indie game sector is willing to do.  It looks god damned impressive and I cant wait until Friday!
He said they probably would have cancelled the game if the trailer wasn't shown and there wasn't such a positive response. They actually asked Geoff Keighley to pull it from the show last minute, but he insisted on leaving it because he believed in the game and fought really hard to get them the spot on stage.
Ah, so you're at -1473 degrees as it stands?
I'll tell you a funny story about PC. I was here late yesterday, and I had to take a break and do an interview with Playboy (!) - and the guy was like "what are you working on when you go back downstairs?" and I was like "compatibility for ATI opengl drivers", and he said "ummm.... could you make something up. That sounds pretty nerdy". I always knew I wasn't Playboy article material :)
NO MANS JOE DANGER CONFIRMED
No Mans Sky to Wii U, confirmed.
Late to the party, but he said> digital *or* physical piece of content
So good at wasting our time!We are the lazy generation!We are the lazy generation, now!!
"DJ STRYKER HERE..."
i 100%ed that game so many times because people kept overwriting my saves. The only negative to that game is you can't easily tell which save slot is already used when starting a new game.All I want is a pc version, please please please!
The only three racing games I know of worth playing are Carmageddon, Mario Kart and Burnout.  Everything else is just a tech demo based around driving.
Yeah but marketing isnt for free - if you look at development vs marketing costs you see the second one is mostly always the biggest issue on AAA titles
Considering that the first footage i saw of NMS was on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, i'd say that they did more than what people are used to.
Wait there are pets now??
Sorry dumb question - what is AAA?
Harambe 4 and Poopworld
Redditers reading this post might make up a few percent of the players at most. Within a statistical anomaly most likely.
Haha 3 years, that's child's play!-Gaben
Unless the game sucks. Then you're on your own.
As if we'd all commit suicide for a video g---
(we'll order you more pizza than you know what to do with!)
I'm with you there. One of my favourite things about Minecraft was just being able to pop my headphones on, chill the fuck out, and explore a procedurally generated world. I was sold the moment I found out NMS is a single-player focused exploration game with entire planets to explore. I predict many a rainy night with scotch and this game.
The spice must flow.
He gives his procedurally generated water to the dead.
The best book, seriously people, if you haven't read it, make sure you do.
Everyone will soon discover your mom. 
And the dude with the steady job is the most comfortable too. Look - no shoes, no jeans. Sure, his shirt is a little bit ripped but that's ok.

Never played it, can I build a zoo??
It's hilarious reading this thread in retrospectWhat a disaster
Gamedev is a weird thing, it messes with your head, because you are trying to impress a ton of people, and you start having doubts, and they don't really stop.
Who knew it was possible to go below absolute zero?Does the camera begin to wrap around backwards?
Good job, now it's gonna be 143Hz.
The beard is all the material you need
Do you know which issue? I'm really looking forward to seeing your centrefold.
A different kind of midnight release.
JOE MAN'S DANGER CONFIRMEDFTFY
Sold my car, gonna buy an early copy.
I'm still stuck on 98%... I only need two euro trolley takedowns and I can't get them!!!
Burnout Paradise isn't exactly the same as Burnout 3 but it's available on PC if you need to scratch that itch
Crash Team Racing should get a solid nod
Which is sort of fucked up, in my opinion.
You can polish a turd with enough marketing and have a successful launch.  
1 planet discovered = 1 justice for Harambe and his galaxy 
That's so fake. He would never say 3
we did it reddit
So nice of you to press "---" before you d
And he knows that Fear is the Mind-Killer. 
I love reggie
Well, he's focusing on the product.Basically, a programmer only has to look nice for interviews.
Dripping wet rn
It would take 585 billion years to go to every restaurant, which is how long it takes for my wife to pick a place.
I'm looking to get into this human centipede as well.
Wow, I'll bet you never thought you'd actually know the answer to that. But here we are.
Doesnt help whenever someone that doesnt like your game has to tell you why they dont like it.  Not that feedback isnt bad, but some people are half vitriol and narcissism.
It'll be 142Hz if I have anything to say about it!
I'm pretty sure if you mine in Sean Murray's beard you'll find Plutonium.
Does she walk? Does she talk? Does she come complete?
Shhhh let him do it. 
It's good but it's not BO3 good.
Its similar with movies, on the plus side - this is the reason Independent Game Studios can exist - they can pull out a great game with guerrilla marketing and make a fine profit (best example is probably early minecraft)
**PROCEDURALLY GENERATED DICKS OUT FOR HARAMBE**
Damn, beat to the punchline. He would say 2+1 years however.
He probably has one of those Candlejack keyb

138hz here, good you?
Bill, what was it like collaborating with Tyler, the Creator for the theme song for the new show? What made you choose him initially? Do you have an ongoing friendship with him? 
Thanks so much for being here. Any chance of working with Disney again on the Energy pavilion at EPCOT? Lots of people would love to see an update based on everything we know about the subject now as opposed to twenty years ago - especially if you had something to say.
Hey Mr. Science guy! I grew up watching your show and it definitely influenced my path towards engineering.My question is what science fact absolutely blows your mind? 
Bill, What are your thoughts on Elon Musk and what he is doing for the scientific world through Tesla and SpaceX?
Hey Bill Nye! I am a 6th grade Science Teacher in Florida (currently in the middle of class) and my students want to ask you.. What was your most favorite episode you've ever created? Also, when did you discover your love of science? Finally, is there any advice you can give to a 6th grader to get involved in the sciences beyond the classroom?
Hi Bill, thanks for doing this - I've got a question, I know that maybe it's not specifically in your field, but I would still appreciate your thoughts as someone trying to "save the world".To what extent do you envisage automation replacing common jobs anytime soon, on a large scale? If this is accomplished do you think it will be a current player (amazon/google/tesla), something completely left-field no one expected, or a community effort from thousands of small to medium sized enterprises working together?Thanks!
First, thanks for making science class so great in middle school. I still have that theme song stuck in my head. What is our worst case scenario assuming nothing gets done to save the world and what does the timeline look like? How much is my life going to be affected? My kids? I know we need to do something, but what if it doesn't work out? 
Hey Bill, what's your take on  our chances of becoming a multi-planetary civilization in the foreseeable future?
Hey there Bill!Was curious, what was your favorite episode of the old Bill Nye the Science Guy show?  There must have been one episode you did that stood out to you more than others.
We've heard the chant of your name even wayyy over here in New Zealand. :)  Just a small question. Favourite astronomy point in the night sky?
Hi Bill,With the march for science coming up on April 22, many scientists are hesitant to march because they fear it will politicize science. What are your thoughts on politicization of science? Will you be marching?
Hey Bill,What are your thoughts on animal agriculture and the promotion of a vegan diet as to reduce our impact on climate change?
Where do you shop for ties?  I grew up in a bow tie family. I want a Bill Nye Science Guy Signature Bow tie!
Hey Bill,Do you think your TV show has helped or hurt the messages you're trying to spend? Does your reputation make people listen or tune out?
Hi Bill!! You're doing great work.My questions for you are:What is your favourite element and favourite subatomic particle?What scientific mystery do you most want to solve?
Star wars or Star trek?
What is the best way a normal person can make a positive impact in their daily life for global climate change?
What's your opinion on marijuana?
Hi Bill. You weighed in on Deflategate 2 years ago. Since then, numerous actual scientific method experiments and research firms have 100% debunked this. Do you stand by your original assessments? If so, what scientific model would you point to in order to defend the position?
Which is your favorite bowtie?
Have you heard the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise?
Who came up with your signature theme song? You know, "Bill Nye the Science Guy!" 
What do you think about the lack of Scotland players in the British Lions squad for the New Zealand tour?
Hi Bill,How many bow ties do you own? 
Hey Bill, thanks for doing this!My question is, does pineapple belong on a pizza? hoping you can solve this debate. Thank you
Hey Bill , I mean no disrespect but why are there so many stories of you being an asshole to people in public?? 
Do you ever see a future where all of our daily nutrients could be consumed in a pill form where traditional meals become more of an activity rather than a necessity?
Oh we hang out all the time. He comes by The Planetary Society; we talk about the cosmos and our place in space.
Not my choice. Please ask the Disneynians to refresh the ride. It was a fun job. It was sponsored by Exxon, while they still owned a division that made bearings for wind turbine generators, and before their climate denial documents from 1977 were discovered and published in the New York Times. I'd love to do a new show though.
You and I are made of the same material as the stars. We are star dust. Therefore, you and I are at least one way that the universe knows itself. Cue the spooky music.
He and is companies are shaking things up in a great way. Some disclosure, he served on the Board of The Planetary Society for a while, but has had to recuse himself as SpaceX became Yuge. (I gave him a ride to the airport once.) The Tesla outperforms conventional gas-powered cars (as does my new all-electric Chevy Bolt). If the reused lower stage of the Falcon rockets proves profitable, it will change space exploration in great way. Go Elon! (He's an immigrant to the U.S., bt-dubs.)
Answer this one Bill!
Dang it Bill, it's only been an hour, I wish this one could've been answered.
Why do I feel like he doesn't like to talk about the show
/u/sundialbill
Kids, meet disappointment 
Self-driving vehicles seem to me to be the next Big Thing. Think of all the drivers, who will be able to do something more challenging and productive with their work day. They could be erecting wind turbines, installing photovoltaic panels, and running distributed grid power lines. Woo hoo!
Go for it! People seldom regret what they do; they, or we, regret what we don't do!
The quality of life for people everywhere will go down. There will be less food and less clean water available in the developed and the developing world. It's reasonable that this will lead to conflict: more violence, more war. Here in the super-developed US, people will have to abandon homes in Miami, Galveston, Norfolk, and other coastal towns. It will lead to defaulted mortgages and people looking for jobs inland. Where will those jobs come from? Sooner we get to work the better.
Infinitesimal. If you think you want to live on Mars, try living in the dry valleys of Antarctica for a few years. And to play fair, you have to bring your own air to breathe. Inhaling the local atmosphere on Mars would kill you in an instant. You'd never go outside, not really. You'd live in some dome, and when you go out, you have to be in a spacesuit, which is just another dome, only really tight fitting. Oh, and there is absolutely nothing to eat.
Nope. When you get your job as a dancer on broadway, don't ever tell people who your favorite dance partner is. Otherwise, you won't get a chance to dance with anyone else. There is something in every episode that I just love. The spit take in Ocean Life cracks me up as does the screaming skull I'm holding in Bones & Muscles. And, who doesn't love passing out in a fighter plane pulling 7.5 g's?
Thanks for your support. I don't have a favorite (favourite). Saturn is beautiful. And, I am fond of the Earth's Moon.
People seem to afraid of politicizing science a lot lately. I agree to an extent - science should not be a political issue as it is really just our best gauge of reality. However, in recent decades, science has been under attack and forced into being a political issue. It is not our choice whether or not this happens, it's happened already.Our best course of action is to defend science since it is constantly under attack by ignorance, closed-mindedness, and bull-headed paranoia. It's very important that we defend science.
Plant-based diets are the future. I look forward to food preparations that are not "derivative bits," as we say in comedy writing. Instead of "coconut bacon," for example, I hope there is just delicious stand-alone coconut preparations. Cooking is a competitive business. I look forward to the emergence of new plant-based dishes.
Dont let Bills non response distract you from the fact that the Atlanta falcons blew a 28-3 lead in the super bowl
This is the question I want answered most.  I always looked up to this guy and believed he was a true "Science Guy" until that video.  I hope it was a joke video because he doesn't like the Patriots or something.  That would be far less heart breaking than Bill not knowing or understanding something as simple as the Ideal Gas Law.
Would love to hear his answer/response to this.
Maybe we should get r/patriots in here for some upvotes.
Check out Nick Graham. com. Consider buying our ties!
I hope people coming of age have a respect for the process of science in part because of my show(s). If not, I guess I've failed, but I did and continue to do my best. Checkout Bill Nye Saves The World, which starts on Friday on Netflix. There are 13 episodes. Binge 'em, and turn it up loud!
Favorite element? Don't have one, but I am fond of the compound water. In fact, now that I've sipped it, I don't think I could live without it. Subatomic particle? Not sure, but I'd sure like to know if there are particles associated with dark matter. Darkons?
Be sure you can do algebra. It is a key to success in a technical field. I work in a writers room these days. If you want to do what I do now, look for a job as a television writer. Thanks for being a member of The Planetary Society. We advance space science and exploration. Let's know the cosmos and our place within it!
Pick up trash. Especially around water sources. Although to be honest I'm not sure if that'll help climate change. But it'll help something :)
s c i e n c e   r u l e s
For us on the outside, it has always been a bit of mystery that Scotland has separate teams from Britain. Carry on.
this can't be real
We have all these stupid reality shows, but somehow we don't have a show about Bill Nye and Tyler the Creator talking about the cosmos
Do you ride bikes with him?You probably should, I've heard it is pretty fun.
Oh Tyler the Creator? He's my best friend.-Bill Nye
Hands down the best Disney ride when you need a half hour to sit and chill.
I understand KFC offers some funding for science-based rides.

So Galen Erso was on to something.

I don't think I've ever see someone write out "BTW" that way before.
I knew this would be a commercial, I did not think it would be a car commercial. 
How much did Chevy pay you to drop that advertisement? 
Bill, Bill, Bill...
Probably because a lot of folks remember him for it, making it his crowning achievement. The guy is brilliant with lots of influence, but can be dismissed by peers as the "kids show scientist".At least until all the older scientist retire and the only ones left are the generations that grew up with Bill!
We have to chant!Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill!
I work in a produce brokerage. We're very interested in the progression of self-driving big rigs. It's exciting to watch the technology unfold. 
They _could_, but in the real world, as it is currently set up, they'll actually go and starve to death in the streets.We should probably do something about that...
We're fast approaching a point where we might have more people than available jobs, when that comes does the government play a role in supporting its populace who are now out of a job?
Just like horses were able to take on more challenging and productive work after cars replaced carriages and buggies
>People seldom regret what they doSounds like you've never mistaken your blender for your rotating fleshlight
How do you plan to reach out to those in rural or underdeveloped communities in the nation and worldwide to educate them on conservation? Despite the fact that corporations and companies are the biggest polluters, things change when millions of people decide to put a common cause above the individual selves.
>You'd never go outside, not really.Awesome, so I wouldn't have to make any major lifestyle change!
Nothing to eat? Well if we brought Matt Damon with us to Mars, I'm pretty sure we could just eat him!
What specifically kills you instantly when inhaling in Mars' atmosphere?
I don't understand +- 2%? 100% percentages of what? What are they equivocating? How can we bring our Republican brothers along on an issue that should be non-partisan

What are your thoughts on lab grown meats?
Is Bill vegan? 
And yet whenever i mention veganism and why its good in a civil way on reddit, i get downvoted to shit. Its as if no one even reads what i have to say. 
He is a professed Seahawks fan.
We never will. 
I don't know how your show could have possibly hurt the message that SCIENCE RULES. Carry on my dude. 
See, when I make that joke about liking water so much I couldn't live without it, people just sigh and shake their heads.  When Bill Nye The Science Guy comes along and does the same joke, the world adores him.  I can't catch a break!
Thank you Bill for the reply! I've always been good with Mathematics; it's comforting to know it will help! I currently do freelance work as a writer for supplementary income and because it is fun! I'll have to talk with some of my connections who are television and screen writers; thank you again for the tip! 
Entertainingly enough, I live in Kentucky now, and it is very one-minded here. Makes a lot of things very difficult! Thanks for answering!
Or rather why do we in the UK usually get to field 4 independent teams, rather than compete as the UK in most team-based competitions? :)
I don't think there's conflict between "not being an asshole" and "wanting to change the world" though. A lot of stories about him are in the category of cursing at kids and being a mean person even before he was famous, rather than "Bill Nye didn't want to pose for a picture or talk to a total stranger and is therefore like Hitler except worse."
>The government cannot declare bankruptcy six times"Hold my beer."
lol I read that with some sass! :D
your outlook here is exactly why you'd be a better president than our current one. 
I think it is. Love me some Tyler, and he's an odd dude. Doesn't party. Doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, still lives at home with his Mom and sister. So I can DEF see him doing stuff like this in his spare time. 
What's surprising about famous people hanging out with famous people. Wonder if they spirit cook together
Did you see the Ancient Aliens thing he did? It's gold.
I love Epcot because it gets you out of the heat, and you wind up learning some pretty cool stuff. 
we r all dinosaur farts
I read this in my head in his voice..i've heard recordings of him speak and he has a way about him.
And then you start to wonder if free will even exists.
Carl Sagan*
It'll be a tremendous event.
Probably just sat there, quietly listening to NPR.
It's oddly fun to say out loud if your friends won't judge you (They will) but at least you can now say Bill Nye says it that way. (BT-dubs, they'll still totally judge you.)
Me neither, but I kind of like it
I can't believe someone would just sell out like that. It's giving me a headache, I'm going to need a Nuprin... little, yellow, different.
Definitely an intentional plug, but even if he was paid (or given the car for free) it was probably because he is happy to drive an all-electric car.
*deep voice* Bill Nye the Science Guy
So, I've always wanted to be a truck driver, haven't gotten a CDL yet, how fucked do you think my dream is?
Yeah, what a disappointing response. "Hooray! These advancements theoretically could lead to improvement in quality of life for all, but due to the death of the social contract will in fact lead to worse livelihoods for everyone except a select few who accumulate greater profits!"  /u/sundialbill do you have any thoughts at all on the need for **policies**, and not just technologies, that can help us reach the utopian vision you lay out?   Someone with your cultural cachet could help to make this dialogue more mainstream.
Well, there plenty of room for SOME work. So many people work 40-80 hours a week and that's just ridiculous but completely necessary when your getting paid next to nothing why don't we spread the load and the resources? 
Humans are slightly more versatile than horses.
At least war horses were replaced by trucks and tanks.
I assumed fetal position upon reading this
Sounds like you have
does runescape work on mars?
No that's too generous the entire answer is now wrong -5pts
A lot of the concern right now with lab-grown is they're perhaps further off than people assume, they'll come with a higher price barrier than traditional meat, and at least right now, they don't taste as good according to some preliminary reports. Also, from an animal welfare standpoint, the meat-protein based ones still require animal stem cells to be harvested, so they're not technically vegan, and still require a degree of livestock. 
But he's not 12?
For what it is worth I think you are swell!
Stargate Atlantis is still Stargate...
Also a Kentuckian. But I'm lucky enough to live in Louisville, so it may as well not be Kentucky.
"Hold my Pepsi"
Reasons to get famous:- Hang out with Bill Nye
Doesn't party *anymore*. In high school he wasn't allowed back to my friend's house because he and some friends made a promethazine smoothie in her blender. But who *hasn't* done that at a party tbh.
A lot of Tyler's music is a little too hard for me, but he seems like a really good guy
Or just get trashed in World Showcase. 
We are primordial soundOutward and inOmnidirectionalWe are existence
ME TOO! Fuck yes, Prog Metal on a Bill Nye thread. This entire album is pure gold. 
I'm always a big sucker for harmony, but JM in this case. It's so much more vulnerable and meditative. You?
I should bloody hope not hasn't he been dead since 1996?
Believe me.
TIL Nye and Musk are an old married couple.
Oh I use it out loud all the time, just never thought of writing it that way. I guess because it's more characters. 
Shit I'd do a plug in every comment for a free electric car. 
*Women computer voice* Science Rulesssss
Pretty fucked
Drive a big rig tow truck so you can tow the computerized trucks that break down. We'll always need tow trucks.
Anything that a computer can do, and will eventually do, will take your job. 
What social contract are you talking about that died? 
It's often cheaper to employ one person to work 60 hours than it is to employ two people to work 30 hours. 
It was a long night...
Get Jagex to open a new world for Mars, Martian man mode 
Yeah, because the Iraq invasion was great for the US economy...
An entire question only worth 5 points?What is this multiple choice?
You forgot to hit backspace on the end quotation mark that you copy and pasted from knowyourmeme 
Well, it's more like 'I can't believe it's not Stargate'.
Do Kentuckians call your area "Kentuckiana" or is that just Hoosiers talking about Evansville? 
* Be on Hot Ones with Sean Evans
That's in the evening. Every day.
It may be my all time favorite album. I hear they're working on a new one though!
LSD is a hell of a drug
It'll be unpresidented. 
Inertia is a property of matter.
As someone who has worked in transportation for many years (big rigs) I can tell you that truck drivers do much, much more than drive. The problem solving and critical thinking needed to deal with the issues that arise everyday will not be automated any time soon. We in the industry envision it becoming more like a commercial jetliner. The autopilot does most of the work but the pilot is still an absolute necessity. 
But the driving will be automated. He'll just be a tow truck attendant....
So everything
r/runescape and r/2007scape are leaking
Never said it was profitable for the country at large. It's profitable for a few in power and their buddies. 
Put fewer questions on the test so that when someone gets 1 wrong a full  letter grade drops
We're gonna have to agree to disagree then
Bill Nye on Hot Ones 
The show with hot questions, and even hotter wings
Oh that's like a spectre grilling, right?
Evening?! If you're trying to finish all the countries, it can take all day...depending on who's in your group.
Star Dust is another hell of a drug
He is going to home
BILL Bill ^bill ^^bill ^^^bill Bill ^^bill ^bill BILL **BILL NYE THE SCIENCE GUY**
Can you elaborate on that? I'm very curious about the day-to-day of being a driver, but I haven't run into much reading material about it. What sort of issues arise every day that can't be automated?
Best job ever. Just sit in the driver's seat, get it when the car tells you to.
A computer can't love.
Quick, invest in /r/marsscape
Okay, you've got me there. Upvoted
Sriracha, it's no big deal.
It's nothing like phantom baking, that's for sure
I did try doing it all in one night. Let's just say I made it most of the way.
We've never seen anything like it.
My Lucy Liu bot would beg to differ.
So much beer and food.. 
Nobody knew it would be so complicated.
> figuring out what to do when someone parked in the truck bay you need to back into. Yeah, there really is some very complex situations that arise when you're trying to maneuver a big ass truck through tight areas and people around you aren't aware of what you're trying to do or getting in your way. 
What do you think has improved life the most in poor countries in the last 5 years?
Hi Bill, my question: Is there anything in life that you regret doing or not doing? 
Hello Mr. Gates,2015 will mark the 30th anniversary of Microsoft Windows. What do you think the next 30 years holds in terms of technology? What will personal computing will look like in 2045?
Although you are a billionaire do you sometimes buy generic products over brand-name ones? If so, what are the products that you buy?
What do you think about life-extending and immortality research? 
Hello, Bill. As for the Reddit 's Secret Santa we know what present you've given this year. But we don't know what gift YOU have received from your Secret Santa. Can you tell us?
Hello Mr. Gates, I admire the work you've done to eradicate diseases such as polio from the world. What can we do as citizens to help keep these diseases gone for good?
Hi Bill, what is a life lesson you learned the hard way?
Dear Mr Gates,What is your internet download speed? ;)
As there are so many great philanthropic causes, how did you and Melinda decided on the causes that you wanted to put the majority of your effort? 
Hi Mr. Gates!Thanks so much for coming back again, I missed your last 2 AMAs.What do you think is the hardest challenge that the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation is currently facing?
Hi Bill! I was watching a video last night on Thorium reactors and saw that you were also in the video discussing this topic as well. This is a technology that I have been following because it makes so much sense.  My question is,  how feasible is the technology at this point in your view and how long before we will see that technology in practice here in the US? Side note,  thanks for being there.  You are an inspiration to all of us geeks and nerds from the 70s and 80s. :)   
Hi bill!First off, thanks for being an awesome human being!!! But onto my question:What innovation has been brought to you but sadly never worked out for what ever reason, but you really wanted it to work?Thanks! And keep being awesome!
Regarding the video of you drinking the ... uh.... poop water, how long will it take to put something like that into a community where they can start seeing immediate results? And if I totally missed it, where are they currently setup and what kind of benefits has it already provided. Besides clean drinking water, that is.
Hi, Bill. Dry rub or sauce on your BBQ?
Mr. Bill Gates, what is your favorite expensive food?
Hello, Mr. Gates!Over the last few years, several entrepreneurs (Elon Musk, Richard Branson, etc.) have launched ventures involving space exploration. Do you have any plans to get involved in this industry?
Who are you rooting for in the Super Bowl?
Hi Bill. What's your favorite spread to put on bread?
What is the silliest thing you ever bought that was expensive?
Have you ever taken a meyers-briggs personality test?  If so, what is your personality type? 
"Bill Gates was arrested in New Mexico in 1977 for jumping a red light and driving without a licence."Do you want to tell us this story?
Can you please release the source code for Windows XP and Direct3D under the BSD license?
Hey Bill! Here's a hypothetical one: You, overnight, lost all your money, power, relationships, and connections. No one knows who you are. Where and how would you start to get back to where you are today?Thanks, you are my role model!!
Vaccines make the top of the list. Being able to grow up healthy is the most basic thing. So many kids get infectious diseases and don't develop mentally and physically. I was in Berlin yesterday helping raise $7.5B for vaccines for kids in poor countries. We barely made it but we did which is so exciting to me!
I would probably be a researcher on AI. When I started Microsoft I was worried I would miss the chance to do basic work in that field.
I am pretty basic when it comes to clothes and food. My big splurge is having a plane to fly around in. I play tennis so I invest in shoes and racquets to help but they don't make a big difference.
It seems pretty egocentric while we still have malaria and TB for rich people to fund things so they can live longer. It would be nice to live longer though I admit.
Bill gates has one thing on his bucket list "not to die" .
Polio eradication is a big focus for me. Our last case in Africa was 6 months ago and we are hoping no more show up. It takes over a year to be sure. We still have cases in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Until we get rid of it there it can spread back to other countries. Pakistan is starting to take this seriously including the army and the government. They need to do the same things that were done in Nigeria. The Taliban makes it very difficult. They have killed women going to vaccinate kids many times.
Don't stay up too late even if the book is really exciting. You will regret it in the morning. I am still working on this problem.
I so want an answer from him for this. 
We have some tough scientific challenges like an HIV cure.However the toughest thing is helping teachers learn from the best teachers. There are great teachers and the kids who get them are lucky. We should be able to spread those skills but the current system doesn't do it very well.
Right now there isn't enough R&D going into safe and cheap nuclear energy. I am supporting Terrapower which has a 4th generation design that looks good. It doesn't use Thorium - it uses the 97% of Uranium that normally can't be used for a reactor by breeding and burning. This means fuel will always be cheap. There are a lot of innovations but the key one is that it is far far safer than anything today - not relying on human operators.
It is safe for now! It is also a lot of fun and helps shape your thinking on all issues to be more logical. There is a prospect for change in this area for the next generation but that is true for most fields and understanding how to program will always be useful.
The day we see OSes program completely new APIs for themselves will be a scary day indeed.  
The timeframe is longer than I would like. Probably 5 years before we have hundreds of them out in dozens of cities but we can scale up fast after that.
Sauce. Lots of sauce. I always spill a bit so I avoid BBQ before TV appearances.
A shorter chair every decade I am afraid.
From a standing position! 
Nathan Myhrvold has some amazing modern cuisine stuff that is super tasty. I am not a foodie but his new concoctions are amazing. I also like Thai and Indian food but it doesn't have to be expensive.
Mr Bill Gates is busy making Earth a better place for us to live in. He got no time for that funky business mister.
Clippy pops up: I see you are trying to burn retrograde to circularize your orbit.  Would you like help with that?
This is an easy question. I am good friends with Paul Allen who owns the Seahawks and I live in Seattle. The playoff game was amazing to watch. Go Seahawks!
Technology is not making people less intelligent. If you just look at the complexity people like in Entertainment you can see a big change over my lifetime. Technology is letting people get their questions answered better so they stay more curious. It makes it easier to know a lot of topics which turns out to be pretty important to contribute to solving complex problems.
Technology doesn't make people less intelligent, it makes stupid people not anonymous.
Every department is his department. Without him there would be no departments.I want a new AoE, too.
Age of Empires II is in the top five greatest achievements of mankind.
Amen to that!
Or an Age of Mythology sequel, I'd take that too!
I still play AOE3. At least once a week.
Mr. Gates, please reply to this. It is important. I would spend all the money I had on a new Age of Empires. From an economics standpoint, we would both benefit. Say I spend $40 on the new game. That is $40 of revenue, with a net benefit of something that would be determined later. From my side of the purchase, I have a net benefit of close to $60, because I would be willing to pay $100 for the beautiful game, and I only payed forty. We really want this game! Please?
Butter? Peanut butter? Cheese spread?Any of these.
I won't have time for all of these. My book reports show up on www.gatesnotes.com The Hololens is pretty amazing. Microsoft has put a lot into the chips and the software. It is the start of virtual reality. Making the device so you don't get dizzy or nauseous is really hard - the speed of the alignment has to be super super fast. It will take a few years of software applications being built to realize the full promise of this.If you study programming and biology and see how the programming can help biology you will stay out on front!
Probably the Porsche 959 that he didn't get to drive for 13 years.
It has to be frustrating to see well educated people from first world countries reject vaccinations for their own kids when you're desperately trying to get it to those who cannot on their own.
Thanks for the response, any specific reason for wishing you could learn those three in particular? 
Is it a paperclip?
Clippy 2.0?
Ah I think this was aimed at the one about what he'd do if Microsoft hadn't worked.
Bill Gates making technical errors puts my mind at ease. 
That's a pretty nice splurge
When you say you "invest" in shoes and racquets, are we talking a pair at a time or in the company who makes them? ;)
Thanks for the reply! It is nice to know that even billionaires are okay with using generic products.
Are you going to put yourself in a casino basement, and become a talking computer?
I've told my family that if I do die, I want my tombstone to say "My only regret is that I died."
Talk about an intimidating Secret Santa partner.  Redefines the question "What do you buy for the guy who already has everything?"
What kind of person would get matched to give Bill Gates a gift and not take that opportunity?!
That's just not right!
Who was the bastard that flaked on Bill Gates?  Although to be fair, it's kind of a lot of pressure, trying to find a gift for the richest man on the planet...
no known case of polio on the whole continent of africa in the last 6 months? That's amazing!Keep up the good work! The world needs more people like you and your wife.
What does the Taliban get out of killing women and children on their way to get vaccinated? 
I hope you see this, but you likely won't...As a recent bioengineering graduate, how would I become a part of this? 
"...But mo^o^o^om, even Bill Gates stays up late playing minecraft."
One of the global DNS servers that hold the internet are in his mountain fortress, so i'd say pretty fast.
Also, no matter what field you choose, automation can be a risk, but at least programmers have the advantage of being the ones needed to help develop and maintain their (and everyone's) replacements.
No, it will get scary when they document their own APIs. Then they will have surpassed humans.
The rise of Sky.NET
What can I do?
The image of Bill Gates worrying about spilling a little drop of BBQ sauce is now the only thing I can think about.
Bill Gates preventing the terrorists from winning. True bro.
Better change your passwords and/or secret answers now. 
Nabisco buzzmarketing... nice.
?? Did you just say that one of your favorite cooks/chefs is a former Microsoft Employee??
Does Paul Allen really have the best Business Card? 
This is the difference between powerful people and celebrities - celebrities have the players of the club as friends, powerful people have the owners as friends...
Who the fuck give gold to Bill Gates?
Like how will smith explained he was a weird kid in his teenage years but there was no internet for the world to know ho weird he is
This. If Bill Gates comes to your department requesting a new Age of Empires, you make him another Age of Empires.
I still play that game to this day.
I still play AOE2 at least once a week.
 Thank you so much for answering! I really appreciate it! :D
the crowd reactions make that video pretty great, you can hear how shocked they were that he could speak any Mandarin at all
It's probably Cortana.
Please...more like Clippy 2020.
Seeing as Microsoft was his third software company and the first two did fail, I suspect he would have started a fourth software company.
billgates.exe has stopped responding and must be shut down.
Will he recruit an army of Securitrons too?
Basement? Wasn't he all the way up in the tower (or are you referring to a server located in the basement, and not his body?)
Or at the top of one, protected by a bunch of Securitrons?
My only regret is that i have bone-itis
A MacBook.
Heifer International was probably wondering why there was a 25$ donation in Bill Gates' name.
Thank you :D I spent a good week non stop making it for /u/bfarnsey to give to Bill! I was worried it didn't make it but it did!
And now those that ripped into the Santa feel like a dick.
A simple card even...You know, with full name, address and phone number in case he needs a friend to throw money at? (even though he gives away a lot as it is)
Honestly I find it somewhat endearing that even the best of us can get internet-snubbed sometimes. Makes me feel sympathy even for Lord DOS
Thoughtful gift !> expensive gift. 
If there were more Gates-like people in the world...The level of expansion, knowledge, and understanding would be unfathomable. 
Why do you think Microsoft bought Minecraft? **EDIT**: rhetorical question, people. 
He stays up too late buying minecraft.
Careful not to drop it.
Ah yes, when the machines do something that humans would never do.
"To run this world domination, you need to upgrade to Sky.NET Framework 4.0" At this point you realize that your IT department didn't give you admin rights
There are some people working on using the Oculus Rift for this purpose.  Putting you directly in to a scene and allowing you to see it first hand instead of using your imagination.  I have a feeling most people will just avoid those videos though.
Eat more fibre.
Counter-terrorists win?
Of all people, you would think Bill Gates would know the importance of naming his children's first pets something at least 7 characters long and preferably with a special character and a possibly a number. 
Among many, many other super interesting things/accomplishments, Myhrvold wrote the Modernist cuisine, which sits on many chefs and foodies bookshelves. Its a beautiful, well researched foray into ultra modern cooking techniques and the classical background they came from. Includes a variety of recipes for people who want to experiment at home. 
I'll trade you my rookie Bill Gates card for a foil-Elon Musk card.
Of course he does, it has watermark.
Warren Buffet
Check this /u/thisisbillgates/gilded/
I keep thinking that, but then I remember that the gold itself is for Reddit servers and the recipient gets to feel like their comment meant something to someone.
Even if your department is only responsible for replacing broken office equipment, you make him a new Age of Empires.
To be fair, it's been less than 15 months since the latest expansion.
Just to add: They cheer because he is speaking Chinese, not because he is speaking Chinese well.They are happy that he actually tried learning their language. According to some people who were there and several Chinese friends, they couldn't understand half of what he's saying.
To be honest, that happens in most East Asian countries when a foreigner (or more specifically, a foreign-looking person) speaks the native language. I'd see this happen time and time again working at a camp in South Korea.
Yes, that stupid carriage! And cowardly Sextus stuck in the tree.. I always thought Marcus was kind of a douche.     Also, I just tried composing a response in Latin but all I could do was remember -bam -bas -bat -bamus -batis -bant...
flavia is a whore
My latin teacher always made it somehow perverted. Puella est en arbol some how was very naughty.also...that carriage being in the ditch was just great artwork...I also feel like someone at some point got crushed by a large granite block that fell off of a cart
MS needs to release the MCC on PC so we can make a mod that replaces cortana with Clippy in the games
So, third time WAS the charm !
Though, let's be real, that's not how he keeps himself rich.  He could own a ferris wheel and 25 cars and not even know it.  It's how he keeps himself HUMAN.
HOLY SHIT HOW COULD WE NOT SEE THIS?! Bill Gates ***IS*** Mr. House
"If that implies a nuclear holocaust, I'd rather not."
Can they be reprogrammed into agreeing with everything I say?
The console where you talk to him is in the penthouse, his stasis chamber is in the basement.
You took an elevator down from the penthouse to the basement. 
Hasn't happened yet... so so far so good.
In past AMA's he said he has owned every Apple product. 
If I got Bill Gates that is exactly what I would send him. Expensive joke, but worth it.
"Billionaire my *ass*, John, look at this! Bill Gates gave us $25! Did he forget some zeroes or something? Sheeeeit."
So glad he loves it!!! Great work, /u/sillygirlsarah 
you freakin' rule.
"Omg, how did my paypal information end up in there? Craziness."
It looks like you were trying to type a pithy response there. Would you like some assistance?
"I'm really enjoying this Minecraft game, I think I'll buy it.""But... don't you already have it?""You misunderstand."

No machine will ever document."Eh fuck it, the next self aware program will figure it out. Time to go look at some sweet robo porn."
Oh god, just imagine ASPCA ads of the future...
Are you telling me my man pees and poos?
Are you sweating?
Warren does not like to spend money on frivolous things. 
If I was the janitor and Billy G asked me for AoE4, I'd immediately find the nearest office, shove the person there out, and start learning to code. 
Exactly! I always thought that was so funny, I know a girl that's kind of hippy-like, and she constantly is talking about evil conservatives not believing in climate change or whatever. But then she talks about natural medicine and the horror of GMO's and vaccines. It's all quite funny to me.
Chinese guy here.His Mandarin is heavily accented, but I found it kind of endearing.
Holy shit, you just tapped into memories I thought were long gone. Like 15+ years gone. Incredible.
Dat Manlius though, love that guy. 
"Melinda, is this your ferris wheel in the foyer?""I thought it was yours, Bill.""I don't... I don't remember buying a Ferris wheel though."
Most impractical elevator ever.
I would.1: you get to see the competition's best.2: he can totally afford it.3: his company bought out apple from bankruptcy in the early 90's so that they weren't a monopoly, so they probably send them to him free anyway.Also, I'm pretty sure some early macs ran DOS.
If I got Bill Gates I would buy Google and send it to him. Expensive, but worth it. /s
Along with these adoption papers...silly me
This dumbass spent 2.5 billion on a 20 dollar game.

Also the CEO of Cyberdyne. 
or "If I document it, they'll just replace me with a newer program. So I better make it overly complex with no documentation to ensure my job security"
Then proceeds to drink it.
Amateur. I'd find someone better than me and *forcibly* make him create a new AoE.
Well, basically, being extreme left, or right draws simpletons. Intelligent people are usually somewhere in the middle.
Chinese speaker here,Yea although it isn't the best chinese (frankly pretty bad), but its the effort that makes it so great to watch as Chinese is ridiculously hard to learn.Evidence: I have learnt Chinese for 10 years, still not native level. FYI I'm also a student. 
He found it on the sidewalk, picked it up, and put it in his pocket. When he got home, he emptied his pockets. He had forgotten all about it and it was mixed in with his pocket change. It's a sad, sad state of affairs. Poor guy.
 Can i a 25 dollar Google ad that says "merry christmas bill" instead?
> He earned $11.5 billion this year which works out to be ~$33.3 million per day; $1.38 million per hour; or ~$23,148 per minute. (Dec 19, 2013)DAMN!
I can't believe they let you take it from Big Ben! 
Hey guys, I missed the last CEO meeting, what's new?-CEO of Cyberdyne
Management material
I took it for a year and a half at my university, still awful at it. Any suggestions on where I could learn it effectively outside of a class (or actually going to China)
You know a pic is old when their go-to TV show is Friends, the federal 401(k) cap is $9,500 and the top of the line car is a Mercedes Maybach 57.
Reminds me of the Chris Rock wealthy/rich bit.
Probably really inaccurate now. Jordan is a Billionaire nowadays. 
I found $2 today so there's that
In other words, in the time I've been reading this thread, he has earned more than my yearly salary.
No way! The elders of the internet would never stand for it.
That's an inconceivable amount of money.
Seriously, once you realize you'll never be able to be an expert in everything (or anything at all), you also realize you should focus more on learning how to make experts do stuff for you. Those experts very often don't know what to do with their skills anyway.
Why are there no wires? Cause it's wireless.
Hey Chris, you seem very down to earth. How has Hollywood not ruined you yet?
It can be difficult to maintain relationships with people from a previous workplace.  I'd imagine even more so for those in your industry.  What previous collaborator, if any, have you spent the most time with after wrapping?
Hey Chris, Who is your favorite actor? 
What is the most useless skill you have?
Does your son still think you're a firefighter? 
What would you be probably doing had you not become an actor?
To what extent would you consider Andy Dwyer to be based off yourself?
Are there any roles you regret taking/ not taking?
Could Johnny Karate beat Starlord in a fight?
Anna Faris from Scary Movie(s) or Anna Faris from The House Bunny?
Would you and Eminem ever do a song together?
What is your favorite song to absolutely rock-out too? Favorite song to cry to?
What can we expect in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2?
Hey Chris, big fan here!What do you miss most about working on Parks and Rec?What was the hardest part about working on Passengers?
~15 years ago you were living in your van on a beach in Hawaii, jobless, listening to Dre's 2001 everyday. Do you ever miss anything about those days? Simpler times, being able to go anywhere you want without fear of paparazzi, etc. 
If you could have played any character from a film ever, who would you pick?
You're awesome man.Got any guilt or just general thoughts for taking this sweet lead role in Passengers considering Keanu Reeves had been trying to get the script made for like 6-7 years?
Will you and your wife ever do a movie together where you're both leading? I think you're both talented and would make an exceptional screen-team!
Im a huge PJ fan and loved that andy was also, was that your idea or the writers idea? are you a big fan?
Was it difficult to control the raptors on the set of JURASSIC WORLD? Did you have any prior training in order to not get hurt by them? It must have been pretty scary. Was it scary? I bet it was. 
I'm going to make a change.org petition to make you fat again. Will you sign it?
Hey Chris! I've been a big fan of yours since Parks and Rec! Just a quick question, who did you have more fun acting as: Andy Dwyer or Peter Quill? Thanks for taking the time out to do this! 
Hi Chris! If you had to pick one of the characters from Parks and Rec to join the Guardians, who would it be? 
How did you meet Anna Farris? Do y'all have any projects planned together?
Hey Chris, you've inspired me to lose weight because funny guys can be sexy shirtless too.So my question is: how has getting into shape changed your life? Also is having maintain your physique harder than losing the weight? 
Good morning from another PNW native (Tigard, OR)! What was the most challenging aspect of working on Passengers? Also, what's your favorite thing about the PNW? Have a good one! -Alyssa
Loved parks and rec, actually know Aubrey Plaza from summer camp(she was good friends with one of my sister's)  Do you have a favorite moment of working with Aubrey?
How is Jennifer Lawrence?What's your best memory of working with your mates in your movies and tv shows?Top 5 movies and shows?You're a very lovable actor and you've lost alot of weight! I'm trying to shave weight off too because of your change in GotG! Thank you!
Since you and Jennifer Lawrence have a pretty similar sense of humour, there must've been some pretty hilarious moments on set of Passengers. What is one of the funniest (or embarrassing) moments when filming the movie?
What Marvel superhero would Jennifer Lawrence absolutely destroy in?
You ate at a restaurant in Cambridge, MA, and you were wearing a patriots jersey because you lost a bet. I was one of your servers and while running your food I don't know if I was nervous or what, but I totally let one rip right next to you. I am pretty sure you heard because you stopped what you were saying and looked me directly in my eyes.**Question**: Will you forgive me for crop dusting you?
Where did you learn that magic trick?I was expecting you to fail miserably and just want to see the hilarious scene but then......damn that was good
Who is your favorite Seahawk besides Russell Wilson? Oh and if you want to be more beloved by your home state, join Russ in supporting the return of the SuperSonics to Seattle. ;) (just a tip). 
How are your balls?
Have you ever been diagnosed with network connectivity problems?
Hi Chris! Johnny Karate vs Burt Macklin. 24 hours prep. Who wins?
Would you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses or 1 horse-sized duck?
Hi Chris. You always struck me as a huge nerd, so I'll ask this:Have you ever been interested in/auditioned for a part in Star Wars now that it's back?
never forget where you came from.

no he knows i'm an actor. But he thinks it's kind of stupid. haha! I suppose he's right!!!
If I hadn't become an actor in the way I did. (being discovered by a director, plucked from obscurity, etc) I would have continued to pursue stand up comedy. probably would have tried to become an actor that way.
Andy Dwyer is the personification of my comedic schtick. I have been making people laugh with that clown for years and years. Way before I ever did Parks and Rec. He not all of me. But I AM all of him, if that makes any sense.
No regrets. Ever. They all led me to here. 
Not alone. But with his band of child ninjas, it would be close.

Wow. that's a good question. like a kiss marry kill thing?trick question. I'd marry and kiss them all. And I did!!!

I miss the cast and crew. I miss my friends. I miss the commute. I miss the fact it was a steady gig, all comedy, and took me 7 minutes to get to work. The hardest part of working on Passengers would be the schedule. There were only two of us primarily through the whole shoot and we worked incredibly long hours. I was homesick a lot of the time. It was a grind. 
That was such an amazing time in my life. There are elements I miss. Perhaps most of all, uncertainty. 
Followup: Do you still have the van?
He wasn't jobless. He worked at Bubba Gump's in Lahaina:> It was during this time that Pratt waited tables at the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, where one day he had a conversation with actress Rae Dawn Chong that ended up changing the course of his life.He wasn't really homeless either. He chose to illegally camp so he could get by on his savings and work only 15 to 20 hours a week.PS, as a resident of Maui, please DO NOT EMULATE THIS. We have a horrible homeless problem and 20 somethings wanting to just fuck around on our beaches are part of it. 
Jim PrestonPassengersOpens December 21st!!Thanks guys thats my time.
Keanu Reeves is awesome. John Wick is the shit. He's been killing it for so long. And hes a great humanitarian. 
yes we will!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
love Pearl Jam! Growing up in Washington i have a very real connection to that music. I was at an impressionable time when it hit. So it will always have a place in my heart.
haha! Yes. It's amazing i made it out alive. The sequel shoots in a fewmonths. I already have nervous diahrea, diarreah, diarreeah, how the fuck do you spell that? anyways. Yeah. I"m probably gonna die on the sequel.
my wife would! haha!
More fun? Andy Dwyer. We got to do whole scenes, over and over. It was more stage play. Lots of improv. Guardians of the Galaxy is so fun to watch, don't get me wrong, but making it can be excruciatingly slow and painstaking. When you have so many elements working at once, you might spend all day shooting a piece of the movie that will last 10 seconds. 
Ron Swanson as an intergalactic small government bureaucrat.
They met at a Blockbuster years ago. They were both reaching for the same copy of Surf Ninjas. The rest is history
Funny guys can be sexy shirtless. But realness is more important. Exercising for health, overall physical and spiritual well being I highly recommend. Doing it to look good naked is cool, but hardly worth the sacrifice. Work on being funny before sexy. lots of women think funny is sexy anyway.
haha! That was during Everwood which we shot in Utah. I don't remember that shirt. I'm not BYU Alumni. I think that picture was taken at a fan signing event or something. That shirt must have been a gift or something. I honestly don't remember.
hello!Favorite thing about the PNW is the hard earned summers. Going to the river and floating down with some beers. I love when Mt. Rainier is out. I love the way everything and everyone slows down to feel the sun on their face when it first breaks in summer. Usually you've been through 100 days or more in a row of rain and mistiness. 
I had the best time working with Aubrey. My favorite moments with her were when she would let her guard down, (it didn't happen that often) and I got to see what a sweet and caring person she is. It's not dissimilar to the April character.
Jen is awesome. She's funny and cool. She's refreshingly tough. She's an amazing actor. It feels good to be around her. Best memory? So hard to say. I've been at this for 17 years. It's a dream job. No question. There have been so many unforgettable moments. I love what I do for a living. top 5? Also very difficult.Friday NIght lightsBreaking BadThe WireGame of Thrones Dual Survival
We were sitting in our chairs waiting for the next shot and a big set light bulb exploded nearby and she screamed. high pitched. very feminine.then she immediately looked over at me and said, "Jesus Chris! You scream like a woman! Did everyone just hear Chris?"and for the rest of the shoot i couldn't convince anyone it wasn't me. I just had to own it.: )

I've met a lot of the guys. it's hard to pick. they are an extraordinary group of gentlemen. And I suppose I am biased, being from the PNW. But that group of guys are all class. And it starts from the top down. So a lot of credit goes to Pete and Russell.
what weapons we talking? If i have a gun I'd fight the big duck. But if i didn't get weapons, and had to use my bare hands i would fight 100 horses and set myself up in a situation where i have the upper hand based on my terrain like the movie 300. whoa! movie 300 with duck sized horses! fuck yeah. 
Would you consider doing a PG Porn with James Gunn?
Blink if she's standing behind you.Haha just kidding! Can't wait to see what project you guys are working on! <3
I think Anna is one of the most talented and under appreciated actress.  She is absolutely phenomenal in May and Lost in Translation.  When will she start taking more Oscar worthy roles?
Yeah, she's awesome.  I nearly blacked out from laughing so hard during the toothpaste scene in Just Friends.
To run lines? Can someone explain this?
Who is his favorite actor? 
So you're saying if you hadn't become an actor you would be trying to become an actor?
Can you be all in me?
They all led you to reddit? Damn. You definitely made a mistake somewhere 
TIL Chris Pratt was in Zero Dark Thirty. Had no idea that was him lol.
Starlord, man... Legendary outlaw...?
Dude, you kissed your wife? That's super gay.
You're married to Anna Farris?...didn't know this. Can you ask her if her character in Lost In Translation was supposed to be based off Cameron Diaz? Apparently Sofia Coppola had beef with her. Or so the rumor goes. (I'm not actually expecting an answer.)

You are like the perfect celebrity to be a fan of.

Well Groot is smaller but cuter
Sounds like after this movie you need to take some time and focus on music. Maybe a mouse rat reunion tour? 
Was it only 7 minutes to get to work because you just had to climb out of the pit behind Ann's house?
The OC?! I forgot you were in that show.
Do you think it's hard for people to laugh at people they are threatened by? Georgle carlin, harmless old man, Dave chappell(back then) scrawny dude. Jonah hill, doughy. You, scruffy. But now? All cut and, either physically threatening, or socially intimiditating...maybe it makes people see their own weakness that they aren't the best versions of themselves, and that jacks with the comedic flow?
Which island is your favorite?
i hope to watch this movie and find out Pratt's character is not Jim Preston.
Well..he's been around for centuries now.
i'll take that as a no
Just don't pull a post 2010 Brad Pitt-Angelina jolie
Anna Faris comically a notch above. Scary movie, people think it is easy, everyone audience member knows it is a spoof, still they have to convince me that for the characters it is not a spoof. The joker in a deck of jokers.
I love PJ and grew up in Washington! Let's get beers and do bad Eddie Vedder karaoke!

"Anna Faris is a feeder" confirmed. 
oh gawd, that blooper "and i wipe, and i wipe!!!"
It has been spoken.
...who hates government. It would be perfect!
Groot would be a tasteful end table before the movie was over.
He answered the personal rather than the question about the movie he was marketing...  That's a refreshing twist from how these often go!  Thanks for your time, C-Note!
and now you lied on a public website about it. Shame!
Did you just subtly slip to all of us that you think she smells bad?
Well...shit
"I once crop dusted Chris Pratt, AMA!"
Make this movie.
This comment lost a little of its gusto after I looked up James Gunn.
Probably baby #2
They have a kid now and Pratt makes a shit ton from hisBlockbusters. Plus has a sitcom. She probably wants the stable life now
Actor lines. Helps with memory maybe?
Nick Offerman 
To be fair, I think a lot of people have chosen this as their career path. I think it would be true to say that there are more people trying to become actors then there are actors themselves.

Don't call it that.
Terry Crews is an interesting take on this, as he's so huge and physically intimidating, but most of his humor is playing in contrast to that.I get the impression that a lot of really big guys develop a sense of humor to disarm people, because it's no fun to go around every day making people uncomfortable.

House Bunny is one of my favorite guilty pleasure movies. 
She is not only a great lead, but has most of my favorite supporting roles by a comedic actress. Just Friends, Observe and Report, The Hot Chick, and so many more have me in stitches everytime I see them. I've yet to see an angle she can't act.

Long since confirmed. He's been making jokes about it since about five minutes after he stopped being fat. 
I may or may not have watched that about 87 times.
It is known.
I cut fun out of my life a while ago. When do I start losing weight?

Do you think Vin Diesel is one of those actors that refuses to break character? I just imagine him walking around set all day only saying I am groot.

Guy: "Wouldn't it be fucking *HILARIOUS* if we just kissed right now? Like, wouldn't that be funny?!"Girl: "haha"
True story, that's how I got my wife. We were out at a beach thing with two mutual friends who were always making out when we were around them. This was like our second time ever meeting. So I tell her "next time they come over here, let's just start making out and show them what it's like". Needless to say, next time they came over we totally pussed out. But later on the boat ride back to shore, we had our first kiss and have now been married 11 years!
He also has a huge penis, like mesmerizing, distract you from mumps huge.
This also sounds like something he'd say.
Been there, done that.

Hi Mr. Aldrin!What advice would you like to give to a lab full of aspiring engineers and astrophysicists?And...What is your favorite flavor of ice cream?
Col Aldrin, what went through your head when you first looked back and saw the Earth from space? 
If you had the opportunity to speak to the crew of the first manned mission to Mars prior to launch, what would you say to them?
What advice can you give to current undergrad aerospace engineering students?
How does it feel to be THE REAL buzz lightyear? Also how can I be an astronaut and go to the moon? 
You were what kids wanted to be when they grew up.What did you want to be when you were a kid?
Mr Aldrin, I am interested in what kind of music a highly distinguished astronaut such are yourself would find yourself listening to. Could you enlighten me?
Thank you for doing the AMA!Ever find time for computer games like Kerbal Space Program? I've gotten 3 kids more interested in math and science after showing it to them.Have a fantastic day!
Was it more challenging to go through the training to become an astronaut, or to actually go to space?
How do you feel about people who claim you faked the moon landing?  Can you describe how the moon felt to you?  (Was it an adrenaline rush when your feet hit the surface?  Was it soft or hard?  Could you feel temperature through the suit at all?)Funniest moment during the mission to the moon and back?
How tempting was it to lay in the moondust and make moon angels?
What is your favoirte science fiction film?
Hello Mr. Aldrin!I just wanted to ask you how was your day?And say that you are one of my heroes.Thank You!
Who's idea was it to yell at the moon in "30 Rock?" How were you approached about it?
You had a very hilarious interview in Sasha Baron Cohen's "Da Ali G Show". Looking back on it, did you get any sort of feeling that this entire persona was a put-on? You seemed to be a good sport the entire time. Few people can say that. Thanks for the AMA!
What is your absolute favorite aircraft to fly today? 
Hey Mr. Aldrin! Have you heard this joke before?"I was the second man on the moon. Neil before me."
my first time getting to any AMA that is not days old and i have no idea what to ask so i'll just ask. Have you ever eaten a burrito? Also thank you.
Will you ever forgive Ali G for calling you "Buzz Lightyear?" during an interview in 2003?
What is your favorite type of cheese?
Col. Dr. Buzz, Sir:What was the most surprising or interesting thing about walking on the moon?
Yes, they do. They recall (for me) the actual experience of myself in space - not by words, not by print, but visual reminders, it brings back a very in-depth appreciation. They can be used very well for communicating in speeches, talks, and more to other people who can actually see what i saw and what the camera saw.

Drive over to the nearest airport, and enroll in flight classes. You will experience the joy of freedom in the air above, as you study the mechanics of how this is made possible by understanding the construction, the laws of motion, the air that can provide lift when it is moved by propulsion through the air, and stay above the gravity pulling the airplane back down to earth. 
I am @theRealBuzz on Twitter!They wanted a name that is better than Lunar Larry - and it became Buzz Lightyear because they wanted it to be more genuine. So now that I have changed my name from Edwin Eugene Aldrin, Jr. to Buzz Aldrin, I'm seriously thinking of adding a middle name - so it would become Buzz "Lightyear" Aldrin.

I have inspired my own video games, 10, 20, 30 years ago, and now there is in Europe a video challenge, a video activity, entitled "Buzz Aldrin's Space Program Manager." And there game players can build their own space program from the beginning, and from where we are now on into the future, with some of the components that I believe will make great progress in our transportation systems between the Earth and the Moon and Mars in a long-standing reusable way into the future.  I'll have to check out Kerbal Space Program. 
I'd love to see a video of buzz playing KSP.
The Soviets landed 5 things on the moon including 2 very long lived rovers during the time the Apollo missions were happening. If there was ANY chance that we were faking any part of our missions, wouldn't the very top priority of the soviet missions be to discredit, disprove and utterly embarrass their cold war competition?Not that there's any reason to have to defend facts from irrational conspiracy theorists...

You hear that, /u/williamshatner !?
That's what's the most awe-inspiring to me about this whole concept: of all the six or seven billion people, only three at a time weren't on earth. Three. And it's the same with a possible mission to Mars: those people will be the *only* people (however few or many) who are *not* on earth. And as a human, being on earth is pretty much the *one* thing that is a given.

I'm definitely getting a telescope. probably going to wait a bit until hes a bit older so we can get a pretty serious one and he can really get some use out of it. Still sort of researching what to get.he already is very excited to point out the moon whenever he sees it, and i've pointed out the ISS to him when it flies overhead and he's gotten excited about that
Is he even reading the questions?

You're getting people excited about science the way Buzz got people excited about space exploration. You may not be cemented in history yet, but you're certainly making a difference :)

I don't believe it!  Beaming is always faster. ;-)

"Just between the two of us, Bill, I've gotta admit... sometimes I feel like I *didn't even need to bring* the bow and arrow!"
Right - what is he talking about?  "Because we will plan, we will construct from the moon of Mars, over a period of 6-7 years, the landing of different objects at the landing site that will be brought together to form a complete Mars habitat and laboratory, similar to what has been done at the Moon."  There is no habitat and laboratory on the Moon - though many of us think that should be the first step prior to trying to do it on Mars.  Or maybe Russia, China or the EU are planning it and we haven't heard about it?
Moon base confirmed!"to form a complete Mars habitat and laboratory, similar to what has been done at the Moon" -Buzz AldrinSeriously, though. wut?
Correct me if I am mistaken, but I think that the Apollo missions left partial laboratories and minimal supplies on the surface of the moon. I am fairly certain that the moon missions sometimes used the other landing site's gear for research rather than waste file bringing something that is already there.
poor guy must be devastated
They'll clog the instruments!
He's rambling a bit, but the answer is there:>I think that reading to children will help inspire that interest in aerospace, and many other supporting career fields. Not everyone can be an astronaut and go into space... However, stories, videos that come from the space station, and other people, are a great inspiration to young people for an exciting career field. 
He walked on the damn Moon. He can do what he wants.

I absolutely LOVE that the subtitles say "and a theif... (PUNCHED)".You go Mr. Aldrin!
How dare that scumbag call Mr. Aldrin a coward! The man isn't just a pioneer of space exploration, but a noted Air Force fighter pilot! That's courage if I've ever seen it.
Yeah, calling a man that flew and tested high performance combat aircraft and helped pioneer manned orbital spaceflight a coward isn't going to go over well, not even going into whether he walked on the moon. His testicular fortitude is *profusely* well established. I don't blame him at all for trying to avoid the troll.
If more of the asshats of the world ran into more Buzz Aldrins...we would have many less asshats. People have a tendency to run their dick traps because the fear of getting punched in the kisser is disappearing from our society.
As a staunch advocate for nonviolence, this was the best punch ever.  Sigh...I love Buzz more for this than I did before.
~~BAM~~ POW, right in the kisser.
punch him^to^the^moooooooon
Bad ass.But seriously imagine how annoying and frustrating it would be for some uneducated misinformed dickhead to constantly harass you about your involvement (and putting your life at risk) in one of the most important time in our world history. 
How expensive? :P
So you grew *more* than a beard...
*Unidan, the next ~~Hitler~~ Buzz Aldrin*
If you can get to Russia, they give 2 seater MiG 25 flights out there for a frwction of what Virgin Galactic is supposed to charge per flight. I think they get up to about 85K feet, enough to see black sky and the curvature of the Earth.
There was also the Air Force's AMU before the MMU, but Cernan was too exhausted by the time he got strapped into it to actually fly it.
The population of Earth tripled in my dad's lifetime
Actually that picture contains every human except for *two* of them. You're forgetting Micheal Collins, who was orbiting the moon in the command module. 
that was Europa, not our own moon
Imagine thousands of news anchors worldwide reading the name "Poopieheadsavant" off of cue cards and teleprompters, all trying to keep a straight face while addressing their viewers. Poopieheadsavant would be a legend. All hail Poopieheadsavant, space hero of the world.

Space Nazis.  Ive seen this terrible movie.
Perhaps he is implying that by the time we are trying to colonize Mars, there will already be a base on the moon.  I think that will have to happen in order to get the experience and knowledge needed for a Mars trip.
I love the ant dialog before Homer comes crashing into the ant farm.Protect the queen!  Which ones the queen?  I am.  No you're not, I am.Freedom! Horrible, horrible freedom!
Well anyway he tied a moon rock to his belt, which was the style at the time
Yes, thank you - he tended towards long answers, but I am not going to tell anyone to ever keep their answers short. Longer and more indepth is always better!
WALKED RIGHT ON IT'S FACE
Buzz doesn't ramble, he expands the question beyond the horizon of our imagination.  
Pretty sure he's got the orbital mechanics down... Since he helped develop some of the practices that NASA used
Oh*... at least i hope that was a typo.

According to Wikipedia, 66 combat missions in Korea, during which he shot down two enemy planes. Definitely not a man with a courage deficit.
Buzz Aldrin, ambassador of awesome!
Not quite staunch, eh?More like general.
it's POW, you idiot. 
Let him lay among the stars
Not just that, apparently the guy had tricked Aldrin into flying all the way over to the hotel. He was expecting a role in a kids TV special and was met with a bunch of conspiracy nuts.
So audio books start when?
You've gotta voice for radio and tv!  Are you a homeless black guy?

Everyone forgets Michael Collins, The lost hero of APOLLO 11 :(
Yes, but he could've been in front of the camera too, just not visible depending on where the module was at that point in time.
One day, we will be old men and women on www.reddit.mars, and asking questions on Poopieheadsavant's AMA.
Me, too!  That was my first thought before I even saw your comment!
>Space Nazis.  Ive seen this ~~terrible~~ awesome movie.FTFY
He couldn't get any of the small dark ones, on account of the war.  All they had were the big light gray ones.  
He might even be too advanced for the game, due to KSP not supporting N-body physics. Come to think of it, he'd probably be really good.
Scott Manley playing KSP with God would be pretty awesome too! Let's be honest, they're probably on a first name basis.
Let him see what death is like
Wow, just when I thought I couldn't hate that cock stain more you go and tell me that. 
Even if it wasn't justified, who in their right mind would file criminal charges against an American hero.
Nope, just a white-dude computer programmer. But back when I was paying my dues working tech support people used to occasionally tell me that on the phone, and it  kind of lodged in the back of my brain. Maybe I'll try my hand at some side work, haha...
From a quick Google search I found a price of $20,800 so if it was really what someone wanted most in life it's definitely affordable. 
And at the time, the loneliest human in existence. He was further away from the next human that anyone had ever been before. Plus, he lost radio communication for a good while, too, when he went behind the moon.
And also helped the Irish win independence.  And had a tasty drink named after him made of gin, lemon juice, sugar, and carbonated water. 
Man, that would kinda suck. Being SO close to the moon, but never stepping on it. 
Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on 'em. "Gimme five bees for a quarter," you'd say. 
I think that he would figure out that the game is using a patched conic approximation and know how to plan accordingly. It's safe to assume that Buzz is good at rocket science.
It would be the best livestream ever
If that was your life goal, I word definitely call that affordable. 20k + ~3~k to get to Russia, basically something like 25k for a one week vacation, the middle of which has you leaving earth. That's insanely cheap imo. 
It shows how remarkable the man was that after being assassinated in 1922, he was able to become an astronaut and fly to the Moon 47 years later.Not a bad achievement for a 78 year old dead man.
Maybe we should just change the WWW to MWW.
Is he good at rocket surgery though?
Buzz Aldrin vs Scott Manley

Buzz Aldrin already knows he needs to add more struts. 
Please, O Lords of Kerbal, please make this happen!
The airline is dumb for letting the people on the flight before they had this figured out. It would have been a lot easier to just not let 4 people on as opposed to having to take 4 people off 
I doubt anyone but his lawyer will be getting those answers 
I think he's a little busy talking with lawyers. 
Another point:  The Passenger Bill of Rights does entitle compensation to the bumped passenger.  I've been bumped twice.  The first time, I was randomly bumped and took a hotel and 350.  The second time I responded to the request with "two grand and a limo to the hotel" which started a bidding war on the plane.I took 850 and a Marriott. 
Time was, when you got bumped, you got a free first-class ticket voucher anywhere you wanted to go in the US.  And a hotel room.  And meal vouchers for your stay.  And put on the next flight.I miss the 90s.
United's about to make that guy a millionaire several times over.
It seems odd to randomly select 4 people to be kicked off. What if you were traveling with your children and your child was picked to be taken off? It seems like this guy's wife or someone related to him ran after him when he was being dragged. 
Let's not turn this man into an Internet celebrity and start digging up shit in his past and fucking up his future. 
"I have to go home." 
I know its standard policy to oversell, but I don't think overselling was the problem here. The issue is that none of the passengers would take the $800 bribe so United decided that $800 was their maximum and decided to resort to excessive force to remove passengers. Solution? Shoulda offered 2 grand, 3 grand, 4 thousand bucks. I bet someone would have taken that deal in a heartbeat. The deep shit that United is now in and the major PR hit they are taking is going to cost them a hell of a lot more than a few thousand dollars. 
$800 isnt enough to get me off the plane if I need to be somewhere. Hope this man gets a large sum of money for their BS
OMG. I just saw the video and cannot believe that happened. I hope the lawsuit gets televised.
I think the real question is, why did they even let people on the plane if it was overbooked?
Good job staying on top of this karma ~~train~~ plane. 
I just was able to get a full refund from my united flight (they had a schedule change). Not going to give this company my money!
What's a realistic estimate for what he'll be paid for this? 
The dude reminds me of my dad in his younger days.Anyone know if the dude is korean or something?
If you made it clear that you were a doctor, who had patients that needed to be see. Do flights get overbooked sometimes? YesShould the police drag someone out who didnt "volunteer" to leave. No I'm just baffled, nobody was willing to stop what was going on. By giving up their seat, so you could get back home. Did anyone offer to give up their seat, while this was happening? 
#FUCK UNITED AIRLINES
What's this shit with over booking? I've flown across Europe hundreds of times and never have had any issues...United Airlines should take Turkish airlines as an example as they rock for God's sake, Best treatment and food I've ever had...(If you're ever flying with Turkish airlines, take chicken if you have the choice, if not, just take anything as it's soo damn tasty) 
They should have realized they were going to be overbooked once the initial check-in closed and by the time everyone got to the gate they could have made an announcement. I feel like people would have been more likely to volunteer to be bumped at the gate rather than when they're already settled into their seats on the plane.
AMA Request Someone to Discuss Their Legal Case.Good luck with that.
yeah. Ask Me Anything isn't meant to be an interrogative interview. AMAs are chill hangouts and I find this to be a little inappropriate if not subtracting from how serious this is. 
Came here to say he should avoid the public eye and social media in particular until his case against them is over.
But what about the great reddit lawyers. They can surely help. They always seem to know what they're talking about
Wait, wtf? Lol. How did the bidding progress? 
All beatings will be applied politely
It really depends how it comes out. The people who physically man-handled him were law enforcement and not United employees. So if anything he can charge them, but we all know how law enforcement seems to take a slap on the hand for most incidents. I'd be interested to see how his lawyers word it specifically to go after both of them. 
Interesting part is that, he will probably still stay working as a doctor if there is no permanent damage and he gets a settlement.  He seems to care about his patients.  
Generally speaking it is not purely random.If he was traveling with family they wouldn't keep the family on the plane and drag him off.If he had top tier status, they wouldn't have dragged him off either.If he bought the cheapest ticket, had no status, had other flights to choose from - then it would put him more into the "person to be taken off the plane" category.
Generally they do it by whoever has the cheapest ticket or whoever checked in last.
Inb4 the Daily Mail reports that he was arrested twice for money laundering and secretly owns an international prostitution ring.
Doctor shockingly loses 3 lbs of body fat while playing possum with and getting beaten by United Airline Security 
He's kept anonymous so far. Wise guy 
"Yeah.. but where are you like really from?"
Hate to go against the circlejerk on this one, but that tweet is about a lack of airport seating. United has no control over that.
Is it $800 plus they book you on a different flight free of charge? If not, not worth it. 
I was just thinking the opposite. There's nowhere I'd need to be that couldn't wait for $800. But then again, I'm poor and have no life. 
I'd like to announce that I'm officially boycotting United. Granted, I had no plans to book a flight in the near future and probably couldn't afford it to begin with, but by god I'm boycotting those sons of bitches.
Cashing in on that delicious, collective rage
'Buy an airline, probably United'
Probably very little or nothing -airline pilot 
Can confirm. Dude is definitely something.
I think it was one part the bystander effect and second, the fact that people thought that if they intervened, they would probably be thrown off for intervening, which is a more reasonable scenario that *shitty airline lottery winner*.
Because you will probably get arrested for interfering with police duty.
In that situation in should become first come first serve. If you overbooked and no one is willing to get bumped for the money, than too bad for whoever was the last person to walk into the plane.
It's not really something that happens in Europe, this is the first time ive really heard about something like this actually happening and I've flew over Europe a lot. 
It looks like it was announced at the gate but no one wanted to give up their spot. I'm amazed they even boarded the plane without figuring out the situation beforehand.
Sounds to me like the Revenue passengers DID make on the flight. It was at the end that they realized some employees (no doubt pilots and FAs) needed to "deadhead" to make their flights.To be clear, I used to work for UAL and frequently flew Non-Rev.What happened here was a clusterphk of epic proportions. In short - this should have been handled BEFORE boarding revenue passengers. Some gate agents in a heap of trouble. 
Can you imagine being the UA employee that took his seat? Awwwkwaaaard...
I think the crazy weather delays across the Midwest lately was a major contributing factor to this perfect storm.Typically when airlines offer hundreds of dollars for rebooking people would line up to take it. This time around all the passengers were probably sick of waiting around and just didn't want to take any chances. Unless the airline really bumps up the offer, like the one passenger suggested, to 1500. 
That's so fucked. 
I'm sure getting the United crew to the right plane takes precedence over a doctor needing to see his patients
United PR is like "$400...? $800...? Ok, ok...$1500...? Oh, you want something in the millions..?"
On the upside, United Airlines will now be charging its customers for the air that you breath in both the plane and the airport.  Each passenger will wear a monitor and will be charged on a per breath basis.  At present no charge will be incurred for excessively deep breathing
lost it at "lottery winner"
Jokes on him, he won't get free health care if he's a lottery winner!
Dignity is priceless. He deserves everything they'll give him and more.
I'm not positive here but I believe his suit would have to be against whomever employs those officers. Now whether they're state or federally employed I'm not sure but they don't look like united security employees to me.
No, AMAs are generally an ad. 
He's currently the most likely person on Earth to become the next Supervillain.
Better call Saul!
On some level, if this had to happen, at least it happened to a person with money and extra legal protections/expectations that come with his profession. Congrats United, you just physically assaulted a male doctor. I'm sure that's going to work out great for you.
No. He should be all over Facebook, Twitter, etc. but in a way as directed by his attorneys. The more public it is the more United is going to suffer.
Pilot came out from the cockpit, donned his cowboy hat, and started the bidding:Hominy-5-5-do-I-hear-5-5-and-I-have-5-hubbaduh-5-5-now-do-I-hear-550-fi-fi-550-thank-you-sir-fi-fi-can-I-hear-6-6-hominy-6-6-who-wants-it-6-6-and-a-Holiday-Inn-Expressand so on.
That guys story is worth negative tens of millions of dollars, at least, to united. They don't need to pay him not to sue, they need to pay him not to go on a tour of late night shows telling his story. 
Actually, because United was directing LEO, the doctor has some good claims against both. I'd start with false imprisonment, which can go to United and the officers. 
The next time he's running behind schedule his patients better remember that time he got his ass whooped trying to get back to them.
Citing this as their source.
South Carolina
$800 and a hotel.I'm going to start booking flights after I've asked if they're full. I want a sweet hotel stay and extra cash.
In other news united flights are still going out full 
"Fire the dick that smashed my face in"
Exactly. I like to think I would say something but I would be terrified of being treated the same! No one truly knows what they would do until in that situation. 
Once the police are involved, stay the hell out of it.  Take videos, make complaints, but do it all after the fact.Same goes for your own interactions with police.  When the cop is about to beat your ass, you shouldn't start screaming that you know your rights.  Save that for after the beating ends or else the beating may not end as soon as you would like.
They should have played music and make the people dance until the music suddenly stops. Everyone quickly must take a seat and whoever doesn't have a seat loses and must get off the plane.
> Some gate agents in a heap of trouble.I think it's going to be more than some gate agents. I imagine heads will roll. Certainly that security guard had no reason to slam a man's face who was peacefully resisting. This doctor is going to get a multi-million dollar payout. Personally, I'd also demand the resignation of the guy who hit me, of his supervisor, the gate staff, and their supervisor. There must have been a dozen people who royally screwed up here. Then doubly, I'd demand compensation for everyone on the airplane who had to witness it, to cover their emotional distress. 
I'm guessing he kept his seat fully upright and did not try to establish armrest dominance over his neighbor.
Can you imagine if there was a medical emergency and someone asked is there a doctor on board.Well... There was....
I read somewhere that it was not an enjoyable flight for them
The biggest contributing factor is selling more seats than the plane has. 
Agreed. My friend got stuck in the Detroit airport for 24 hours this weekend because of weather delays (Delta!).
Overbooking has always been a scumbag airline practice. Imagine if a restaurant intentionally sold more than they had available and then just told people "too bad, no meal for awhile". It should frankly be illegal.
Well to be fair you don't know how many doctors are on the plane the United crew needed to get to.Not that there aren't better ways to resolve this.
Best I can do is a voucher with a 1 year expiry and black outs.
...Chapter 11 to pay off this bitch.
You're underestimating the PR value of this guy being bound to confidentiality and non-disparagement as part of the settlement. Right now he could cause millions in damage to United's brand by going on every big news program in the country and having that video played repeatedly, then going on a Delta commercial as their new customer experience advisor. (Look what Sprint did with the Verizon guy)
>In the video it's pretty obvious he's suffering from some manner of post-concussive syndrome. He's disoriented and repeating himself.*Excuse me, is there a doctor on the plane?*
Gotta respect that legal disclaimer at the end of your comment.
So in other words, he should start forgetting things immediately.
Everyone reading this announcement has been charged an announcement fee.
That's sad. I hope you find it again. Good luck god bless 
Well played!
Not to mention the appointments he possibly had to cancel. Doctors' time is valuable as shit. As shit as in modifying the intensity of the value very upward. Not literal shit. And literal meaning actually literally, not figuratively literally as is colloquially common. 
You're allowed to sue more than one person for an incident. They're all going to be in the list of defendants.
Lol I will never forget the day reddit took a huge shit on Hillary Duff?
I think that title is still held by Elon musk. Not only able to become a supervillan, but probably the greatest one of all time if he switched to be evil...
I think he was asian.. 
It is sad that you have to have money to win in court against a big company.  Also, I think he may be asian?
It should be going down, since the bidders are receiving
I can imagine him never letting it down."Samantha, you're 5 minutes late.""Doc, I'm really sorry, there was this traff-""You know Samantha, I was beaten off a plane and still made it on time"
"Yeah... but like where are your parents from?"
That $800 tends to be an $800 voucher for another flight, not cash. As someone who's had to take that before, it's not actually worth it. 
Yeah, good point. No one knows what they would do until they are there. I would also like to think that I would have given up my seat. Depends on why you were flying too. Depends on so many things!
In other words, kill em in court.
The guys a cop so he'll probably get paid leave while under investigation then he'll get fired (transferred to another police department); case closed.
Alternately, he could have reclined and armrest dominated all he wanted because no one would mess with him after seeing what happened to the last guy who tried that...
Bullshit. That employee told the person next to them to give up the armrest or they were "next".
And there was a medical emergency on board...
*curb your enthusiasm theme plays*
What happened?
Actually, it is fine that the airline sells more seats than the plane has, as long as they are willing to buy back the seats at their established value when the rubber meets the road.The problem here was that the airline was unwilling to buy the seat back for what it was worth.  If the airline continues to increase the reward from $800, eventually someone will volunteer.
You over sell by around 10 average. Passengers miss their flights all the time so they learned to double dip the seat. Granted the missed passengers just get rebooked to the next flight. Rarely around holidays it backs up so bad that flights can get up to 15 paying standby passengers who missed their last flights. So no seats were available throughout the whole day and more. That's when it gets bad. Wife works for delta. I was trying to fly standby on Presidents day weekend to Atlanta and man. They ended up asking for volunteers all day, but the payout was $2,000 at some flights. 
Except they didn't sell more seats than the plane has. One of United's fee for departure carriers added a deadheading crew last minute to go pick up another United branded flight that was going to cancel. Working employees always have the highest boarding priority. The only outlier in this whole process was the single plain cloths cop that got physical removing the passenger. The rest of this process happens literally every single day.
I'm ok with the practice - better to oversell and make use of the no-show seats than to sell exact inventory and fly around empty chairs.  But if that is going to be the yield optimization strategy, they need to manage demand by buying back inventory to meet the surplus demand.  In the same way that we have to pay outrageous prices when demand is high, they should have to pay outrageous prices when they need a seat back.  They should keep sweetening the pot until someone voluntarily takes the offer.  Then you have no problem at all and everyone who wants to travel gets to travel.
This does happen in restaurants though.
It's a 4 and a half hour drive.  Put the employees in a car.  Would have been cheaper and faster.
Except it wasn't United employees that confronted the man, it was Chicago law enforcement.
"Hi you might recognize me as the guy beaten unconscious on a United Airlines Flight because I refused to give up my seat when I was already on the plane when they overbooked. I'm here to tell you That Delta Airlines will never, ever, ever, ever, EVER assault you for them overbooking their own flights. Have a nice flight with Delta!"
That's where I think the manager should be fired. He should have realized physically taking people off of a plane is not worth it. They could have given $10,000 and it would have still been cheaper than having this happen. 
There was but we just beat him up....
Haha, fuck you I can't read
Everyone reading the announcement fee announcement has also been charged.
Do we know if he is Dr as in MD or one of the other Doctors that can't help you medically?
Can we please just talk about Rampart?!?
Didn't Google remove their "do no evil" from their code of conduct?
I think "evil" is part of the supervillain part..
The important part here is money and not black. United is going to get fucked harder than a cheap whore. 
Yeah, I realized that after typing it but don't feel like fixing it.
Jesus christ, "beaten off a plane" conjured up all sorts of mental images at first until I realized what you were actually saying. 
Depends on the airline and which city the flight is departing from. Delta gives out $800 Amex gift cards as a starting offer from JFK and LAX. 
If were sitting next to the guy who bumped off the doctor I would get a double clamato and accidently spill it on him right at belly button height so it ruins both shirt, pants, plus he gets to sit there with a damp crotch for the flight.I would be sure to note that the airline must have overfilled the drink, and apologize for the "overfilling situation".
Another article I read said people were saying stuff to them like "You should be ashamed to work for this company". Probably nothing too crazy but that's pretty awkward when you can't just walk away.
There's an "add injury to insult" joke in there somewhere but I can't manage to shake it out.
*"Sorry sir, it is your fault we overbooked and nobody took our generous offer of a turkey club sandwich. However if you don't get off the plane we're going to go Malxon X on you"*.No, the guy above is right. If you build your empire upon overbooking, you can't blame a customer when everyone shows up. Even worse, its for people on standby. United is run by an imbecile and someone is going to get fired for 'following orders'.
>So you have a choice - overbook by that percentage, or just let it happen and potentially not make money on those spots.Not sure how things work outside my apparently small bubble, but when I worked at two different hotels, we charged no-shows. Win-win: The person that booked the room got in even if it was late. The hotel hosting the booking got paid even if they didn't show up.
"I'm sorry United. This seat is now worth 10,000$ on the open market."
Uh ...which airport is that from? I might want to uh purchase a seat or two. And what would be the busiest flight of the day to start with?
It shouldn't be allowed for any airline. 
It still shouldn't be allowed. 
Yeah. United needs a lesson on how the Free Market works. Sounds like they had a plane load of people where all of those people thought their seats were worth at least $800. And they need to start dealing in REAL MONEY. Not this credit BS. What if I can't fly in the next year??It's exactly what the airlines do to us when we need a seat at the last minute. OH! you need to get to your destination with 6 hours notice? That'll be an extra $800, thanks! Except now they want to do it to us at literally the last second and also want to be stingy about it. 
Haha that was like, the worst example possible. "Ummm they do that in real life... and you can just go to another restaurant instead."
Or, they're at a major airport in a major city.  Book a charter flight.
my exact thought
Stuff like this is usually in their union contract. They may not be allowed to do this.It also could've been a legal rest issue. The law requires minimum rest time for flight crew.It also could've been that they needed them on a plane a lot faster than 4.5 hours. Is it better to bump 4 people or make 200 different people wait 4 hours for a crew to show up to fly them?
You joke about it, but that would be a fantastic use of Delta's marketing dollars. 
Apparently United breaks doctors too.
Just charged you a fee for reading your comment.
Anyone seeing these announcements has been charged.
Fuck, I can't afford anymore Reddit today.
Let's keep this about Rampart people.
Whoa, first I've heard of that... What a bummer
I think they were saying Elon is currently about Chaotic Good, maybe leaning towards Neutral Good. Man if he switched to Evil he'd be Lex Luthor. 
No the important thing is huge publicity and a major multinational company. This means any of you tier 1 law firms will take this case on contingency. 
"Oh no!!!  It's so damp you may get rheumatism!!!  Please help!!! Anyone!! Is there a doctor on board!?!?!??!"
*username checks out*I have a feeling you've done this before. 
...which is unfortunate, because the pilot/crew that had to bump these people from their flights are probably filling in for United's screw up or because FAA crew rest regulations or illness or because they literally have to for some other reason. Not because they just want to go to Louisville. 
My thoughts exactly, they probably had a strict limit on voluntary/involuntary compensation, heaven forbid they lose the cost of a seat or two. I bet they respond with "It's not consistent with our policy and the employee handling the incident has been terminated." When in reality, they were following SOP.
IMO it simply should be considered breach of contract. It's the airline's own misdoings that cause it. 
The state of airline transportation in America is despicable, between 9/11, crazy lobbying laws and corporate executive pay gap/profit misappropriation the airline industry has been the epitome of regulation failure... and there's nothing we can do about it. 
To be true to practice don't even refund their money.    You give them a voucher good for one year that they can use to purchase another item, it may or may not be available as well.
I respect that you're sticking to your guns on this one, partly because you're simply right, and no considerations thus far have refuted your point whatsoever. 
If they really wanted to up their game they'd treat is as an auction. Get people excited about the possibility. I imagine doing it in an energetic forthcoming way would built excitement, rather than resentment.
If I worked for a rival airline's marketing department I would be trying to buy the rights to the video of the incident and getting the guy to be our new spokesperson while showing the video in the background of them dragging his body off the plane. The man is a doctor and that kind of money could expand his practice and let him help more people. At the very least it should pay off his med school debt.
What stock are you looking at? UAL is up 1.5% today.
That's incorrect according to Wikipedia"In fact, UAL opened at $3.31 on 6 July 2009, dipped to an intra-day low $3.07 (-7.25%) on 10 July 2009 but traded as high as $6.00 (+81.27%) four weeks later on 6 August 2009"
and a paid vacation that the destination will be somewhere that the officers fly to on united
I know, but I wouldn't be a Redditor if I wasnt picking on someone for some minor point that has no real significance. 
I am aggressively passive-aggressive.
Then send those employees on another flight, on another airline. For 4 employees they were willing to pay $800 each to bump. For that $3200, they could have hired a private charter plane.
The problem is that the strategy of overbooking and then compensating people that get bumped have to go hand in hand. You can't just do the overbooking and then cheap out on the compensation. If you're unwilling to pay enough to get people to voluntarily give up the flight they bought, then maybe overbooking that much isn't actually a good decision.It's like mining companies that want to use cheaper, sloppier mining practices and then not pay for the cleanup. It's a package decision, you can't be allowed to just take money by screwing everyone else over. 
Well now it's also assault and battery. Yeah. United, good luck with that.
No, all of the arguments against it are essentially: but it's difficult for the airline!
He is 69, hopefully his med school debt was paid off years ago.
Amazingly, it started the day off about .75 but rebounded... what the fuck is the market thinking? that this is the start of something good for united?  "The beatings will continue until passenger morale improves" sounds like an awesome long term strategy
Goddamnit. I want to cancel my account but there's a fee for that, too!
but what happens if that flight is overbooked?
So basically be evil but within the confines of the law
I used to be so pro Google, the last five to ten years they just keep letting me down over and over, harder and harder. Power corrupts, sometimes it takes longer, but it seems God damned consistent.
Passive-aggressiveness is truly an art form.
What if he than got air sick on you. Now you have an assholes vomit all over you. Wars can be dangerous things. Be sure you know your end game and where you are willing to go before you start one. Its what I would do anyway. 
It's not real money it's airline vouchers.
You can literally optimize this and know exactly what your max payout can be versus the (potential) cost
They should have bumped it and tried at $1200 then.
No man that's covered under the section 2.3 "any passanger can be beaten til unconscious by up to 4 police officers at at the will of any united airline managment with out repercussion" 
They could've sent their employees on a competitor's flight last minute (assuming that was even an option with the blizzard) or dramatically upped the cash incentive for giving up your seat for less than the cost of this blow up. 
Knowing how they used to do things, he probably paid that off by the time he was 30.
Maybe the effects haven't really hit yet. Maybe once there's a big legal case, or a more widespread social media effect?
*Ahem* Lawful Evil. 
What's your fondest memory at Harvard?
Some people (Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking, etc) have come out in favor of regulating Artificial Intelligence before it is too late. What is your stance on the issue, and do you think humanity will ever reach a point where we won't be able to control our own artificially intelligent designs?
Hello Mr. Gates,I know you love to read, carry a lot of books around and learned how to speed-read, is there some technique you use to make this easier?More generally, how do you "attack" a book you're interested in? 
What's a technological advancement that's come about in the past few years that you think we were actually better off without?
Mr. Gates! How soon do you think quantum computing will catch on, and what do you think about the future of cryptography if it does? Thanks!
Sql server on Linux was announced yesterday as I'm sure you are aware.What do you think this means or says about the company's direction, culture and future?
Hey Bill! Has there been a problem or challenge that's made you, as a billionaire, feel completely powerless? Did you manage to overcome it, and if so, how?Now for a less serious question: sushi or thai food?Thanks for doing this AMA!
Any plans to retire and enjoy a quieter life? It strikes me that you must be sacrificing a lot to remain so active on these projects.
What's your personal computer specs?
What's your fastest time in expert minesweeper without editing the .ini file?
What do you think will be the next biggest advancement in technology in the next 20 years?
I'm about to graduate high school, do you have any life tips that I should know about moving forward in my life?
Bill,  why aren't you running for president? 
Mr. Gates, do you use Bing?
What are your thoughts on the many politicians that completely disregard climate change? 
What was the most useful thing you ever learned?
Hi, Mr Gates! Big fan of your work. For someone that's currently 17 years old, what can I do to help or improve the world either now or in the future?Also, if you could give 17 year old Bill some advice, what would it be?
Afternoon Mr. Gates, I was curious about your thoughts on VR. We've all seen the great strides in AR made by the Hololens but nothing on VR from you guys at this time. Does that market interest you?
Would you consider marrying Melinda to be one of the top three decisions of your life?Because I do!  :)
Bill, in an interview with Playboy in 1994 you claimed to have used LSD when you were younger.Right now, LSD is being investigated more and more closely as a therapeutic tool for various conditions and situations (ranging from autism, to alcoholism to fear of dying), but also as a creativity enhancer (as attested by its documented use in the form of microdoses in Silicon Valley). Do you feel your LSD experiences contributed anything to what you have achieved and invented?If so, could you share some of the most relevant elements?
I think people's spending instincts are set when they are in high school. I don't like spending a lot of money on clothes or jewelry (for me - I do like to buy nice things for my wife).
I decided that I would be different and never attend any class I was signed up for but always attend a class I wasn't signed up for. This worked out in a funny way when the final exam for a Combinatorics class (which I signed up for) was given at the same table as my Brain studies class (which I attended and did not sign up for). My friends from Brain studies thought it was very strange that I sat on the wrong side of the table and took the Combinatorics exam even when I was the most vocal student in the Brain class.
I haven't seen any concrete proposal on how you would do the regulation. I think it is worth discussing because I share the view of Musk and Hawking that when a few people control a platform with extreme intelligence it creates dangers in terms of power and eventually control.
It is worth learning how to read a bit faster. I am not sure what the best course for that is nowadays. I had a friend who took Evelyn Wood and told me what they said.I have a rule that I always finish a book once I start it. This might now work for everyone. I only read 2 books at a time - in fact usually just one unless one of them is so complex I need to mix things up. I read a lot at night and my biggest problem is that I stay up to late and regret it the next day when I haven't had as much sleep as I would like.
I am concerned about biological tools that could be used by a bioterrorist. However the same tools can be used for good things as well.Some people think Hoverboards were bad because they caught on fire. I never got to try one.
As a tagalong question: what's a fantasy technological advancement you wish existed?
Your question got straight up hi-jacked.
I think it shows Satya looking at how the market is changing and being willing to change how things have been done. His embrace of the cloud and mobile including doing software on other people's mobile platforms are also great examples of that.
The problem of how we prevent a small group of terrorists using nuclear or biological means to kill millions is something I worry about. If Government does their best work they have a good chance of detecting it and stopping it but I don't think it is getting enough attention and I know I can't solve it.I love both sushi and thai food. Since I like them better than my family does I have them for lunch a lot.
I love my work. I love meeting the scientists and field workers. I have the flexibility to work less if I wanted to and I do take vacations now. When I was in my 20's I didn't believe in vacation so I have mellowed. I feel super lucky that I can be involved in the Foundation work with Melinda for another 30 years assuming my health holds up.
I just recently switched to the Surface Book. I only detach the screen a few times a week and I like the keyboard better than my previous Surface.
Since our Foundation can basically save a life for every $1,000 we spend I would pick it up since that would be enough to save 40 lives which is a big deal.
He doesn't stop making money while picking up that money... 
Tagging on to this.Mr. Gates,Your foundation funded my high school, Utah County Academy of Science. I was able to get an AS through concurrent enrollment with a nearby university. I got my AS in 18 months, which set my career ahead by 5-6 years by my estimation. I now work in the STEM field and completed my 4-year degree with no debt and I owe it to your charitable work.Thank you, and thank you for starting the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
I think the value of getting a great education - that is going to college - is easy to underestimate. The most interesting jobs require a college education. The STEM related jobs are probably the most interesting although they are not for everyone. The value of staying curious - reading a lot and learning new things even after college is also underestimated.
I like my current job at the Foundation better than I would being President. Also I wouldn't be good at doing what you need to do to get elected. I thought Michael Bloomberg was thoughtful about why it didn't make sense for him to try and run even though he is a great executive.
I'd guess he has more power and less stress doing what he already does. 
Or Warren. Tell your ol' pal Mr Buffet to run. 
Pirates of Silicon Valley was a reasonable recapitulation of the early days of the PC industry.I don't jump chairs at all now. Maybe I should since when I go snow skiing with my kids I need more exercise so I don't get tired by the end of the day.I use the latest version of Windows - always updated Windows 10.
His silence means no.
He has answered this in previous AMAs. He says he loves it.

To read? To type? To think before speaking? 
I'm gonna take a wild guess and say it was probably programming.
Document your source code.
VR is the extreme case of AR when nothing from the real world gets mixed in. It can be tricky if you are walking around that you might run into things. Mixed systems which seems like VR but when you might hit something it shows you that seem better than pure VR. So I don't think these two things will stay as separate as they are now.
You are correct! I would put it at the top. Deciding to work on software was a good decision but that just crept up on me rather than being some choice.
I will look into this. How many empires do you need?
I second this request.
Come on Reddit! We can make this the top question!
Yea and not something like AOE 3. But more of AOE 2 concept.
You got your wish though!Microsoft actually supports a lot of local programs to get kids engaged in programming and thinking about computers. There's a program called "Hunt the Wumpus" aimed at high school students that teaches program design, problem solving, etc. They also have a high school internship program they offer to students within driving distance of their Redmond campus.There's probably more examples, but those are just the ones I'm familiar with that Microsoft is doing now.
At least we know he'll never have to buy reddit gold for himself!
Who the fuck give gold to Bill Gates?
Mosquitoes... PLEASE! make them go away.
How did this even work? You passed the classes you didn't attend?
What are your current 2 books?
Those things are so hot right now.
Follow up question: do you think calling them Hoverboards should be outlawed until they actually hover?
I recently saw a company working on "robotic" surgery where the ability to work at small scales was stunning. The idea that this will make surgeries higher quality, faster and less expensive is pretty exciting. It will probably take a decade before this gets mainstream - to date it has mostly been used for prostate surgery.In the Foundation work there are a lot of tools we are working on we don't have yet. For example an implant to protect a woman from getting HIV because it releases a protective drug. 
Embrace the cloud! Be as one with the cloud!All hail the glow cloud! All hail! All hail!
>A lot of the issue is helping kids stay engaged. If they don't feel the material is relevant or they don't have a sense of their own ability they can check out too easily. The technology has not done enough to help with this yet.I think this is key, if education doesn't interest students then they will lack the motivation to learn from it. In the early grades curriculum puts an emphasis on getting the kids involved, but this really dies down as the kids get older.
I'm a PhD student at UC Berkeley working on optimal ways to employ mobile units for nuclear threat detection but it's hard to get funding in this area and I might have to move to a different project with more fundings soon. Have you thought about including grants for this type of project in your Foundation? 
> When I was in my 20's I didn't believe in vacationThe entirety of reddit just gasped.
Cool I have the same computer as the riches man in the world.
/r/pcmasterrace Is dissapointed
He is not made of money, last gen i5 will serve just as well.
math checks out
$1K = 1 life saved? Astounding that more people aren't jumping on board with efforts like this. Thanks for all you do, sir!
Whenever I hear phrases like "save a life" I wonder how they come up with that figure. What does $1k do exactly? How long would it be able to keep someone alive? At what point do you consider someone's life "saved?"I also want to thank you for all the work you do! If only we had more people like you!
I like how it's not about wealth for you anymore. It's about saving lives. Great answer!
*Stay Hungry, Stay Curious* - Bill Gates

I think a lot people need to realize how restrictive being president is. You are tied down by congress, approval ratings along with a bunch of other factors.
Ah, the (Cartoon) Lex Luthor answer.    Edited for clarification of comic book universes.
Warren also loves his current job too much to give it up!
> I use the latest version of Windows - always updated Windows 10.Nice try Bill Gates.Wait a second...
Did you install Windows 10 on purpose or did it sneak it's way in like on everyone else's?
> To think before speaking?I wish more people did this. Myself included. It's just too easy (and common) to act off the cuff before fully processing. Great skill to acquire.
Programming does help you think logically. I was obsessed with programming from age 14 to 19 and that is a good time to keep trying to improve.
so what would you do if you were apple?
This is the answer to the first question, right?
Who the hell is giving Bill Gates gold?
Agreed we need a new Age of Empires!
I think you did - sorry I can't deliver an Empire (or an Age) easily.
I read the website, but how is it different than AOE2 HD version?
It's true that we have devices very similar to what I described in my essay (can I get a prior-art patent on Google Glass?), but it's not quite there yet!
He's secretly buying himself gold to tuck with you guys.
Somebody who can brag about giving one of richest person in the world money
I studied super hard during reading period and almost always got A's. The big exception was organic chemistry where the promised video tapes of the lectures sometimes had no sound or no video - that spooked me and I ended up getting a C+ in the course!
That latter downside is something I'd never thought of. Interesting!  Still, I think it's unlikely that raw processing power will remain the stumbling block for AI for all that long anyway.
He usually reviews them on gatesnotes.com

When you ask such an absolute question: "Will *ALL* storage and computation be online?" it is easy to answer "no".  Cloud storage is inherently less secure and less reliable. There will always be offline storage for these reasons. How much storage is the question...   Also local computation will always be necessary. There is no reason to ask the quantum supercomputer at the center of the earth to calculate your restaurant tip, your phone can do that faster and more efficiently. 
As a student in high school, I can confirm. If I feel that my class teaches me material either not interesting or not useful to my future, chances are I won't put my best effort into my work. I'll just want to get it done, forget about really truly learning it. I get good grades, but that high 90-100 stuff comes from things I like and think are more important.Except for French 3. Love that class, but I just can't get that grade above an 80. Aggh. 
True PhD student begging for grant money right here.I've been there, but as an undergrad working on a Surgeon's prototype device.
it's almost like you have to work your ass off to be hugely successful
Cool I have a *better* computer than the richest man in the world. 
> He is ~~not made of~~ money
This is exactly why you do the 50/50s as soon as you find them, so you don't waste your time if you guess wrong at the very end. 
Maybe he meant 10 minutes.
shouldn't that be much much faster?
Yeah, that's actually amazing to hear. I kind of glossed over that reading it the first time. I'd like to know more about what exactly that means, and if it's as good as it sounds.
I'd love, just once, for one of the robots to kick the guy back.
No worries, my college loans keep me hungry.
Whichever one makes sexbots first.
There's a lot more to being president than just running the US, which is why the people who would be the best at running the country aren't always elected.
but lex was president......
It's funny to hear billionaires talking about each other like pals. 
My computer did that last night while I was sleeping. I feel violated.
Not dick riding or anything, but it's something I've come to respect about Obama. He isn't afraid to pause and really think about what he's going to say.
So that's why I'm so good at masturbating
Maybe they could propose an overall plan for striking the balance between government being able to know things in some cases and having safeguards to make sure those powers are confined to appropriate cases. There is no avoiding this debate and they could contribute to how the balance should be struck.
Except the Vista version.
omg i have never seen this o.O
Well V is Halo Wars, also by Ensemble.

It's a direct port (with no networking) that only runs on linux (afaik) vs an HD remake that does have networking and runs on windows.
In that case, tuck Bill Gates! Tuck him, man.
But the internet told me you were a high school dropout who smoked weed and made mixtapes.
I think it would still be something worth taking into account. It is hard to tell how long takeoff will take (it could be anything between minutes and centuries). It should better be as slow as possible.
I finished Reddit when it was called Digg. I won't spoil it, but the ending is very disappointing.
Finally, clean arteries without all that pesky eating well and exercising nonsense. 
NANOMACHINES, SON
A billionaire expressed concern about a topic he/she is directly involved in... It would be foolish not to take a shot!
Careful, I'm sure Bill also has a better computer than a Surface Book at his disposal. I made an inclusive statement. ;)
I don't think it's any coincidence we call them dollar Bills.
A lot of people think that things that aren't 50/50s are though, and they basically pick random tiles with that mindset and lose 90% of their games.
Unlikely, as a 600 second score on expert is pretty bad, especially considering he managed a sub 10 second on beginner.Source: Played a lot of minesweeper. Fastest on beginner was ~10, intermediate ~45 seconds,  expert ~120.
It would have been a lot faster had he disabled the prints.
That comma's gonna cost you about $3.5k extra
Neat. Mine keep me curious! As in, why the fuck did I do that? 
Ha, yeah! They think they're people!
Mind trip - you told the richest man on earth about your masturbation habits, and he probably read it.
The only real safeguard is "nobody can do it". 
Yeah you can keep that one, Bill

You expend your great person when you boost production&research this way.
Still, the fact that it's open source means that anyone could port it to windows, add content, functions like networking, and more.Not me, but anyone can.
I would tuck Bill Gates into bed.  I would tuck him in so hard he wouldn't be able to move.
Oh shit, /u/sicarmy getting called the fuck out.
You know the best way to brag about giving him money? Donating to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
I like how people say things like "Oh Bill Gates and Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard" as if they flunked out. No they were actually acing super hard courses and left because they had better things to with their time.

That's why you need to play more to get more experience. Also, whenever you notice any pattern that crops up from time to time that you *don't* know the probabilities for - take a minute and work it out (even just ballparking it is better than nothing). There are plenty of patterns that are you won't see *every* game, but still pop up often enough that it's worthwhile to figure them out. It'll kill your time for that one game, but it'll help every future game.

Hi Conan, how much money did you actually raise in your Wall Piggybank, and what do you plan to do with it (since I know it's not going to Trump's initiative)?
Hey Conan! Love your show! What is your favorite type of bacteria? 
Hey Conan -- thanks for doing this! I'm a long-time admirer.I know you've told a lot of Trump-related jokes, and I've seen comments of people saying you shouldn't make things so political. Is it important to you to tell those jokes? Do you think humor can change the dynamic in this kind of political atmosphere?Thanks!
How much marijuana do you smoke?
Do you have any good mac n cheese combinations?(Such as hot dogs w mac n cheese)
Do you keep in touch with Max and Joel? How are they doing?
Number 1: Flo the Progressive Insurance lady, Number 2: Aristotle
Mike Pence.
Witcher 3, because I got to have sex on a unicorn. When that game comes out in VR, you'll never see me again.
You are very wise to ask me.  I'm not a doctor.  Next time you're not feeling well just bite into a glow stick and suck it down. 
Is it too late to drop the class?
My children. Their agents won't call me back. 
I met my wife while filming a remote on my show. And that's interesting moment #28. The most interesting moment was a cooking segment with Jerry Orbach.
I seriously asked them to explain many times and they never did. I was fervently looking forward to making out with a beautiful Mexican actress and they made me a pompous asexual cheese merchant. I am honestly very angry about this. 
As an Mexican I know the real answer, here in Mexico we have "Menonitas" that are people from Europe born in Mexico (mainly in Chihuahua) that make great cheese and then sell it on the streets wearing the "Menonita Outfit" Conan looks pretty much like a "Menonita" so that's why
When you watch the segment tonight, you'll realize that even when I'm seriously trying to wrestle, I'm still doing comedy. 
For a show like "Made in Mexico", we really wanted to make sure we struck the right balance between being funny, but also being culturally sensitive and attuned to how people were feeling there. We really did want the star to be the Mexican people, and I feel good about the result.
I was doing it in the office for a few years and the writers dared me to do it on the air. The rest is history. 
When people like Norm Macdonald, Will Ferrell, Martin Short, Charlene Yi, Kevin Hart, Bill Burr, Sarah Silverman, etc come on, it always makes me laugh.
I started dyeing it when I was 15. So I'm way ahead of the curve. My true hair color is jet black, and my real name is Blaze Falcon (I'm just babbling now). 
I was surprised how many Mexicans were shouting my name through their car windows. I don't know if they knew who I was before, or were just reading coverage of my visit. I was recognized more there than any other country. Except Finland. Finland's weird. 
Nopales. It's cactus with cheese on it. It instantly cured me of my 25 year impotence.
It's like Charlie Brown, Lucy, and the football. I believe in my heart one day he'll do the right thing. 
Lucille Ball.
Thanks for remembering my favorite remote of all time. Sometimes late at night I think about the young woman Nell and how we were supposed to be together but sadly we were born 150 years apart. 
If you're future wife is anything like mine she'll insist on taking out the part of the vows where you promise to honor and obey your husband.  Try really hard to get that part back in.  
Taking Jordan to Italy is already in the works. We're waiting until it's legal to bring a cyborg into a foreign country.
Mayonnaise, corn starch and embalming fluid.  Bake at 125 degrees for 1 hour. 
It does fit. I do not wear it at the office at all; I wear it at home, and to the gym at Venice beach. 
Because the bread is connected, and forms a "hinge" if you will, it falls under the "taco" classification. Ergo, hotdogs and tacos are not sandwiches. The pita, however, takes us into strange territory and demands further study.
See my previous answer about the penis covered stegosaurus.
True story: I met Jack and Meg in a bowling alley in Detroit in 1999 while shooting a remote. They were part of a group of people that came over and hung out. Later, they became famous and told me they were part of the group that were chatting and drinking beers all night. I totally lucked out. Since then, I just hang out in bowling alleys looking for future rock stars.
My son really got me into 21 Pilots other than that my wife and I like to slow dance to John Grisham audio books.  
Riley, I yelled at you because you exceeded my 'one almond an hour' rule. That wastes water (an almond takes 1.1 gallons of water to produce).
Giving your boss your reddit username... Bold move, Riley
How many almonds would you say is the perfect amount?
The Asparagus, because I could change the odor of your urine against your will. 
It's a tie between Fruit Loops and Cap'n Crunch with Crunchberries
Thanks for calling that an incredible display. The goal I scored was so incredibly fake that I felt bad for the goalie who had to pretend to miss a ball moving at 2mph.
Harry S. Truman. Do not screw with Harry S. Truman. 
Go to Pino's Pizza in Cleveland Circle. There's only two tables but it's the only pizza my family and I eat.  I've been going there since elementary school. 
I'd like to keep this going as long as I can. It's really fun, and at this stage in my career it feels like something new and exciting. I've always loved my job, but the one downside is being in the studio every day. The chance to travel and try my comedy out on people who speak different languages is a great joy.
I got a complete 50/50 response on the beard. Half the people loved it, half the people hated it. Since it was my kids who hated it, it had to go. Don't fear, I still keep it in the attic with my wedding dress.
That's a great question. What surprised me the most is how little I have to adjust. Especially in Mexico. The Mexican people are really funny and sharp, and they always got the joke instantly - and they weren't afraid to give me a hard time. I'm very comfortable being the underdog when I do remotes, and all the Mexican people I encountered were great and generous improvisors. 
Skittles, Hennessy and a new born kitten. 
Jeff Ross was molested by a puppet in 1958. When he testified in court he had to point to a human to show where the puppet touched him. 
Great idea. I'd love to do a travel show. In fact, I'm going to go shoot one in Mexico right now. It will air tonight at 10pm on TBS. Look for your name in the credits under "Idea By". 
Without intimate photos it's hard to say. I'll send you some. 
President Vicente Fox was very funny, and although he was talking about a serious issue, he came prepared almost like a comedian. He entirely caught the spirit of what we were trying to do, and he's a big part of the show.
My father Dr. Thomas F. O'Brien who works at Brigham and Women's hospital in Boston has been working hard on this problem for decades.  He's the smartest guy I know.  He and his team have been working hard on this serious issue for a long time.  
I hope he does more episodes with just him and Aaron in the future. The celebs are often funny but I like the show more as a two man deal.
Slenderman
Wow. Your friendly, casual demeanor cracked through my cold emotionless exterior. The answer is no. Bud's not okay.
The Killer Angels, by Michael Shaara
Still no curtains. My dad says it happens for guys at different times.
I have a scar from an appendectomy on my lower right abdomen.  I have three cats named Thor, Maow and Cleo and the only one I like is Thor.  My ATM Pin is 1494.  
I'm from Boston, and a huge Patriots fan. We had to edit out all the times I tried to kiss him.
My favorite moment was when I threw the big pass that won the game. Or maybe that was Jimmy Hennessey. Seriously, I went back to Brookline High School about 15 years ago, and it was so much nicer then when I was there. They actually had a sushi bar (not kidding).  I felt like I had gone to high school during the Great Depression.
I went to the Trotsky museum; it's the house where Leon Trotsky was murdered with an ice pick. I think it's safe to say that I'm the only late night host to ever go there. 
Ah, the old classic question. I've always been a penis stegosaurus guy.
"Conan: Made in Mexico" (which airs tonight at 10pm on TBS). Aside from that, season two of One Tree Hill. When Peyton hit bottom, I thought my life was over. 
I think it's time to tell people that yes, we are dating. 
In 2015, The Masturbating Bear died of autoerotic asphyxiation alone in a Motel 6 in Flagstaff, AZ. He was buried with full military honors.
Liam Cartwright. He played tenor sax with the group, but left for better things in '58.
No, I did not. It's one of the great disappointments of my life. 
After something like 4500 hours of weird awkward television, I honestly cannot answer that.
Absolutely not. The Mexican people were warm, friendly and eager to participate in the show. We spent a week there. I met thousands of people and I never felt the slightest hint of trepidation or hostility.  
TRANSLATION:Hello Conan. How have chimichangas its because tacos fall head from so for how many chicken chicken up? Thank you.
I think there's a kind of bacteria they spray on oil spills that turn them into delicious frothy strawberry milkshakes. If that's true, that's my favorite type of bacteria. 
I'm not a big fan of marijuana. My drug of choice is wine, and the cheese popcorn they sell at Whole Foods (Smart Choice White Cheddar Popcorn).
And how is Joel's Asian male lover, Toshi?
Check your voicemail - you have 178 new messages from Progressive's marketing dept
So you can pull the old Jay Leno on him?
Have you seen the succubus? Much better than a unicorn
And you do this for how long? Please help I have  got to get back to work
This AMA is even better than I thought it would be. It's like an online remote segment.
I just watched the clip of that segment where you met your wife, it was hilarious and amazing. I hope the guy whose furniture store they were making a commercial for was invited to the wedding. 
>I met my wife while filming a remote on my show. And that's interesting moment #28. I'm going to assume that you're talking about the girl from the old time baseball skit. 
Probably because the only people in mexico that are as pale as you are menonitas, kinda-sorta amish cheese sellers
I would love to see you in an episode of Norm's podcast if he ever decides to put any more up.
Norm is the greatest... he has a few legendary appearances on your show.
We all know your real name is Chip Whitley.
Ok grandpa.
As a Mexican i NEVER miss any of your shows. Over at r/mexico we are excited to watch your special!
> Nopales. It's cactus with cheese on it. It instantly cured me of my 25 year impotence.Surprised you were allowed to eat it. It says "no-pales" right there.
I hope he never does
I love the one that starts out as the correct movie, and then quickly turns into Mac and Me.
Why did I watch that entire thing
LUCIO BALLLLLLLLL!!!
Her poor husband. Such a sad story.
It might take Jordan awhile to feel this burn. Does he feel pain?
I left this exchange with more questions than answers.
A pita is a pocket and thus falls under the same classification as a vagina.
Personally, I like to practice law while listening to slow dancing music

And you can trust him, because he's a scientist.

So, where does the water go? It's clearly not in the actual almond(s). Is this an issue of depleting aquifers, where the water can stay in circulation more locally and groundwater recharge can't keep up, or is the water somehow moving elsewhere?
Did you see that ludicrous display last night, Conan? 
There's actually no period after the "S", because there's no name behind it.  True story. 
Abraham Lincoln was huge and a beast. He was undefeated as a wrestler and he won't get caught letting someone sneak up on him from behind... again.
Truman for sure. He'd let FDR take all the punches and then cherry pick a nuclear bombing at the end of the melee. 
Thank you!  We both actually love trying different pizza places, so this is perfect.  So many new places opened up in the area.  I'll let her know tonight.
What does a new born kitten smell like?
Oh my god, reading through these answers is like getting an impromptu Conan stand-up.
Jesus, this is top shelf stuff.
Was this intentionally answered like Donald Trump?
Nobody tell r/trees
Holy shit lmao. It's like you're a professional at this. 
Aren't drapes and curtains the same thing? 
Now I am Conan 
I heard Leno's planning to go there next week.
However, a close second would be a pterodactyl whose eyes are anuses. 
Mr. Conan, Don't ever change.
/u/Oldschoolhollywood is going to print this out and use it as their facebook profile picture. And it'll probably be on their fridge, forever.
The specificity of this response is actually impressive. 
Pete Best and Stuart Sutcliffe are devastated. They're also dead, but they're devastated.
That's because you look Mexican.
Did you smoke with Ice Cube and Kevin Hart when you went to a dispensary during the girl's driving test? 
I can't buy that stuff because once the bag opens I'm eating it all.
Damn I miss the old crew.
And 1 from Aristotle saying sorry but he's more of a Leno guy. 
> Jay Lenohow ~~c~~dare* you mention that name
Amazing. I don't play TW3. Is this really a reference to Conan?
she can finish a capri sun pouch in 1 succ (;
I'm a doctor, and I do know you have to suck on at least 3ish glow sticks to help.
I don't think there is a man alive who doesn't crush hard on Nell when he sees that skit.
Who's this red headed firebrand on the talking box Smithers? I like the cut of his jib.
That episode was from a couple years after Conan stopped writing for The Simpsons.
Anyway, the year was nineteen-dickity-two! You had to say "dickity" because the Kaiser had stolen our word for "twenty"...
This is like a joke that Conan would say in his monologue to grumbled laughter from the crowd while he stares at the camera apologetically and Andy tells him it was a terrible joke. 
I hope that when you poop, a droplet of water kisses your butthole
I was actually surprised there wasn't one version where they reenact the scene themselves with him as every character
Because its hilarious
OH, OH, OH! TIME TO ACCELERATE!!!!
Not really. He was a coward.
I think this is the best answer we've ever had to this question. "No, it's a Taco". Brilliant. 
Classic Riley.
No, I'm just a shy boy
Almond researcher here. For maximum efficiency, we make the 1 almond and then launch the 1 gallon of water into space, rendering it forever unusable.
FDR is the most tank-like president.

Marshawn Lynch
He should go into comedy.Start as a writer, maybe get his own TV show someday.
nah, he'll never make it in comedy 
Have ya heard of this Trotsky guy, have you seen this?
That's not going to be good for business
Nobody likes beating a dead bear.
Liam Cartwright doesn't even exist as far as I can tell. Conan is such a troll (even though the Beatles weren't called the Beatles in 1958)
Yes, Conan of Braye End = Conan Obrien
You have to put it in the microwave first
HE SAID IT HAD TO BE HIM
Devils advocate: He wrote it and the script was shelved until after he left.
why did i watch just watch the entire thing even though i already watched the entire thing like last month?
CAN'T STOP, WON'T STOP! 
Jordan is not pleased
Do you think about Conan's penis often?
That's not going to be good for anybody.
Liam Cartwright was Duke Silver's first stage name. When he left the band, the Beatles almost never recovered. It took them a few years before they were able to reform as a lesser band.
Wow. Even after you guys confirmed it was a reference, I didn't know it was a (phonetic) pun till you spelled it out for me.
"When Jay Leno tells you something, that's supposed to be a pact with the American People. He's giving his word." How prophetic.
She's cute as hell, and was totally digging Conan...
Do you not?
ON THE EEEEDGE
That's a rat hat?And a poorly made one, even by rat hat standards
"We didn't have any capital, and there was a giant, lit up 'FACT' sign on top the building, so we had to incorporate that into our advertising".That's some real world shit.  
How does everyone automatically know which girl is Conan's wife?
OOOOF THE CRATER
Have airline companies changed their pricing algorithms due to Skiplagged's increasing use and prominence?
A friend of mine claims you can get screwed on this, but I don't know if I believe himSupposedly if you're flying from NYC to Dallas and use this to get a flight that goes from NYC to las Vegas (with a hidden city of Dallas), the hidden city could switch at the last minute from Dallas to Chicago! Possible? Or an urban legend? This is the only thing keeping me from using this service
>Fast-forward a few more months to May 2015, a federal judge dropped the lawsuit completely.Why?
What were the biggest obstacles to overcome in getting the website off the ground?-Also, how does the website and app make money?
If I'm getting a results unavailable page is this a result from the Reddit hug of death and/or no results that save money for my potential trip?
Some carriers have applications that can sniff out passengers using hidden cities and mark their return flights for cancellation. Have any of your passengers had their return flights cancelled for this reason? And if they do, will you compensate them?
How does it feel to personally be telling that 'One weird trick Airliners don't want you to know about'?
Can you explain like I'm 5 what a hidden-city is? I don't understand how/why it saves money.
Can you get on a flight from the middle to end instead? Say flight does to New York, Miami, lax. Can I start from Miami to end in lax?
Data engineer here, what types of obstacles from a data acquisition/infrastructure view did you run into? How do you manage scaling up? Did you have to apply for access to the FAA data or do you pull from an alternative source? What kind of backend do you use to handle this large scale/constantly changing data? My apologies for all the nerdy questions! :D
Use this sub-thread to vote for a charity! :)
Is it true that the best (Cheapest) time to purchase a plane ticket is about 3 weeks in advance? Do airlines seem to change the prices on certain days of the week?
I want to use skiplagged to book a flight now but it keeps saying "results unavailable" even after multiple city searches. Is the site down?
In terms of voting, what about making a comment for each charity and our upvote can help decide?
What do you plan on doing next?
Is this a violation of your agreement with the airline as a passenger? could you be banned from the airline for doing this often?
Oh hey! We graduated from RPI the same year. I mostly wanted to say that it's super cool to see an RPI grad being successful and don't really have any great questions to ask about Skiplagged, so I guess I'll just ask what your favorite and least favorite parts of RPI were so we can bond.So, what was your favorite and least favorite part / experience at RPI?
Does your site show the cheapest flight possible as soon as you search, or is there a further step you have to go?
Which airlines have "contract of carriage"? What could they do to you for missing a flight?
Just saying, you're my hero. Had to go see my mom a few weeks back, and used Skiplagged. Saved a crap ton of money. Just wondering, what's your primary method of growing a startup company such as yours?
What about the other passengers on the flight you don't show up for? Do you worry that Skiplagged will increase delays caused by late arriving or no-show passengers?
Can I come work for you?
Just an FYI. I just downloaded your app, and tried your website. The website is not giving me any results, and the app is crashing every time I search. Running an iPhone 6 with ios 9.2 beta. Any ideas?
What is stopping airlines from deciphering which flights are being purchased through Skiplagged and denying all sales made through your site? I'm not even sure if such a thing is possible, but if it is I wouldn't put such a thing past them. 
How'd you come up with the idea for Skiplagged??? It's really amazing!!!
RPI Class of '11 here. Here's hoping you bring our school some more recognition. You didn't happen to take any of the Operation Research classes, did you? That class fully explains why airlines price as they do.
Not that I've noticed. Airlines still make the additional money from uninformed, so it might be silly to get rid of hidden-city opportunities.
Hijacking the top comment to tell people: Airlines can and will ban you from flying with them if they catch you doing this. Do not use this method of travel hacking with an airline you intend to use often!
By suing Skiplagged, United educated millions about hidden-city and made Skiplagged significantly more popular. It might be better for the airlines to leave Skiplagged alone.
Thanks for the input. I've been going back and forth about when to donate the excess like I promised. Only reason I considered now because it's been a year already. I'll be sure to update you guys.
Yes. If the airline decides to reroute you due to a plethora of factors this can happen. However it is rare.
We proved it wasn't filed properly. The jurisdiction, Chicago, was not the right place for this lawsuit.
It's a classic move companies use to bleed smaller opposition of money. File in the wrong jurisdiction, force the company to defend themselves and have the case thrown out wasting time and money, both of which are precious to a smaller company, then re-file in the appropriate spot. He'll he sued again
It turns out services that provide airfare data make it really difficult to facilitate what Skiplagged does, i.e. search by stopovers. I had to figure out an efficient and scalable solution to this huge obstacle, given that airfare is lots of data that changes every few minutes.The website and app don't make money right now, but there are lots of ways Skiplagged as a travel service can in the future (e.g. hotel commissions).
Hug of death
Never had a complaint. We tell you to book a round-trip as two one-ways if it involves missing a flight.
I work for one of the major Airlines and I can tell  that yes, if you miss a segment in your reservation, they will automatically cancel out everything after that segment 
Pretend you live in California. You want to go to Denver Colorado. The ticket is $550. But there's also a flight to Nashville Tennessee that has a layover in Denver. This flight is only $300. So you book the flight to Nashville and just get off your plane when it stops in Denver and you stay in Denver.The only issue with this is it's a one way ticket and you cannot check your baggage. you either have to mail it to your destination beforehand or just have carry on baggage. 
If you take a flight from Los Angeles to New York, you may have layover Chicago. The layover destination is the place you're actually trying to get to. Airlines are selling to fill their planes, so may offer a discount ticket to get people on the airplane. Now, if you don't go to New York and drop off at Chicago, the airline doesn't have a full plane and they sold you a discount ticket to New York but you just went to Chicago. Maybe Los Angeles to Chicago costs more than New York, but you've sort of circumvented by buying a cheaper ticket to Chicago. I hope I explained that okay.
You'll appear as having missed your departure on your origin and it invalidates the rest of the trip unless you have a customer service agent override it.  Say your plane to second leg was significantly delayed due to maintenance and you just decided to rent a car and drive to the next airport instead and told the agent and had him exception it.  I've heard of it happening a few times when someone would just decide to go from PIT to IAD or EWR via car to make their flight out to another area.
Keep it as a war-chest in case they refile in the proper jurisdiction.  
A fist-bump, a high-five, AND a cold beer with pizza! Haha
Ah, yeah those airlines that routinely go bankrupt and can barely stay afloat while simultaneously getting 99.999999999% of people where they're going without tragedy are so evil and blood sucking. 
Hey fellow RPI grad! Thanks for the nice comment. My favorite part was that the computer science curriculum prepared me well for the working world. Least favorite was the boring city. You?
All the airlines have some sort of agreement. If you missed a flight, you missed a flight. They can't really prove you missed on purpose and therefore violated the contract.
We're hiring so maybe! Email apply@skiplagged.com
Alternatively, do you have employees or is it a solo operation currently?
Just a PSA to those who are planning to use this service and book a flight with it: Airlines are very privy to the Hidden City "trick" and will not hesitate to shut down your frequent flyer account (and take away your "miles") . You may be able to get away with it once or twice but if you are flying regularly and have a frequent flyer account with that airline, they will figure it out. 
Airlines also don't like it when you use the word 'hijacking'
I'm banned for life from Alaska Airlines for doing hidden-city fares *twice*. Really sucks, too, because it's one of the most popular airlines around here. I'm locked out of about half the flights I could take, and sometimes I have to fly separately when traveling with friends and family.Shit is real. 
thank goodness I'm poor and rarely travel and can't afford to choose what airline I use
As wonderful a sentiment as that is, that's very rarely how multi-billion dollar companies operate. I don't want to be a negative nancy here, but you shouldn't be surprised if you see the inside of a courtroom again soon.Or, even more likely, find yourself on the receiving end of their lobbying team. 
Rare indeed. Only 2.5% of trips get rerouted, usually in obvious times of issues like bad weather.
Whats stopping them from filing it again in the right jurisdiction after you donate the money and cant fight it?
Considering it was dismissed on a technicality, don't you think you should keep the remaining money that hasn't been spent instead of donating it to charity? I don't think any of us would fault you for keeping it saved for a year. If you haven't been sued by next year, THEN donate it. But who knows if you'll have the same fundraising capabilities if this happens again.
Do you also contend the suit is without merit? Or...are you standing proudly in the loophole?
I think the question is asking what the remedy for hidden city booking is if your flight is changed or cancelled, either intentionally by the airlines for violating their terms, or coincidentally (e.g. due to bad weather). Does your site have any remedy, or is this just a risk that passengers have to live with?
So if one purchases two one way tickets through the same airline and misses a segment on the first ticket, will the return ticket be cancelled?  Is this just for round-trip tickets?
I've always wanted to pretend live in California
Why would they charge less for two trips instead of one? Never got this but I've used this trick forever.
I tried this once. My grandmother was sick and we wanted to spend more time with her. The second leg of the trip started 30 minutes from her place but united wouldn't let me skip the first flight and said the second would get cancelled. This was the return portion of a cross-country round-trip ticket so it's not like I was really gaining anything... They made me purchase a new ticket, completely cancelling the old one. They said I could reschedule if I showed them a death certificate/doctor's note.
After reading all the other comments, it sounds extremely likely that they will take him to court at least one more time. Better to start at 30k for some lawyers than 0k. Wait til your turning a profit before worrying about charity. On the other hand, it sounds like he said that he would donate what's left from this case to charity in the original gofundme, so it may not be great PR to keep it. 
www.givewell.org is a better site.  Focuses on results vs where money goes in the company.
None of these organisations are rated well on charity-rating websites.This one spends 50% of it's donations on the actual program.
You're a good guy too, aol
I think he might walk out on your before you get to the pizza, but all you really wanted was the beer anyway.
This is Reddit. To the 18 year olds who don't understand that a company like United has to employ tens of thousands of people to fly and maintain their planes, as well as pay for millions every DAY in equipment and fuel, the fact that United charged them $25 to check a bag once means they're evil.All corporations are evil, apparently.I just paid $259 to fly non stop round trip from DC to Denver.  In fact, I did this seven times in the last two months. Each time I got there safely and on time except for once that was late due to weather.  That's nine cents a mile.Those greedy bastards!
But let's say they could prove it. What could they do to you? Cancel your return flight? Revoke your frequent flyer status? Ban you from flying with them?
I posted the source file to a tutorial site 5 years ago for instructional/personal use. This is actually the first time I have seen the XOO.me site and will also follow up with them.
Nah. Just swap the logo, don't pay good money for something that looks like it was drawn by a halfwit 4 year old. "Hard work" my arse, plus, he's pissed that someone plagiarized an image he literally made a step by step tutorial for.
Yeah, Skiplagged is more than just me now. We're hiring too...email apply@skiplagged.com
What if you don't have a frequent flier account? Is there anything else they can do about it?
I'm a brown person. Skipping the connecting flight might probably result in a nation-wide manhunt for 'person of suspicious origin with unknown intent', even if the intent was just to save 20 bucks
I agree. My husband and I have used the skip lagged technique. We don't give our FF# when we do it. It's not worth it!
Frequent flier miles are a scam anyways, just always pick the lowest priced flight and it's more than worth it compared to miles.
I don't think it's that simple, though... It's cheaper to fly London - LAX than it is to fly somewhere on the East Coast.... like say, DC or New york. That makes zero fucking sense. Why would a longer journey to a major destination like LAX be cheaper?
Overheard in the TSA screening line: 'Oh yeah, I found out about this sweet deal from a hijacked comment on reddit, it was the booooomb!'
Found the Alaska Airlines employee! 
Proof?  Sorry to have to ask, but how do we know airlines aren't just using PR via reddit to try and frighten people out of using this technique to save money?
It would be interesting to see what happens. Those are definitely likely possibilities.
>  that's very rarely how multi-billion dollar companies operate.that's exactly how they operate, what are you talking about? getting tons of bad press means they back away *very* quickly, especially when continuing will do more damage than letting it go.
Eh one in fourty is pretty high to be called rare, especially if you are taking at least 2 flights per trip.
What can be done in these rare situations, if anything? Or as a consumer am i taking a gamble of being taken to some random crap town, like say.... Detroit? 
They may have filed thinking they were going to scare the kid into giving in. When he came back with proper counsel and national media attention they may just consider cutting their losses. Bringing another lawsuit is likely going to bring even more attention to the site which isn't good for the airlines.
Nothing other than the fact that it would draw more media attention.  While the app sounds cool, you don't need it to get these deals.  If the lawsuit gets big in the news again, more people will do this even if the app is gone.
This should be the top response to this thread. I find it hard to believe OP has a lawyer who was able to win the jurisdictional issue but hasn't warned the OP that there is a VERY HIGH likelihood he gets sued again in the correct jurisdiction. 
I can't imagine this would be something that they have any sort of obligation to compensate you for. It seems like something that would be firmly in the 'use at your own risk' camp, like sports betting arbing and the like
Round trip only. your return one way ticket will be safe.
The price airlines sell tickets for is disconnected from how much it costs them to get you there
I do. It's whatevs. 
Yeah but knowing the internet, if he didn't follow up on the original promise people would crucify him over it, it's stupid because he's probably gonna see more lawsuits but what're you gonna do
And it seems like the idea is to partner with hotels and rental car companies to eventually make it a profitable company. Except if he gets sued a couple of more times, those companies won't touch him with a 10 foot pole, especially if it potential hurts the hotel and rental agencies relationships with the airline industry. 
BUT YOU COULD WALK THOSE MILES FOR FREE!
Lol according to reddit any person or company that owns more than a million or so is automatically evil
Spirits proposition - cheaper for a horrid, crap airline - would be a perfectly fine OPTION, if it were actually cheaper. I've never flown them but they charge for carry-on bags, printing boarding passes, water, peanuts, everything. And 20% of their flights get cancelled, adding to the risk of you coughing up extra for transportation, hotels, etc. So it's really not cheaper. It depends on people's stupidity to thrive
As a Flight Attendant for a major US carrier, thank you. Everyday people take their frustrations out on us as if we control the situation but it's the passengers who actually have the control. If you continuously tell the companies by buying the cheapest tickets that all you want is cheap tickets then you have to expect lower service. The company provides less service for less money. Just like McDonald's, you don't get a Big Mac meal on the dollar menu. Basic economics people. 
> Cancel your return flight? Yes, which is why your departure and arrival flights should be booked separately.> Revoke your frequent flyer status? Yes. Do not use your frequent flyer information when skiplagging.> Ban you from flying with them?I've never seen this happen, and I don't believe it would hold up if they attempted to do so.
It is likely going to fall on Xoo, since app designers will likely grab from "free" sites.Somewhere along the line, someone who gets paid to "produce" took your design and took credit for it.I am not a lawyer, but getting any money out of this looks slim, since you'll probably have to pay for a lawyers time. 
What are you hiring for? 
If the site isn't making money, how can you hire someone? 
It is within their discretion to block you from booking further travel with their company
they can frame you for murder
The brown people I know, East Indians, would risk it to save $20. 
The airline could pretty easily connect you to your FF# if they wanted to.  
Unless you work for a company that expects you to purchase your own flights, and then reimburses you. Then it would be silly to pass up the free miles
FF miles are amazing if you always stay within the same company or alliance. I travel a lot for work and almost always get bumped up, free flights for vacations, etc.FF are only worth it if you truly are a frequent flyer. 
Probably supply and demand. I would assume that London to/from NYC is the busiest international route in the world when you consider the amount of business done in the two cities and the volumes of tourists going both ways.
For some reason, I pictured Aziz Ansari as the person saying this.
Of course, Hail Corporate! I mean, if an airline wanted people to believe that they'd ban people for using hidden-city, wouldn't the best way to accomplish that be by banning people? Why pay people to post about bans that never happened when you could just kill two birds with one stone and actually ban the people.
What was their claim against you? Tortious interference?
Just to reiterate that for people,  that's a 1/40 chance. If 4000 people used skip lagging in a day, about 100 of them got rerouted, and never reached their intended destination. 
You are taking the risk. I'd say if you were worried about it, only book flights with final destinations that you wouldn't mind ending up at. 
They usually won't switch it mid-flight, so you would know before you got on the plane. You would then have the option of not getting on the plane and dealing with the repercussions of doing so.
DTW is a really nice airport. I'm in NW Ohio so that's what I use. I actually just used it to fly to and from St. Louis this past week and they have a really nice hotel inside and lots of windows that look out at nothing. Also, located in Romulus Michigan.
Hey now, the lions have won their last three games. The city is on the upswing.
Seriously. This isn't really a win for OP. If anything, it's a setback, because the airline suing him is just going to start over with a totally different lawsuit in the correct jurisdiction.
> sports betting arbing ?
Former Continental / United IT here. Your return one way ticket could absolutely be cancelled if we wanted to, but nobody really cares that much.
I live in a small town in California. It costs $500 to fly 45 minutes to SF and only $285 to fly SF to DC.This only because its a 5 hour drive to SF and there is only one airline to choose from.As you said "what the market will bear"
And then what? 
Food, shelter. Not free.
Airlines used to be like that before federal deregulation that was supposed to "give consumers more competitive choices".
So wait. He made a tutorial for how to create this image? Not sure how that works legally, but if you expressly show someone how to create something can you claim copyright on their end result? 
Looking for employees who are okay being unpaid
Claim a medical emergency happened so you couldn't make the connecting flight.  HIPAA prevents any doctor from sharing medical information.  They'll ask you for your doctor's name and information and then never request proof because they can't. This also works for simply cancelling a flight.
Wasn't expecting to see the Maloney reference. I am very amused. Thank you, internet stranger.
Can they really cancel a ticket you already have?  I'm sure they can stop you from booking future flights, but I'd be surprised if they would/could cancel an existing ticket.
For using the system they made and haven't fixed?  What are they, EA?
They still know it's you flying tho.
I'm brown and this is hilarious. I'll accept any racism thrown my way if it makes me laugh
Are East Indians the same as South Asians? Like east Indies?
You don't have to purchase the flight to get the miles. You're thinking of credit card reward points. You get miles from having your butt in the seat. I've flown over 200k this year and am not allowed to book the flights on my own CC, unfortunately. However my mileage bank is close to 1 million ff miles with United at present. 
If you travel you are just taking the miles from the person paying for it. If you are paying for the tickets it's worth it to shop for the lowest.Frequent flyer miles are really marginal and aren't worth a whole lot. For example I frequently make abut a 1,000 mile trip. The tickets are about $400. I would have to make 25 of these trips to get enough frequent flyer miles to get a free ticket for this flight. That's $10,000 to save $400. It' basically a discount of 4%
Surely then it would cost more to fly NYC? Like the reason this Skiplagging works is because less popular routes are cheaper. So why would the more popular route in this instance be cheaper?I regularly travel between LHR and RIC. You have to connect somewhere to make this journey and I purposefully avoid JFK and ATL because they're such a clusterfuck - but it's often cheaper than CLT or IAD, which are my preferred routes...
He screwed a turtle?
The claim is that skiplagged is inciting people to violate the terms and conditions of purchasing plane tickets, thus breaching their contract with the airlines.  It's not worth going after each person individually, but since skiplagged is advertising itself as a service that takes advantage of this pricing loophole and profits from this, it's an easy target to (1) stop people from taking advantage of the loophole and (2) recouping lost profits from these breaches.
"I'm sorry, I can't legally enter the state of Ohio anymore, can I get a refund?"
People not from around here generally think that all of southeast Michigan is a barren, post-apocalyptic wasteland. In reality most of it is actually quite nice...
We'll be 9-7!!!
That makes no fucking sense. If they are two one-way tickets they would not be on the same reservation. If they are on different reservations, the rule would not apply, and the airline can't read minds - if you fly from JFK to NRT on July 1 and have a second reservation from NRT to JFK on July 31, how does the airline know you don't have a reservation with JAL to fly back and forth in between? People often have half a dozen reservations stacked up in the future - there is no way for the airline to know what that person is doing with their life.
Then offer a reasonable price to take the horse early so you can ride it to the bank.  Never come back.  Something along those lines.Schultz decided to shoot the farmer before any of this could happen, so it didn't really play out how he intended.
I never understood carry-on people. I check my bags because it's far less hassle for me.
It would still be protected from someone else using it for monetary gain. There are plenty of tutorial book on how to draw Mickey Mouse for example. 
they can still refuse you anyway though, they can refuse you because they think you're ugly if they really wanted to(disclaimer: I think you're beautiful, in every single way)
Genuine question does HIPAA prevent doctors from even disclosing whether or not they saw you? I would imagine that it does but I don't know. 
Really? They asked my dad for a prescription from the doc for pushing his flight because of illness. 
It's Mulaney man! Jesus!
They totally can. If you miss a flight in any stage of a round trip they cancel all remaining segments and you get no refund
Yea they have enough data for a computer to do a cross check algorithm to figure out all the skippers out there.The problem they have is that they don't want to start another viral campaign if they start shutting down FF accounts. Maybe they'll just flag it so they can give you shit later... 
No joke, my mom will drive 10 miles to save 10 cents on anything. I keep trying to tell her that those 10 miles wasted more in gas then she will save. No dice. It's a dime in her pocket.
East Indian as in India. I generally hear the term 'East Indian' to differentiate us from native americans, who are also called 'Indian'. South Asia also includes Pakistan/Bangladesh/Nepal etc.
Less popular routes are more expensive. Knoxville to Cedar Rapids is $550. DC to New York is $100. Why? Because on unpopular routes there is no competition so they can charge whatever they want.
Tort is a wrongful act or an infringement of a right (other than under contract) leading to civil legal liability.
As crazy as that is, it can literally happen.  I wonder what the legal issues would end up as!  
It's official as fuck. Wild card here we come.
Lol that's actually a good idea. 
Isn't that a different situation? Mickey Mouse is copyrighted as a character, while there is no general copyright on a "cartoonish plane" character. I assume the automatic copyright would be on the specific image, and that wasn't used by OP.
"Because we're Delta Airlines and life is a fucking nightmare."
Bullshit, I'm ugly as sin.
You aren't booking a round trip though. It is two seperate trips.
It also just straight up costs more per passenger to fly a smaller plane.
And tortious interference refers to intentionally infringing on the contractual/business relations of another. 
"Can I please go home, on an airplane""No, in fact, we're gonna frame you for murder!"
Beauty is subjective, you're the most beautiful person in the world to *someone*.
What are your thoughts on the FBI/DOJ vs Apple ordeal at the moment?
Steve, what's the greatest invention that you wished you designed?
What is the most funny prank that you've pulled?
Do you like how you were portrayed in the Apple movies (jobs and Steve Jobs)? Who did a better job: Seth Rogen or Josh Gad? What did they do completely wrong?
Whats your favorite Linux Distro?
Hi Steve, what is the book you've gifted the most or recommended the most to people? Doesn't have to be about tech or business, just one that you think most people should read.
Getting straight to it I see.
That question might be too hard for any human being. Greatest invention... I just described one, which was a device to pop anywhere - real tiny, into a glove compartment, a backpack, whatever - and be able to locate it, wherever it is in the world. There are some devices that kind of claim that now, but they don't really work sufficiently. A device that gives us one extra hour per day?
I bet it's the Zune.
u/andymbrit, I get asked that everywhere. I have pulled so many hundreds of pranks; I pull pranks almost every day! So I can't come up with one funniest prank. Sometimes I like to talk about early ones; when I was so young, how could I have thought of it.I did like the one where I put a little ticking electronic metronome in a school locker, back when very few people could build such things as a ticking metronome; and I had it rigged so that when you opened the locker, a little tinfoil switch caused the ticking to speed up.
He said on Conan that he never had a big confrontation with Jobs like portrayed in the Fassbender movie. They took a lot of complaints from various employees and made the Woz character the mouthpiece  for all that.
Money says he signed a contract that wont let him answer this.
Joey Slotnick of course.
I'd like to know if he plays with Linux at all.  I couldn't imagine him not.
Support! I'd like to know what he thinks about GNU/Linux and the free software movement in general.
That's not what I expected someone called *xxdeathx* to look like. Hope you go far bro!
> is acknowledging the employees of AppleI see that part of the movie was spot on :)
I'm glad you mentioned Apple Watch. It's been a pretty weird product from Apple, something that maybe doesn't fit the Apple philosophy in many ways. Like the band being the only difference, the software not being very solid (unlike how the first iPhone OS was), and the dark-ish & (rather) slow software design. Do you think it could be the effect of a different approach by Tim and the team?
I miss Steve, too.  Thanks for the response!  I've been an user since the Apple IIe.  Cheers!
Going into the future, what do you believe will be the solution if something like this ever occurs again, whether that be with Apple or another company?
Can I ask why you wrote viruses? Was it just to learn?
He wasted no time responding to it either haha.
> A device that gives us one extra hour per day?google is working on that, it's called the driverless car
capsule corp?
> A device that gives us one extra hour per day?A clock with 13 hours.
I loved my Zune HD. I still have it somewhere around the house.
> I like to live a life where kinda everyone likes me. I'm just not bad. If somebody is bad to me, I'm still good to them.I wish more people were like you, Steve. Thank you.
that'll get you sent to jail nowadays
That's funny as heck. Another great alternative would be to have the ticking stop when they open the locker. "Huh, I swear I heard ticking coming from here..."
And the principal ran onto the football field hugging onto the device to save the students lol. 
> we succeeded when you look at all the people walking down the sidewalk looking down at something in their hands and totally oblivious to everything around themWe're truly living in the future
My 13 year old son is blind (and into technology). I read him what you wrote about blind people and he said 'that's weird and cool at the same time.'
I wish more people would be understanding when I tell them why I don't respond instantly to their texts.  There's a time and a place to do that stuff, and mid-conversation is not it.
As a legally blind person that's the best thing I've read all year!
> you'd have to say we succeeded when you look at all the people walking down the sidewalk looking down at something in their hands and totally oblivious to everything around them!this is hilarious and sad at the same time. It's true though. At least half of all people i see outside these days are looking at their cell phones at any given time.
My parrot can use an iPad. He can scroll and will play some simple games designed for kids. That's, um ... something in my book.
I just want to say, this AMA so far is up there with Gordon Ramsay's.You are being so honest, thoughtful, and dedicate so much time to your answers. Thank you, Steve. :)
I thinks that's a completely valid creative liberty there. It tells an affecting story better that way.
tl;dw is basically "everyone fucks Xerox".
YOU'RE STEALING FROM US
My father received a Newton from his company in the 90s. Not a tech type he brought it home and I eventually ended up with it. Its touch-tone dialer was quite handy for free long distance calls. I bet *nobody* at Apple thought about using it for phreaking when they coded the software ...
> Almost every time a technology is brand new, it leaves security as a later concern. Look at the phone system in the United States. When I was young, you could put tones into a United States phone if you learned about "phone phreaking," and you could cause calls to be dialed for free anywhere in the world. Old 2600 member saluting you Wozniak.
Of course he does, I remember in an interview once Woz mentioned that he forces himself to use platforms that he never would normally. So for example for a couple of months he would use an Android phone and and not touch his iPhones. That way he can give fair arguments about the different platforms to people without being an ignorant fanboy of one side.
Ok then Steve...Batman has no realistic chance right?
> so that we can eventually communicate with them as our best, most trusted friends that know our own hearts and souls *better than other humans.*ONE OF US, ONE OF US, ONE OF US
A machine to understand us even better than our best friends. That reminds me of the movie Her. 
>think differentlyNot sure if that was on purpose but that's great. 
How the heck did you go back to college under a fake name?
What do you mean by 'too late to ever go back'?
Welcome to reddit
Just watched this the other day. Why didn't Jobs acknowledge the Apple II team? Why??So that's my question to Woz. Was there any truth behind that whole thing?
I think a lot of people look at iPhone OS 1.0 with rose colored glasses.  It had:* No App Store* No multitasking* No folders* No copy and paste (!)And, while snappy, native apps like Safari *loved* to crash all the time.
I think the Apple Watch is entirely about minimizing the technology and they may as well find a way to pay for those tech improvements by selling something along the way.  It's a temporary market in a much longer development cycle to reduce the size of wearable tech and how much it interrupts our daily lives to operate (according to me of course, I have no particular knowledge or insight).
> since the Apple IIeThis guy probably played the original Castle Wolfenstein like me. :P
They are already doing it. The chip in the lastests phone is physically blocking brute force attacks. they manifactured the phone in a way that it's not code that is stoping you from hacking the phone but physically the chipset will just not let you. IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN
I think you're missing the nuances of what he said. He said "Twice in my life I wrote things that could have been viruses". So he was probably writing code for something else, and it could have been used as a virus. It's sounds to me that he didn't write it as a virus. 
That'd give me 2 hours a day! I think my happiness would improve by immeasurable amounts. 
As someone who commute on 495 and 66 during rush hour, yes please. So much wasted time... Time I could be getting a nap or other stuff. 
WONDERFUL - ANOTHER 2 HOURS FOR YOUR BOSS TO ASSIGN YOU WORK AND KEEP YOU LONGER ON CONFERENCE CALLS
Bulma's never around when you need her..
Just waiting on trunks to time travel back to us and show us the technology behind it. 
Oh good, I'm not the only one. The hardware on that thing was great.
This isn't to disparage Woz, but I think I would be a better person if I didn't have to worry about money.I think everyday stresses are what effect my moods the most. Having to work for the man and cementing my future is the biggest part of it. 
It would be worth it and you could use the now famous "woz defence"
Or the White House
Wozniak was actually sent to jail once. I forgot on what charge, but he taught the inmates how to use the ceiling fans wiring as a conductor to electrocute any officer that comes in contact with the bars. 
Dumb question incoming... Why would you be sent to jail?
This reminds me of a prank pulled on me using an annoy-a-tron from thinkgeek.com.  I'm on mobile or I would link it.  Let's just say it is very, very effective.  I destroyed my office looking for the beep.  By destroyed I mean smashed a lamp and over turned a couch.  But trust me, If there were more things to destroy I would have totally destroyed them too.
I used to have that argument with an ex a lot.  My phone would ding and he'd ask me how I could not immediately look at it and I'd say "because we're in the middle of dinner and I'm having a conversation with *you* right now and the message will still be there later."And then his phone would ding and he'd pull it out and start typing.
I'm in that strange state of mind where the first thing I wondered after reading this is wether someone can be illegally blind.
As a sighted person, walking down the street as I'm posting this,  I'd like to s
And 150 years ago it used to be a newspaper, times haven't changed that much. 
Unless the story is about the Woz. =/
Wait, the guy from The Librarians? Thats... Interesting.
Good old Xerox PARC, the R&D lab that invented all these incredible things that Xerox themselves had no clue what to do with.
Oh man, I loved the Newton! I got one from a family friend, and it was the best thing ever as a kid, I still wish you could scribble on a touchscreen and have it "explode" erase the text... that thing was so ahead of it's time.
Mother F'r... I had a Newton... Never knew you could use it to make free long distance calls... TIL.
Exposing yourself to as many environments as you can is very important if you want to be a great developer.
>he forces himself to use platforms that he never would normallyAbout that, I doubt he would never use linux or android. I don't think he is using those only to discover the competition and stuff like that.He even said Apple should make an android phone.  Also I doubt they used OSX servers only, he must've worked with linux.
If you mean to say that Batman has no realistic chance against Superman, then that's just silly because Superman by his abilities is unrealistic.But Batman is a tactician and super rich, and Superman is just a cannonball. All Batman has to do is load up crop dusters with synthesized kryptonite aerosol and pollute the sky.
One of the oldest toys ever discovered was a 4000 year old doll.  It's amazing how far the artificial partner concept has managed to evolve.  I can imagine a world where human/machine partnerships make interpersonal relationships between two humans completely unnecessary.
Karmalogically I should be welcoming you amigo
Eventually (after the ending of the movie), Jobs did start thanking the employees in real life. I don't think it was until the release of the iPhone that he started doing that. After he did, he started doing it at every presentation.My guess is that, after he got cancer, he changed. He was still an asshole, but maybe a little less so after he realized how short life is.
I remember showing off my OG Droid to friends with iPhones (which launched with many of these features)."Look, the interface may be arcane, but WATCH WHAT I CAN DO." Both platforms have come so far since then, and I really think they've pushed each other in a really great way. I'm not sure Android would have gotten user experience unfucked as quickly as they did, and I think single-tasking would have festered on the iPhone a lot longer without the competitive pressure. I may personally prefer Android, but the competitive pressure has been undeniably good for the consumer.
Honestly it was mostly about:* All of your music from your iPod (which everyone had) on your phone* Viewing full web pages. Mobile sites were beyond shitty back then. * Pinch to zoom was incredibly impressive.* Google maps* The camera quality* Photos app
No MMSNo multitasking, and that really didn't even show up until, like, when? 2014?
Honestly, the original iPhone was probably no more polished software-wise than the Watch. But when the original iPhone was released there were no mature, feature-rich mobile platforms to compare it against like iOS.
I have a thumbdrive that does that, called an Ironkey. It's pretty neat. Only 2 gigs though. If you want secure though, I guess it's a good call. I think you get five tries on the password before it nukes itself at the hardware level.
That is still confusing the shit out of me.
Shots fired.
I'm reading through Hacking: The Art of Exploitation by Jon Erickson at the moment. (It was recommended by some other Redditor.) It's extremely interesting, and I'm learning a lot about computers. I just wish there was  some way to try these things in the wild without it being illegal.
Buddy, you ought to consider getting an apartment closer to work.  Provided you can afford it, of course.  Losing two hours a day to commute is just not worth it.  
i actually ride the subway to work, it doesn't add that much to your life.  though the privacy of a driverless car would be fantastic compared to walking up those steps and dealing with rush hour congestion
DC traffic, nothing like it 
Capsules came way before trunks
Still have mine too. Everything about it was great
There are literally dozens of you.  Dozens! 
Tbh it is not an "equivalent". It plays HD flac (which the ipod doesn't do) and most importantly the DAC on that thing is seriously the best you will find under $1000. He got the best in the business to make the hardware on that thing, it sounds amazing. 
Even before they had money, when Steve Jobs secretly took a bigger share of the money they had made from the first PC they had made, when Woz found out he was just like "I wish he had just told me, I would've given him the money anyway"He's always been a great guy, dude. 
"IT WOZ JUST A PRANK, BRO"
clocks fired
I wonder if at some point we'll have to add another step in that progression with a guy with a crazy VR device on his face.
He needs to get fatter
Isn't the point of a text or email that it can wait a bit? Sometimes you have to email specific info but usually if it's urgent you call. Otherwise, wait. Anything else is rude.
Not entirely accurate.People didn't walk around talking in to newspapers while they walked down the street (or even reading them for the most part)I'm sure a large portion of the site knows what it was like walking down the street growing up in a time before cell phones and can tell you it *is* different now than then.Sure sitting around on a bus people may have had their nose in a magazine instead of a phone, but walking around? No.Not saying for good or ill; but times *have* changed in that regard.
At the time he was "the young guy from ER".
That's how he's famous to the millennials?  How about Dr. Carter?
exactly, Xerox fucked themselves pretty well.
> Exposing yourself to as many environments as you can is very important if you want to be a great ~~developer.~~ *person*
Wozniak left Apple before OS X..  before Linux.. before the Internet.
Superman don't need no sky, he can just go into space and fry badman from orbit with his laser eyes.
I'm actually surprised that people are so sure Batman even has a chance. Isn't Superman like basically a God? The guy can turn back time.Batman is like a rich and clever. Is that really enough to take down a demigod? Just seems like it wouldn't be a balanced fight at all, without some clever writing making sure Batman stands a chance.

Jobs and his curable cancer. 
iOS 4, actually, and even then, it only worked on the devices with higher-end RAM. My 16GB iPod touch (2nd Gen) couldn't handle it without a jailbreak.
At the time of the demo the OS was not even stable enough to make it through the time the keynote would take. To great frustrations of the venue staff and apple engineers and most of all Steve Jobs.
Was the camera quality that good? The experience, for sure, with the big screen, but I think my Sony Ericsson still took better pictures.. 
How about No Video Recording, No Camera Flash, No Front Facing Camera, a screen resolution of 320 x 480 (on  3.5" screen which we all thought was huge!)
The original iPhone didn't even allow for third party apps at launch. The hardware was great at the time but the software took some time to mature. 
> before it nukes itself at the hardware level.This may pose a problem.
How does it do that? Does it have a built-in miniexplosive or something?
Windows shot first!
That's the catch. I'm paying $200 a month with an hour commute or I can pay $1500 a month living close to work.I have a decent job, I can afford it, I just don't want to. 
> it doesn't add that much to my lifeFTFY
As someone who had their band's music pre-loaded on the Zune, I'll just assume this includes my songwriting and guitar playing and say "Thanks man"(it's the only payment I'll ever get)
That's how I felt when I had a windows phone.  Such a beautiful piece of hardware and software, but nobody cared.

Jobs died of pancreatic cancer. Why do people keep saying it's curable?  Less than 5% of people diagnosed with it even survive more than 2 years.
> it only worked on the devices with higher-end RAM. My 16GB iPod touch (2nd Gen) couldn't handle it without a jailbreak.You had to jailbreak it to download more RAM ? 
I found it pretty intriguing how they did that presentation with 3 or 4 iPhones and that they had figured out what to do when in order to not crash the phone on-stage. It's literally how I do my presentations in college. Good to know I can still do this later in life and ~~not~~ make a billion bucks.
Oh come on. At the time the original iPhone display was the most gorgeous display on a mobile device bar none, only the PSP came close to it in quality.
I saw a device with a capacitor that would discharge and fry the chips. Not sure if it was the Ironkey.
Seriously. I didn't realize just how big of a quality of life impact long commutes were having at my new job until I noticed my commutes dropping from 60 minutes down to 30 during holiday seasons. It really feels great coming home with way more energy from shorter commutes. 
Cool! Which band/song?
wow, Ethan
Wow, that's really depressing. 
That's **really** good for MS Paint.
Ironically, you needed to jailbreak so you could enable ZRAM/swap file and technically get more RAM. Still didn't help all that much though. 128MB was a bitch.

i don't really like the statement of "Why are you so worried if you've got nothing to hide?" Not only is it moronic, but its moronic to assume that only the government has access. Chances are, if the government has a way to bypass, that opens up the possibility of anyone bypassing the security. Such as stated in the Apple letter.
Could you not just disconnect the capacitor first?
The Adored and I don't know which song, I've never actually encountered a Zune.  Probably called "Tell Me Tell Me""
great moves. keep it up. proud of you.
Depends on how you look at it. In the future we might have VR that can give you the feeling of physical contact. And then you could sit together and snuggle with someone halfway around the world. 
Did you ever get that to work? It was like a dark art. I never got any benefit from it.

Citizen, are you saying that the American Government is fallible? I can't believe you really think that our Government could ever be wrong! 
If you should ever personally get asked that question, the easy reply is to simply start asking increasingly personal questions. Or, if you want to be a bit more polite, ask for PINs and passwords and other login data. As soon as they refuse to answer, they've answered their own question.

Too bad she died young and he's just interacting with an echo of some stored behavioral patterns. After all the years, he slowly forgets what the original her was really like. Unfortunately, he doesn't notice.   
Yeah we can even have virtual reality vacations, where instead of spending thousands of dollars to fly to Thailand to sit on a crowded, hot beach and get a sunburn, you can just check in to a vacation VR place where you sit in a chair under a UV light and they feed your brain the sensations of being on a pristine, untouched beach, the warm sand between your toes, sipping on a delicious exotic fruit cocktail, and then diving into turquoise, crystal-clear waters.Then they unplug you 6 hours later and you go back to your shitty job!
Did playing a man so badly bullied by his co-workers have an effect on you IRL?Also, your dog is awesome.
Hey Jim Gengurch! I love your acting in many shows I've seen, especially P&R. The finale after special refers to you being the most different from your character. Which other actors are most distant from their characters and most similar?! Also, how much do you miss P&R?!
Did you start this AMA by going to alta vista and typing in **"Please take me to Reddit?"**
Do you actually know how to play piano? 
Hey Tim,You've kind of been defined by your role on *Parks & Rec*, but you've had a long and impressive career. Is there one movie or TV show you've been in -- other than *Middle Man* -- that you'd recommend to people looking to see a little more of you? A performance you're particularly proud of?
What was Jerry's worst day at the office?
Hi Jim!At one point in P&R, it is referenced that your character has a very large penis. Does that take any method acting on your part?
Jim. My wife's good friend in Downers Grove was raising funds for a pitbull rescue and you quietly donated ~$1,500 for this noble cause. She only noticed because of the generous amount. You didn't say a word about it. This was like 5 or 6 years ago?I'm here to give you your due recognition. You're good people. 
Hi!!  Who was the funniest cast member on Parks and Rec and who was the most fun to work with?  Also how similar is Nick Offerman to Ron Swanson? (in my head they're the same person)  Thanks!!
Tim,With this being described as a "black comedy", how was this role different for you in comparison to past roles, and how do you feel audiences will react?
Was it difficult playing such a wholesome and naive character, when a lot of your other work is so dark and twisted? It's great you have such a wide range.
Have you been able to keep any interesting props or memorabilia from any of your roles?
First Aubrey played a character named Lenny in 'Legion' and now you're playing Lenny in 'Middle Man'.Who do you think the next one from Parks and Recreation to play a Lenny...?Personally, I'm hoping it is Li'l Sebastian.
Was the cast of Parks and Rec overly nice to you off camera to make up for how Jerry was treated on camera?
Who smells better, Chris Pratt or Rob Lowe?  
Who was your favourite director and actor that you've worked with?
How often do you pull a classic Jerry move?Also: I remember seeing you in a Castle episode, and I swear it was the most amazing thing I've ever seen, as I decided that your character (who was a butcher with anger management issues, if I recall correctly) was Jerry Gergich trying to process everything he was put through in Parks and Rec.
Would you rather fight 100 Aziz-sized Li'l Sebastians or 1 Li'l Sebastian-sized Aziz?Credit to /u/GodDamnNameDoesNotFi for the tweak to my original question
Hi Jim! If you could be anything other than an actor, what would you be? 
Was the makeout-fest on Late Night planned between you and Aubrey or just improvisation?
Hi Jim! So Chris Pratt's Kardashian cumback joke has basically become legendary. Were there any other funny moments like that one that didn't make the blooper reel? 
Hey Larry, what did you type into Altavista to get here?
What is your favorite pizza topping?
Ask you anything, eh?Okay. Let's put this question to bed: Is the reason that Gayle was with Jerry/Terry/Larry/etc., was because of his massive penis?According to Dr. Harris (whom Chris Traeger said was literally the meanest person he's ever met), it's the biggest penis he's ever seen. I mean, he didn't even know if you had mumps. He forgot to look. He was distracted. By the largest penis. He had ever seen.
We know of your enormous member thanks to your PandR checkup, but what I really want to know is did you have mumps? 
What was kissing Aubrey Plaza like?
Hi Jim.  Altoids or Tic-Tacs that night on Seth Meyers? 
Hey Jim, I can't wait to see your new movie, but I'm afraid I have to ask, do you ever see the Parks and Rec gang reuniting in the future?Maybe for a reboot or even a film? Would love to see you all back one last time.
Hi Jim, i just want to say that i love your acting, you're extremely funny. The scene when Chris is proposing to Ann while Larry is choking in the back is one of my favorites of the show!Congratulations on the emmy!My question is, Was there any Jerry in the Parks and rec crew?
I loved you on the show! Who was your best bud on set?
Hi Jim! Thank you for taking the time to answer some questions.  How do you think your character Lenny and Jerry/Terry/Larry would get along?  If you chose a boys day out for them where would you go?
Who would win in a mud wrestling match, nick offerman, or chris Pratt? 
Hi Jim! Are you a Billy Joel fan? You were married to his ex wife! Also, murinal! Lol
Hi Jim!Has DJ Roomba come back to haunt you with Black Eyed Peas yet?
Off the top of your head, what was the funniest parks and rec scene you participated in shooting?
Hi Jim!Do you and Chris Pratt keep in touch? Do you keep in touch with the other P&R cast members? 
Which actor/actress on Parks and Rec was most similar to their character?
What do you enjoy doing in your free time? 
Is your dog Cerberus?
Hey Jim. I love your doggos! What are their favorite things to do?
I was watching Rosanne and was delighted to see you in a random episode. Do have a any cool memories form back then on set and what do you think about the reboot?
What was your favorite "Gerry-Burn"? Mine was - i know it's kind of basic - the fart attack. 
I loved Jerry (Terry, Gerry) on Parks and Rec. We're there any jokes you made in the outtakes that you wished they used and what were they?
Are you and Aubrey still a thing? Who was your favorite guest star on parcs?
I'm pretty clumsy, so naturally I'm the Jerry of my friend groups. How can I avoid this or how can I not let it get to me?
Do you have any thoughts on the passing on Parks and Rec guest star, Glenne Headly?
Thanks for taking your time Tim!  What do you think about the shows final season?
Yes.  My dog is AWESOME!!!  ;)  As far as being bullied on the show having an effect on my real life I would say no.  The bullying was only on camera.  The minute the director yelled cut I was definitely one of the "in crowd".  lol
I love that we eventually find out that he has a beautiful family and has achieved awesome life goals ! 
His name is Lord Shelton. And his rectum is fine. 
Please don't say Jeremy Jamm.... 
Is there another way?  ;)
Not a note.  lol  :)
Well geez why can't he say his new role?  It's what brought him here in the first place.  
I think the "mugging" was a pretty bad day for Jerry.  He knew that if they found out what really happened (dropped a burrito in the creek) that he would take hell for days.  I love how he came up with the mugging story.  To think that he thought he could get away with it kills me.  :)
I love playing a Jerry type character.  I'm sure it will be something I'll do forever.  The problem in Hollywood is that they can easily put you in a certain box. Typecasting like you mentioned.  It's just the nature of the biz. The gift of Middle Man is that I get to step out of that box and really dig into a deeply disturbed character.  :)
Great question.  From what I understand one of the writers were standing next to me at the urinal and thought it was time to mix real life and TV life.  Made perfect sense to me.  lol  ;)
He wrote this a little bit ago:    >When the writers realized that Jerry was going to be the office punching bag they also realized that they had to give him some reason not to blow his head off. lol They decided that ultimately Jerry would have the best life of any one of the characters.  Jerry's wife and kids adored him and thought he did no wrong.  Don't forget...they also gave him a huge penis.  I like when real life and TV life come together.  ;)    He's answering questions, but some of his answers are getting buried. 
They were all funny.  What a lot of people don't know is that after every scene we did a "fun run".  That's where we got to play around and do whatever we wanted while telling the same story that was on the page.  Most of us had an improv background so it made sense to let us play together.  We did that EVERY DAY.  I think it's one of the reasons we stayed so close as a cast.  That being said...Chris Pratt is so off the cuff funny that it's crazy.  Really really funny.  I had fun working with each and ever one of them.  That's not Hollywood bullshit.  I loved them all...and still do.  :)
Nick Offerman is actually super liberal, whereas Ron Swanson is super not.
I was listening to an interview with him and Ron was based off nick but everything is greatly exaggerated. 
It's totally different than any other role I've played.  My character Lenny starts out in the same vein as Jerry from Parks.  A sweet, nice guy.  Unfortunately for Lenny he makes one terrible mistake and on his way to Las Vegas he picks up a hitch hiker (played by Andrew J. West).  This turns his life upside down.  From that moment on we slowly watch the mental unravelling of an otherwise normal dude.  Playing the character was terrifying because if I didn't make it work the film doesn't work.  From what I hear I did it justice.  :)
I try to keep something from every shoot I'm on.  Most of it just sits in a box.  I figure someday when I'm old (well...older) I'll want to take a trip down memory lane.  I have the Jerry Gergich Conference Room RIP plaque on my desk.  I see it every day.  :)
I wish I knew what happened to all the amazing murals that were in city hall. 
You nailed it.  Li'l Sebastian will be starring as Lenny in "Of Mice and Men".  Can't wait to see it.  :)
Nick Offerman as Lenny in "Of Mice and Men" would be interesting 
I wouldn't say overly nice.  We were all just good friends doing good work and laughing our asses off every day.  :)
This is definitely the most important question I will answer today.  The answer is Rob Lowe.  I only say that because he has his own fragrance line and it would make sense that he smells better than the rest of us.  :)
How many fights does your username start?
My favorite director was a guy who started as our editor on Parks.  He had also worked on The Office.  His name is Dean Holland.  He really understood all of our characters and knew how to get the best out of us.My favorite actor that I've worked with is too broad of a question.  I've fallen in love with so many people I've worked with over the years.  By "love" I mean I loved being around them.  :)
LOL  That's a great analogy.  I'm not sure that's what I was thinking at the time but who knows?  As far as pulling classic Jerry moves....every day.  We all do.I won an Emmy last month and as I was walking up the steps to get the award I just kept thinking "don't fall...don't fall". If I had fallen it would have been another "Jerry" moment that I would hear about forever even though I won the award for a different show.  lol  :)
Was this in the moment or preplanned or what???
why did this happen
I typed "please bring me to a site on the interwebs called reddit that will let me answer questions".  ;)
I get my pizza with sausage, onion, extra sauce and crispy.  mmmmm  Now I've got to have pizza today.  :)
YES!  Put it to bed.  ;)
I've never been able to see if I have mumps.  When I go to look I'm always distracted by the largest penis I have ever seen.  ;)
Nothing but nature that night.  I didn't know that was going to happen.  Aubrey leaned over and said "you wanna make out during the Li'l Sebastian song".  Within .01 seconds I said yes.  As a guy who doesn't get roles as the romantic lead I listened to Rob Lowe's advice.  Just follow whatever the girl does.  So when we started kissing and I felt Aubrey tongue make its move I knew all bets were off.  lolI'll be on Seth Meyers next Wednesday, June 14th.  Check it out.  Maybe Aubrey will surprise me and we'll make out again.  mmmm  ;)
I'm obviously not him but I think the show ended perfectly. I don't know if they can top that ending.
My best bud was Retta (Donna).  Our trailers were back to back so we spent a lot of time going between them.  Our characters were not initially brought on as series regulars so I think that bonded us right off the bat.  We were both in limbo together while things were working themselves out.  I had lunch with Retta last week.  She's one of my favs in life.  :)
The popular answer is going to be Offerman but IMO it's Aubrey Plaza.
You saw me in Roseanne?  That's awesome.  Unfortunately I've never been on that show.  lol  But seriously, I used to watch Roseanne and would have loved to have been on it...but sadly no.  You must have me confused with some other shockingly handsome well hung guy.  ;)  As far as the reboot goes...I'm not sure.  Some things are better left alone.  :)
Aubrey and I dated for ten years before we eventually broke up due to a side relationship I was having with Joan Calamezzo.  It wasn't easy on any of us and I take full responsibility for the breakup.  That being said it didn't help with Aubrey started dating Joe from the Sewage Department.  That really hurt.  ;)  lol
Of course you were, barry
> "in crowd"Now I'm wondering who was in the "out crowd"
When the writers realized that Jerry was going to be the office punching bag they also realized that they had to give him some reason not to blow his head off. lol They decided that ultimately Jerry would have the best life of any one of the characters.  Jerry's wife and kids adored him and thought he did no wrong.  Don't forget...they also gave him a huge penis.  I like when real life and TV life come together.  ;)
Also was great that when he was at home he was super witty, had great reflexes etc. Honestly I've always considered that to be a master stroke of the show. 
Why else do they bully him? They're jealous
He also has the largest penis that doctor had ever seen.
I tweeted at him saying "shut up Jerry" once and he responded saying "okay u/mrsp00pybutth0le :)" :') I still feel bad 
> I would rather have someone come up and ask for a pic than sneak around trying to get it. For some reason that seems much more invasive to me. :)That's interesting to hear, because I suspect that in their minds, going up to you and bothering you for a picture would be more invasive. 
Sooo... when's the sequel coming?Ann and Chris in Michigan? House of Cards-esque drama with Leslie and Ben? Full House with you and Gail?Please. I need this.
You've been JAMMED!  ;)
**I'VE BEEN JAMMED.**
God, Jerry you don't deserve the internet.
You and H Jon Benjamin should put out an album together then.  
I loved your cameo in Brooklyn 99 as the homophobic cop in Florida.
Was it the guy who played the doctor?
I don't actually know if he has Mumps, I didn't look.
That's pretty much it.  Nick is such a great guy and so is Ron.  They just took Nick to an nth degree.  What he did with that character was something I have never seen on another show.  I've always been confused on why he never received an Emmy for his work.  :)
Kinda like a pro wrestler 
> (well...older)You are becoming one of my favorite people. 
Jerry, I hate to break it to you but... Li'l Sebastian is dead 
Damn.  Should have read this before my previous comment.  I guess Nick and Lil' Sebastian are going to have to fight this one out.  :)
I'm giggling just thinking about it...
Not a lot, but it does get a lot of comments like "I had to downvote you because you don't like the same TV show I do."  
Nice humble brag, Jerry. 
From what I've read, Aubrey asked Jim during a break while taping if he wanted to do it during the song.  I mean, who's going to say no to that anyway?
You have been banned from /r/OnionHate
I love this because Donna also showed Jerry so much warmth on the show (in her own way). It makes me so happy that you're pals outside the show.
I figured the popular answer probably would've been Chris Pratt but I was kinda hoping it was Aziz Ansari
Given that the part of April Ludgate was written *specifically* for Aubrey Plaza, I would agree. 
Classic Barry. 
Brendanawicz, obviously
Counselman JAM
Jean-Ralphio
> they also gave him a huge penis.  I like when real life and TV life come together.  ;)Damn Jerry, you such a pimp.
I completely agree.  The episode where Jerry retires and Leslie comes over to talk with him because she felt like they didn't give him a good farewell was one of my favorites.  Leslie sees how Jerry is adored by h is family.  She also sees that he's awesome around his house.  He's funny, smart, quick reflexes.  Leslie acts likes she's been thrown to some other dimension.  The writers on Parks always knew how to handle each situation.  I thought it was a brilliant idea.  :)
100% agree with you. The coffee-mug flip is one of my favorite scenes in the series.
Was brilliant and maybe among the zenith period of the show 
Many people have told me that they work without someone who is basically the office punching bag.  I seems that every office needs that person to take the fall for everything.  Unfortunately for Jerry it was his burden to take on.  That being said...I do believe that Jerry truly loved all of his co-workers and knew that deep down they all had his back.  As much as family was most important to Jerry he also adored all the people he worked with.  Even when they weren't being especially kind.  
True Dat!!!!!!  ;)
I remember that tweet.  sniff sniff  lol  ALL GOOD!!!!!  :)
God dammit Terry the line is "You just got Jammed".
I didn't know I wanted this.Now I know I'll never have it.Why do you do this?Who hurt you?
I'm just now watching it and the surprise cameos are one of the best parts of the show.  Between Mr. Oheir and like every side character from Its Always Sunny, its been amazing.
So, everyone agrees this is a Tom quote without argument, right?
This guy FUCKS. 
I was distracted
The part when you found out he has brothers blew me away.
Dont use me in your Tall Boys pic!
he really is Andy isn't he?
Dunno, we see a very different side of him on Master of None, which I think is probably closer to him IRL.
I once had a Lyft driver who worked on Parks & Rec as a crew member. We asked him if any of the actors were secret jerks or anything like that. He said everyone was great, but the biggest difference was that Aziz was much quieter and more reserved than his character. 
Classic Larry.
Classic Other Barry.
More like BrendanaQUITZ.
He did not have favorable things to say from the show.
Technically I'm homeleeeessss~*
J-R was easily my favorite character on that show, and Mona Lisa was a close second. *I got run over by a Lexussssss*
I read this in Tom's voice
+1000 points for actually responding to comments. kudos to you Jim, and to /u/CIPHERSTONE 
I remember watching a segment where the cast talked about how bad they felt about the constant bullying of Jerry, because in real life they all love Jim, so that's why they wrote him the perfect life outside of work. Hot wife, loving family, all that. They also said Jim probably the most twisted dude IRL. 
Eggs, bacon, and toast! 
The absolute confusion on Leslie's face. Good times. 
Hey guys, I',m getting interested in rewatching. Which season and episode we're talking about?
The relationship between Ben and Jerry (heh) was so awesome. I loved how Ben was so much more conscious of how terrible Jerry was treated by everyone, and then Jerry noticed that Ben noticed, and would stop Ben from intervening and in a subtle way would let him know it's OK and he's used to it.Such awesome chemistry between characters in that show.
That's a very "Jerry" view of the world, John.
I knew exactly what that was going to be before I even clicked. And, just like Gail, I was not disappointed. 
Fuuuck. That played on blast at a Subway I'm at."THAT MAN HAS THE LARGEST PENIS I HAVE EVER SEEN"
I always figured it was because of his time share in Muncey.
That's an interesting insight.  Yes.  When they're making fun of a characters physical attributes they are also making fun of the actors in a way.  Personally I've never been bothered by it.  I've been a big guy all my life so weight jokes come with the territory.  That being said maybe I should get myself some therapy and figure some shit out.  lol  :)
Or Toby from the Office. I know he's an adult, but he gets destroyed on an every episode basis. Funny, but it's gotta take a toll on your psyche.
Who other than Artemis? I've only recently started watching it's always sunny so I have probably missed the connections !
This. Guy. Fucks. Tell me about all the fucking you've been doing
I expected the scene where he's talking to the doctor and said he keeps wiping and wiping. 
What makes that so awesome is that I read somewhere (or maybe watched a video) where one of the writers said they were genuinely pissed at him because they couldn't have written a funnier line.
I agree.  Master of None (which is BRILLIANT) is more like Aziz in my opinion.  I love watching him do his thing on that show.  He also writes it with Alan Yang who was one of our Parks writers.  Two really smart guys for sure.  :)
That's fair, Master of None has been awesome so far and he seems super genuine in the role of Dev.
Classic Cheryl/Carol
Did he quit or did the producers not ask him to return?
The showrunners also did not have favorable things to say about him.  It says quite a bit that Brendanaquitz is never mentioned again after he leaves, as if the writers are just erasing him from memory.
I'd just like to note that your choice of punctuation captures his distinctive vocal tone *extraordinarily* well.
Boom! Two ankle bracelets. The judge said it's the first time he's ever had to do that. Uh, ja boiz a question on the baaaaar exaaaaam~!
Pills baby!!!!
I just realized they had Tom and Jerry :O
I'd like to start my day the Gergich way. Now give me all the bacon and eggs you have. 
That plus Ben's near obsession with how he was married to his wife were just perfect.
S5 ep9"Ron and Diane"
By the later seasons Ben was essentially a permenant break in the fourth wall. He was an extension of the viewer, reacting how a normal person would to all the ludicrous behavior. And I loved that.
There was only ever one possibility. And yet, it's always worth the rewatch.
Yes.  A time share in Muncie can certainly sway a girls head.  But Jerry's other "head" is what probably turned her head.  lol
Found the guy not from Indiana....
I'm understanding now why everyone on the cast of Parks and Recreation has always had such wonderful things to say about you. You have a wicked sense of humour and such a positive outlook. 
I always thought she was beautiful...
He wrote a lot of his storyline
Well Toby was one of the writers and later the showrunner, so you'd have to think he was ok with doing it to himself.
Garry dies in the end.  Jesus Christ, Barry.  Can you even read?
Classic Cherlene
Money please! 
Also Ben and Jerry
Except Tom is the little brown one and Jerry is the big grey one...
They also had Anne and Andy. Like Raggedy Anne and Andy.
Add to that Ben's "coming out" about liking Larry. The way the show made such a seemingly simple situation sooo strained and controversial was art.
I was really hoping they were going to answer that question before the series finale.  Ben brought it up so much, that I figured they had to answer it.
"Does she have, like, a disease? Is she dying?" 
Damn, Jerry. Never knew you had all these dirty jokes in you.
From what I've read, they planned on her being played by a different actress every episode to show how unmemorable she was. But they decided that the audience wouldn't get it, and dropped the idea.
Actually, Paul Lieberstein disliked being on camera, so Toby usually had very few lines in the episodes he wrote. I think Mindy Kaling is responsible for a lot of Toby's shining moments.
Really? I didn't know that. TIL. I suppose that would make it a lot easier to handle it.I was under the impression it was all BJ Novak. Hmmm.. learn something new every day.
I find many writers who insert themselves into shows really try and make fun of themselves. The creator of Workaholics always makes subtle jokes about whatever ~~Kyle~~Karl is doing at the time. I think he's the writer...
They did. Jerry has a huge penis.
I thought it was that they really liked the second actress, Mae Whitman, and decided to keep her on.  And most of the comments about Mayonegg were more about how unmemorable she is rather than any specific features, so I don't think it would have been quite as difficult as if they'd been picking on her for a gap in her teeth or the way she walked. 
Everyone who worked in the annex early on, not in the last season, was a writer. It let them not need to be on screen at all times but still in the show!
Paul Lieberstein who played Toby was higher than BJ in the hierarchy of things. He was an executive producer and at one point the showrunner. BJ was recruited after the initial conceptualizing and pitching was done and he came in with zero TV writing experience. Paul is also Greg Daniels brother in law iirc. The idea to give Paul a role came from how slow he was in the writers room. It was basically the employees hazing their boss into the show. 
The office definitely had a Barry, but I can't really remember him.
He also said he used to look like IIRC Chris before he married Gayle in one episode. Dude was a catch. 
I knew they were all writers, but I never put together why it made sense they were all together. No idea how I didn't put that together. Thanks!
1) Are you in direct control (editor or author) of:-Wikileaks.org-@wikileaks twitter-@WLTaskForce twitter2) Why the change in tone / editorializing on social media from around the elections to current? This is based on my perception as a follower/devotee to the cause of making what is dark light, and correcting falsehoods to truth. 
Why have you never released the leaks on the Russian government announced years ago? Why did you attack the Panama papers when they showed dodgy money flowing into Russian coffers? Do you bear any weight of conscience for the deaths of  pro democracy activists in Belarus after your friend Israel Shamir gave Wikileaks documents to the Belarusian dictator? 
How's the coffee in the embassy?Also: Does ANYONE notice this is happening right as cabinet hearings are happening? 
Why Hannity?
Can you explain your whole October?/r/DICKSOUTFORASSANGE
Julian, is there a plan in place in case Wikileaks ever becomes compromised? How will we know if it happens?
As a mod from /r/whereisassange I ask this question for our community. Most of us were/are legitimately concerned with your welfare. We felt like we were dismissed by you and Wikileaks even being called part of a "Black PR campaign". What do you think of our group which formed because we were not allowed to ask questions about your welfare?
i clicked on this ama to see if this was answered. i don't really follow wikileaks but this seemed legitimately concerning.
Take it for what it's worth, but he said elsewhere that the hashes are of the plaintext....yeah.
OutoftheLoop here: can some explain what this is? 
Was this one answered in the livestream?
I think this new trend of video ama's is rubbish. I come here to read, not look at video. 
Wikileaks twitter linked to a conspiracy site which claims Hillary had a seizure AND sent hand signals to Lester Holt during the debate (truepundit) to push the idea that Hillary wanted to "drone Assange." This random sketchy right wing propaganda site became the "source" for this report that got reported the world over because of Wikileaks.That's just an example
Surprise, surprise, he didn't address your question...
>   added 6 new users to the moderation team who he stated were the first to send him a him private messages volunteering their helpWait, what? This seems like a remarkably unwise way to decide your moderators? 
I have not been in contact with any Reddit moderators nor am I aware of our people having being in contact, but it is theoretically possible that someone in WikiLeaks has but did not think it significant enough to bring to my attention.
Here4Popcorn is a shill, calling it.
Assange just answered this on livestream, to paraphrase:They were the victim of attacks and the only remaining copy was on an encrypted backup laptop. The funds were to decrypt the laptop, not the video.
> Why did you attack the Panama papers when they showed dodgy money flowing into Russian coffers? Can you source this? I remember it vaguely but wasn't able to find it when I last went looking. I'd like to know of a specific source for my usage. 
He was dragging out answers on some questions until other questions he wanted to skip where outvoted, but it ended up not working out and he then went to the the end of the comments to cherry pick questions from there - this was a shitshow!
I know I'm late to this party, but I also want to point out that it's impossible to set your gmail password to 'password'
He only answered 6 questions and typed a total of 14 sentences (if I count one word sentences).So I think you're not going to get this one answered here, as useful as an answer would be. 
This is what I find troubling. When you're soliciting specific leaks you're removing any illusion of being unbiased. You're actively targeting specific people and promoting your own specific agenda.
We have never confirmed or denied a source. We have occasionally stated broad properties about who a source is or is not where we felt it was crucial to do so (to prevent the risk of war or the undermining of the publication). The interview was not with RT it was for Dartmouth and a UK broadcaster. It was then sold, somewhat irritatingly, to RT.
As an add on, why did your RT show never say a word about Russian dissidents? Surely they are as relevant to free information flow as food orders from the DNC?
Just commenting that this needs to be answered.  Wikileaks trust finally eroded for a lot of us after the targeted releases this year.WL is about the free flow of information and releasing everything/anything after vetting - not political pandering.
This is a question that has to be answered. Wikileaks is supposed to be about unbiased and transparent information for the public. However, in the recent years and even more so during the election cycle and leading up to PEOTUS taking office it's been clear there is a bias.
Fantastic question, following in hopes of an answer.
To add to this, what is Julian's understanding of what occurred on the 17th of October?
this one is important.  A PGP signed message only shows that someone has that key, but the INABILITY to sign a PGP message shows that he does not have that key.  
He just skipped you altogether....
It's not him...it's a filthy SYNTH.
Can't be the only one that laughed at "nonce value"Obviously is tech speak but I am not a clever man so I have no idea what it means 
This is very clever and well thought out. Questions like this are why I love reddit. I never would have thought to ask anything like this. I sincerely hope that of all the questions asked, this series gets answered the most. 
I'm not trying to imply any of my bias toward Hannity or Fox News. I tried to use the least amount of words as possible to ensure that. I'm just curious as to why Mr. Assange's recent interviews have been with Hannity. If he wants to answer, I'd still like to know.
Is this AMA his first "public" appearance since his disappearance? If so, it's a pretty weird way to come back...
Compromised like... I don't know, tweeting Pizzagate nonsense and selling "lock her up" merchandise?
He will never answer anything like this because you are correct and he is a piece of shit.
Can you explain for the curiosity of those of us that don't follow anything wiki leaks related, what does this all mean?
That's so fucking retarded, holy shit.Why not just provide hashes for both?
Indeed. Not really a Reddit AMA if it's on Twitch.
This is good that you're doing this but for ducks sake can't reddit employ someone to do this fir them?
WLTaskForce has been harassing journalists, threatening to sue critics for libel, and threatening to make doxxing lists of people. They've been trying to use LinkedIn to slander people for ever working with government or talking to people in government etc.It's like the brownshirts. These neo-fascists should be banned from twitter. **Their goal is not to release information to make people informed. It's to release information to undermine democracy and replace it with Russian-aligned fascism.**
Folks who frequent r/wikileaks just call them shills and not mods and are almost certain that the sub is compromised...WL itself is still up for debate. Hopefully the AMA settles it.
Okay, /r/WikiLeaks is a scam then.
Thank you for typing out your answer! i hate video amas
That's pretty much exactly what OP did, bruh. 
Broke Wikileaks encryption? These people know how to use PKI and, I am certain, correct encryption techniques. Something stinks here.If breaking current strong encryption methods was so easy, governments would not be making laws against the use of such technologies.I'm suspicious.
They've become a partisan organization. It's pretty obvious at this point.
I feel like claiming WikiLeaks is unbiased at this point is a hard argument to make, to be honest.
Technically the wikileaks tweet meets our standard for public proof. We're also confident he is who he says he is based on various emails and phone calls. Obviously given the extreme situation here, users are going to want him to go above and beyond our normal proof standards, which is why the reddit admins have worked with twitch to bring us the new streaming video integration.
I just tried it, and not only that, but it will not allow 'p@ssw0rd'.  I tried 'Runner4567' and it was happy with that, however.
Why did you insinuate Seth Rich leaked the DNC documents?
Because that's how you end up with polonium in your tea.
Do you want to lose that sweet Russian protection? Cos thats how you end up in Putin's gulag
> WL is about the free flow of information and releasing everything/anything after vetting - not political pandering.Er, should be about.
So far, it seems like he took this question and answered a different question that he wanted to answer.I guess he is just a politician like the rest of them.
> "If I have nothing to hide, then I have nothing to fear" I haven't met someone who says this but doesn't have a password protected phone, laptop or will let folks just ~~said~~ swipe through their pictures yet
Troll Trace irl 
It was my birthday!
PGP signed shoe on head or assange is dead.
Please eli5 what you are /u/g2n are talking about. Thanks  
Yes he did. He skipped the top three questions and went straight to the question involving how his October was.
Total novice in AMA and most this stuff, but the first thing I was looking for was that "proof" shot everyone does when they do an AMA....Did I miss it here? Is it not done everytime like I thought? Am i just dumb and asking nonsense?
A cryptographic nonce is just an arbitrary number or string that is used once. It is there to prevent a signed message prepared before this AMA.
And here I am, liking reddit for Mr. Poopy Butthole references.
It's not even fake news it's just a random fucking idiot posting bullshit
It means that the files were not posted through the normal method. They could have been put up by someone else, or be a form of distress signal that wikileaks has been infiltrated, or maybe just a mistake. But the refusal to acknowledge it indicates it's probably not the last one.
or, you know, the entire point of providing the same hashes is to prove that it is the same payload... any deviation from this, no matter how handwaved or explained away it is, is literally the only proof we have of tampering
No they fired that person a while ago.
Im struggling to think of a *less* secure method of doing it, which is beautifully ironic, for a sub like Wikileaks.Madness, I say, sir! Madness! 
The sub is completely taken over by pro Trump nonsense, of course it's compromised. 
Not JUST a scam - but a honeypot used to scoop up anyone wanting to leak potentially damaging information and give them to someone in government, all the while spreading propaganda.
What did you think it was? It's a fan site.
inb4 cancelled AMA
> ,We publish according to our promise to sources for maximum impactHow does that promise safeguard Wikileaks from selectively weaponising information for the personal benefits/desires of the person in charge? Appears that we have to give WikiLeaks all the privacy it desires, based on a nonbinding promise it made, and hope it is being used for right reasons...
All due respect, is everything ok on your side of Twitch? There's currently a WL animation playing and (rather vitriolic) spam comments but that's about it
Hey there, I was just wondering: why are the answers being distributed on twitch for this specific AMA? It seems kind of odd that an AMA with such controversial questions wouldn't have written and archived answers. Also thanks for all that you modpeople do :)
Now what the hell do you think he'll answer to this?
Didn't Assange claim that it wasn't from *any* state party? In other words, he's saying it was not someone working on behalf of a government. Unless someone has evidence to the contrary, it would seem odd to say he's lying.Wikileaks has been quite accurate, and if they were engaged in propaganda, that would indicate they're spreading fake information. The U.S. intelligence release on Russian hacking admitted that Wikileaks is authentic.
That is the end of this AMA
My fav response to that is "It's like saying I have nothing to say hence I do not need freedom of speech."
I love pooping with the door open. 
I like Snowden. I do not like Assange and do not consider battling other's privacy to be a particular improvement on the status quo. Actually, I think he's unrelentingly dogmatic and reminds me of the banana republic rebel leaders who would overthrow a dictator, then sit into their own brand of political throne for the next few decades without any reflection on the irony. Some underdog idealists must remain so.
The embassy's power and internet were cut. It wasn't restored for nearly a month and a half. /r/WikiLeaks mods all simultaneously disappeared and were replaced by new mods who ban anyone who suggests Wikileaks could be compromised. Many other normal Wikileaks activities have ceased since that date. Assange's lawyer has been barred from entering the embassy. Wikileaks has stopped PGP signing anything. The hashes of the encrypted insurance file have stopped. Wikileaks has become uncharacteristically polarized in its politics. To top it all off, Assange hasn't made a public appearance.
But if the shoe is on his head, it's off his foot. Still dead.
if your post gets edited, couldn't the admins just update the shasum?
They want Assange to prove cryptographically, in a way that can't be faked by other parties, that he is alive and well. 
Nope. You are asking for what we are. There is no proof at all yet and according to Julian and wikileaks, the only acceptable form of Proof of Life, is crytographically pgp signed messages and live streaming video. None of which has been produced in any way whatsoever. Not even a half assed attempt has been made.
unless of course, /u/g2n is a prepared messenger for a prepared message. 
How can we know Julian's private key is not compromised? (Genuine question)
That's what people mean by fake news. It's literally random idiots posting bullshit. People actually think this is legitimate news, just look at the comments at the bottom and the fact that *wikileaks retweeted this site*
From what I understand, the hashes for the plaintext files were published to prove to TPTB that Wikileaks has files TPTB really don't want to get out.>Look, I have this file with hash xxx.>So don't fuck with me or it will be published.
He is answering on live stream not in the thread. 
> How does that promise safeguard Wikileaks from selectively weaponising information for the personal benefits/desires of the person in charge?It doesn't. It enables them to do so when their handles see fit.
What the hell, that joke is lame as fuck
If you follow Wikileaks you'll see their twitter feed and press releases don't even pretend to be unbiased or devoted only to a blind resolve to release information. They now release information selectively and time these releases strategically to further selfish agendas, and litter their own stance with petty propaganda like that T-Shirt.It's a shame because a few years ago I was rooting for Julian Assange. Now he is exactly who he claimed to fight years ago.
Does triple parenthesis represent Judaism now?  I must be really out of the loop cause that whole comment just confuses me.
The wikileaks team is in control of the twitch channel right now - the graphic is coming from them. Hopefully they'll get things figured out soon. They are surprisingly technically challenged, considering who they are.
> That is the end of this incredibly weird AMA in which you have to focus all the time in order to somehow know what question he is now answeringFTFYYeah, I'll wait for the transcripts.
He's answering it now.
I love it when you poop with the door open.
Wait.......they did that?That's like 1 step short of murder.
technically, could /u/g2n be 'in on it' and this nonce actually be non-random? 
Thanks for the info, but how do we know Assange has a private key? And what should it be?
that's assuming that nobody got his private keys
This is basically Julian's own private warrant canary. If he won't provide it (as he has told us he would in the past) then he is comprimised. 
The far right propagandists have co-opted the term to muddy its actual meaning by using it to describe any report they disagree with.                          Please just call them tabloids. The century-old word for made-up-published-nonsense. Trump supporters read tabloids. Batboy. Alien pregnancy. Child sex dungeon in a pizza parlor. Tabloids.                 ps I've now seen Trumpets on the internet referring to CNN as a tabloid, so I guess they're reading my posts? 
What is TPTB?
Just like that shirts target audience. 
it's a dog whistle for jewish people commonly used among white supremacists.
Apologies for bothering you but would there be any way to tell the WL side to turn up his mic? Can barely hear him
am i a moron, i can't find a single answer from him on here, wtf are they?
Also the voter registration info of _literally almost every single woman in Turkey_
Yeah, it's not a perfect proof. 
What's to stop them from tampering with the file before giving out the number? 
The Powers That Be.
That's really weird, but I guess racists are inherently weird people.
We're working on it. They're not super easy to communicate with.
Well, it makes sense from their perspective. Most neo-nazi fascists believe that an elite cabal of Jews control all major sources of information and especially the main stream media (MSM). Textbooks, publishing, TV, movies, etc. They also believe that the Jews have huge amounts of either paid or purposely ignorant people spreading disinformation through social media. Triple parenthesis help identify who those people are, so you can ignore them. Because in their world, those people are shills or enemies. 
For a bunch of folks who think they're the master race, they sure do seem to hold the Jews in much higher esteem than themselves.
Who would win a battle to death, you or Ben Affleck?
The Bourne movies are easily my favourite series of movies ever. Were you reluctant to do a fourth or was it an easy decision?Also, you're my favourite actor and my mom is in love with you, just so you know. 
Hi Matt! What was your favorite show as a kid?
Hey Matt! You've been my favorite actor since the Bourne Identity. Can't wait for the new one.- How long does it take you to decide "yes" or "no" on a role when you read a script?- What are the ingredients of your ideal taco?
Hi, Matt. I'm really looking forward to the new Bourne film.My question: what does Julia Stiles smell like?
When should we expect Stuck On You 2? 
How much do you like Jimmy Kimmel?
What was it like working with Christopher Nolan?
I think the answer to that is clear and I'll let you fill in the blanks.
Thank you, and I'm glad I'm your favorite actor. You have my favorite user name of anybody I've ever seen. It was an easy decision. Once Paul Greengrass said he wanted to do it, I was in, but we didn't have a story. I mean it was nine years in the making because we didn't want to force it if it wasn't there, and so once we realized it was there we all jumped on board, but before that it was an agonizing process as we tried to figure out if there even was a story to tell. 
Yeah, so that article was sent to me. I might be the first person for whom a trillion movie dollars was spent to rescue, so obviously that will be a milestone, and I am actively looking for projects that could cost people money trying to come get me. Thank you.- How would you celebrate passing it?I think a big Reddit party would be the way to go.
With a mug like his, spare no expense! 
Scotty Doesn't Know!!! I hope he answers this
My favorite show as a kid was *Chips*, I loved Erik Estrada, Ponch and John, you know. I used to get on my bike, and my mother actually sewed blue lines down a pair of chinos that I had so that I could have the tan pants with the blue lines that the California highway patrol, and get on my Huffy and ride around the neighborhood.
"Come on Matt Damon, get me out of here!" I'm dying.
> come on Matt Damon, get me out of heream I hearing things or did he say this?
Happiness. 
Stuck Two You?
He's thinking, "God damn it. The studio fucked us by cock-chopping 30 absolutely necessary story-telling minutes off the film, and now it doesn't even make sense." 
I really wanted Jimmy Kimmel to ask a question on here. 
You look more like that dude on Friday Night Lights TV show
I love the Shooter. Matts best movie!
Props for these in depth answers man. Seriously. I also can't stop reading these in your voice 
How's your poker game?
This is from IMDB, so I wouldn't take it personally (assuming this is true):> Originally, Matt Damon (who Trey Parker and Matt Stone have admitted is really a "pretty cool guy") was going to be portrayed as intelligent and articulate, but when they saw the puppet, they noted that it made him "look retarded" and decided to portray him as such. 
I'm pretty sure they only did that because your puppet came out looking retarded.
Follow up, do you get people shouting "Matt Damon Matt Damon" in that voice if they see you on the street?
I think it's funny you linked to an answer on another site that came from his last AMA
>The problem there is that he just keeps giving himself the best roles
>he just keeps giving himself the best rolesAwesome. Only good friends bust balls like that.
So it wasn't really just you writing and Ben smoking joints on the couch? Family Guy lied to me.
It's not your fault
"The arbiter of taste" is a very insightful way to put it 
I agree but for what it's worth, I'd want you to win instead
> You have my favorite user name of anybody I've ever seen.        Ouch.
Good Guy Matt Damon. Answers the question, thinks of a follow up, and answers it too.
Oh, hell, you *do* know your audience, don't you?
Ain't no party like a Reddit party.
username checks out
That is an awesome answer. Thanks.
> By the end of the film, it has become **so widespread and popular** that Scotty's best friend Cooper is **able to use it as his cell phone ring tone**.Oh, the early 00s!
Yeah, Casey Affleck doesn't get anywhere *near* the love he deserves. Drowning Mona's kind of like this weird little comedy that no one remembers anymore, but he was fantastic in that.
Gone Baby, Gone is seriously one of my top 10 movies Casey's performance is stellar.
>Where James Bond always has the right gadget, Jason Bourne never does, so he's got to just improvise.You know, I never really thought about it this way, but that has got to be one of my absolute favorite things about your Bourne movies. 
And you are the only one I can envision filling this role!  Additionally, I'm relieved to hear directly from you that you don't go around whacking people with a rolled up magazine in real life.    Thanks for all of the films and entertainment -- can't wait to catch your latest!
Now *that's* how you answer a question about tacos
Your comment on tacos not being salads has likely impacted me more than anything else in the past decade
Why are you not allowed to have this taco? And who is trying to stop you?
Oh my god, I'm fanboying because matt Damon and I use the same hot sauce!!! Cholula you sultry mistress, no one can resist your temptations.
You can see him literally deflate as soon as he calls him Matt Damon
lmao what the fuck. It came out of nowhere and nearly killed me.
That's an astounding impact. Thanks for putting your celebrity to such an amazing use.
I just want to thank you for taking the time to answer the important questions like this. I feel like with all the craziness and violence going on that we're losing sight of what's important and that's the fact that a hot dog will never be a damned sandwiche. 
What do you smell like?
Thanks for answering my stupid question. I guess I could have asked you what it was like to work with her.
If that is truly the case, the director's cut on the DVD will redeem the film, right?  Hopefully.
fuck man...I miss robin.
I'm sure you're that person to a lot of people too.
> If gaming is the way to do that I'm all for looking into it, but nobody has asked me as of yet.Hey u/TheIronGiants, I would legit contact his agent (available via googles), reference this answer, demonstrate you are legit, give a $$$ quote, and see if he wants to do it. That's how you do a pitch he can take seriously.
I WILL WASTE YOU!
The scene where he breaks down while watching Barefoot Contessa is one of my all time favorites
Yeah, I'm glad to see such solid answers. Guy seems down-to-earth.
Matt Damon and Hillary Swank are the same person
Looks like somebody who would deflate a football.
I'd love to be a fly on the wall the moment they saw the puppet for the first time.
Yeah, it was cheaper to rewrite the character as retarded than to remake the marionette.
I've also heard this was the reason.  They felt the puppet as made looked heavily retarded, and they just went with it.  It's part of their genius.
Oh my god, what happened to Matt Damon this time?!We have to save him, Reddit!
/u/pitchforkemporium
Hey guys! We actually got this answer on video so we will share it with you in a couple days. Hold the pitchforks for now. ;) 
Seriously, this should have been addressed.  But maybe it was just a case of him forgetting.  But also, maybe it wasn't him.  His writing style looks and sounds the same in this AMA and at least in that linked answer, so there's that.
When I saw he had an AMA, I immediately shouted MAHT DAYMON in my head. It's permanently ingrained. 
I think it's funny that in the answer he gave above, he clearly doesn't remember the answer he gave before.
So I guess Matt wouldn't be interested in a role as Robin, or..?
friends for 35 years.. honestly never knew that they were friends for that long until today. that's like BFFFFF status.
It's not your fault.
Are you the guy who couldn't spell his name correctly?
This is the greatest moment in my life.
> redditor for 4 minutes
This would be so much funnier if you hadn't created this account for the joke; plan ahead next time!
Now I know why we keep saving him. Godspeed, Matt. God. Speed.
I don't think he knows what a Reddit party is like.
Reddit Baltimore meetup
He's my favorite member of Black Banner
Miami Vice is number one show in Bratislava! 
That Jesse James movie with Brad Pitt is pretty good.
is that the movie about the town where everyone drives a Yugo?
Holy taco, Matt Damon's AMA is the best in awhile....a huge paragraph just on he likes his fucking tacos. I love this guy.
They way he mentions cholula is great. He acts like normal people don't know what cholula is aha. 
There's a dope mexican restaurant in chicago that has a menu item called "white boy tacos" and he kind of just described it. I believe it's the hard shell that makes it unauthentic.
Did I just see Beyonce shoot a taco from her vaganus? 
The impact carries well beyond just having clean water/sanitation.  African women & children mostly would spend up to 8 hours a day just hauling water from far off points.  Those hours can now be used for education and other areas that better life.  In the west it's hard to understand the level of work involved for people to gain the most basic of needs.  The impact is exponential.
Hey, aren't you that guy wh- ah forget it.
Matt Damon
It's pretty great. The sad thing is Ben loved the film that he was making.
Well now I'm crying at work. 
Ya I think /u/TheIronGiants meant, "I know a game **in** development," just a typo.  
Well good luck pressing "Take Off", then "Autopilot", then "Land"!
My boy's wicked smart.
that is an amazing catch
*opens oven*Matt:  Well, shit.Trey:  What?Matt: Matt Damon! He looks retarded!Trey: Fucknuggets!  What are we supposed to do with a retarded Matt Damon?Matt: Retarded Matt Damon?Trey: Retarded Matt Damon!Matt Damon:  Matt Damon!
> Yeah, it was ~~cheaper~~ funnier to rewrite the character as retarded than to remake the marionette.
it's funny how he knew about two years ago but he doesn't today
This isn't Matt Damon, it's a robot that looks like Matt Damon, quick, give it a glass of chocolate milk!
Ha same. I was somewhat wondering if one of the top comments would just be "Maaatt Daamon"
Yeah, is this actually Matt Damon? 
Good God imagine him as Red Hood vs Batfleck.
Hoooly shit. An older Robin partnered with Affleck's Batman would be incredible
It's not your fault.
I laugh every time.  /u/jstrydor has brought so much joy to my life. 
> Redditor for four years.Impressive.
4 minutes is still enough time to hurt :'(
I'd save you any day, Matt.
I don't think *I* know, nor do I intend to find out.
As a Maryland resident that works downtown that photo is the sole reason I will never got to a meetup.
I prefer Roland's Band.
And here I was thinking that Matt was sitting at his PC typing this up and reformatting it. 
Nowhere. Near. Berlin!
 I'm not feelin' a goddamn thing. This Absinthe is BULLSHIT
I thought that was a gif and waited for an inordinately long time... Still worth it, though.
That's an understatement if I've ever heard one. That movie is phenomenal. One of my absolute favorites. Brad Pitt is crazy good in it, but Casey Affleck totally eclipses him. I'm watching this tonight. 
Yeah! I have an irrational love for it.
Hot sauces are like more obscure than craft beers. A lot of them you can only get at bbq festivals or farmer's markets or hot sauce stores. Cholula's not really obscure but it's not sriracha or frank's red hot and it makes sense to think that it's at the least a regional thing.
I just think he isn't assuming that everyone knows what Cholula is. It's not likely sold all over the world and he isn't assuming the person he is responding to is from an area where it is sold. 
Matt Damon
Yeah, it's not a case of the Fantastic Four where you play in the movie and already you're asking yourself "the fuck is going on?" and then you see the movie and you're like "Yep, that sucks, fuck that", so you're kind of ready to face the media.It's a case of doing the movie, having a great time, thinking the directors and producers involved are doing a magnificient job, watching the movie and being fucking proud because you truly think the movie is awesome.Then you go out there and hear that everybody is shitting on it and you're like: "Are you fucking kidding me? goddamn fucking it" 
Sorry. I feel like a jerk, but if you've only seen his movies I recommend his stand-up. He was brilliant and beautiful. I miss him.
Like the fact that you insulted me in front of my entire crew, especially Stewart who often makes up hurtful nicknames for me, like Mr. Bumpy Landing.
> My boy's wicked smaht.ftfy
> Matt Damon: Matt Damon!I feel like that's how a lot of these movies get started.
You're a lunatic with the madman's dream of a milk-proof robot!
My torch isn't gonna last that long..
What if its actually Ben Affleck doing an AMA as Matt Damon.
Jason Bourne in a red hood. That'll work.
Damon in any villlain role vs. Batman would be super interesting.
so... nightwing? 
Don't fuck with me Sean, not you!
It's /u/Warlizard all over again
That's not Matt. 
Basically, take a normal party then remove all the women, add 30-40 pounds to everyone and replace all the interesting anecdotes with recycled memes.Reddit party.
Yes Howard Roland's song Fibber is just delightful. 
Son of a bitch.  Cancel the plans honey.   We are watching The Assassination..  Its way too long to type.  We are watching it though.   Great effing movie! 
Yeah Casey is absolutely incredible in thr Assassination of Jesse James. That movie doesn't get the credit it deserves and neither does Casey. Also the score of that movie is gorgeous 
Wow I never thought id read Matt talk about Cholula. Also its great on eggs! 
Wow. I'm over here thinking it's just as common as tobasco or tapatio. Apparently not. I do live in California though. 
Matt Daaaamon
The could have just switched it to Willem Dafoe...am I right?
Now THAT'S a beauty.
"The Talented Mr. Ripley" is a great example of the type of villain Damon could play against Affleck's Batman. Make it happen!
It's pretty crazy to think that two world famous stars went to highschool together. Like, their classmates must feel like real underachievers in every high school reunion.
It's not your fault. 
warlizard didn't ask for it, though
Is she having a stroke?
Don't forget the fact that you're in room by yourself in front of your computer while everyone else in attendance is doing the same. Basically a normal night for reddit users everywhere.
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward... something. 
Yeah I've never heard of it, lived in Indiana and now Virginia.
Matt. Damon.
*Some* kids are already afraid of puppets, JLSaun. Do you really want to make them ALL afraid of puppets?Wait, are kids afraid of puppets? Am I thinking of clowns again?
now go instigate!
don't forget about casey!
Yeah, I bet the class of '75 at Hillcrest High feels the same way about Fran Drescher and Ray Romano.
That's a.. That's a wink
That one chicks tits are OK.
C'mon, dad, I wanna buy an internet stranger some fake shit on the computer.
"Why the fuck did I come to this? Would it be rude to leave already?"His thought process. 
I read that the rover can't approach specific areas (including where the streaks are located) due to risk of infection by Earth microbes.What are some examples of microbes that could be living on the rover that you are concerned with infecting the surface of mars?
What quantity of water are we talking about? what volume?
What's the next step?
How long into the future do you think it will be before we can realistically think about sending humans to Mars? 
How much liquid water are we talking about? Like.. tap water leaking when you don't close the valve tight enough, or Niagara falls?
This may be a bit far-future looking, but does the fact that we know liquid flowing water exists mean anything for terraforming Mars in the future?
If the Mars rover were to travel to the site of the briny water, what would be the scientific procedure for determining if that water supports life? 
From my fourth grade students (edited by me for clarity): Could there be Martian life in the water since it's only there at certain times of the year? What might happen to the life when the water disappears?It was mentioned that there's life on Mars in the form of microbes on the machinery. Is it possible that these microbes sent by us could harm Martian life?Thank you!
Is there any evidence of evaporation happening on mars? And do you know where this water came from?Thanks for your time!
what would be the procedure, if life is found on Mars?  would the public be made aware? who gets told first? 
First off congratulations on such an amazing discovery. Second, how close is the rover to the water? Will you be able to get close enough to get pictures without contamination? 
What can *we* do to get the government to increase funding for NASA? 
Where does the water come from? I understand that water vapor is very low in the martian atmosphere, yet surely there must be a sizable partial pressure of water vapor in order to hydrate the salts.
Hello NASA,What do you say to those who would argue we already had proof with the ice caps? Obviously, they're full of water. Don't they melt periodically?Sincerely,A fan.
Is NASA now considering putting a man on Mars to get more data on this or can we find all the information without having a man/woman on Mars?
About how much longer do you think it will take to get visuals of the rest of Mars at a high enough resolution to see these types of things?
What does this mean in regards to possible life?
Congratulations! Given the seasonal nature of today's discovery, does this suggest that their is a hydrologic cycle on Mars?
In the press conference they said the Mars mission in 2020 will bring back samples from Mars. How are you going to bring back these samples?
How did the person who initially first learned this information inform the rest of the team?
In the articles I've read so far, the water is referred to as "briny" and that it's more fluid than it is water. What does that mean? Would this be something theoretically possible to drink or grow things with? Or would this be the kind of thing that would need purification before it could be used? 
Do any of the space scientists at NASA write poetry/do art? If their art is inspired by their scientific work, can you please share it with us?
This is gonna sound silly, but what does it taste like?
How long has water been on surface of Mars?
Scale of 1-10, how excited does this make you guys? Is this a huge deal for the scientific community?
What procedures does NASA have in place to prevent potential contamination of these active water sources on Mars?
The images going around today as proof are from 2011, what results/tests did you wait on to finally confirm what the images show fairly well?
what was the hardest technical challenge you faced on this project?what was the hardest nontechnical (political, cultural, legal, emotional &c) challenge?
This seems to indicate that mars is closer to the end of its life cycle than a younger planet like Earth (as in, a long while ago mars had flowing water, oceans, and likely life.. now it's mostly arrid)  What are your thoughts on that? I can hardly fathom what kind of life may have once been on Mars - but it's kind of depressing to think that it is something that was once but unless terraforming becomes  a thing - Mars will remain a grave stone of a world where life once may have thrived. 
Will 2016 mars mission aim to explore more on this?
Why should the average joe care about this? What does this mean for science and space exploration?
Awesome news! Really excited about this! How long before you guys can map a significant area (~20%) of Mars with Hi-Res images?
With the discovery of water on Mars does that mean there could be rainbows on Mars? 
Has Nestle tried to buy the water yet?
If the atmospheric pressure on surface is the same as Earth's, but the air composition is the same as well as the soil/terrain, how likely would we be seeing streams or ponds of liquid water there?
Is this water we're taking about, or could it be another liquid?
Serious question, why is this a surprise considering there's evidence of ice and glaciers?  From what I saw when I googled it mars can get warm enough to melt ice, so what's to say this isn't from the glaciers melting and then refreezing?
the gravity on mars is about 3.711m/s.want to know if this much gravity is enough to hold a large amount of water on its surface ?what will happen if we pour 200 gallons of water on the surface?will it evaporate?
Is there more water on Mars than California?
As someone who knows little to nothing about anything related to space exploration. What took us so long to discover this?
Do you know how much water there actually is on mars? Is it enough to support a city, for example?
These features are on steep slopes, so our present rovers would not be able to climb up to them. Because liquid water appears to be present, these regions are considered special regions where we have to take extra precautions to prevent contamination by earth life. Our current rovers have not been sterilized to the degree needed to go to an area where liquid water may be present. -RZ
To add onto this, what earthly being or creation doesn't have these microbes?  We would have to avoid it indefinitely, unless something was created on mars and from martian resources that could approach those areas?  
We think this is a very small amount of water -- maybe just enough to wet the top layer of the surface of Mars. The streaks are ~4-5 meters wide and ~200-300 meters long. -- LT
The next step is to look for more locations where brine flows may occur. We have covered 3% of Mars at resolutions high enough to see these features. -RZ
Presently, NASA is looking into the possibility of sending humans to the vicinity of Mars in the early 2030s. In this scenario, the earliest humans to the surface would be in the late 2030s. -RZ
Tap water leaking. -RZ
Think of this as a "seep" not a flow. We have not seen flowing water on the surface. We see something that darkens the soil, which may be just a wetting action but still involves (briny) liquid. -RZ
The Curiosity rover does not have life detection instruments. It would look for confirmation that liquid water was present and how long during the day it was liquid. -RZ
It's possible. We know of forms of life that hibernate during dry seasons on Earth. The water that we're seeing within the RSL (the seasonal dark streaks that we're seeing on slopes on Mars) is salty. Salty water could be harmful to life.We don't know what Earth life could do to any potential life on other worlds. That's why we try to clean our spacecraft very carefully. -- LT
These are great questions! Bright kids and awesome teacher.
New impact craters on Mars sometimes have bright ice exposed in the bottom of the crater. This goes away over a few months. The ice, when exposed, is going from solid to vapor. Evaporation of a briny flow will also occur, so the water needs to be resupplied. We don't know how. -RZ
Information flows to the public very quickly. If one of our missions here at JPL detected life, we'd notify NASA headquarters immediately, who would then follow procedures to notify the US government and the public. -- SLS
There are no confirmed brine flows (RSL) near Curiosity nor Opportunity. There are in Gale Crater some interesting slope streaks but they are several km away from the Curiosity's present path. -RZ
Militarise NASA.
The ice caps freeze and sublime (solid to vapor.) The RSL water stays liquid because it has salts in it. Yes, we know there's water on Mars. We're looking for where it stays liquid for an extended period of time. -RZ
Send Matt Damon. He already knows the terrain.
MRO has been taking data at Mars since March 2006, nearly 10 years.  The HIRISE instrument (high-resolution imager) has currently taken images of only about 2.4% of the surface.  --LT
Mars is more habitable than California now.
There is a hydrologic cycle on Mars, but typically it involves vapor going to ice (frost) or ice going to vapor. There is no rain in Mars today, but there may have been very early in its history. -RZ
Just, like, throw them real hard.
"That's weird. Hey guys..." 
I'm no scientist either, but how would NASA be sure that the lactobacillus would completely displace the extremophile bacteria?
how does this in any way also kill the bacteria that can make the trip?
The salts in the water appear to be perchlorates, so I wouldn't want to drink the water. To be a future resource for humans, you would want to remove the salts. -RZ
briny means salty.  I don't know if they mean 'salt' like on earth, where it's just table salt, or some other type of 'salt'.But briny water means salty water.
Water in some form has probably been on Mars since at least 3.9 Bya. --LT
This is super exciting!  It is an important discovery because it is evidence that supports our hypothesis that the RSL (seasonal dark streaks that appear to flow in the warm season) are flowing briny (salty) water.  --LT
We have a policy for Planetary Protection.  This policy means that we clean our spacecraft of earth microbes to varying degrees depending on where the spacecraft is being sent.  It the intended location is thought to have a high possibility of harboring microbes, then we go to the maximum extent to clean the spacecraft. --LT
The features that darken and fade as temperatures get warmer and then colder are long but narrow. The difficulty was to get enough resolution from our orbiter instruments to first detect, and then characterize what these features are. Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) can do that with its HiRISE camera and CRISM Mineral Mapper. -RZ
MRO has been in orbit for 10 years and has mapped ~2.4 percent of Mars in high-res. We have six-meter-per-pixel imagery of more than 90 percent of the surface. -- LT
Not quite rainbows, because there is no rain, but we have seen icebows with the Pathfinder mission. -- RZ
>Has Nestle tried to steal the water yet?FTFY
You joke, but likely the future of space travel will be privatized. Corporations make more money than NASA at the moment.
fuckin savage
At the North pole there is a polar tap made of water ice, which is a mile thick and several hundred km across. Todays story was focused on liquid (briny) water closer to the equator. -RZ
Wow, I never realised the word 'earthquake' had the name of our planet in it. 
What is involved in sterilizing a rover to that degree? I'm sure the current rovers were sterilized a great deal already, so what else would need to be done to future rovers, and is that level of sterilization feasible now or in the near future?
If the rovers haven't been properly sterilized already, will this throw doubt upon any possible future discovery of Mars-based microbes living in or near the water? Wouldn't detractors be able to claim that they are microbes that somehow survived from Earth?
After we confirm that life exists outside our planet will we stop worrying so much about contaminating it with earth life? By that i mean if we want to colonize Mars at some point we will purposefully contaminate it, when is that point?
Could you explain why you can't go near the water?  Is it for fear of harming the rover?  Or contaminating the water?
Wouldn't radiation have killed them by now?
Doesn't that suggest that there could be wells with much, much more water underneath the surface?
How deep would the streaks be?
>3% at high resolutionsTHAT LEAVES SO MUCH MORE ROOM FOR ACTIVITIES, YAY! 
How much extra funding would NASA require before this date could be moved forwards? Or is it in terms of actual technology needing to be developed?
2030s?!  Is there anything we can do to help speed this up? 
"Damnit, Xarnax! I told you to shut the faucet off, now the human know we were there!"
"We have oil and it seeps through the ground. Do you want to pay me to know where it is... ""Well, just because there's something on the ground doesn't mean there's anything beneath it."
"Phew"-The Martians
Wasn't the base of life on Earth micro-small lifeforms in salt water though?Disclaimer: Genuinely curious, I know nothing.
I'm so amazed that a fourth grade class just communicated with actual NASA scientists. 
THIS is the most exciting part to me.  
Seeing a scientist say "We don't know how" simultaneously excites me and terrifies me. We know so little.
By "US government", do you mean to include the US Planetary Defense Force?
So these procedures already exist? That's really cool, can you tell us what they are and a bit of history of how they were created?
Should... should we alter its path?
I, for one, volunteer to be a space Marine.
Declare war on Mars. The US will have boots on the ground within a year.
When it sublimates, is it essentially "gone" forever?  Or does it hang around in the atmosphere to eventually re-freeze at some point?
The basic answer is yes, NASA is planning to send humans to Mars in the 2030s. It's always helpful to have more information before sending them, and that's why our robotic explorers are so important. -- LT
Will Matt Damon make it back to earth alive?!
Yeah, but there was that time we sent him to another solar system. I'm surprised they sent him to Mars after that.
416 more years to go! 
> There is no rain in Mars today, but there may have been very early in its history.The thought of the *last rain storm on Mars* puts me in a state that's hard to describe.
NASA finally got the budget for Amazon Prime so they could afford the shipping costs.
There's a quote (unconfirmed, apparently) from Isaac Asimov about this.>The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka!', but 'That's funny ...'
"... Guess who's gonna get a *motherfucking PROMOTION!!!*"
We should dip it in ebola
And add electrolytes. 
The salts detected on Mars are magnesium or sodium perchlorate. These are not typical salts on the Earth, but they have the attribute that they can keep water liquid to much colder temperatures which occur on Mars. -RZ
In the livestream they talked about perchlorate, which I believe is a type of salt? They also specified that it would be far more salty than Earth's oceans, because it was formed by salt absorbing water vapor from the air until there was enough liquid to dissolve. So I've basically been picturing a kind of salty sludge. They also said it would look more like wet dirt, not a stream flowing on the dirt.
1-10 tho...
Why not *always* clean them to the maximum extent just in case? Too expensive? Takes too much time?
Is the 6 meters/pixel data public? If not, will it be?I think it would be cool to create a Mars vizualisation app.
Pics or didn't happen 
It's not stealing, 26$ were paid in dues for all Mars water. The trademark Spacewater has been registered and extraction begins whenever enough public money will have been spent go make private profits attractive to their board.Do you even capitalism?
Hahahaha..Seriously though We need water. It's starting to look like the world from mad max out here.
It's the thing that bothered me most when watching Armageddon. No fucking Earthquakes on an asteroid.
Proper sterilization would involve very high heat and pressure, autoclaving it (hard to design a rover to withstand that heat, but not impossible), not just a rub down with rubbing alcohol
The rovers have been sterilized for their particular landing sites where there's been no evidence of present day liquid water. To go to the RSL rovers will be required to be sterilized to a higher level. We also take samples of microbes that might be on the spacecraft before they're launched, so we can compare with any future discoveries. -RZ
It'd be pretty embarrassing for NASA to say "THERE IS LIFE ON MARS" then later say "sorry that was just some waterbears stuck in the gears from earth"
Consider that any life we find on Mars would be the first we find on another planet besides our own. You can bet that any Martian life will be studied incredibly heavily and carefully. If we have finally found life on another planet, we wouldn't want to fuck it up so quickly!
This would violate the prime directive.
Or given them super powers?
Wow..please check your low res privilege at the door. We are still on earth 
When talking about exploration or colonization of Mars or whatever it's so easy to forget that even if it's a lot smaller than Earth, it's still *a planet* that we're talking about.
I know right?? It almost rivals your mother!
The perfect project manager approach!
You should try to talk Disney into donating all of the Star Wars profits to NASA.
9 pregnant women cannot give birth in a month.
Some people have claimed we are more technological prepared to send people to Mars, than they were to send people to the Moon in the 60s. I just don't think most people are willing to spend as much on NASA as we did back then.
Tech wise we could go now. We landed men on the moon in the 60s! over 50 years ago. Honestly the thing holding us back is funding, and the willingness to sacrifice life. 
Just don't die man and you'll get to witness it
I like how he pours it away immediately like he's somehow disgusted by how much water came out.
"C'mon, Beejaq. It's our calling card. We're the Wet Martians!"
"DRAINAGE!"
I am not a scientist, but I imagine there's a sweet spot for it all.
When I was in elementary school our teacher gave us an assignment to write to scientists anywhere in the US and ask them questions.  We *all* got responses from our chosen scientists.  No joke, every single one of us.  I kept my penpal at the University of Colorado Boulder who worked in an observatory.  We'd talk about space and stuff.  Kept that up for a couple months.It just takes a teacher to open that door.
Would this not imply its being resupplied by underground sources?
Most scientists say ''we don't know how''. That's why they're scientists in the first place. It's not a rare occurance.
he means DOOP
No, or else we risk contaminating the water with microbes from Earth
You're not going to do it with that name, /u/on_the_ground 
I would like to submit my application now to start training for the next 15 years so I can explore mars for the good of humanity.
If this is Interstellar Matt Damon, hopefully not 
Only if he figures out how to science the shit out of it
Actually, he was chosen for the other mission because he survived Mars
Next day: $67.4 billionSecond day: Free with Amazon Prime!

So I should be using that type of salt water to chill my beers faster, got it. 
Judging by the reply, looks like a 3 to me.
Come on, OP.
Roidquakes
Seems to me that as soon as you take it out of the autoclave it will get contaminated again. 
You can sterilize using radiation too.
wouldn't mar's atmosphere kill any earth life that possibly could have been on the rovers? 
Simple, just build *everything* out of carbon fiber - needs to get autoclaved anyway.  Two birds, one stone.You're welcome, NASA.
That's a really fucking smart idea. You guys must be, like, rocket scientists or something. 
This actually happened with microbes on the Moon.
Yes because humanity would never even consider to fuck up the locals in order to colonize. 
To be fair we aren't part of the life forms governed by the prime directive because we haven't yet achieved warp technology. 
There's two kinds of people...
a) give Martians smart phones2) check their snapchatsD) profit
The surface area of Mars is nearly the same as the land area of the Earth. -RZ
Why so briny?
Well, you require a shit ton of vespene gas,  don't get me started on the minerals.
Yeah good luck with that, I heard that Disney guy is a real stiff.
That depends on how pregnant they are to begin with.
Not with that attitude. 
30 gasoline 
Basically we'd need China or somebody to be heading to Mars, then we'll speed it up so we can get there first. 
I'm fairly certain (about 100 percent) that NASA won't send people to space knowing they won't come back. 
dude I'm 78. 
I'll upvote a Home Alone reference any day of the week.
"I think we're getting scammed by a kindergartener."
Too salty for life as we currently know it anyway....
I think that most scientists are excited about the prospect of getting new blood and want to facilitate genuine interest in the young. They have the hindsight and foresight to see that they built their work off of their predecessors, and while they might not discover an inhabitable planet during their own careers, their work will live on in future generations of scientists.
Yes. It also implies an underground alien base.
I read 2030's and thought god I'll be nearly 60 by then. Then your comment said 15 years... Why am I still convinced it's the year 2000
I just want to know if there's any three boobed chicks there.
Elysium's Matt Damon might be okay though
Then he turned into a dick
I'd give it a hard 4.5
It's been over an hour, NASA must be dead.
Not necessarily, there is life on earth that can survive the vacuum of space, such as extremophilic bacteria and some micro-invertebrates.
Wait. What? Is there life on the moon?
I'd like to think we're a little more aware of what we're doing now.
It's like people who put a cup of sugar in their 8oz cup of coffee.  it's not coffee with sugar, it's sugar coffee.
I'm PC Penn State bro!
So mars is like a rounded up Pangaea? Got it.
YOU MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PYLONS
Gotta get those expansions man. I say we take over Canada as our closest natural expansion.
That's because he said the quote wrong.  It's, "Nine women can't make a baby in one month."  
...and how concerned you are about the babies surviving.
2 extra wagon wheel
We can't let the Red Planet fall to those damn ass commies!
I don't want to put words in that other poster's mouth, but when they mention sacrifice life I think it may be a commentary on the idea that the "failure is not an option" mindset may have held us back terribly.Risk is part of the business, and as long as a single Senator can stop everything in its tracks by saying "is there ANY chance someone might die?", We cannot venture back to the moon or onwards to Mars.Our current culture is not just risk-averse, it seems almost pathologically risk phobic for space travel .
I 100% agree, but that wasn't the case during the moon landings. We were willing to take a risk to make grand leaps of faith.Exploration results in deaths, but it also leads to discovery, todays society is too risk averse.  
better start eating better.

Sir Patrick, I've read that you were born in Mirfield. As a fellow Yorkshireman, does your old accent ever pop out by mistake sometimes? Or has it completely disappeared after so many years away from God's Own Country?
What would you advise to Daniel Radcliffe who'd like to play Shakespeare in theatre?
If you could find one rare artifact in the world what would it be and who would you give it to?
First off, let me say that I really admire your work-you were so flawless as Professor Xavier and Picard, and so wholly charismatic and thoughtful in your acting.My question is whether you have done/would consider narrating audiobooks? I'm an audiobook junkie, and absolutely adore your voice. Thanks for the AMA! :-)

Hello Sir Patrick!I am a young actor who is currently engaged as Henry V, having developed a love for Shakespeare in the last few years.As a man who has had a long career as a film and stage performer, do you have any advice on making the transition between film and stage?Thank you so much for the wonderful entertainment over the years!
I missed a performance you did with Judy Dench in 2002 in London.  Showed up and it was sold out.  One of my biggest regrets.  Are you in any productions now?  When is the next time someone can see you on stage?
What's your favorite cocktail, sir?
Sup Sir Patrick!!What are some things on your bucket list?
Hi Patrick! Im a huge fan of yours and I grew up watching the X-Men Films. What is the best thing about playing the role of Professor X?

When will we see you on Tabletop with Wil Wheaton?? We really just want to hear you say "shut up Wesley" because we know how much he looooves that. Seriously though...when? :)
Some day there will be a space ship, or a star ship. It will have a bridge, it will have a Captain much like you represented, commanding a bridge crew, and travelling the stars. In all likelihood, that ship will be called Enterprise.Was there ever a time when you were on the bridge set of TNG, that you had that same realisation? Was it at all apparent at the time how impactful the show would be on future inventions, on people's choices  of career, and on our looking to the stars?
Will we ever see you as Jean Luc Picard again?
Sir Patrick, I'm an English Lit teacher, and we're using your film version of the RSC Hamlet with David Tennant to supplement our reading of the text. As someone who's studied the part, what sort of backstory do you imagine for Claudius? How long has his affair with Gertrude been going on? It would be amazing to share any insight you have with my class...
How many lights are there?
Mr.Stewart, did it ever bother you that a French Born character named Picard has an English accent, was that ever brought up to the writers? 
Hi. What's your favourite TNG episode?
Unbelievably exciting. Unbelievable because I never expected it would happen to me and as an ex-athlete and huge fan of the Olympic Games, it was one of the best days of my life. And, I ended the day taking home the torch, but I seem to have mislaid it. If anybody knows where it is, please let the @SirPatStew team know. 
You are absolutely not a liar. I use the subway all the time and in London, the Underground. Broadway-Lafayette is one of my favorite stations!!!!!!!!!
Nothing I do is accidentally funny. It is all pre-meditated and carefully planned and scheduled. And if you steal one of my funny ideas, I WILL sue you. 
Yes! Deep-sea diving and mountaineering. There's something about going up and down that turns me on. 
Frakes with a beard, preferable, because it tickles when you kiss him.

Dear Roger Rees saw a preview of my one-man show, A Christmas Carol, and told me I shouldn't act Scrooge. I should simply be him because Scrooge already lived inside me. 
Then Daniel should do it wherever and whenever he can. But I warn him, he could get hooked and wave goodbye to a lovely film career. 
Yeah, I'd hate to see Daniel Radcliffe go before I've had my wish fulfilled, to see him play a megalomaniac genius young Bond Villain that built an empire and has a wicked sick sense of humor and is completely merciless! He was so great in Horns.
A Sonia Delaunay painting, which I would present to my wife for our imminent second wedding anniversary. 
I have done, but many decades ago. I'm afraid it is too labour intensive for the present state of my career. Maybe once I'm in retirement...perish the thought. 
Don't be silly, I couldn't see my head. It was decapitated!
If it was immediately followed by another perfect Sunday...and then another...and another. 
Easy. Yorkshire Gold. Any other kind of tea bag needs two bags. By the way, did you know that I am the man who introduced the concept of the double tea bag to the United States. Don't you think that deserves some recognition...A Medal of Honor? And invitation to the White House? Or my own seat on the next space shuttle?
Actually, it's Alan Cumming. Deputy Director Avery Bullock on American Dad is my favorite role to voice act. 
Always, all my life, a favorite, thickly sliced Granny Smith apple on thick, heavily buttered white bread. Very healthy and yummy. 
Sunny, is that you? 
Not difficult at all because the script was brilliant, but impossibly difficult because Ricky giggled all the time and spoiled so many takes. If you googled him and me, you would have already seen that. As for venturing into more comedic roles, see the link to my Facebook above to watch the first episode! BLUNT TALK. 
> This video contains content from BBC Worldwide, who has blocked it in your country on copyright grounds. I'm in the UK.  
Well, the thing is, my favorite episode is "Inner Light." It was a beautiful script, which for me was almost entirely located away from the Enterprise - and it's crew! And because I was given the chance to perform what Picard would have been like if his life experience had been different. But another important reason is that I had a son in that episode who was played by my son, Daniel Stewart. And if you care to see how he has grown up, watch my new series Blunt Talk. 
Easy. First season of Blunt Talk. For the 12 weeks of shooting, I remember nothing except laughing, which is a nice way to get through a working day, especially if it's 14 hours. Everyone in our cast is a comedian (or comedienne). They're funny on screen and they're funny off, which accounts for my comment about laughing. There's not much laughter when you're performing King Lear or Macbeth. 
You're a lucky man to be playing Henry V. I played it in Manchester, England in 1963. How many of you saw it? If you're transitioning from film to stage, there's only one piece of advice: find a great voice coach. 
I'm sorry to say that you missed only one of the two occasions I have appeared on stage with Dame Judi. The other one was the farewell to the old auditorium in the Royal Shakespeare Theatre by dozens of actors, who had made that stage their home. This time, next year, Ian McKellen and I will be in rehearsals in London for Harold Pinter's great play, No Man's Land. 
A martini with Old Raj gin and very important, one olive. Who knew that you must never put an even number of olives in a martini glass. My son told me that martini drinkers are superstitious about even numbers of olives. 
My father retired from the military as Regimental Sergeant Major of the British Parachute Regiment. He jumped into action three times. I don't care for the action part of it, but I would love to experience what he did of jumping and parachuting safely to the ground. 
Great costumes in every film, but I loved my superhero costume and my flying chair in Days of Future Past. The chair actually levitated, but only a few inches. 
1. Favorite drink of choice is Oregon Pinot Noir. 2. The letters of Vincent Van Gogh to his brother, Theo. Problem is, there are seven volumes and I've already been reading for two years. 3. Best thing was meeting my wife, Sunny, and my soccer club, Huddersfield Town, failing to win a match so far this season was the worst. 4. Nothing scheduled for NYC with my BFF. London, maybe. 
He also played Capt Picard as Capt Ahab in First Contact
I'm sure it would be if he were there. He never is as I've always recorded in isolation. Maybe before the series wraps up, Stan and Avery could have a long cozy chat over a glass of malt whiskey. 
I mostly came just to say this.  Your portrayal of Picard helped me grow up as a good person.  Then being a grown up and seeing the work you do in the real world... Well, it's inspiring.  You do not know me, but you have affected me in a profound and good way.  There are many battles I am able to fight in part because of the role model you provided.  
Can you please form a political party in UK, so that people have somebody they trust to vote for? :)
Why do the top questions of these things never get answered?
It's too late, he's already seen everything.
I can't remember if it was ever said in the show, but I believe the explanation is that the French accent is dead by that time. 
iirc they covered this with an offhand mention that the french language somehow became obscure/extinct by the 24th century.
Maybe in the future, the universal translator gives you a choice of any accent you want.
I'm saying The Inner Light.
Its not in your bathroom, at least not in plain view of the window.
What kind of athlete? What did you play/do?
I KNEW IT! Thank you for confirming my suspicion!! 
One of us!
"There's something about going up and down that turns me on." It'll take reddit like ten seconds to take that out of context.
I... I don't think we could hang out.
Would you go as far as to say you have a *drinking problem*? I'll see myself out.
As a true Captain even a question is a command.
*Translation: You see, listening to my accent is like drinking hot lead* (an incredibly painful experience).
This is the greatest thing I have ever read in Sir Patrick's voice. ...I read most things in his voice...
As an American I'm always puzzled by the range of dialects in the UK. It's so tiny! Here, you can go a thousand miles and hear only slight variations.
I need to go home to Yorkshire now, thanks.
Your version of Scrooge is a must watch for me every Christmas. 
Well if he's happy doing it then it's a career switch worth doing in my opinion. He'd be a great Hamlet. :)
I never knew I wanted this, but now that I know, I *need* it.
Bad move.... imagine trying to top that on the 3rd.
My lord, which one!? It could be about the history of paperclips and I'd wanna hear the whole thing.
Always the decapitatee, never the decapitator.
You're the guy that wishes for infinite wishes, aren't you?
My SO will be pleased to hear this. Im a Yorkshire man and shes a Brummie. Its her favourite brand of tea. 
I really had hoped the answer would be, 'Earl Grey. Hot.'
Stephen Fry can keep his posho Twinnings. Yorkshire Tea is where it's at. A fine choice!
Does two bags mean an additional bag of the same tea, or wrapping the tea bag in a second bag?
> Naturally, recapturing this fugitive is our top priority. Then we can track down the bastards that have been harboring it and punish them brutally. I mean, really brutally. Weird stuff. *Butt* stuff.Hilarious.
Deputy Director Avery Bullock is the best character on American Dad for sure, maybe in a tie with Roger the alien.
And he's probably one of the greatest characters in modern television. With your voice and how Avery is drawn I just see Sir Patrick Stewart running the CIA and being generally devious and insane.
I love that the sandwich question got the first reply. Priorities, you know?
...An apple sandwich? Is this a thing I've never heard of before?
Ummm. Yes. We're going with yes.
"I've seen everything. I've seen it all."
Can't watch it, and I'm in Canada. Has your country no respect for the Commonwealth?!
I swear all UK channels are only blocked in the UK. There's probably a reason behind it, not one that I'll find though.
For me, that 10 seconds or so when you wake up back on the bridge of the Enterprise, is the best acting I have ever seen. No dialog but just this whole sequence of thoughts, emotions, and realizations playing across your face. Hats off. You're a master of your craft.I'm stunned, STUNNED, there wasn't even an emmy *nomination* for that. 
Do you have the flute!  Please tell me you keep the flute on your mantel.  
Damn, as a long time TNG fan, I would vote "The Measure of a Man" as the best episode. It was poignant, spoke to all the best attributes of Star Trek, upheld Picard as the shining beacon that he is and left a very intelligent debate sort of open ended for the viewer to think about.I really hope Star Trek gets made again for TV, preferably by Netflix! Much of the younger generation now needs exposure to good sci-fi that isn't all time warps and laser blasts.
>There's not much laughter when you're performing King LearHow do you make a King Lear? Put the Queen in a bikini!    
Thanks so much! It's definitely a dream role, and the space we do it in is a recreation of Blackfriar's Playhouse.Thanks for the advice! After this contract I'm headed to NYC and seeing what happens there!
I have never been more excited to be an Oregonian. *Did you guys see that?! He likes OUR wine!*
Wine. Oregon Pinot Noir. Room Temperature.
Wow, a shout out to Oregon wine. Suck it, rest of the world.
Was really hoping you'd say "Tea, Earl Grey, Hot". 
"You broke your little ships."
Is it your choice to record alone? Do the other voice actors?
I always thought of Captain Picard as a kind of Atticus Finch in space.  
How could you trust someone who's that good an actor?
*wife frowns*  "I don't care if it's the Klingon way! Take out the damn garbage!"
You reckon they wouldn't develop him at all?
"I'm afraid it only translates into a useless dead language.""Hello.""Bonjour.""Crazy gibberish!"
And who wouldn't choose the British accent? Our accent makes you 50% more trusting.
Sounds more like committing to the cover story.IOC: "So, runs over, may we have the torch back now?"Stewart: "Umm... odd, I can't seem to find it.  Senior moment perhaps, I'll have my people look a bit.  <shifty eyes> Can't have gone far now, can it? <slides torch under sofa>"
God damn, that's a sexy gif. 
That's Sir Stewart you dolt 
And then NEVER CALL HER AGAIN
I love it so much I wanna take it behind a middle school and get it pregnant 
He must be devastated.
"You WILL respond to my questions."
"You must become an old man in good time if you wish to be an old man long." -Marcus Aurelius
I'm reading this whole AMA in his voice
As a general rule, the place of origin of the language has more variations. It's how linguists and anthropologists trace the migration of civilisation in some cases.
Exactly, he's already worth $110 million. Do what you love.
Amateur mistake. 
This is what I imagine a muppet version of TNG would look like.
He did "The Last Battle" from The Chronicles of Narnia. Great work, and even gets into doing weird voices for different characters.
Twinings is for porcelain cups and raised pinkies. If you poured Yorkshire Tea into a porcelain cup it would explode and shower your affronted guests in piping hot, delicious char. ONLY A MUG WILL DO
>Where's your wife this evening? > Handcuffed to a radiator in Fallujah. 
My favorite was the Stonecutters.  Hearing him say "Let's all get drunk and play ping pong!" for the first time was beautifully surreal.
"Do you have any gatorade?  I seem to have left all my electrolytes with your daughter."
His love of prostitutes and his ability to make them dissappear is only matched by Ben Affleck.
Don't forget Reginald. The entire scene with him and Avery in the Limo is one of the best that show has to offer.
A true Englishman!
It's not rare over here in Britain, but it is slightly uncommon. It really needs the addition of cheese to be perfect though.
It's really good! I like it with a thin (!) Layer of honey and a sprinkle of cinnamo, on top :)
I can only imagine how much crazier his American counterpart would be at the MI6. Y'know, that's actually not a bad idea for an episode.
I'm also in the UK and can't watch it, apparently this country has no respect for this country!
The BBC isn't allowed to make any money by selling its products to the British public. BBC worldwide has adverts on it and therefore British audiences aren't allowed to see it in case this becomes a loophole for making money by the BBC. 
But it did win a Hugo.
TIL I need to watch TNG
Pretty sure it was sold at a charity auction. 
The flute sold for lots of $$$ actually. I really wanted to buy it. 
Is this the black friars playhouse in Staunton VA? 
Willamette Dammit! 
Shhhh not so loud!! People might try and move here...
from a previous AMA he has stated he actually dislikes Earl Grey. 
No self-respecting Brit with testicles drinks Earl Grey.
*laughtrack*
The character's been around for almost 30 years with a ton of episodes and story arcs centered around him.  I'm not sure how much more they *can* develop him.
I thought it made you better than everyone else.
Actually they let everyone who carries it keep the torch. I've got one at home.
Sir Patrick, technically.
I also am having a hard time believing he couldn't get back to making movies if he ever chose so after, he has proven his worth ten times over and the entire world has seen him do it. 
It couldn't go into space though. It was a test model so it didn't have heat shielding or engines.
Uh, that's a skullet not a mullet.
Holy shit how did I not recognize that? 
The run with Coco, the fat Asian, what one of the funniest things. Then the cocaine bender with the random prostitute where they were shooting up his home. Oh my god yes.
Going to try to create this sandwich tonight. Probably won't go well :/
Yes, that would be a different version of the apple sandwich, but it would have to be the strongest, grittiest, and sharpest cheddar. 
I'm British and I've never heard of it
I'm pretty sure half the stuff they show on worldwide has license fee money in it somewhere, if this is the reason then it's bullshit.
Good. That makes me feel better, actually.
I say this as a really *really* big fan of TNG. Start at season 3 and only go back to watch the first two seasons after you've finished seasons 3-7 and are desperate for more.
For $40,000, and there's an interview with Sir Patrick giggling about it ("it doesn't play; it's not a real flute").
*Every single one of those speakers worked*
I hope you got into spelunking as an excuse to use it all the time. 
He'll always be Harry though
Correct. He's got the party in the back, but we're missing the business in the front.
If you're like me and haven't seen episodes that old in a while, only when you were younger, you didn't quite think to put a name to voice actors, or realize they were doing multiple voices for a show.Nowadays I can almost always tell which actor/actress is voicing a character. FXX played the Stonecutters episode a few months back and upon watching it for the first time in probably 15 years I was all, "Holy shit, that's Patrick Stewart!"
"Smith! Come on in, we're doing *cocaine* and shooting *guns*!"
Indeed, most BBC programmes have been produced for the domestic British audience with licence fee money, but they are shown to the British public without adverts. The British public are seen to have already paid for the service and if they were to be exposed to adverts they would effectively be paying again, for something they already bought. 
Gurney Halleck does not fuck around. It's all business.
It's not really nice, and it's marketing is aimed at Non-brits. Most of us don't dream of being some posh wanker sitting in his country manor drinking wanky tea.
I instantly knew it was Pat Sharp. This is basically the most English thread I've ever seen on reddit
Mr. Savage, are you going to Silicon Valley Comic Con next year?
Hey adam! How is progress going on the martian suit?
Your questions are all so good. I'm typing as fast as I can!!!
If budget was no limit... and I mean if you had *millions*... what myth would you have most liked to test?
Hi Mr. Savage, and greetings from Iceland. As some here surely know, the 'Mythbusters B-Team' has been up to no good and is due for a hopefully spectacular opening with their new show 'White Rabbit Project' on Netflix in just a few days. Have you been involved in any way with the project, even if just in an advisory role? Will we be getting a podcast about the show on tested.com? Are you or Jamie gueststarring in any of the episodes? Thanks for your time, and keep up the great work.
You recently announced a joint show with Michael from VSauce. How did this venture come about, why did you choose to do it, and what are you most excited about with that venture?
Hey Adam!I loved the collaboration between you and Alton Brown, since you two were literally my childhood role-models. How was it working with him?
You've inspired a lot of young people, myself included, to really delve into science and the scientific method, so thank you for helping me discover a passion, first of all!If you had to add one person (dead or alive) to the Mythbusters team, who do you think would be best suited for the job?
Hey, Adam!  What are your essential cheap tools that everyone should own, and what are some that you feel need to be higher quality in order to be worth bothering with?
Hi Adam,I recently discovered my college has it's own makerspace and club complete with 3D printers, a laser cutter, and a wood working shop. The only thing that it's missing is: makers!What would be the best way to get people interested in a makerspace?
What's the coolest piece of science fiction you could see becoming a reality in the next 5-10 years?
Have you ever worn Jamie's hat?
Hi Adam, Like everybody else, I love tested and the work you're doing to jump start Making. I'm a maker of music (or noise...) and I as wondering who you listen to on your drive to the shop or while you're working or just to decompress? Thanks for being such a huge inspiration to me!
What was the scariest thing you ever did on Mythbusters?
I'm about to take my last physics test of the semester. Any words of advice?
Hi Adam!I want to start off by thanking you, Mythbusters was a huge part of my childhood and it introduced me into the wonderful world of engineering. It helped me decide that I wanted to pursue a career in civil engineering, and now in my third year as a CE student I couldn't be happier with my decision. So thank you so much for that, and also for participating in this AMA today!So my question for you is, is there any myth that you wanted to do but didn't have the right technology? If so, do you think it'll ever be possible to test it?-Briana
Hi Adam, Can't remember if you've ever answered this before but have you ever worked with the "slow-mo guys"? They've dona a lot of really cool stuff filming things in super slow motion. The company they are apart of is also doing a really cool series called immersion, trying out things from video games in real life and seeing how easy/difficult they are.
Hey Adam! How are you doing today?
Try the backwards bike I sent yet? (Destin)
Hi Adam,I often find my self working on multiple projects at once, sadly some end up on the shelf for a while. Does this happen to you? What do you do to alleviate it?
So obviously your famous quotes are "I reject your reality and substitute my own" and "the only difference between science and screwing around is writing it down" but what are some things you said that you wish were more popular? P.S I'm a senior in high school and I picked your reality quote for my senior quote! 
Hi Adam! My 3 year old son is a humongous fan of yours. He's bright and very interested in science and engineering. Christmas is coming and I was wondering what toys you had as a kid that helped foster your lifetime love of science. Or if there are any toys on the market today that you would recommend? Thanks! 
In-N-Out or Five Guys or something completely different?
Do you still frequent reddit after that whole fiasco with people making fun of your fan that takes a picture with you every year?
Mr. Savage, what is the feeling you get from blowing something up that you worked so hard building/creating for Mythbusters? What was the highest amount of explosives used (terms of poundage) on the show?
What was your relationship to Randy Savage and have you ever dove off of anything and dropped an elbow OR referred to yourself as "The Macho Man" Adam Savage?
If you are editor-in-chief, wouldn't that count as a job?
On Still Untitled you mentioned the idea for Adam's Bookclub. Maybe you meant this as a joke, but I am legit excited for this idea. Mainly because your interests are interesting to me and your recommendations have never failed me. Is there a chance this will become something for real?
Hey Adam,What's something about you that we don't know?Thanks! I loved Mythbusters growing up and I can't wait to show it to my kids one day.
Hey Adam, What do you miss most about Mythbusters?
How was it working for Micheal Stevens?
Hi, Adam!I see that you're a Hayao Miyazaki fan from some of your comic-con cosplay (No-Face and Totoro). Which Miyazaki movie is your favorite?
Hey Adam! Im a big fan of your one day builds on tested.  I think it's because I see a lot of myself in the way you work.  One problem that I frequently have is getting caught up in the energy of building so much that organization goes completely out the window.  Any tips for keeping the enthusiasm while also being organized?
Hi Adam, Out of all the things you've had to build over the years. Are there any builds that you regret finishing? Ya know the, "this was not a great idea after all" moment. 
Can we get a hint or two as to what we can expect from your Brain Candy tour?
Hey Adam! What is a **Life Pro-Tip** you'd like to give to dudes all over the world?
Did you want to make things for a living as a kid? (I mean was that the job you had in mind back then?)
Hey Adam! I'm glad I got to catch this AMA!I'm a pretty big fan of anime and manga, and I've been presenting (game shows and discussion) at PA conventions for about five years now. I think it's super cool to see celebrities and public figures from the US show an interest in that kind of stuff (especially positive role models like yourself)!My question is this: what is your favorite anime and why? I've seen on your twitter and Facebook that you're a fan of Miyazaki, but I've always wondered if there was more! Thanks so much for being so cool! 
Was there any Myth you specifically wanted to try and solve but never had the chance?  
Hi Adam, I just wanted to know, how do you feel about the fact that you, along with Tested have inspired thousands of people to become makers when they otherwise wouldn't know where to start?From someone who never made anything cool until finding Tested 
Hi Adam, greetings from a very cold UK!My question is, how do you think improvements in virtual reality could impact on your work? Would you ever wish to "zone in" to a virtual reality space of a project you are working on and physically manipulate the object(s) in real time?Also, if you haven't already, watch the new series of Black Mirror on Netflix. I feel it's something you'd likely enjoy.
When you came to Pittsburgh,  did you ever have a primanti's sandwich?  If you haven't I suggest you come back and I will gladly buy you one and a beer!
What's in your CD Player/MP3 player/Music Device today?
Do you still have that astronaut suit? Do you ever wear it?
Is Peter Jackson's collection as awesome and deep as the rumors imply? 
Hi Adam! What is your favorite beer? 
Hello Adam!What moment during the making of Mythbusters did you feel the greatest sense of 'I may have just broken the universe'?
Hey Adam do you think we will ever get more of a tour of your house like you promised ? 
I realize I am late to the table, but hey, any chance you and Mike Rowe could get together and do a collaboration?
Given the rule "In a singularity, all objects are equidistant from one another, even if that distance is zero. When that distance becomes greater then 0 the resulting object must be a sphere in which the diameter of the sphere must be equal to the distance between any two points on the sphere." Given this, should I order pizza or Chinese for dinner tonight?
how can i build a homemade flamethrower?
1. What was being a Battlebots judge like?2. would you rather have a personal jetpack or a personal tank?
Hi Adam, I walked up to you at the a cappella convention in Memphis last year and asked for a picture, and soon after realized you probably just wanted to watch the performances in peace, so I'm sorry about that.  I guess my question would be how you feel about fans approaching you?  It seems to be polarizing to people with a following, so I was wondering what your take on it is.  
Hey Mister Savage,I teach UX Design and have often found that the medium changes, but design and it's core principles stay the same. Can you give a quote on what design means to you?
Hi Adam! The maker community tends to be very inclusive and supportive of certain rights (ex: to repair and modify things that you own). Do you have any suggestions as to how the maker community can organize to be more politically involved but while staying non-partisan?
How adorable is Norm's puppy? And can you post more pictures of him? 
Hey Adam! Big fan of Tested and your one day builds. Speaking of which how is you dog pillow bed doing? Do they still love it? 
What's the best movie you've seen this year? (Not necessarily that came out this year)
Adam, I am teaching a Freshman science class at this very moment. Any advice for them?Thanks!
How did you get your start with sewing and leatherworking? Your Kylo Ren piece and your other cosplay pieces have been really impressive. I'm trying to pick up a handcraft, but trying to avoid heavy machinery because I am a klutz. Love your one day builds!
In an episode of Mythbusters you had a chance to view the Earth from outer space, was is it flat?
Dear Adam SavageAre you ever going to do a pepakura build like a suit halo Spartan armor or some  iron man armor?- Adam Shuttleworth
Do you know my great uncle Michael lynch, he's told me stories of you since I was young. Do you know him?
I've seen several AMAs from you over the years.  Do you do these when people ask, or just wake up some mornings and think "I wanna answer some questions today?"
Slowly. Sorry about that. 
Achievement unlocked?
Damn, getting your quote in the Civ tech tree is pretty fucking legit. 
Don't worry we can wait a little bit :)
I'm gonna throw out a guess and say fridge nuke from Crystal Skull. It just seems so perfect.
We aren't in any of KG&T's show. I really hope they're successful as all getout. Can't wait to watch it.
I love live shows. I love touring and I love interacting with a live audience. There's stuff that happens in a room with people around that is genuinely electric. Jamie was done touring at the end of 2015, and Michael Stevens and I were mutual fans and started discussing it and it seemed like a natural. Magician Michael Weber, an incredible magic designer and writer is our director. 
Alton is the best. He's hilarious. He's just as funny as you want and a bit darker. 
When did this happen?! Oh man, how did I miss that?
Simone Gertz!!
Great question! Everyone should have a multi tool. Everyone should have something akin to the iFixit bit kit (to be able to take apart anything). Tools that are shit until you spend $:Air powered rivet gun. Don't waste your time on the $30.00 one. Spot Welder. Nippers: go ahead and invest in a set of Knipex nippers, the last pair you'll ever need.
She's a force of nature. Love her and her output. She's just as nice as you hope she is. 
well THAT's why it's taking so long to type!
That's THE question! The best way is to show them obsessive builds by others. Wake that part of the brain up that says "I've always wanted X, maybe I could make it MYSELF!". Also- sharing the build log/methods goes a long way to helping people understand that it's not beyond them to problem-solve.
I agree, years later I still think about that episode every time I see a video of the Tacoma Narrows bridge collapse. 
I also can't get enough of Justin Timberlake's song "Mirrors". Such good pop!!My kids make fun of me and say I have the musical taste of a 14 year old girl. I'm ok with that.

Go though all your formulas.They say they'll provide all of the formulas,but they never do
I've started tweeting myths I wish I could have gotten to. Under the hashtag #mythsiwouldstillliketotest. Like the roomba that went over someone's dog's poop and covered THE WHOLE HOUSE WITH A POOPOCALYPSE. We would totally have tested which type of stool would yield the worst scenario. Also cat vomit.
I haven't yet, but I love their work. Hoping to do something with them some day. 
Well it was a bit of a rush to start but I'm ok now. I got to the shop a little early and sorted tools so now I feel normal.Thanks for asking
CARDBOARD! You can make literally anything out of cardboard. Ask them their ideal costume and help them make it so!
Haha Destin do you just send those to everyone?
Destin from smarter every day? 
Don't forget: "Failure is always an option!"

Favorite burger is a Jardiniere in San Francisco (the owner, Traci Des Jardins is a friend so clear conflict of interest on my part) and lately she's been serving the Impossible Burger (all plant proteins!) which is INSANELY DELICIOUS. Serious. They serve it at the bar. Go try one.
Yes. Sigh. Reddit, like the web in general, is a mix of the high and low, the good and bad. When it's bad it feels like middle school at it's worst. I think the general tone of discourse on the reddit that I see is getting better rather than worse. That keeps me coming. I also spent lots of time on Metafilter as a salve to reddit's baser instincts. Seriously who makes fun of a 13 year old girl? Remember being 13? It sucked ass for all of us. Why make it worse?
Last ep. 5001lbs of ANFO.  Big boom
This is the best. Homeland security is on it's way. 
NSA checking in here, thanks from bringing this to our attention, we'll be in touch
Missouri State and New Mexico Tech offer degrees in explosives engineering, might be worth a look. I'm pretty sure most of the jobs are in mining or road construction, but it's an option.
You're right, but I like saying that I'm unemployed. 
I just figured out how I want to do the Adam Savage Book Club and details will be coming soon!!
My crew! And also the driving myths.
Love working with Michael. He talks just like he does in the videos, so that when he's handing you a coffee or talking over lunch, you half expect to do a VERY DEEP DIVE into what it's all about. I love the collaboration.
*this was not meant to be*
A two hour bombastic variety show using all the tools of the theater and stage magic to illustrate cool science, hosted by a pair of better-than-average explainers. With craptons of audience participation. I can't WAIT to hit the road. We're writing it right now and it's awesome.(braincandylive.com)
Talk less, listen more. Mansplain much less.
I love Akira. Metropolis. Ghost in the Shell. 
No! I will. What's in it?
Listening to a lot of the Milk Carton Kids and Decemberists. Also Sara Bareilles. 
Where are your parents?
Elon Musk - Adam Savage collaboration confirmed. GET HYPE. 
"Saint Barbara is often portrayed with miniature chains and a tower. As one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers, Barbara continues to be a popular saint in modern times, perhaps best known as the patron saint of armourers, artillerymen, military engineers, miners and others who work with explosives because of her old legend's association with lightning, and also of mathematicians."From her Wikipedia entry. I only happen to know this because I live in Santa Barbara, CA, and one day I decided to look up our namesake. 
Would you like to be the patron saint of ballistics?
Probably the best response to that. Well done Adam.
have you seen the quotes in Civ 6? They just googled "tech quote" and picked off travel blogs and shit it's pretty bad.
Wouldn't this Myth most definitely be, BUSTED?
60's Soviet tech
Why make it easy, how about 1860's tech?!
I want you to know that is the first time I hear them referred to as KG&T and think that's an excellent "team name" for them.
You both are the best in your given areas, IMHO.  
S10E20 "Food fables" one of my favorite episodes, Alton helps them cook a  Thanksgiving meal on the engine, catalytic converted and other parts of a car as the drive to where they are to eat it. Also they investigate the fastest way to cook popcorn with him.
!!! Posting that screenshot on my wall alright 
Do you recommend a particular multi-tool?
Blink twice if you're under duress Adam. 
You might want to check that username there 
I would also add a laser cutter to the space, of you can afford it. It's a terribly useful device, which few people can afford. And it draws a crowd. Come for the laser cutter, stay for the sewing lessons, would be my approach.

That's awesome to hear.   We know there was tension in the past (creative and just differences in general).  Not expecting bff type shit, but hopefully the mutual respect continues and grows...maybe someday...long from now you 2 blow something up together.
45 individual legos. Got it.
Tried this at momofuku in NYC after hearing that it was backed by Bill Gates. It's nothing short of a game changer for meatless burgers.
What a great response. It sucks when you get a bunch of adult asshats who make fun of a kid for petty reasons.
It would have been so tragic if the high speed camera failed for that one... again!

ADAM x MUSK - Dedicated for the geeky hypebeasts
Wow thanks for the info. Collective human intelligence is astounding. 
Don't you have to be dead for that?
Thank you.
Oh that's disappointing. I haven't played it yet. I just remember Leonard Nimoy quoting Lincoln and Gandhi and such.
Hasn't stopped them before. And come on, it's Indiana Jones + the biggest explosion ever, so who cares?
>I feel like that is just simple physics though.You just described the vast majority of their experiments. It still awesome to watch the physics work outside of a piece of paper and calculator. 
But when driving upside down,  rather than having the weight of the car + downforce, you have downforce - weight of the car. So this will be much much lower than the normal force on the tires. This causes a huge decrease in mechanical grip. Furthermore, it's not known if the chassis, suspension, and tires could handle the forces of driving sideways.My money says that it's not possible. /u/mistersavage , you know what to do.
rotary engine? or an all-electric rig? surely that could maintain the speeds they need for at least a short upside-down jaunt.

From what Adam talks about on the tested podcast he uses a leatherman charge and he bought one of his sons a leatherwan wave so I think his brand of choice would be leatherman 
He's being held hostage by one of her shitty robots.
I'm gonna take a stab here and guess he took this as a chance to compliment her...

More importantly, how much does this coffee, weigh?
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for?

the tanners didn't actually shoot in that San Francisco house they show in Full house where they supposedly lived. they were recorded in a studio. We never saw the inside of that house. the producers just picked a random SF house and took a pic of it. thats fucked up
Yep.For the time being, best we can do is canonize Adam's eyebrow.

Lol, that'd be a little bit different ending for the Indiana Jones series. He survive, blood's pouring from the cuts all over him, concussed and confused.

Do you write out fully sketched profiles of characters before you start the plot?
The end of chapter suspense moments always got me and my little sister all excited every time I'd read one of the books to her. it got to the point it'd urge us to read on past our bedtime getting us in trouble numerous times. So my question is why the war on bedtime?
Have you ever considered writing for comic books?
Are you afraid of the dark?
Hey Bob, loved your books and show growing up. Can you give me a sentence that will scare me as an adult?
How do you feel about the goosebumps movie?I grew up reading goosebumps, now i love horror as an adult...thank you.
Was season 1 episode 8 of the television series, "My Hairiest Adventure," meant as a puberty allegory?You da man, Bob! 
Now that Stephen King just put out a children's book are you going to put out an adult horror novel in response?
Happy Halloween! Loved the Goosebumps series growing up! Thanks for playing a big part in my childhood. On a side note, love hearing your voice on R.L. Grime's Halloween mixes. How did he reach out to you, and have you actually listened to any of his mixes? 
Who did you read growing up?
Dr. Seuss, or Shel Silverstein?     Walt Disney, or Jim Henson?
How do you begin writing a story?  How much is Romantic inspiration and how much is pragmatic design/planning?  
Which book of yours is your favorite?
What do you think the scariest movie of all time is? 
Mr. Stine, thank you for doing this! I'm a little starstruck, you were one of my favourite authors as a kid.Two questions for you:1. Who is your favourite horror author, besides yourself?2. How do you feel about the Goosebumps TV show that aired in the '90's?Thanks!
Is it wrong of me to want more of your stories? 
Where did the idea for Slappy come from, and why does he seem to be a mastermind puppeteer? 
Every time I watch Wheel of Fortune and they give the most common letters (RLSTNE), I think about you.Is that where you got your Pen Name from?
Oh. My. God.1st I love you, you basically raised me - I've read every single Goosebumps multiple times.**Can you explain your method for writing choose your own adventures??** Do you just start with one storyline and then add others? Do they happen separately or at the same time? I have some very very well worn in 'give yourself goosebumps' books and I always loved how the different options really felt natural and none of them stuck out as awkward  
What is the best memory you have from working on Eureka's Castle?
Hello, Mr. Stine. Thank you for being part of my childhood. The books still give me the creeps to this day.The ones that scared me the most were the Monster Blood books. How did you come up with the idea of a substance that could be so terrifying?
Wow. My son has read over a hundred Goosebumps books in the last few months. I wish he was home today to ask you a few questions but I will ask for him. How do you come up with scary ideas, but still make make them appropriate for kids?  Also, what is your favorite series that you have written?
What was the worst character you've ever written? 
Did you read Animorphs? 
How are you? Have you been getting good sleep? Eating right? 
Hey Mr. Stine!! What's your favorite Halloween candy? Please don't say candy~~corn~~garbage
hello this is chuck tingle i am the best author in billings and PROUD DAD here is question:you have proved love with important books MY DUMMY IS HANDSOME and THERES A HAND IN THE BASEMENT, showing that love is real for both dummys and hands. do you have any ideas for books that prove love is real for handsome unicorns or are do you believe they are too cute to be scary? (i disagree with this way but i would like to hear your opinion)
What literary works influence you the most?
Will there be any more "Give Yourself Goosebumps" books? Those were my favorite as a kid.
What do you think of Rod Serling's work?
How often do you look back at a book, and wish you had done something differently?
What is a type of book you have always wanted to write, but for one reason or another never have gotten a chance to?
What was your favourite book to write? Where do you draw inspiration? Do you miss the TV series they did from your books?
Have you met the 'Ermehgerd' girl? 
What are you scared of? 
How's the relationship between you and Henry (RL Grime)? How's the interaction for the Halloween mix go down? You just send him a demo of you saying whatever you want?
Man I wrote you back in like 2003 for some middle school book project on that goosebumps book about a robot and choosing your own adventure and I never got a response... All the other kids got a response... Why you make me cry? 
I grew up reading Fear Street, and I absolutely loved them. Any plans to write any more of that series?
I'm Marcus, 9 years old and your biggest fan.  I was wondering if you were tormented as a kid?  How did you come up with your ideas?  They are really creepy.  Thank you for being you.
do you like mustard?
Any memorable stories from when you meant Stephen King that weren't covered in the media?
Hello Mr. Stine!Your books were a huge source of my love of reading as a child which has developed into adulthooed, especially the books regarding Chucky. My question is what is the source of your inspirations, and do you use your books to share any messages that you find important for kids?
Where is your dream vacation spot?
How close was Jack black's portrayal of you in the movie?
If you could re-write any of your books for an adult audience, which would it be?
I write a vey complete chapter-by-chapter outline of every book before I start writing.
Sleeping vs. reading-- it's a hard choice.
I'm writing a series of comic books for Marvel--  my first comics ever. But I'm not allowed to talk about them yet.
Isn't everyone?
Don't get scared, but it's time for me to leave. Thank you, everyone, for the great questions. I hope you enjoy the Hunting Hour marathon on Discovery Family Channel. And I hope you have a scary Halloween. Bye for now.
I was really happy with the GB Movie. I'm so glad they're talking about doing a sequel.
God, that's probably Jontrons greatest video to date. Memorable quotes from the video "FBI should be knocking this door down any minute""CANT A GUY GET SOME *PRIVACY*?? HMM HMM HM HM HMM"Larry- I had to check to see if there was hair growing anywhere elseJon- No no no, no no Larry- none on my chestJon- please LarryLarry- None on my backJon- you don't know what you're doing Larry- and now... Jon- STOP 
My latest adult horror novel is titled RED RAIN.
Is it actually on sale now?
I love the R.L. Grime mixes. Of course I listen to them.
Yo could you send me the link to that mix
Tim's covers were amazing. I always sent him short summaries of the stories. He painted at the same time I was writing the book.
Glad you guys are back! Are we going to have a long wait for camp jelly jam?
I read mostly comics--Tales from the Crypt, The Vault of Horror, MAD. When I was nine, I discovered Ray Bradbury. Changed my life.
I'd vote for all four.
All of my stories start with a title. The title leads me to the story.
My favorite GB book is he Haunted Mask. I also enjoy writing the Slappy books-- he's so evil, he's fun to write.
I'm a big Stephen King fan. I think he's a terrific storyteller. I also like Peter Straub.
Yes, terribly wrong. You need help.
I was very happy with the movie. I think it could have been a TINY bit scarier. But I truly loved the way it came out.
They use the order RSTLNE though
His name is actually Robert Lawrence Stine
This was my favorite part of Goosebumps!  I would tag the decision page and then go down one path, and then go back to the decision and do the other! Seriously, R. L. Stine made reading so much fun. Between him and J.K. Rowling, I became a lifetime reader.
As a child, i was always disappointed that this never became a big thing in movies. I always wanted a choose your own storyline movie because i loved it in books so much. I think the closest there is something like a porn version of choose your own storyline on dvd.
Working with the puppeteers was the most fun a writer could have. Did you know that I modeled Batly the Bat after my son Matt?
I'm working on a new GB series for next year. It's called Goosebumps SlappyWorld. The first book is called Slappy Birthday to You.
Jellyjam from Camp Jellyjam. He smelled so bad, he died of his own odor.
Matt is doing well. He does sound design for theater companies, and he has a two-year-old son, my grandson Dylan.
I'm very loyal to the KitKat Bar.
Searched your name. First book result. "Gay T-Rex Law Firm". Ok. Edit - Next result. "Space Raptor Butt Invasion"
There's nobody better at asking HARD questions than Chuck Tingle.
Rod Serling was a hero of mine. The Twilight Zone was a big influence on me. I've seen them all.
I always wish I had done something differently, but I seldom look back at books. Gotta move on to the next one.By the way, the new Fear Street book is called The Dead Boyfriend. I'm enjoying writing Fear Street again. And watch for a Fear Street movie next year!
No such thing. 
No. Has anyone ever met her??
Game of Thrones.
I'm scared you might miss The Haunting Hour marathon that starts in two hours on Discovery Family Channel. Seven straight hours of R.L. Stine shows. Hope you don't miss it.
The cycle of abuse continues.
He's not responding to you this time either. Don't be sad, he didn't answer me either.  :(
Why are you asking this? Do you have a thing about mustard?
He accused me of using up all of the amusement park plots in the world.
How to write a book. Step 1. Write all the chaptersStep 2.
Oh my god, this is such a good idea. To just write like a time line of what is going to happen in each chapter and write it from there.
A choice with only one answer, or so my childhood self seemed to think.Thank you for all those nights spent reading late under the covers with a flashlight!
When you are, please let us on /r/Marvel know!  I would be excited for that!
You... you just did...
I'm not afraid of the dark. It's what's in the dark that you have to watch out for. Like creepies, and crawlies, and clowns, and bus drivers, and my step dad, and lake monsters.
Glad to hear this and loved your cameo at the end. Watched it for the first time on Saturday night and really enjoyed it. Did you think Jack Black did a good job portraying you? 
Confirmed enough for me! 
Oh Larry. He's hard to love, but he's harder to hate.
See if He'll do an AMA
Oh so the lesson was umm..DONT BE A DOG
Childhood me would be thrilled that R.L. Stine just answered my silly question.Adult me is just as thrilled.Thank you!
> RED RAINMy #2 all-time favorite girls' coming-of-age Thriller.  Right after *Carrie*
November 22nd!

/r/trap's collective heart just melted <3
r/trap we are peaking
Were you ever influenced by something he may have painted before you were finished writing?
Do you have a favorite cover?
Hopefully not. Plus we've got a Give Yourself Goosebumps planned as well, where we'll read every single page and upload the pages individually so that you can literally choose pages on YouTube. And we'll be taking shots for every ending we hit...
Ever read The Illustrated Man? My high school library had a tiny copy of this, hardbound, with the best illustrations of the guy's tattoos.
#BRADBERRY
They're all dead, no need to worry about hurting their feelings.
In the fourth grade I was told by my after-school program to go to the media room and pick out a VHS tape for everyone to watch. I went in, looked through all of the Sesame Street, Veggie Tales, Princess movie horribleness and chose The Haunted Mask 1. I took it back and was admonished by my teacher for picking a movie that was too scary to watch. Just know that you were my source of inspiration when I wrote "Ms. Stevenson is a wuss" on the inside of one of the classroom cubbies later on. 
I just want to say I loved your books as a kid and still love them now. My absolute favorites were the Fear Street series. Also my nephew who is 8 is obsessed with Slappy, he carries him around everywhere and creeps people out lmao
Me too! Scared the CRAP out of me in fourth grade
But you didn't answer the second question.
You traumatized me as a kid and I want more.
Well, I tried. 
 but did his parents get the name from WOF
>I would tag the decision page and then go down one path, and then go back to the decision and do the other!But...but that's *cheating!*
Like a game, but on video!
Do you refer to him as Mattly the Mat?
are we gonna talk about how he didn't answer either question
Ngl that book made me physically ill with how AMAZINGLY DISGUSTING you described him. I was probably 12 or so and ended up having to throw up towards the end. Bravo.
All scary stories to tingle your butt and get hard with your buds
Can't forget the literary classic "*Pharma Bro Pounded in the Butt by T-Rex Comedian Bill Murky and a Clan of Triceratops Rappers Trying to Get Their Album Back*" 
I would read the fuck out of Gay T Rex Law Firm. If that book has just two of those things id be happy
Dr. Chuck Tingle is a pseudonymous author of gay niche erotica. He self-publishes his works through Amazon.com, primarily as ebooks, but also as paperbacks and audiobooks
Check his AMA. That is pure gold!
I...don't even know what to think. You almost have to think something like this is all just satire and trolling. 
What do you think of Black Mirror?
OMG the Fear Street books were the best!! Especially the cheerleader series 
My favorite part of this answer is the implication that he already knew the meme before the question was asked.
My childhood nightmare relived why!!!!
/r/restofthefuckingowl
For some people outlines are like the blueprints of a building (general ideas, this goes here and that goes there, etc.) For others the outline's the actual structural beams of the building (entire sentences or even scenes written into the outline, minute details of the story, etc.) 
I had a Goosebumps clip on book light that was well used in these scenarios
Thanks for letting me know this sub is a thing!
Now the ghost of comics future will come to haunt him
Bob actually had a cameo in that movie as Mr. Black the drama teacher.  
Pretty sure the film's version was a completely fictionalized version of "R.L. Stine"
That's awesome that you found it, though. I was incredibly lucky in that my Ma read to me and my brother a lot growing up and instilled a love of reading. Elementary school was all Goosebumps and Animorphs
I think childhood you would be disappointed that adult you used the time machine to tell childhood you that R.L. Stine once answered one of your questions.
I've always had a special place in my heart for *Cloudy with a Chance of Menstruation*
Now I'm just picturing him dabbing and shit while he writes.
My favorite cover is Johnny Cash's version of NIN's "Hurt".
If he answers this one I'm going to buy that book.
Post your actual house for proof
Am I missing something here?  He's always been credited as Bradbury.  Is there an inside joke that I'm on the outside of?
I was surprised to see so little mention of Fear Street in here. I loved those books.
>The movies are the movies. They just make them. If they're good, that's terrific. If they're not, they're not. But I see them as a lesser medium than fiction, than literature, and a more ephemeral medium.Stephen King is a fantastic writer, but oh my god do I hate the mentality that there's such a thing as superior and inferior art forms.
If you can't say something nice... 
Stockdrome synholm
Victoria never would have let this happen...
I know! But it was only once I finished the original path!I had to know what ALL of the options were for the storyline! I was obsessed!My mom used to ground me from my books when I was bad!
I think his favourite is the series he's writing, but he still didn't answer the first part :(
The last 4-5 were pretty bad, but honestly the entire series was rife with body horror and some pretty dark moral tones.
Also they traveled back in time and met Hitler before he was all that bad. They then debated on whether or not to Kill Hitler in this young adult fiction book.
Lookin' goooood...
In fun and NORMAL ways
>please do not ask me about seals i do not understand them as animalsThis is golden.
there is nothing trolly or satirical about TRUE LOVE
I've been hearing some talk about this one. How similar is it to Twilight Zone?
And like that you've given that subreddit more traffic than it's seen in months.
For me, outlines are an imaginary shack that I build in my head and it's sort of made about of strewn about pieces of wood and nails.
I got mine from bookclub lol.
Good tip. If you find a new hobby or interest. There's a subreddit for it. I usually just google "[Hobby] Reddit"
I loved that, the ol' Goosebumps switcharoo
I don't think so - I think the whole movie was based on an actual event.
Animorphs man... what a time to be a kid reading
I wasn't clever back then. At least he'll know that won't change.
Thats just spaghetti sauce dude... 
He dabs every time he finishes a chapter.
Did you know Steve Buscemi was a firefighter during 9/11?
To be fair, I think he was trying to say is you're too limited in movies with the 1.5-2 hour time length, whereas you could jam every detail about a character in literature. That's why it's very hard for directors to convey a book into a movie because of all the little details you have to masterfully implant in the short period of time without making it feel cluttered. Maybe I'm reaching, but that's what I got from that bit.
Say it anyways, because it's probably true?
I copped the same punishment as a kid, except my old man would throw in a twist. "Oh, sure, you can still read. Here, this is a geology book from 1987. Read away. I'm gonna quiz you after."Nothing says 'don't get caught doing something wrong' like having your entertainment options stripped down to 'pop quizzes on rocks'.
And then in a later novel, the rat is given a chance to become human if he can persuade one of the Animorphs to give up on the team and instead serve an evil multidimensional entity instead... but the rat fails and he begs for death instead, with no clear resolution (e.g. no main character saying "good guys don't kill" or anything like that).
IIRC it was written with the thought of "what would happen to children if they were placed into war in combat," which is pretty fucked to begin with.  I read everyone as a child but never realized how fucked up they were until later on.  Makes sense I guess how fucked up I turned out.
They actually met Hitler in a different timeline. WWII was going on anyways, and Hitler was just a driver. They were trying to hunt down a time-traveling maniac. This is after Jake gets shot in the head trying to cross the Delaware River with George Washington. The Animorphs were weird.
And then completely abandoned as I opt for building a beach house five miles east. 
If it exists, there is ~~porn~~ a subreddit of it
You know what, now that you point it out I must have been thinking of something else.
We lucked out with so much good material: Lemony Snicket's, the Harry Potter books, Artemis Fowl, Captain Underpants...
That's an awfully clever statement.
Mom's spaghetti?
Did you know that swans can be gay?
Yeah, it's deliberately left up to your imagination whether or not Rachel kills him.
It's like if Red Dawn had less accents and more awkward puberty
Jesus christ, these were books for children!?
oh gosh, captain underpants - I remember that from 3rd grade.
Broken arms.
You just know she did though.
That was the great thing about them. They gave zero fucks and pulled zero punches. Because the characters had the ability to heal from any non-lethal injury, just by changing shapes, there was no soft-shoeing on the gore.Anyone who ever read them wiill have at least one body-horror memory they haven't purged. Rachel in grizzly morph, so caked in bloodlust she didn't realize her paw was cut off. Or the time fly-Jake  got swatted in an airplane and the others, all as flies, had to  carry his guts around.

you didn't even mention ants
Governors Johnson and Weld,What is the campaign's strategy to get into the debates if you are not at 15% in the CPD polls. Is there a backup plan, or any other leverage or influence you have that could get you in?
Governor Johnson- what inspired you to switch party allegiance from Republican to Libertarian?Governor Weld- what made you want to join the Libertarian party?
Do you believe it is the role of the US government to maintain hundreds of military bases all over the world?
You've made clear that marijuana legalization is a priority.  What about other vices that create black markets, like gambling, specifically sports gambling?  Prostitution?  
Hi, Governor Johnson. If you are elected, what do you hope your legacy will be seen as after your term?Best of luck and thank you for being a voice of reason! 
Governor Johnson, Governor Weld, thank you for doing this AMA. I would like to ask two questions:1. It is abundantly clear that America has a healthcare problem. Americans pay far more than any other Western nation for healthcare, and it is a leading cause of bankrupcy. What is your plan to address this issue, if elected?2. What do you feel your strongest states are? Where will you two be campaigning, and where do you think you have the best chance of winning?
Gov. Johnson, you've said that you love the Game of Thrones. If you could be one of the characters who would you be and why? 
Governor Johnson, I am an avid fan and a potential voter of yours. I must know:If elected, would you work to abolish the electoral college? Would you also consider replacing our system of plurality voting with the Borda Count Method or even rank-choice voting as Dr. Jill Stein does?
What is your view/stance on the North Dakota Native American protesters that have been attacked near the pipeline?
If you do not get into the 1st debate (and at this point, I'm assuming you will NOT be invited to IAVA either :-(  ), would you consider using video of those debates, and have your answers edited into them to share publicly? Alternatively, could you and Gov. Weld at least put out a release with your answers to the questions posed to Trump and Clinton? It would be wonderful to have something to share with your replies to the same questions.
Governor Gary Johnson,Do you support the ban on kratom?The DEA is attempting emergency scheduling of the plant kratom.  Thousands of people use this herb for everything from kicking addictions to chronic pain to enhancing their concentration (small doses have a  slight stimulant effect).  Sept. 30th many people will no longer have access to something that allows them to carry on with their lives.
Gov. Johnson, you have stated repeatedly that you want to cut the US's military spending. As a US Soldier, I actually support this, but how do you plan to make the cuts? If left up to the individual forces, I'm sure the men and women serving will be the one who bear the brunt of the cuts. How will you simultaneously cut the military budget, and protect the interests of our service members? 
Gov. Johnson, my biggest problem with the election is that even with two horrible choices, the general media coverage still ignores 3rd parties.  What can we do and what are you doing to get the attention you deserve? 
Gov. Gary Johnson, I'm a huge Libertarian supporter and you surely have my vote. I'm wondering if you could explain your policy on privatized prisons. I realize that the private sector is usually better and more efficient at allocating resources but wouldn't privatized prisons lead to the desire (by prison owners) to have more and more prisoners and to keep costs low? Please explain?
What is your stance on nuclear energy? Do you think we should lift the ban on constructing new/more efficient nuclear power plants?
Governors Johnson and Weld, thanks so much for doing this. You two have mentioned before that your presidency would be a two man team. Could one of you describe how a partnership like that would operate?
I have a question for the both of you.....what are your favorite science fiction films?  
Would you direct your Drug Czar to de-schedule Marijuana during your first week in office? Why do you believe that our current President, who makes jokes about his prior marijuana usage while many are still being incarcerated for broken windows policing, has not done so?
Hello Governors, former Bernie supporter who converted to you two here, and I'm so glad to have two sane individuals on the ballot this year!I have two questions.1. Would you support efforts to end government sactioned cable company monopolies that reduce competition in the market?2. Do you support net neutrality? I don't see it as government interference, just merely a way to ensure the free market exists online. Do you feel the same way?Thanks so much for your time! I'm proud to be doing everything I can to get you to 15%! I believe in you guys!
Governor Johnson, The DEA recently announced they are adding Kratom; a plant leaf used by hundreds of thousands of Americans to treat pain, anxiety, and opiate addiction; to the list of schedule 1 drugs without hearings, public comment, or congressional review. Given the disastrous consequences of the war on drugs; how do you feel about this latest action?
The mission of the Commission on Debates is to educate people about the presidential election. 76% of all voters in the United States say they want Johnson-Weld, by name, in the presidential debates. End of argument.
Term limits is our one silver bullet for the poisonous dysfunction in Washington, D.C. If the Republicans and Democrats were only there for 6 or 12 years, they would do the right thing. I was the National Chairman of US Term Limits when I was Governor. 
The Trans-Pacific Partnership is actually very valuable for the United States as a strategic geopolitical play. It puts us into partnership with 11 Pacific-facing nations, not including China, so it gives us an automatic strategic beachhead in Asia. The free-trade aspects benefit the United States, as always, because of our edge in productivity. 
Shedding the social conservative dogma of the Republican Party.  (On behalf of Gov. Weld, he feels the same way.)
No, we would initially target a 20% reduction in those bases.
I do believe that marijuana should be legalized, and I do believe California will legalize it in November, which will be a tipping point.  An example of a black market in marijuana is Washington state where a black market still survives due to too many taxes.
Sorry, but doesn't PR themselves get to decide on whether or nor they become a state and get granted those rights?
Honesty, transparency, not a hypocrite (not saying one thing and doing another).
The best way to reduce health care costs is to get more competition into the system. This means health savings accounts, this means not requiring everyone to buy a cradle-to-grave policy, but instead they could buy a catastrophic-injury policy and after that negotiate with individual vendors.
I would be Jon Snow.  My favorite Game of Thrones scene is Jon Snow, holding his sword, ready to be slain, only to survive.
How would eliminating the electoral college work? Would it have to be an amendment?
We would advise the Department of Defense that receipt of required financial statements would be a precondition to determining their appropriations for the following fiscal year.
We believe far too many Americans are currently incarcerated. We do believe in redemption, and we feel that much of recidivist behavior has to do with conditions encountered by former inmates upon their release. Resources for ex-offenders are short money, given the costs of recidivism.   
I'm obviously not /u/GovGaryJohnson, but look for a Libertarian Party press release on kratom very soon.
Willing to bet that he1. Doesn't know what Kratom is2. Would oppose the ban if he did
Highly doubt he's for the ban of Kratom. Only my opinion though.
This is very important to alot right about now.  Good question.
Governors, there are several questions about this currently rising. It seems a lot of people are very keen on a candidate who is against scheduling Kratom, and I doubt this is a partisan issue for them. I know that the libertarian ethos is very consistent with not scheduling Kratom, so this seems like a really easy, low-hanging-fruit way to pick up a few hundred thousand votes! :)
Work visas would be unlimited in quantity, subject to background checks and provision of Social Security Numbers.  No quotas.
With any cut, people will lose jobs. But these are points of excessive spending by the government. We can't save, without making these cuts. It is simply not manageable anymore. I think people would just have to find other jobs, like how it is with any other case. 
Weld had a hard fought battle AGAINST the gun control in MA, but as a pragmatist he brought both sides to the table and was able to knock out some less intense regulation. MA is a very blue state, and was going to pass SOMETHING for gun control, he was able to reduce the impact. I can't find the link right now, but he had glowing supports from the NRA back then.

Congratulations on your accomplishments and your life thus far!  You're the person I'm standing up for with my position on immigration.  I think that what you're talking about is a state issue.  As Governor of New Mexico, I would have sided with you on the issue.  As President, I will continue to be your advocate.
The best way to reduce health care costs is to get more competition into the system. This means health savings accounts, this means not requiring everyone to buy a cradle-to-grave policy, but instead they could buy a catastrophic-injury policy and after that negotiate with individual vendors.
> 76% of all voters in the United States say they want Johnson-Weld, by name, in the presidential debates.What is this figure based on? Frankly, given the political apathy in this country, I'd be absolutely stunned if "76% of all voters in the United States" even knew Johnson-Weld are running. 
> Term limits is our one silver bullet for the poisonous dysfunction in Washington, D.C.But, Governor, wouldn't term limits lead to inexperienced legislators being taken gross advantage of by private interests, as we saw so clearly in the Texas energy barons' extortion of the California energy market?
Any reason this stance is not listed on the Issues page of your website?
Thank you! I think this is what holds the Republican party back the most. They have ideas that should certainly be heard, but when so much of it comes from virulently backwards social ideologies that don't have a place in 21st century America, it destroys so much of their claim.
What is the selection criteria?
That stance is widely known.  What I was asking about was other vices.  If you'll only answer one, I'd like to know about sports gambling since it is strangely legal in limited states yet a federal law restricts it in those not "grandfathered-in"
Balanced Rebellion is awesome!
Honestly I believe your legacy as it stands right now would be civility in a time of ruthless mudslinging. I admire so much your tact and courtesy, even in the face of two unfavorable opponents. I will be proud to vote for you!
Did you just roast Amnesty International?
it was on a Post-It note somewhere no doubt
In companies that work in media, there are often master documents that contain the login info for social accounts. Usually these are stored on the company's intranet server or, more recently, as a Google doc that all consumer-/public-facing employees have access to. Whenever a new account is made, the info is recorded there for future reference. Easy peasy. 
This seems too sensible to be coming from a presidential candidate, but it is.
Citizenfour was awesome. It took me from viewing Snowden as a narcissist (the way I felt he had been painted by the media) to a really thoughtful and well put together person. 
PLEASE say this LOUD AND CLEAR.
Part of me feels like amnesty international already knows this...
And when companies collude and start launching services that force paying customers (and website owners) to pay MORE money for content versus customers having to pay for speed? How would you address this or do you feel this wouldn't happen?Because it is happening. T-Mobile, Verizon, and Comcast have all started opening up those doors. Look at Netflix having to apply throttling so that they don't get "fined" by ISPs for "sucking up too much bandwidth", despite me (the paying customer) paying to access that data.
If corporations start taking advantage of the freedom of the internet would you support legislation that opposes the corporatizing of the Internet?
Check out the NBC News poll from this morning. We're at 15 points or above in 15 states and in double digits in 42 states.  The poll shows us at 25% in New Mexico and 23% in Utah.
* What happens to people who under-insure themselves?* What happens to children of people who under-insure those children?* Do you support the ban on pre-exisitng conditions?* If not, how will we deal with those who are not presented with affordable plans?* Do you support the system as it is, where employers can claim a tax break on insurance plans?
Health in an inelastic good though. You don't get to choose whether or not you want to go to the doctor based on your willingness and ability to pay. How would competition guarantee healthcare for all?? With the epipen and other life saving drugs being exorbitantly priced, I don't see how healthcare would be any different without regulation. Can you explain?
But no matter how much competition is introduced.  Some people will never or will never be able to afford any level of healthcare.  What would happen to these people who need medical treatment?
KING IN THE NORTH!
A candidate that admits they don't know everything? What is this madness
Could you be a bit more explicit about the complexities of implementing a carbon tax?Are you referencing the difficulty of capturing the true social cost of carbon emissions?
You now have my vote.
If you are so sane, why are you in politics?
So much common sense in this AMA, it's refreshing.
I'll throw in my vote for Johnson if he changes his stance for privatized prisons. The problem with putting prisons into the hands of private owners is the fact that it allows for leeway into making prisons a sort of for-profit industry rather than a place for prisoners to be rehabilitated.
Guys, this is the chairman of the Libertarian National Convention; he did an AMA a few weeks ago and is in charge of the LP platform. His word here is as good as the word of the Governors. 
Just hearing a presidential candidate even mention being against the ban would sway me. I have an L4/L5 & L5/S1 injury and kratom has been a lifesaver for pain control for me.
I found out today that you and Bernie were the only candidates to NOT received a "PANTS ON FIRE" from Politifact. Congratulations! 
But the important question: Which one of you is better at chess?
That's not what I'm worried about. Given the option, there's a fair number of people who will be willing to leave. However, I'm more concerned that programs that take care of us and our families being cut, instead of, you know, the Army just picking a fucking uniform and sticking with it already.
Were they "going to pass something" or did they have the ability to pass something by overriding a veto?
Your knowledge of obscure films is impressive, sir. Your approval rate is soaring on my end.
Transparently speaking, what does this stance actually entail? 
Yeah, as much as I support Johnson I have a hard time taking this figure at face value.
And guess why they didn't join.
I've never wholeheartedly disagreed with a lot of big Republican government policies. But when they campaign for less government control, and turn around and want to propagate intelligent design in schools and fight against Planned Parenthood... it's such blatant hypocrisy. I can't support one policy without supporting the others, which is clearly the problem with the two-party system. (And yes, I know, not all Republicans are like that. But I'd bet 99% of social conservatives like that happen to be Republican.)
I think a better way of looking at it is that anyone - citizen or elected official - is entitled to hold any kind of values/opinions they want, even Christian conservative social ones... But they should separate personal life from office holder, church from state, etc.  They shouldn't try to legislate their religion onto society.
I would guess he would rely on the military advisors for that. Hard for a civilian to have anything other than a general plan.
I've come out in favor of legalizing online poker. I think sports gambling should be legal, too.
This is really good, mate. I'm in a bad place right now, but this really feels like the motivation someone needs to try and push harder.
plus the video was really funny and sad...mostly sad that Clinton and Trump have so much support.
If they were truly suffering and truly needed the help from the US, what's stopping them from becoming a state other than their own choice not to?
Mmm, International Roast
> based on what I knowthis is so important
I would not be surprised to see Utah and New Mexico turn gold on election night.
It was the Washington Post poll actually that polled all those states. You were at 12% in the NBC/SurveyMonkey National Poll released today though.
Libertarians don't have good answers to these questions. Competition doesn't work when people are dealing with their health. The Free Market makes sense when we're talking about categories where the laws of supply and demand can be applied. Health Care is not one of those categories. 
The epipen had its priced jack specifically because their competition vanished. There are several companies trying to get alternate injectors out there, but they've been blocked by the FDA. So my guess is that changing the regulation around approval, and speeding up the process, would help here.
Someone photoshop this man a sword
r/FeelTheJohnson
A human being, that's who.
He has my upvote.
Why aren't you?
Let's hope hope it's positive. We need all the support we can get!
Yeah, I'm sure Johnson knows people use it as a medicine. I wish you the best.
My wife asked me how i could support bernie and now support johnson.It comes down to integrity.  You can go far to the left, and far to the right, and both can work out just fine, as long as there is mutual respect from both sides.Sanders and johnson are statesmen.  Hillary and trump are soooo fuckin 90's.Were done with hollywood.
~~Its definitely Bill Weld. He can play multiple games of chess simultaneously while blindfolded.~~*EDIT* Apparently this isn't so clear cut.
Bill Weld must be one of the most cultured politicians I have ever seen. And he doesn't even hide it. In a debate Kerry accusses him of being too wealthy and out of touch. He answers with a quote on Latin. He just doesn't give a fuck about the anti-intelectuals and I love him for that.
Best. Response.
He invoked state's rights rather than outright support amnesty  because he realizes his stance would offend many conservatives that are dissatisfied with Trump, but aren't libertarians.
Sorry about that. This is my first time on Reddit!
I doubt 76% of voters could correctly identify both presidential candidates by name, let alone their running mates.
lol, the iava thought it had it bad
> The CPD's tax-exempt status is revoked for being bipartisan instead of non-partisanThat's an amazing angle and would absolutely work.
Is this why the IAVA push is so important? Are they setting precedent?
"You expect them to do the right thing in their last term when they have nothing to lose politically."Sure, for presidents. They're not looking for work after the end of their term. But for any lower office? If you're not looking to get re-hired by 51% of voters, you're looking to get hired by someone else. So you'll treat your last term in office as a job interview for that someone else.
I've heard people outcry against Internet privacy encroachment included in the TPP. How real is this concern?
They didn't join because they didn't see it as a net benefit to their domestic economy. Gov. Weld responded as if the goal of the TPP was to deepen the American economic foothold in East and SE Asia in order to counter China, when in reality it was assumed that China would join (or at least think about joining) the agreement. They weighed their options and decided not to join.The invitation is still open, so they could join literally any time they wanted. They choose not to.
>(And yes, I know, not all Republicans are like that. But I'd bet 99% of social conservatives like that happen to be Republican.)Oooh, I've met socially conservative democrats. They're scary folks.
Unfortunately their base is full of people who think America is a Christian country and should uphold Christian values.
So he doesn't know more than the generals? /s
Hmmm, it's almost as if their personal interests are in some sort of conflict with their purpose.
Thank you for coming back to my question.  This is a very refreshing take on gambling. 
Its a good statement. As Snowden showed us, there's sooooo much that they don't tell the public. 
This would be legitimately incredible.  Even winning one state is a colossal win not just for the Libertarian Party, but third parties as a whole.I am sadly in a state where this is basically impossible, but best of luck to voters in these states.
Wait, the liberatarian color is gold? Sweet!
Brace yourselves, Clinton is coming
Quick, someone Photoshop his face onto this!
It can be in the Photoshop Battles sub in minutes. People will have a field day.
That sounds... sexual.
I love this! It's just like being in IT. Everyone expects you to know everything about anything that bleeps and bloops. It's just not possible. I've always been fine with saying "I don't know now but I will soon". Also, most people can tell if you're talking out of your ass. So best to educate yourself before speaking.
> And in this case the Libertarian argument would be, as individuals we could have brought suit against polluters. We can bring suit individually. Well, in the case of Molycorp, you know what, they would have been able to withstand any individuals trying to bring that suit against them.One of my biggest issues with Libertarians is that, from my perspective, it seems they way too often and way too quickly stray into the realm of Anarcho-Capitalism. So its damn refreshing to see a prominent Libertarian politician not gloss over the legitimate roll government can and should play.
wow. this  has convinced me that I like this guy
Because it tends to costs an amount of money no average citizen has available to even run for any major elected office, let alone win.
so it could be used to get someone off of suboxone?
I voted for Johnson in 2012, and I'll probably vote for him in 2016, but I was really hoping to be able to vote for Sanders in 2016.My reasons for both are that I like the guy that comes along and says, "Let's try something new and see if it fixes our problem." Johnson wants to try some new things, Bernie wanted to try some new things.What I don't want is Hillary saying, "Let's do the things we've always done and see if it fixes the problem." or Trump saying, "Let's make more problems and see if we have problems."
But Gary beat him when they played.
In all fairness though, States' rights need to make a comeback given the differences of opinion in this country. I think that some things are better left for some groups of people to disagree on.
The poll that figure is from had a question with something along the lines of "if a candidate is on ballots in the majority of states, should they be a nvluded in the debates." it wasn't specific to this ticket, though it did have their qualifications covered. 
The primary concern was with copyright law. Any expansion in copyright law and penalties for breaking those laws can basically always be considered a bad thing. 
I'm a Christian, actually a worship director for two relatively large churches in California, and I am always telling people this:We should focus our efforts on changing hearts, not laws. Even Jesus said that to obey the letter of the law is not enough. Sure you didn't murder that guy, but if you hold hatred in your heart you are still in sin. So forcing your morality upon people through laws, guns, and prisons does nothing for the kingdom of God. And in fact it alienates those with whom you might otherwise have had an opportunity to share God's love. 
*Believe me*
I didn't think he was coming back. Good stuff. :)
It's a great answer really. Covers his ass if Gary actually was in a position of power to bring Snowden back.
Join the party. I'm a conservative in NY. Even a Republican winning isn't remotely possible. This is my biggest reason to vote Johnson. Lol. No one I vote for will win. (since I don't vote for corrupt career politicians who knowingly violated federal law...) thus if I vote Johnson it's out of protest to the current party system and to try to help boost the LP. 
That's his secret, Clinton is always coming.
Start small. Run for local office, gain trust from donors, do a good job, climb the ladder.
REMATCH! REMATCH!
I had money on it
>  Covers his ass if Gary actually was in a position of power to bring Snowden back.I think it's pretty line with how Gary talks.  He prefaces a ton of his desires for what he'd do as president for things like "If Congress submitted..."I chalk it up to him being governor and so understanding his real limitations along with being from a party of pie-in-the-sky hyperbolic ideologues. 
The more important question is who cares about the GOP? Or the Democrats? We should support people and ideas, not political parties that arbitrarily choose the nominee.
Train by day,
This must be live streamed. 
Cuff him boys 
On the other hand, everybody should preface all of their opinions with "based on what I know". Unless we want a candidate who won't change their mind in the face of new evidence.
Bernie did this a lot too and I respected him greatly for it. If there's one thing I look for in a person, let alone a candidate, is the ability to admit when you were wrong. 
The only interview they are safe doing!
I'd ask...If your movie got pulled?...why are they still running promos for it every 15 minutes?
Related IAmA request: Kim Jong Un.
Are you guys still alive
This will be the best selling straight to DVD film ever
Isn't this where Anonymous saves the day and counter attacks the hackers?
Do you think that The Interview should be instead released as a PPV showing so that people can watch it in the safety of their own homes?
If North Korea is the actual perpetrators behind these attacks, why give into their demands? They've threatened to bring force before but failed to follow through every single time. What makes this threat any different? 
For the North Koreans to be able to pull off any kind of a terrorist act next week on the proposed lunch date they would have to have personnel on the ground and ready right now. If this is the case don't you think they will redirect them to some other target in the US?Don't you think it's amazing that a country that can't even launch a missile in the ocean next to them now suddenly has the capability to put a commando squad on US soil?
What's next on the plate?  Maybe a film about Putin?
They ought to simply leak the film to the internet and "release" it that way.No sense letting it go to waste.
Not a question but an apology: I'm sorry I'll have to inevitably watch a pirated version of your movie. I would have loved to see it in a theater and help you earn the money you deserve 
Even Kim Jong Il had a sense of humor, did he threaten to blow up theatres over Team America? NO! Seriously, I bet he even owned a copy of the film (and possibly had an edited ending) BUT STILL! Kimmy needs to grow up and Sony needs to let their balls drop.Do you think this film is more controversial than Team America?
What Sony should do is release the movie for free to the world and claim that other hackers released it! I'd pay money
Seth, still think Sony is "brave?"
Guys what if this is another publicity stunt. Think about it- a movie causing so much ruckus that it has to be pulled and then it ends up coming back out? You know how many people would have to see that!
You guys worried for your safety. Must be disappointing and i am sorry for that. was going to watch it. looked funny.
They should release it and just call the guy and the country different names. Now everyone knows who it really is about. 
But seriously -- If the film was hacked because it made fun of Kim Jong-Un, the next best step is to unleash massive meme/photoshop wars and disseminate absurd amounts of satirical pictures through the internet.Hackers can attack a company, but not an army of individuals. Crowdforce unite.
Is anybody else Pissed off at how easy Sony and the theatre chains caved to terrorist threats? 
Will you release it as an extra in the next movie you guys make and sell? I really wanted to see this. = /
I don't get how they got pissed at this movie but they weren't pissed about Team America
Just go listen to the howard stern interview from Monday 12/15. It's Prob one of the last interviews seth rogan did for this movie
They are laying low, not going to happen.  Sony is throwing their movie under the bus.That most likely means there will be lawsuits over this movie since people will still want to get paid.  No one is going to be talking publicly about this movie.
How can I support you guys and your movie?  It pisses me off that the threats got the movie pulled.  Comedy is a part of democracy and free speech.  Play this movie everywhere for everyone. 
They should just release the movie as VOD.  North Korea can't possibly attack every single household, can it? 
I'm a lil curious if anyone besides me thinks this could be a giant publicity stunt in order to hype the fuck out of this movie and boost numbers?I wanted to see it before this whole thing went down, but now I'm slightly hesitant. My suggestion is just too put it out straight to download. I'll buy it. I know that.
I think some "Hackers" (Cough Cough Sony) should release the movie online for free as a big fuck you. They complied with their demands. There are no theaters showing the movie. It just so happens that someone else hacked into their website and stole the fully completed movie. 
If you guys were in a jazz band what instruments would you play?
If I were to guess it's a contractual obligation.Sony paid a network to run a certain number of commercials, and the Network still wishes to receive money but they don't want to keep the ad spread out over the next few weeks.Just my best guess
Because there is no such thing as bad publicity.
Because this is the greatest promotional stunt *ever!*
What if it bombs?
Not enough servers in the world for that AMA
I honestly think that he's just mad because they didnt ask him to play himself in the movie 
With Dennis Rodman!
Without a gout, that would be cheesy. 
You have been banned from /r/Pyongyang. 
james is kil
Their moms said they're not allowed to use the computer anymore after that whole 'fappening' thing.
Then they'll threaten the cable compa... ...hey, wait, maybe that's not such a bad idea. 
But then the North Koreans would just blow up ALL OUR HOMES!
Agreed.  I find this very confusing.  Hasnt NK threatened nuclear war like every other month to SK and friends?
Sony had nowhere to show it. All the major theater companies don't want to risk people's lives or their reputation by showing the movie, so they refused to show it
>lunch date   mhmmmm i'm hungry
This is the start of a new genre of filmmaking: suicidal-modernism
That will happen, just wait for it. 
Will there even be a pirate version?
True Fact: they already were paid. 
Team America was lampooning American arrogance as well, and Kim Jon Il was a huge film buff and would have understood that. Hell, the major thing they mocked about him was the Korean dialect. The Interview is supposed to be pretty damning of the North Korean regime according to an NPR story I was listening to earlier. 
It's not him they're worried for - it's the anonymous currently unattributed hacktivist group making consistent threats to not only Sony, but anyone who was going to show the film.
He did ban it in his country, probably would've done worse if he had the power
No major movie theater is willing to show it, Sony has no outlet. Blame AMC and Regal.
Seeing as they're now too scared to promote the movie; probably not.
I mean, worst case scenario, they release the movie and are "brave" and a theater gets bombed.Who gets blamed: Sony? Terrorists?If people blame Sony, that would be silly, but maybe they think people are stupid and would do just that...
That CGI is better than almost everything in the new Hobbit.
It's like Hostess going under only to make "The Sweetest Comeback in the History of Ever!" except... "The Movie You Could Have DIED Seeing Is Now Back From The Dead!"
Or worse, what if this is a way for Hollywood and the CIA to push for stronger internet surveillance laws in order to "prevent" such hacking in the future, but in reality was deliberately caused by themselves. It's actually quite brilliant. Like sacrificing a rook for a queen.
Sony teams up with thepiratebay??
Don't worry...you'll still be able to watch this right after they've finished soaking up every last drop of pure unadulterated free publicity that this whole stunt has to offer.
That would be hilarious if they did a shitty dub, in just one scene maybe, to make fun of all this and instead of his real name they dub Kim Bong Uh and North Candyland. I could imagine Seth dubbing it in a high pitched voice. If they did it once it would be funny, otherwise it would get old.
gee willickers, $5 for bringing in some of the most famous actors in the world to do an AMA
Of course! We'll just defeat North Korea with memes! If only we'd though of it sooner!
how easy?i've seen estimates that the damage might be up to $100 million.Then theater chains started getting cyber and physical attacks and backed out.They could have allowed some theaters to run it, but it would have a horrible opening weekend, and then there's the danger of those theater chains being attacked too.Why would AMC or Regal risk this kind of crippling cyber attack over a movie?
I agree with this comment. They most likely pay for a block of time. 
Well, that hasn't worked quite well for North Korea.
Just ask Bill Cosby.
If it turns out to be a promotional stunt, I see a class action lawsuit. I think its real.  Sony got fucked up last few weeks. Like those are real peoples lives leaked onto the internet. I don't see why they would go forward with an ad campaign with that. No one would forgive them or take them seriously ever again.
In that case, I think The Interview with him would be even more important.
Ask DJ Khaled for more servers then
If that happened, would he speak Korean or English? To go even further can Kim speak anything other than Korean.
You know, a lot of people keep saying that he isn't really in charge and might just be a puppet for the people who are really pulling the strings. But when I look at his haircut, I have no choice but to conclude that he must be the supreme leader there if not one single person is willing to tell him that his haircut is really fucking bad.
I thought I was weird for doing the crossbars on my lowercase "t"s before the downstroke, but you win because it looks like you do the little hook on lowercase "r"s first. O_o
that's a tad racist tbh
You are now banned from /r/pingpong
Rip in peace
Not my Google Fiber!
BRING IT ON!
Do you have a source on Kim Jong Ill  being big into movies? That's kind of fascinating and I'd be interested in reading some more. 
Maybe it's that hacker, 4chan. 
The movie theater I work at sent the movie back and is refusing to show it because of the bombing threats. They said any theater that shows it will get bombed. Do I believe that will happen? No. Do I believe there's a chance one or two bombings would happen? It's possible.People are getting pissed off, but this is an actual possible risk. Slim, but possible. And I'd rather not be blown up because someone wants to have a chuckle
Banned it? Do they have movies at all in North Korea? 
Completely agree.  Front line poontang are the theater chains.
Sony allowed them to break their contract. So you can still blame Sony.
It's hard to release a movie when all the theaters won't show it and Video on Demand services won't carry it.  Remember that in the US, theaters are legally responsible for the safety of everyone inside even without a well advertised threat in advance.
Well, that was real and just good marketing tied into it. 
Or even worse, what if it is a way for Broadband companies to get Hollywood and CIA to push stronger surveillance laws so that they can push for controlling internet lanes and say they can stop the lane for hackers even though that doesn't exist but old people believe anything Republicans say.
If it only costs $5 to contact famous/important people through reddit users, could one of you tell Tony Abbott to go fuck himself for me?I'll pledge five bucks or reddit gold for that cause.
Why is there cheese behind him?
Not to mention this just happened today and programming is usually set a few days ahead of time. 
Oh I think this is real as well. I'm assuming Sony can't pull all of the ads from every channel, movie theater, or website that quickly, so that's why they're still up. 
Sony company don't have the balls for that kind of stunt anyway. 
DJ Khaled pls let us use most powerful servers pls
WE THE BESTGo buy your mom a house.
You're the best.
Haha yeah, somehow I've managed to do that. and when I do an "er", the tail of the "e" becomes the hook on the "r", as shown. I've got a few handwriting quirks.
You are now a moderator of /r/tabletennis 
You know.  I am completely against stealing content.  I will DL bit torrent and get this movie because I have no problem stealing stolen, canceled content.  
Greater good man, the greater good! 
The encoding was written in Korean, but the attack was sent from a hotel in Bangkok. Also, the GOP group has only just started asking for the removal of The Interview, in leaked emails they asked for ransom money and "equality" at Sony Pictures. It seems more like a rouse than an actual state-sponsored attack. 
they didn't catch that guy yet?
Well, it looks like the terrorists have won. 
Thinking about it, im pretty sure some dumbass would make a shit joke and pop off a firework during a screening.
They do actually, it has a very Soviet bloc, post-revolution China feel last time I saw a piece on NK cinema. A lot of "Young girl deals with doubts about her nation before overcoming her disloyal thoughts and becoming a glorious servant of the Great Leader and the Korean people!"
Il loved movies, he actually famously kidnapped a South Korean film director and his actress wife in order to make them make movies for him.
It would be absurd if Sony tried to hold theaters to their contract when there was a specific that against those theaters.  You could never win that court case.  It was a nonenforceable contract at this point. Sony made every reasonable attempt to keep this movie alive
They even censored the *entire* speech about not caving in to terrorist threats and living in fear.
Not from third party violence they're not.
OR EVEN WORSE, what if this whole thing was orchestrated by Hitler in his immortal state inside a lab somewhere in South America so he could finally break Sony's defense and become the cyber Hitler he was always meant to be.
Are you questioning the Glorious Leader?
he almost died from cheese addiction. 100% true
Worked in ad sales, can confirm. Everything is plotted out quarterly and networks are anywhere between live and 4 to 5 days out. If a plane crashes and gets decent news coverage you'll be spending your evening getting as many of that airline's commercials off the air as possible. 
WE DA BESS
I did not picture DJ Khaled looking like that. I thought he'd be.......skinnier, I guess.
I'm confused. Is he a DJ or an IT guy? Why would the CEO of iTunes need his help to add servers?
Say my name. 
Your username is a lie!
Even I'm tired of people telling you your username is a lieyou can post anywhere you want friend 
Nope, I'm still around. 
Did they ever end up making any movies for him? 
Where did you get your law degree?
There was only a specific threat against one of the theaters. There was a very nonspecific threat against the rest.
yea, that was the worst part. That's like censoring the black bar censoring exposed breasts/genitals.
Yes, from third party violence.  Remember the Aurora shooting at the premiere of *The Dark Knight Rises*?  The victim's families sued the theater for not anticipating the shooting and increasing security.  The theater tried to get it thrown out as they cannot predict crime.  The judge ruled the suit could continue because the theater was aware that violent things happen sometimes.So if they can have a case brought against them for that, imagine what a theater that had massively publicized advanced warning would get.
I don't think it can get worse than that.
Um.. Uh... No?
That was his father.
You've never heard a song that starts out as "D! J! KHALED! WE THE BEST!"?
HE DA BEST!
You've never seen Fresh Prince of BelAir? He is the one that plays Uncle Phil. 
He Smot! He loyul!
Rick Ross is actually losing weight.
All I can say is when he steps up in the building, everybody's hands go Up and they stay there and they say yeah.
Let the music take you.
...we're not on /r/gonewild? Then why am I fapping?
Omg the government is going to get your email from Reddit admins and then they'll know where you live.
The reddit academy of how to make speculation sound like concrete evidence
If I remember correctly...Despite censoring the episode hardcore, in the following season of South Park they show Mohammad in ***every single episode*** of the following season (in the opening sequence).
Honestly that judge sounds crazy. I hope an appeal was filed.
You have been unbanned from /r/pyongyang
Ron Jung Un?
WEEEEEE NIGGUH
ALL I DO IS WIN WIN WIN NO MATTER WHAT!
ANOTHA ONE! 
Thanks to pears and shit 
You smart... You loyal....
QUICK! I HAVE HIS I.P ADDRESS! I think it was...192.168.1.1. Get 'im boys! 
This was ruled on a motion to have the case thrown out, not on the case itself.  The theater lost that motion, but if memory serves ultimately won the case.
I'm... I'm confused. Is that a satire? I've seen the sub before, I've just never asked. 
Wung Un.  
hold up baby, SAY MY NAME
Oh that guy. Cool.
I fired my drone missile on that IP. It should be there any minute.
The news itself is not, the comments are one big circlejerk.Praise to our Supreme Leader!
It looks like they're just posting links to state-controlled NK Press. So it's kind of satire, but not really?
Bang Ding Ow
There's a Comedy Central exec somewhere right now, realizing they pulled this off without anybody higher-up knowing.I love South Park :D
Have you watched any movies about the Holocaust or would that be difficult?
I am a pre service history and English teacher. What is something you'd want all teachers to talk about when teaching their students about the Holocaust? 
What do you enjoy now that most of us take for granted?
what was the ride to the camp like, were you aware of what awaited you, and if not when did you realize ?
Thank you for doing this. In your opinion, how accurate was the movie *Schindler's List*?
What was the transition back to civilian life like, after spending three years in concentration camps?
What kinds of foods were snuck in for special secret meals? If ever? 
what stand out experience do you remember whilst you were in the camp?
Hello Mr Flescher, Firstly thankyou so much for doing this AMA :)Just a question regarding post liberation from the camps,How did you feel returning home afterwards? what was the general attitude surrounding jewish survivors?
What was the first thing you did once you were liberated?
Were you consumed by hate towards those who did it to you?  Have you ever managed to forgive them?
Thank you for this AMA. My grandparents are both survivors. Grandfather was from Warsaw and liberated at Auschwitz. Grandmother was luckily hid by a German family in a sub-basement along with her parents and sister. She suffered many gunshot wounds while running. My grandfather sadly past away 12 years ago but I was always very proud of what he made of himself knowing where he came from. That said here is my question for you, from my 86 year old grandmother: "Is he single?" 
Hi Mr. Flescher, Thanks for doing this AMA, it will be interesting. I know multiple people who survived the holocaust. The founding rabbi of my synagogue survived by switching lines from the one going to the showers to the work line. So my question is, how did you make it through such horror?
You mentioned you were 70 lbs when you were liberated. I'm a dietitian and have an interest in those initial weeks when you began to eat more. Was there any process for refeeding people that you are aware of? What did your diet consist of after you were liberated? How long until you reached a normal, functioning weight? Thanks so much!
Did average people anywhere realize at any point exactly what Hitler was doing when he had Jews and other outlying members of society taken from the populace? Was there a clear idea to people? 
Did you have any residual mental health problems after you were liberated? Such as PTSD  anxiety or depression .
Do you ever feel pressured to act in a certain way or live up to certain expectations, given your experiences? When I think of other survivors like Elie Wiesel, it seems that there is great reverence towards him and that people might expect survivors to be wise and always act kindly. Especially volunteering at the museum you do or giving speeches, I wonder if you ever feel as though you are living in a fish bowl and must act in a certain way. 
Hi Mr. Flescher, my grandparent were killed in the holocaust, luckily they sent my Dad to Palestine, later Israel.My question: Were all the guards terrible or did any of the guards show any humanity or compassion?
Good morning, Mr. Flescher, and thank you to you (and your grandchild) for doing this! I'm sure it must be painful to revisit. My question is regarding the period leading up to the true horrors of your capture and detainment. (Such a bland word for such horrific conditions!) I realize you were very young at the time, but does anything stand out in your mind as a warning that something truly awful was happening? What indications did people have, or should they have had -- both Jew and Gentile -- that this was more than just setting up ghettos and segregating populations? 
Have you ever considered writing a book? It seems ludicrous, but there are still deniers out there who claim the holocaust never happened and every documented account helps. 
Hello Mr. Flescher, thank you so much for sharing your experiences here on Reddit today. Was there ever a point in the camps where you felt like you couln't go on, and if so, what thought or hope kept you going? Have you ever returned to any of the camps years later to see how the Holocaust is represented to travelers in Europe, or is the thought of doing so utterly abhorrent to you?
Mr. Flescher,If a guard had asked you for forgiveness, what would have been your response?
Might be a stupid question but I'm going for it. Did you believe in  a god before? And do you believe in one now?
Hello Mr. Flescher, I am from Germany, where denying the Holocaust is a crime and can get you a prison sentence. What is your opinion on this law? 
Have you ever been standing in a store or walking past a person and seen their tattooed numbers on their arm?  If so, did you approach them and talk or show yours?Also, belated happy birthday, Pisces. You share the day with Albert Einstein. May you continue to enjoy all the best health, wealth, and happiness-thank you for sharing your lifestory with the world (hugs)
As a grandchild of 3 holocaust survivors, I was wondering if you still kept the faith? I am not judging in anyway, just genuinely interested. 
Damn, you look amazing for 92. Have any aging secrets? I hope to look as good as you at your age.
Hello Mr. Flescher, Thank you do much for doing this AMA. My question: Is there anything you regret doing while you were in the concentration/labor camps? Anything you would take back of you could?You are an inspiration and living proof of the resilience of humans. I hope life has treated you well since you were liberated. 
What was it like immediately following your release? I've heard stories that some prisoners were made to stay in the camps for a time as the allies did not know where to place them (albeit under better conditions). Any of that true? How much say did you have as to where you went once released and how long did it take you to get back into any sort of normal living situation. Thanks for the AMA!
Hi Mr Fleshcer! Thank you for doing this AMA, and so happy that you've been able to live your life to the fullest. My question is: Did you ever create a plan to attempt an escape from the camp, or did you ever witness a successful/failed escape plan? If so, what are the details? Thank you!
I'm an American Jew and I wanted to thank you for sharing your story. Both of my grandfathers fought for the United States in the war. My question is, that as unfortunately more and more survivors and veterans are passing away, what do you feel is the most important thing that we carry on for future generations? How can we take one of the darkest parts of human history and learn something from it?
Anne Frank would have been 87 this year, have you read her diary? If so, how did it affect you personally? 
Sir, can you describe your first thoughts when you realized you were finally free and had survived? 
How did your family in the US (your brother) react after finding out what happened to you?
Mr. Fletcher- We're you captured-sorry for lack of a better term-in Germany or another country? I've always wondered when Jewish people and other groups that were interned started to become aware of Hitler and the Nazi's horrific agenda, especially in Germany. Wishing you happiness your remaining days. Thank you and God Bless.
Thanks for sharing your story, Mr. Flescher. I've grown up attending many Holocaust commemorations, and the refrain has often been simply to 'remember.' What would you want the next generation to learn about the Holocaust besides 'remembering' it?
What was an average meal like in these camps?
I recently went to Vietnam with my dad who had fought in the war, and I was wondering. Have you been, or would you ever consider going to modern day Germany? 
Do you remember any groups wearing the pink triangle?  If so, how were they treated compared to the other prisoners?
We all know these were slaughter houses, but how does a person (and your not the only one) go on to survive several of these slaughter houses. Some people survived several years in camps that were killing all day everyday, how? Also why did they bother moving people that seems alot of work. Thanks! 
My late grandfather was in Buchenwald. If I post a photo and a name, do you think you would be able to remember if you saw him? I know the chances are small. There was one survivor who knew of my grandfather when I mentioned his name, but he died before I could interview him a lot. 
What was it like living in Vienna before the war? How did you see the non-Jewish Austrians who were not taken to camps but knew about the persecution of Jewish people? Thank you very much for sharing your experiences - I know my great-grandfather came from Germany around 1900 and his family is now probably lost because of the war. Thanks for telling us what things were like back then.
How were you treated in the camps? Is everything we hear about yhe holocaust true, or is some exaggerated? At what time were you placed into the camps, and when did you get out? What was daily life like? How do you feel when people today compare things to the holocaust?
Are you by any chance related to fellow survivor Miriam Flescher, who did a talk at my school a few weeks ago? She lived with her family in Amsterdam before the war, and was at Belsen in 1943; she made it to the UK after she was exchanged for a German prisoner of war.
Hey Mr. Flescher, I'm a high school senior that is preparing to go to college next year. Naturally this stresses my mother out a bit, and has led her to push a lot of "teachings" on me before I'm on my own.  One topic that she pushes quite regularly is how she thinks that I should only date Jewish women so that when I fall in love with one and eventually have kids with her those kids are Jewish. When I asked her why my kids has to be Jewish she said that it is my responsibility to replace the numbers of those lost during the holocaust. What are your thoughts on a statement like that?
Hello Mr. Flescher,Do you have hope that nothing as atrocious as the holocaust will ever take place again, or do you think it's still possible for something similar to happen in the future?
Mr. Flescher, thank you for doing this AMA. I actually have two questions. 1) As a black jewish person, I've been told that there were hundreds of thousands of blacks killed in the holocaust. Did you come across any yourself? If so, did their treatment differ from yours?2) I once made the mistake of asking my Hebrew school teacher what the numbers on her arm meant. Seeing her cry was one of the most devastating moments of my life. How do you respond when a child asks what your tattooed numbers mean?
Hi Henry, I've wanted to ask someone in your situation this question for a while. What would be your thoughts if one of your grandchildren were to tattoo your number on them in the future? Would you be insulted? Do you find that disrespectful? I apologise if this has already been asked.
I have two young kids. How do you recommend I educate my children about the Holocaust?
Thank you so much for doing this AMA, it is so important to teach people about the Holocaust, especially those who aren't as exposed to it. When I was in Poland I learned of Jews who returned to their pre-WWII homes after the Holoacaust and were later murdered in pogroms. I've heard of other cases of post-Holocaust anti-Semitism directed at other survivors who moved to the US, UK, or then Palestine.Did you experience any post-Holocaust anti-Semitism? How were you treated by people who didn't go through the horrors that you went through after you were liberated?
If you could tell holocaust deniers one thing, what would it be?
Hi Mr. Fletcher! I am very happy to see such a unique and interesting AMA today. It must have been terrible to go through everything you've been in.Here's my question: did you receive any kindness from any Nazi soldiers? I heard many times there were people that joined the Nazis just to survive, but decided to help people in small ways to ease their pain a little.
I have watched most of them. I don't find it difficult to watch because I went through it. I've seen it all. I still remember a friend of mine who was hanged because he was using a telephone wire as a belt to hold up his pants. They hung him and he fell back down. They put him back up and hung him again.
They need to tell story as it is. You cannot shy away from history and its brutality. We usually learn about history through books, but this is an event that happened in my lifetime, I witnessed it, and I am still alive today to discuss it. Soon, there will not be any survivors left. I am 92. Once all the survivors are gone, the skeptics will probably come into the picture unfortunately. And that is why we need to educate everyone about what really happened. It didn't happen 500 years ago. It happened in my lifetime.
My grandfather was the pilot of a B17 flying fortress bomber during WW2 and flew 29 missions over the axis.Towards the end of the war he flew into several liberated concentration camps with a cargo plane and rescued several holocaust survivors. He said it was the most beautiful experience of the war to see the look of absolute gratitude and thanks upon the faces of the brave souls he rescued.  I am going to get him to do an AMA as soon as I  see him next. God bless you and yours, Mr. Flescher.
Life is beautiful. I love seeing my family. 
I didn't know it. I didn't understand. I was on another death march at the time from Altenburg to Waldenburg. I managed to slip away and hide in a chicken coop along the way and at that time the American convoy was advancing. I saw an American tank and an American soldier and thought he was going to kill me because I didn't know the uniform. I still left the coop and went up to them, because at that time I could barely stand up and weighed about 70 pounds. I was liberated on April 11. I didn't know that day would come. I was very sick when I was liberated and could barely eat, talk, or walk.
You mean... after the war was won?
I was first sent to Drancy, a transit camp. I was then transported in a cattle car packed with people with no food or water and one bucket in the middle to use as a toilet. I was ~~16~~ 18 at the time.  The smell was unfathomable. After six days in the train the train came to stop. The guards started to count men. They selected 300 men. I was number 298. We were taken off the train. The train then continued on its way to Auschwitz and everyone was killed. I will never forget the number 298.
I thought it was as close as you can come. It was very well done.
I wanted to travel and see the world. I went forwards, not backwards. It was a very difficult transition back into real life. I had 3/4 of my stomach taken out from an infection I got while at the camps. This was painful.
I used to go out at night risking my life to steal some raw potatoes from the kitchen at Peiskretscham and at Blechhammer. I took chances. At Blechhammer some inmates caught a dog, a German Shepard, and cooked it. It was a feast. Tasted like rabbit. That was the only time I've eaten dog, and it was the best meal I had in a long time. These days I prefer steak.
I had dysentery in Gross Rosen and I couldn't go to the bathroom for three days. This was when I almost gave up. 
Going back to normal life was difficult. People didn't want to talk about the war and didn't see anything special about surviving the camps. People didn't want to discuss it.
I asked the american soldier if he knew my brother. My brother had gone to US a few years before and enlisted in the army.
I cannot forgive. But I was never consumed by hate. Hate doesn't improve anything. 
I got divorced after 49 and a half years of marriage. We still talk to each other once in a while. I now have a girlfriend, and I'm very happy. My ex-wife got remarried shortly after the divorce to a family friend. I never stayed single for too long! My ex-wife was also hidden during the Holocaust with a christian family.
Everyday you think of living. We are born to die, but I appreciate life. We live day by day, and I always say: yesterday is history, today's reality, and tomorrow's a dream. 
Some people ate too much and got very sick from that. I ate slowly and slowly recovered. It took maybe four to five months to get back to a normalish weight.
Most people had no idea. Anyone who knew what was going on was already at the gas chamber or in the camps.
When the allied forces came in, they forced civilians of local towns to see what they had allowed to happen. 
When I visited the Mittlebau Dora concentration camp they told us that civilians in the town did know what was going on. You could see into the camp from the town. When the allies liberated the camp they were forced to bury the dead and basically look at what they allowed to happen. 
I never had anxiety or depression. I'm lucky I guess. I'm 92 and my health is very good. I go dancing, I travel, and I love life. I'm busy, I'm active, and love sharing my story to schools in Miami and my time at the Holocaust memorial in miami.
I love sharing my story, but don't even know what reddit is. My grandson has always wanted me to share my story to as many people as possible so he suggested this. 
The soldiers were doing their job, and I cannot recall any compassion from any soldier. 
It stays with you, but hate doesn't help you in any way. The memories will always stay with me. My brother moved to the US right before things got ugly in Europe, so I wanted to move where he was. He was in Providence, RI. Itzik's. It's definitely my favorite.
No. Every survivor has his or her own story. I was interviewed by Spielberg and have that on tape. I think every survivor was interviewed by him to document the living survivors.
I know there's a research database in the holocaust museum in washington. there's probably some organizations that could help you but i'm not truly sure. good luck!
There was many times I almost lost hope. It was difficult to get the stamina to keep going. I just hoped I would survive and lived day by day. I returned to Drancy where I was deported from. My name is on a wall in Paris with 76,000 names of people who got deported from there. I don't think many survived.
Never forgive, never forget.
I asked my grandparents this as well. Both were raised religious before the war, my grandfather died an atheist. My grandmother kept her faith. Both lost most of their families when they were kids.
Yes. Definitely.
I cannot take back anything, and I cannot regret anything. We were treated worse than animals. My name was 177153.
I honestly didn't comprehend it when I was liberated. I was very sick at the time. I stayed in a house for two weeks and then i went back to Belgium. Somebody gave me clothes to wear and that's all i had.
I never planned an escape. There were electric fences and you were wearing uniforms. I never witnessed any possible escapes.
To teach everyone what the Holocaust was and to make sure that history doesn't repeat itself. I didn't personally learn anything from the Holocaust. We have one life to live and you have to enjoy it. There is no room for hate in this world. 
I never saw signs of regret. I cannot recall ever seeing or knowing any "normal" soldiers. 
As people started to learn about the horrors of the holocaust this was a big question and a lot of research was done to figure out why people did it.  The conclusion of which was basically that if someone authoritative says something is the right thing to do, almost everyone will do it.  If you are interested read about the Milgram experiment in witch regular people did something that they thought would kill an innocent person because a guy in a lab coat said to.
That dictatorships are not good. They fulfill the dream of one person. And unfortunately they are still in existence today.
What is the pink triangle?
If you have a desire to live, you will do what it takes to exist for the next day. 
Thank you for your time Sir, it's an honor to be able to ask you questions. 
hundreds of thousands of blacks? I studied the holocaust in college and that number cannot possible be correct. 
Depends on the age, but you have to explain slowly. It's very difficult to understand.
Not a Holocaust survivor,  but "Fuck you" would be at the top of my list. 
Do you the movies are an accurate description of what really happened?
What is so bad about using a telephone wire as a belt?
Wow. Very well said. Thank you for doing this!!
There's already too many skeptics as it is, so I guess the future is looking pretty bleak.
Now that you mention this, what you think about this movie?
Do you mark or celebrate your liberation day in any way?
Well,  I'm a little bit early,  but Happy Rebirthday! 
How old were you, if you don't mind me butting in to the other person's question?
Lol I meant won
Why did they take 300 off? Why not just kill everyone? Also, so sorry for what you've had to go through in your life, but glad you're here with us through it all. 
It's been on my list for a while, but you just made me buy it. Thank you. 
Where was the first place you traveled to after your release?
Did the Nazis not let you got to the bathroom or was it because you couldn't go? 
What was his response?
I forgot to mention something important i think pertains to my Grandmas story. A few years ago she returned to thank the descendants of the family that rescued her. She didn't get the heartwarming welcoming she thought she would. Instead the remaining family members hated her for putting their family at such an extreme risk. They wouldn't even meet with her. It depressed her that such a mentality could be taken, as opposed to them being proud of their families courage and heroism. It's sad that hate can be born from such a loving action. 
92 and he has a fucking girlfriend. This guy. 
Why'd you get divorced after almost fifty years?
>yesterday is history, today's reality, and tomorrow's a dream./r/getmotivated would drop a picture of a sunset to this 
> Everyday you think of living. We are born to die, but I appreciate life. We live day by day, and I always say: yesterday is history, today's reality, and tomorrow's a dream. Yep, I'm sharing this :) Good stuffCalm down people. I am lifting a well known quote quoted by a Surviving Holocaust Member, it is already posted to my Social media accounts giving full credit to Mr. Flescher. 
I don't know what I expected but now that I have some insight, the Holocaust sounds way darker.
Eisenhower knew that people would try to deny it, so he made a point of securing as much evidence as possible (photo, video, tours)
Your grandson is a wise man.
Thank you for your reply Mr. Flescher. Your reason for keeping the tattoo and remembering the past, is the same reason I heard from one of the survivors I met. Once again thank you for doing this AMA. I wish the best for you and your family.  
I didn't even know Spielberg interviewed survivors. Thank you so much for sharing with us today, I have a lot to learn. 
Do you think its important that people keep visiting places like Auschwitz or that it's disrespectful? Have you visited Auschwitz since they started tours at the memorials?
I don't know why this comes to me as a shock. Did not imagine all their soldiers being 100% psycho.
My understanding is that when you've got such a large system that's so well entrenched and everyone just goes along with it, it's hard to question it. The soldiers involved probably never thought to question it because they never saw any opposition to it - it never occurred to them that what they were doing might be wrong.
These death marches was exactly how my great-grandfather died. Instead of being shot he fell and was trampled. My family only found out how he died because his friend survived. The camp he was running to was liberated only three days later. 
> we didn't know where we were going, didn't have anything to eat, and marched in the freezing cold for two weeks. Anyone who fell was immediately shot and killed.I cannot even imagine how terrifying that must have been.
Did you ever see your sister again?
>I was never consumed by hate. Hate doesn't improve anything.
One thing I've seen depicted inaccurately in a few times in films or TV recreations is the gas in the chambers venting out as a vapour or even coming out of the fake showerheads. In reality Zyklon B pellets were dropped in from small holes in the roof and would release hydrogen cyanide gas after mixing with the heat and moisture of the prisoners.
My guess is this was a symbol of self-respect and they didn't want him to have any dignity
Did you have any students that once they realized this in fact really happened they couldn't handle it? I remember in high school there was a girl who just in denial and when she finally realized it she burst out in tears. It was surreal almost. Also, sorry phone formatting. 
> Some of these kids didn't know what the Holocaust was and genuinely thought it was just something from the novel we were studying. I had to spend a 60 minute lesson just trying to help them sort the fact from the fiction.Was it *Night* by Elie Wiesel, by chance? I taught my 10th grade English class from the same book, and I ended up sidetracking my lesson by two class periods to cover what they hadn't heard in their history classes, as well as to address concerns/skepticism.
Amazing how much we can still learn about the Holocaust decades after it happened. These AMA are nothing like the textbooks.
I'm really curious. On what grounds are people skeptical? Like what's their argument for why/how it was fabricated? I honestly can't get my head arround it.
i might be blind or maybe a comment didnt load, what movie are you talking about?
I have two birthdays. March 14th, and April 11th. 
thank you!
He said earlier that he was taken away at 16 and was in the camps for about 3 years. So sounds like he was 19 when the camps were liberated 
I believe he said he was 16 when first captured, and it took 3 years to get liberated, so probably 19.
Oh I think it's a guarantee some died. I'm sitting here wondering how ANYONE could survive 6 days without water though??
Even in the death camps, not everyone was immediately killed. The strongest men would be recruited for work details known as "Sonderkommando" and performed jobs like corpse disposal, operating the crematoria, sorting and categorizing looted possessions, pulverizing any bones that were recognizable after cremation, plus basic camp duties that the guards didn't want to do. In exchange for this they lived in better conditions and were fed more, but the Sonderkommandos themselves were periodically killed and replaced. 
Set aside an evening to watch it on your own or with a close friend/partner, and just sit there in silence. The first time I watched Schindler's List made far more of an impression on me than I was expecting.
I went back to Brussels, and that's where I met my wife.
Do not think that you carry the sins of your fathers.
After reading a bit, it looks like he was alive and in Providence, RI.
I'm just guessing here but he probably didn't answer or said no. If someone I didn't know at all came up to me and asked if I knew their brother I'd say no. At least, that's the context I'm getting here.
"Yesterday is history; tomorrow's a mystery. Today's a gift - that's why they call it the present."
Yet still we have fuckers denying it
thank you. i take after my grandfather :-)
It also helps to prove the holocaust was real and as bad as historians and survivors say it was. This helps to fight against those who deny it or try to diminish the level of tragedy that it was. 
Shout out to those working at the USHMM. They do amazing work there.
Fun fact! "Yad vashem" translates to "remember them" in Farsi.Source: I'm Iranian :)
They didn't put the regular soldiers to work in the concentration camps, only the zealots.
Because it isn't true.  Brainwashed =/= psychopathic.  The people who carried out these orders genuinely believed it was for the good of the country.  If you're going to say that EVERY staffer at a concentration camp was psychopathic you'd be wrong, very wrong.  I don't know why people think that in order to carry out inhumane things, you must have a mental disorder.  The DSM-IV says psychopath occurs in about 3% of males in the US; meanwhile, in Britain about .6%
Ever read the book "night"' by Elie Wiesel? Amazing read, but haunting nonetheless. While Mr. Flescher described his experience as "marching" Ellie describes it as "the marathon of death" Running through the snow, every time someone fell, they were killed.
If she went to Aushwitz with a young child odds are they were both killed right away. 
Wow, I thought the fake showerhead thing was absolute fact. Thank you for the bit of enlightenment. 
I'd guess that it might be seen as smuggling an item that could be used in an escape attempt
They think that all of the survivors are lying. That's literally their only argument, that everyone is lying. 
That's beautiful.
Wow...that's some heavy stuff to read over coffee. Thank you so much for sharing.
Sometimes they would take hoses and spray water onto the cars; people inside could drink what came through the slats. Based on the 6 day figure, they were at least doing this for them.
"The Grey Zone" articulates this part of the camp's use of prisoners for duties. Very gritty, gripping film. 
They didn't have the internet, it was far easier to hide atrocities than it is today. I wouldn't be surprised if many of them did not know about places like Auschwitz. Our generation takes information for granted.
That's absolutely tragic. Most of these men were just fighting for their country. Heck, most weren't even doing so by choice. They saw the Allies as the villains who had crushed their economy and pillaged their resources following the first World War. I can't imagine learning that I had been a cog in such an evil machine. These were likely good men who had been part of something horrifying. Any time these atrocities occur at this scale, we must remember that even the "enemy" is made up of mostly good, moral people who have been led astray. 
More importantly than the other question, do you feel jealous of your grandfather's karma?
The craziest thing about the Holocaust in Germany is that German Jews were well integrated.  There was so much mixing that the Nazis had to figure out (arbitrary) ways to distinguish Jews from non-Jews.    Yet, the Nazis still rounded them up.  Based on pretty arbitrary distinctions.  They rounded up and mass murdered people based on arbitrary distinctions.  People who had been their neighbors, friends, etc.  It's mind-boggling how people can just become brain-washed on a mass scale to just turn on other people.
huh that's cool... in hebrew it means "a place and a name" and is a reference to a  passage in the book of jeremiah which states:  "Even unto them will I give in my house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off"
Wow, I'm not doubting the DSM, but it seems like kind of a jump from .6 to 3.0 (not a HUGE, or ENORMOUS jump mind you, but a solid hop, at least). I wonder what the differences are chalked up to...
I found out later on, but I cannot be 100% sure because I got off the train. But I can probably assure you that I would not be here today if three people were picked before me.
Auschwitz was 3 camps and one was a mining camp used to get minerals to make rubber.
I think that's Abraham Lincoln's pen name. 
Both of my grandmas lived through the war, one of them lived in Warsaw and the war started on her first birthday, her early childhood was devastated by the war. My other grandma lived on a pretty large farm in the country side and she said she knew that a war was happening, she didn't know anything other than the Germans and the Russians were fighting over Poland. Shes told me she only saw soldiers a couple times. 
I mean, let's just cut to the chase here.
Germany was falling apart at the time and they were told that cleansing the country would fix all their problems. They did what was supposed to help them. Its horribly tragic that it was so easy for many to just forget compassion and willingly degrade a group of people simply because they thought it would help.  
It's important to mention this went beyond Germany. In Lithuania, Jewsih people were well integrated, and long-established members of communities. In many respects, what I have read about the treatment in Lithuania is far worse than anything I've read from Germany.
Fewer tea and crumpets to soothe the soul, probably. 
As horrible as it must have been living through that for years, I'm curious to know if you have any good memories from that time? Did you laugh? Smile? Love?
I thought rubber came from a tree
95% of the Jewish community in Lithuania was killed, often with the help of Lithuanians *Hilfswilliger* (volunteers), or even in spontaneous progroms. They still have trouble acknowledging their role in the Holocaust, they only talk about how much they suffered because of the soviets (which they undisputably did, maybe up to 500 000 Lithuanians died because of the stalinist repression).
Wehrmacht were just the general German army. The SS were part of the Nazi party. IIRC Hitler didn't even integrate them into the normal army. 
I find it depressing the "bunch of other people" get even a smaller mention even though numerically they're just as represented in the slaughter as the jews.All of those free thinkers, radicals, intellectuals, artists, people from dozens of countries who's crime was they had black skin and in some ways worst of all, the Roma, that being like the Shoah was called the Porrajmos.Sigh
SS were his personal army, that he controlled. So yea.
Yeah there was basically zero mention of the political prisoners, homosexuals, Roma, etc. The entire thing was really offensive to me. That omission, plus the fact that the entire 4-chapter section was primarily devoted to military events; just a side-note on the Holocaust, and basically zero mention about *why* Hitler and the Nazis were able to rise to such power.
Also, there's a lot of evidence that some of the most zealous of the Nazi's were actually meth addicts (provided by the SS). It makes the actions of the most evil soldiers seem like the monstrous acts of meth addled minds.
Which 4 books did you use and in what order?  Did you have a history of programming?   I'd love to know where to start.
how much time did you spend learning per day?
The only question that actually matters: do you indent with tabs or spaces?
Is selling to Google the dream?
Do you have an example of your code? (not necessarily the code you wrote for these apps.)Mostly I'm curious how far you've managed to get in 18 months. I find that most people who start learning how to program don't actually get very far and level off quickly. They seem to get stuck writing procedural code and never learn software engineering architecture. Though I suspect you may have pushed yourself to actually learning OOP and Design Patterns and Architecture and things like Unit Testing / TDD.
What do you credit as the biggest resource that allowed you to be successful at programming, and how do you rate resources such as Code Academy?
Did you have do anything to protect yourself and your development from the minor hockey team you first intended to use it for? Like claims that it should be exclusively theirs?  
How did you market yourself initially?
How much of your own money did you spend before making money?
This is awesome, did you make a lot of $$$ from it?
What was your educational background before you started programming?
I started coding apps 1.5 years ago, and am doing very well. However, I have reached the point where I'd prefer some more advanced content to follow rather than Big Nerd Ranch - Any materials you could share that are practical, yet significantly more advanced (tutorials)?
What color Lamborghini are you going to buy first?
How old are you? I'm a 30 year old civil engineer and I sometimes feel like my mind is not "plastic" enough to learn something new. 
Hi congrats on the app and more importantly teaching yourself a valuable new skill. Have you received any flack from purist event attendees who don't believe audience members should be encouraged to be waving their phones around all night? 
Did you enjoy working with Clemson? How much work did you do with them?  I am an undergrad there in compsci
As someone who frequently has ideas for apps but has no idea how to get them off the ground is this  more of a hobby or a job for you?
Can you share what languages youve studied to make the apps? Thanks!
Just want to say I saw your app in use an Purdue and Notre dame basketball games at it was pretty awesome. Since I need a question, what caused you to find this programs out initially? Alumni connections or what?
So I'm a 35 year old truck driver and looking to retrain since automation will put me out of a job soon. I only drive now because I like it and my college degree is worthless.Should I even bother with programming? I'm old now and I'd be competing with people who have done this for decades.
Does it offend you when /r/NBA complains about the NBA app? Or is that on the NBA itself?
Dude! This is incredible!!What was the biggest struggle you faced that you never saw coming??
Dude that's brilliant. We have done waves and other things like that, but with a section-entry UI, so the users could tell the program they were in section 101, for example.
Can't you define 3 different default sources for triangulation? Like a speaker ABC that the program expects you to place in place in such way that will triangle the smartphone in the beginning, so that it knows how much after a "data" wave it should reproduced the light. 
For iOS pick up (1) book on learning Swift; (2) Big Nerd Ranch book on making "practice" apps with Swift. For Android pick up (1) book on learning Java; and (2) Big Nerd Ranch book on making "practice" apps with Java.With those four books, you should have a very strong foundation for getting out to sites like StackOverflow.com and advancing from there.
About four hours, seven days a week, for six months. Then I spent the next few months with programming as my basically full-time job, so I was pretty immersed from the get-go.
Meanwhile I've been coding 18 years and have worked at a Fortune 500 company as a coder and I can't find a job :(
I've found that most people who say tabs think you mean actually using the space bar instead of the tab key lol. 
My mother birthed me as an investment in the goal of selling to Google.
Thank you. I'm very suspicious of new developers. I'm afraid they're incapable of working in larger collaboration.
Definitely StackOverflow. I haven't used Code Academy but have heard really good things about it. For me it was a few good books and a very large dose of SO.
This is a very tricky subject. Basically the issue was solved by letting the owner of the hockey team in on the software startup.
Strictly emails to marketing guys at college/pro sports teams. Literally, look the guy up, snoop for his email address, and send him a letter asking if he's interested. We finally started getting some traction as fans started sharing our videos, and this has made it more of a they-come-to-us instead of we-spam-them business model.
We didn't invest a single dollar. It was all contributions of time, way way too much free time.
Considering our initial investment was $0, the ROI has been infinite.
Economics degree from Northwestern. I have always been really introverted but had a love of learning, so I finished up high school and moved out at 16, and was probably very lucky that Northwestern chose to let me in at that age.
If I were you, and past that BNR point, I would just start coding projects and start looking to build a reputation or earn some additional income. Maybe look into freelance (some of those freelance mobile developers really rake it in) or try to build a reputation on GitHub. StackOverflow is the only resource material I've really needed following those first four books. There is just so much info on SO, if it goes down the internet is history.
I am 23. If you ever feel like you can't do it, do what I do and head over to r/CrappyDesign. If some of those guys are professional programmers why can't I be?
I'm 32 and have nothing but kitchen staff job experience. Started learning to code about a year and a half ago. Today is my first day at my new job as a software engineer. 
I'm 55 and I own and run a successful company providing distinct services to associations and societies. The majority of the services we provide are distributed through web applications. I've never had an ounce of web programming in a classroom and have self taught myself  how to do it. I learn new stuff almost each and every day. If I didn't, we would have folded years ago... Make that jump for yourself and you will be happy!
Clemson has been the nicest team to work with. After publishing their app, they sent me a signed thank you card and a bobble head. Class act all the way.
I wish I made the NBA official app. I've made some apps for NBA teams, though. Some of this has been one-off apps, like the app we did for the Atlanta Hawks last year, and others have been integrated into the team's official app in SDK format, like we did for the NHL Florida Panthers last season as well.
Having them scan their ticket's barcode may be easier.
This is a great idea. Two other finely timecoded sources of data would do it. No scanning of tickets. No entering of section numbers. Surprisingly precise. See a device called a "pc notes taker" that does this to capture handwriting. 
Which swift book did you use?
How does stackoverflow play into learning?
Someone told me (in relation to programming) "disregard the idea you need to learn everything before you can start doing something"Nobody makes a code with 0 compile errors the first try, make a code and fix it till it works, that's what everybody does.
>analysis paralysisFucking hell. Even as a fairly experienced software developer, this is still very much a thing for me.That, the "fear of missing out", and "framework fatigue" kills me every time I try to pick up a new technology. I hate it with a burning passion.
Isn't it basically impossible to code for iPhone without a mac?
What sort of coding should I be looking to learn if I absolutely cannot do any level of math? I'd like something I can start making extra income on the side. I'm willing to commit to learning, I just don't know what I'll like, what is practical for making money, and what I can feasibly learn with an extremely limited education. 
cool. any tips on staying motivated and getting disciplined?
Unfortunately, it's probably *because* you've been coding so long
You'll note this guy created a job. Have you looked at building something from the ground up?
it better be tabs that just converts to 4 spaces 
What? How is this possible? Do you indent with enter or esc? And the people who say esc actually mean enter? This is driving me insane, how is this possible?!?! What do you mean?!?!
Did you have a background in DSP or math already, or did you learn that as you went too?
A shame, because you MIT-licensed it. They can basically do what they want with your code.&nbsp;That being said, there might be a good chance they'll hire you if they find use in this.
As someone who can hear frequencies in the 16-22kHz range, I hate it. Google had employed this tech a while ago to pair Chromecasts and it was painful.Sorry to say this, but I hope it never catches on.
Problem is when you think you're doing good but you don't know about a dozen security vulnerabilities you haven't designed for.  You don't know what you don't know.That's not to denounce what you've done, but a reason for caution and the importance of getting someone to review your code.
Any suggestions on how to take amateur coding to the next level by being prepared for collaboration
What is SO? Can someone explain?
That is interesting. I'm glad it worked out for you. That's not a bad person to have on your side in the end. I think people should be aware that this can become an issue if they have industry specific developments they come up with and decide they want to strike out on their own. 
>We finally started getting some traction as fans started sharing our videos,That's exactly how I heard about it for Purdue. A buddy sent me a video of it when he was at a game.Have you looked into getting it into an Olympic opening ceremony? That would be huge.
How did you pay the bills while you were learning / coding for 18 months?
How much time average did you spend to develop your programming skills? Daily average, weekly and monthly or whichever is easier to quantify.
Well you had to buy the books...
You started undergrad at 16 years old?
Like you I had ideas and issues which I solved. Any tips on discovering cool libraries to work with? or Apis? Stack is so huge, how do you find out whats "hot"?
Author of the iOS Programming book here. Just wanted to say thank you! Stories like this make all the hard work worthwhile.For others, our 6th edition iOS book was just recently released that is updated for iOS 10, Xcode 8, and Swift 3.0. Our 2nd edition Swift book was also recently released also updated for Xcode 8 and Swift 3.0.
Did you read them in that order or sort of all at once? Is learning obj C your first introduction to code at all or did you have any prior knowledge whatsoever?
Do you recommend the leaning Java/C books first or could you jump into the big nerd ranch ones if you have some limited experience with code?
Pretty sure that last link is wrong. The 3rd edition is on pre-order and hasn't been released yet. 
That's great to hear. I'm glad that you had a good experience with us. What app were you involved with? Go tigers!
Yes, someone actually mentioned that to me last month and it's definitely something we should implement.
At the time when I was picking up iOS programming, there were few good Swift books, so I learned Obj-C instead. It was good in that there was so much more open-source software written in Obj-C than Swift, which helped me through my early stages. A lot of my code is still written in Obj-C, it's actually my favorite language (likely because it was the first I learned), and I'll miss it.
You need a baseline of knowledge so you can know what to search for to figure out the solution to your problem.
Very few books, if any, are so comprehensive that they could cover everything you would need to do, so that's where stackoverflow comes in to play. Odds are someone has probably tried to do something you're trying to do, gotten stuck, and then asked a question there.
I've just started learning python within the last few weeks and found stackoverflow to be hugely hit or miss.Yeah, you can usually find workable code but at least at my level its almost never explained by the poster who is answering the question and is often unhelpful. When I'm working on a script in order to test what I know and to learn some new things, pasting in some code I don't understand to make it work isn't helpful.
Been doing it for 7 years now and "It worked the first time" is still a surprise.
Same, man.  When I'm about to learn something new, I waste way too much time wondering if it's...well, a waste of time.I had some free time a month ago and I was thinking about learning some new stuff, but there's an ocean out there to sail and I couldn't decide where I wanted to go.  Grails? Django? Scala?Couldn't decide, ended up just tinkering with my rasp pi and beefing up on my Spring skills.
As long as you have some inclination towards logic (i.e. your lack of math skills is just due to lack of education) then you should be able to create pretty much any kind of code except advanced scientific simulations. There isn't all that much actual math involved in most software development.On the other hand, if you already at an early age decided that math was impossible and never developed your analytical skills, you might struggle with any sort of coding. It's all about thinking logically and thinking in systems of symbols, and maths is great practice in doing exactly this. 
Maybe web design. However, all forms of programming require Boolean algebra in some form. That being said, Boolean algebra is unlike any form of math you've likely studied; it's logic. If you can pick up the algebra, you can code anything with enough study. 
For me, it's always just been a lot of pressure I put on myself. I want to succeed so that this pressure will finally go away. Me_irl.
Why is this? 
Why would anyone use anything else. It's easier to just press one button, but spaces just work more predictably than tabulations. So it's the best of both worlds.
a couple of my friends use two spaces.I refuse to work on any projects with them.
My background was economics.
They already have first-party code that does this. They use ultrasonic frequencies to pair the Chromecast.OP's idea is not so original.
Who's a good boy?!
Holy crap, does chrome cast really do that? My room mate always uses hers and I've noticed the high pitched sounds
Wait, what? They're electromagnetic waves at the fq, not compression/sound waves right? I might have a fundamental misunderstanding about the technology but I genuinely do not believe you should be able to hear it.  Your ears are not an antenna and chromecast doesn't communicate via a speaker...
Yes, I actually have yet to cooperate with a single other developer so I've ended up (unfortunately) with a different style that might be hard to work with. It's something I'll need to fix in the future, but thanks for the tips!
Just wanted to say that your comment was very informative and provided very detailed constructive criticism. 
Seems like posting the github link to his software and explicitly saying he doen't know if there are problems is a pretty damn good way of doing that to me mate
Learn about good code practices and design patterns :) Always have an open mind and ask for code reviews to other senior programmers. That is going to help a lot in getting better and better
Yup, people should look at their employment contract before doing **any work** on personal projects during work hours. Many companies write in that anything created on company time (or on company property) belongs to the company.
Awesome to come across someone who's heard of my work! Yes, I've thought (dreamed) about doing something with the Olympics but easier said than done. We have recently gotten into some other continents though, such as for Cricket in Australia and we plan to work with some Soccer teams in Europe as well.
Doing econometrics for the hockey team. It was a place where, say I finished my work at 1 PM, I could spent from 1 to 5 PM studying how to code. 
Daily is probably the easiest. For the first six months after I picked up my first programming book, I put in about four hours a day. Then I started actually working on apps. At first these were minor league apps for hockey teams, and they kinda sucked. But it helped me improve to the point where I could pretend to hang with the big boys. Classic tale of fake it till you make it.
You're right. That lowers our ROI from infinity to around 3.50%.
But knowledge is priceless! 
He said he's a programmer not a finance guy! Get outta here with your opportunity costs and whatnot
16 and a half
No prior knowledge whatsoever. Learning Obj-C was my first introduction. 
Money's just fuel units.That is, I can buy fuel for my 47 Lamborghinis with all the money I made.
It had a lot to do with math, but not necessarily in the way you'd think. I did some alternative schooling in high school, which ended up in me teaching myself Algebra II, trig, pre-cal, and calculous all from books I bought off eBay. I think having a history of teaching myself new skills made this round much easier than it would have been otherwise.
Honestly, computer science isn't about doing a lot of math at all.  Unless you're seriously working with developing and researching cryptography algorithms, the computer is doing all the math for you.  A strong understanding of algebra and a smattering of calc is really all 99% of programmers need.Actual day to day software development is far more about logic than it is about math.  It just tends to follow that people with a talent for logic also have a talent for applying it to math.
If you can create point sources of sound, you could simply use phasing between ultrasonic frequencies to control sweeps, with the added advantage that you don't need any detailed knowledge of physical layout.
The audio trick is cool, but they'll only get you so far.  Here's my advice for the long run.  Basically just modernize the stadium flip card.1. Treat each seat as a RGB pixel.2. Have the user put in their seat number.3. Each user pre-download a single pixel video stream for that location.4. Just use the audio trick to start and synchronize the playback.5. ???6. ProfitDone properly and you just turned the stadium into a low resolution video.
Hmm, sounds a lot like python.*^^cuz ^^they're ^^both ^^sneks*
Hi, I also self-taught myself objective-c back in the day (coming from non-programmer background), do yourself a favor and learn Swift. I thought I loved Obj-C as well but after Swift, looking at Obj-C code makes me puke a little.Your idea is spectacular but your execution is even better, best of luck in the future!
I'm glad this is getting upvotes. It is a very important point and it's a problem that I experienced when I began to program. So many answers are available through StackOverflow, but only if you have the vocabulary/understanding enough to know what to ask (or search for) and how to ask (or search).
"I wrote a code and it came up with a bunch of errors. I wonder what's wrong.""I wrote a code that worked the first time. I wonder what's wrong?"
Tape the options onto a D(n) and roll with it?
I know a few of these words.
macOS apps don't need to be made using Xcode. They don't even need to be made in Xcode in order to sell on the App Store.What you say is true for iOS apps though.
Thank you. I probably need to see what sort of studying I can do on my own. I might try going through some Khan Academy math courses. 
Thank you for the info.
Thanks, that's really helpful. I'm sorry for my ignorance, but is this mostly design-based? I ask because I'm not very talented in design. But I would like learning how to optimize, or something in that category. 
You succeeded. Literally not /r/me_irl
Definitely not me_irl
Thats interesting and motivating. I do this to myself but unfortunately apply this pressure to nothing. I have no idea what to apply myself to so i pretty much just end up bumming myself out with the pressure i put on myself. Glad to see you found a way to pressure yourself into a new area of learning! Here's to hoping i can do the same! Best of luck in the future :)
They assume that free mountain dew and pizza won't be enough to compensate him for 18 hours days...
If tabs don't work predictably, you haven't trained your editor very well.
Many (non-PhD) economists I know have a bit of trouble when it comes to Fourier analysis, transforms, DSP. So I'm gonna assume you're just a smart guy who's good at math.
Because this is him advertising his product/service (it's free to use until April of this year, then they charge) and really has nothing to do with giving the source away.I mean what API/Service DOESN'T have demo code for you to get from GitHub.
> OP's idea is not so original.Nothing is, really. Surely you don't think Google invented the Search Engine either.
It does actually (it's google's *nearby* api):"Nearby uses a combination of Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy, Wi-Fi and **near-ultrasonic audio** to communicate a unique-in-time pairing code between devices."
I recommend reading a book called "Clean Code", it helped me a lot. It's impossible to work with people that have different coding practices, and this book introduces you to everything you need to know.
If the comments you're receiving are just formatting and code style comments, then you're doing quite well. 
I also noticed that you use mProximityLevel to determine what color should be selected, maybe you should use the Color class or whatever R.color.blue type is, then you avoid using case 0, 1, 3, 4, 5 at line 225-252 and just set the color directlyHowever even if you have coded for a long time, you still run into bad code you made in the past, and the video looks really crisp.Now to a question, does your program sync with any song?
I seem to recall Notch saying he's also self-taught and has received criticism over the way his code looks because of it. To me the point is, yes, do accept this feedback, but don't let it get you down. You can still become a multi-billionaire coder even with self-taught-looking code.
Just wanted to say that your comment about his comment was very formal and appropriate.
Where can we learn what does and doesn't flow well?Code may make sense to us and we might not know why it wouldn't make sense to others
Serious question: Can't you just lie? Pretend that you created on your own time and/or said you produced it prior to working with said employer?
This was the answer I was looking for to my unasked question: "How smart is this guy to learn code on his own?"After doing econometrics in school, I imagine code wouldn't be that bad.
Four hours, wow. Thanks!
Hollywood Lamborghini's on my bookshelves in the hills
Okay, not knocking your story of success whatsoever. It just sounds to me like you had the intelligence and maturity of an adult in your teens...so while I agree that hard work and dedication helps a lot..your brain is an XBOX 7 while I'm working with a PS2 upstairs. My overall point: you got the gift, kid.
Sorry mate. I can't help you out with this. Maybe OP can.I learnt coding language fundamentals in my school itself. Learnt a few more in college. But to this day, I don't know how to start something from scratch like from ground zero. In my current job, most of the stuff is already somewhat setup so I can just directly code. That's the only reason why I am surviving.That's why I can't help you. You need someone who has actually learnt coding from the basics itself because ideally that's what you need I believe.
Seems like your an autodidact. 
I used derivatives for the first time last week and I've been programming for 10 years
Remind me to do an AMA next time I need to create a product/come up with an idea. The responses in here are brilliant.
Scanning the ticket might be better than trusting 20k people to put in their info correctly.
Cool idea, but I'm not sure it would even work as super low resolution. The relative ppi would be about 9 when accounting for the viewing distance(I'm guessing 150 feet from other side of stadium). The average screen has about 100 on desktops and 400 on phones. I don't think you could discern anything beyond simple text. 
Ay you're a wavy ass dude, you know that?
But why male models?
beyond that, you have to start with something; they'll flat-out refuse to answer "how to" questions, it has to be at least "this is what I've done; help me from here"
Second one is so much more concerning. It worked the first time... something truly terrible must be happening in the background. 
Actually not a bad idea, but now you're tempting me to come up with like 20 options
Boolean algebra may sound scary, but there is a good chance you already understand it, just without all the formalities of a class.  If you understand the meaning of the words 'and', 'or', and 'not', you're half way there.  Basically, Boolean algebra is just the algebra or logic of making decisions.  Don't let the name scare you.
 > I do this to myself but unfortunately apply this pressure to nothing.    I had something simular. Except for the obvious advice never stop trying i can't say much. When I failed a grade it "clicked" somehow and I started to work a lot more. Currently learning Japanese in my free time and planning to learn to code in a couple months.
In which case, this AMA is a thinly veiled advertisement (and the "releasing for free under MIT" thing is dishonest).
No, but they invented PageRank, and that's what's important. 
Well those were the two most pleasant and sensible comments to be be uttered in the entire history of the internet. 
Honestly, as someone who hadn't done a line of code when I started my course on it, as long as you've got a decent understanding of algebra and logic in combination with decent googling skills, you'll be fine. Occasionally frustrated because you lack the terminology to find what you want, but fine. 
If you want to get really good at something, really fast, that sounds about right.Putting in 1500 hours in a single year (~4 hours a day for 365) is about equivalent to all the coursework in an entire undergraduate degree.
What's that?
Can I ask what you used it for or how? I've always wondered what type of projects you would use calc in.
do an AMA next time you need to create a product/come up with an idea
Max B is that you???
This sounds just like how my first aid training started a few weeks ago:One person is lying there screaming in agony. One person is lying there silent. The silent one is much more worrying and is almost always the one you should investigate first.
Write a program that will tell you what the next language you should learn is.
I wouldn't necessarily recommend c++ as a first language.
Aren't most AMAs?
Just wanted to say that your comment is abnormally and refreshingly legible though somewhat hyperbolic.
You mess up enough times, you eventually get something down.
> What's funny is even child prodigies largely even out with everyone else once they hit university.> I know a woman who played violin as a member of a symphony at age 11, and started studying violin at a big US university at 14. She was the youngest graduate from the program ever. She's just a normal hipster now, who abandoned a successful adult career as a concert violinist to go back to school in her mid-20s. For nursing.
are you that kid from 4chan who triforced his parents computer?
Damn, you're good at this. Remind me to create a product/come up with an idea
You just gave me a mental image of a compiler screaming every time it hit an error.  That would be terrifying.
But what language to write that program in?
It was my first language (other than messing around I'm visual basic), and I honestly don't see it being any more difficult to start with than Java. Sure, you won't necessarily make use of the object oriented features right away, but they will be there when you need them.
Please create a product and/or come up with an idea for one.
I know my next project..
There's been a lot of talk recently about the need to further monetize reddit in order to ensure it's financial longevity - what kinds of steps do you think need to be taken?  Do you have any ideas or goals about how to approach this?
When were you asked if you wanted to be the new CEO?
Hey Steve.When the whole "blackout" due to Victoria being fired happened, a former mod of /r/worldnews and /r/brasil pointed out that geodefaults are also having their fair share of troubles. Apparently, the former manager of international comunities was let go, and the geodefault mods weren't notified.How do you plan to improve this?
Hey Steve!  Weekly, or at least semi-regular, AMAs are an awesome idea.  Maybe different admin teams at reddit could step up and do some too!  Any thoughts on how reddit should prioritize the needs of brand new users (who may find various aspects of reddit's design complicated and confusing) with the needs of core users and mods (who reddit relies on for its great content and dankest of memes)?
Are there any specific plans for the Alien Blue app that you can share?
I'm the current owner of /r/SteveHuffman. Any ideas with what I should do with it? I'm lost right now.
Is it okay if we use Reddit gold as our Greek Currency ?
Do you plan on reviewing your policy on shadowbanning users? From my understanding this was first implemented as a measure to prevent spam bots from knowing they have been silenced, but has since been expanded to everyday users without there knowledge. Is there any new system in the works were a user being banned would be let know that they 1) have been banned 2)what the ban was for
Will any of the policy changes under Ellen Pao actually be reverted or was she really just used as a scapegoat for these unpopular changes that would have happened anyway?
How would you define the current culture at Reddit?  Is it in line with where you want it to be?
Who is your daddy and what does he do? 
Hi Steve!So, AFAIK you'll remain the CTO of Hipmunk. Do you think that you can realistically manage two jobs of this caliber at the same time? How will you arrange that?
Heard about the incident with the /r/AMD subreddit? If so, what do you think about it?
You could have had any username you wanted. Why'd you go with spez?
Are /u/kickme444 and Reddit Gifts coming back?  Please tell me Christmas isn't dead.
Are you threatened by Voat? Do you see it as reddit alternative as reddit was Digg alternative?
Please don't do them weekly. Maybe monthly or bi-monthly. What's your plan on policing vote-brigading in the future? Do you have some way to automatically track vote brigades and people taking part in them?
Since I am sure this question will be asked 100 times during the course of this AMA, let me be the first:Will you be bringing Victoria back on board?
Finally caught one of these right when it started!What are your plans for an official Reddit Android app?
Steve, I'm a huge fan and I'd like to ask what your thoughts are about reddit being a potential game changer in politics and pop culture. Do you believe that the reddit community has an ability to sway public opinion and policy? Did you intend this when you created reddit?
So, you're my new boss. When are you planning to stop by "The Annex"?In case you don't know, The Annex is the coolest, hippest, most jovial corner of the reddit offices. We have candied treats, art, pigeons, and even a sister city (flint, michigan)!
Besides r/cannibals, what are some of your favorite subreddits?
Can we change usernames? Now that reddit is becoming more popular and is cited in mainstream media, I can't be commenting as handsinpant.
 Hi Steve nice to meet you. Would you rather fight 1000 duck sized horses, or one horse sized duck? Thank you. 
reddit has a lot of cash. Monetization isn't a short-term concern of ours. Yes, we will continue to experiment with different efforts so that when time is right we know what works and what does not.
Board relationships need to be managed. The message they will be hearing from me loudly and often is that we need to build out the team here if we want to get anything done. All the planning in the world is useless if we can't execute.
Which admin?
What are "geodefaults"?
Really good question, thank you.I think the new user / core user dichotomy is the biggest product challenge we fact right now. Solve it, and we are unstoppable. A vague answer, I know, but this is one of the big things on my mind.
I have lots of ideas! But, I'm sad to say, I don't want to publicize them here until I've got more support internally. It's shitty if you're on a product/dev team to come into work and find everything's been upended without any of your input.
Don't forget to crosspost with /r/cannibals. Similar audiences.
Create a bot that reposts all his posts to /r/SteveHuffman so we can keep track of his statements if we ever need to reference back to something he's promised.
yeah, because he didnt provide proof. LOL.
We will reconsider all our policies from first principles. I don't know all of the changes that were made under Ellen's tenure. I'm mostly still getting to know everyone here.No, Ellen was not used as a scapegoat. She stepped up during a time of crisis for reddit, for which we were thankful. Things didn't go smoothly, for sure, but I will do my best to guide us forward.
This is important.Will you re-hire some of the old staff who more or less made up for the administrative essence of Reddit?If not, can you provide a reason for why?
Too soon to tell. I've only got to meet the team for the first time late in the afternoon, and I still haven't had a chance to meet everyone, let alone have substantive discussions.The vibe around the office is pretty fun, but the reddit team has been through a lot the past while. I hope I can bring some stability.
My father was an engineer at GM for 30 years.My step-father was a heavy hitter in the business world for a while, most publicly he was the CMO of Unisys, but that place is a cluster, so he left.
It's going to take a little time to find the right balance. Hipmunk is in a stable place, and most of my value is provided in a few key meetings every week, which I will still be attending. Also, they're five blocks away, so I can go over there whenever I need.
For those not aware, /r/AMD was closed down by the top mod abruptly without any warning. This forced users of that subreddit to move to /r/AdvancedMicroDevices.As for a potential answer if spez doesn't reply....reddit hasn't intervened in subreddit's closing down and such when a mod does it on their own. If the AMD mod had done something fishy then it could be opened (like /r/wow was).
Is Reddit Gifts gone? I'm pretty sure it is not, and we have no plans to shut it down.As for Dan, I didn't work with him, and really don't know much of that situation.
reddit had better technology than Digg. I don't think Voat has better technology than reddit.
Aaron and I were very close for about five months. During that time we ported reddit from Lisp to Python and collaborated on a lot of ideas that are still important to reddit today.We had a falling out around the time reddit sold, and I regret to say I didn't really know him when he passed. That whole situation was ugly, and the world is worse for it.
> Please don't do them weekly. Maybe monthly or bi-monthly.Ok, you're the boss, Xephryon.> Do you have some way to automatically track vote brigades and people taking part in them?Yeah, we do. It's existed for a long time. Maybe it broke after I left. We used to put a lot of effort into identifying large groups of people who were trying to undermine the community.
I think we need more official Reddit Android Developers.
They can ban what they want, but I'd like to make it transparent what was actually banned. Some sort of "garbage can" or something.
Yes, we have an amazing opportunity to change the world.No, I just didn't want to look stupid in front of my parents.
As long as Toby's not there.
I was just over there, in fact! It's well decorated for sure.I was born in Michigan. I ran the Crim race in Flight years ago.
They have a really nice fire escape. I've been told Annexers get to use it first before the other 5th floorers.
You should totally stop by the fifth world lounge first. We have a little shrine to you and everything.
1000 duck sized horses. Since they can't climb stairs, you can easily get away from them long enough to figure out how to drown them.
Monetization through the "Gold" program was fantastically handled.  Reddit was upfront with the community from the start with what they were doing and why they were doing it.  Feedback was openly welcome and was effective because the users were wholly included at the start of the process.  I think for future efforts to be successful you'd do well to repeat this strategy.  The last thing Redditors will accept is that feeling like someone's trying to cash them out without their knowledge.
That didn't seem to be a very direct answer...but..I can understand where you are coming from.Reddit needs more CMs, or better tools for those CMs :(
In other words, yes, but I'm stalling for time.
/u/pinwhale He was gonna help us with so much, then he disappeared 
Would this also translate to Reddit Is Fun for us Android people?
Actual Cannibal Steven LaHuff
Can't we just look at his post history...?
> Absolutely. Shadowbanning is for spammers.Im liking you already.
I'm not sure how I can provide more proof other than marking it as admin.
She can't surely have been solely responsible for all the negatively perceived changes?
He said Victoria was fired for specific reason but can't tell what it was. Now, I am wondering. 
I like that a CEO is now taking on two jobs and walking to each office between shifts. You're kind of a model for the country.
Thinking in realtime: we probably don't want to undo a mod's decision, but if they leave forever, we can re-claim it.
>If the AMD mod had done something fishy then it could be opened (like /r/wow[3] was).Or /r/iama was, years ago
Its pretty low to take someones idea, incorporate him and the idea into your system, then fire the guy who came up with the idea.  Makes a lot of redditors not want to help you folks out.
I've participated in a few reddit gift exchanges, from the 50th anniversary doctor who exchange to the classic Secret Santa/arbitrary day. Please keep the exchanges from being privatized and or overtly commercialized. The last thing I'd want to see is the Reddit Ford gift exchange brought to you by Ford Motors. 
Shots fired.
So nerd question: was Reddit originally in lisp? What led to that decision, or was it just what the original people knew?
You said elsewhere you're against shadowbanning of real users. Given that brigading is currently mostly countered by shadowbans, how do you plan to punish them instead?
Like /r/ShitRedditSays?
Hit me up. I develop sync for reddit and I'd love to make it official. 
Toby is the worst.
You should come to one of our Annex Events. Tuesday is Improv. Thursday is the urban foraging club. I'll add you to the annex newsletter for updates on events and more!
Fellow Michigander here. 
Whoa Whoa Whoa. Slow your roll, Drew. While I think 5th World Lounge is one of the hottest spots in town, I think it's only proper that he visits the ORIGINAL hot spot in town, The Annex, first.I hope we can resolve these issues and possibly co-market our corners of the office soon?
I hope "nothing illegal" here means no *doing* illegal things, not no *talking about* illegal things. Talking about drug use openly is good for harm reduction, and saves lives. 
"Don't ever, ever try to lie to the internet - because they will catch you. They will de-construct your spin. They will remember everything you ever say for eternity."-- Gaben
Honestly, I'm not sure how much of an answer to questions like this he can give until he figures out his relationship with everyone at the company and exactly what's going on. It's his first full day on the job. Luckily, he said he's gonna be doing these AMAs weekly or so. I'd ask again in a couple weeks.Also, happy cake day!
Stalling isn't the right word, but of course the board wants to see growth. I want to see growth too. We're not going to see much growth without serious product efforts, and we're not going to get serious product efforts without more resources. Fortunately, I have the ability to get those resources, so that's what I'll do.
I strongly prefer Sync myself. It's got full, beautiful, material design, a terrific dev team who stays active on the sync sub, and embedded image viewing.
Ahh! Your karma! It's caught in a bear trap!
Can you subscribe to a user so that his or her posts will show up on your frontpage?  I figured that would be the rationale.
This just in: New Reddit CEO is bigotted against Greeks./s
Well, I haven't seen even a single complaint from a shadowbanned user.
Seriously. I was just shadowbanned last week.
Only option now is to ban automoderator.
You could verify using /r/gonewild's rules.
from what ive seen, most people post a picture of themselves with their username on a piece of paper to show proof
It's hard to imagine she was, but responsibility flows up. I'm sure there will be times I've got to take it on the chin as well. Part of the gig.
I don't think you realise that either her or anyone on reddit spilling the beans is going to end up in a legal shitstorm or a situation that leaves them unemployable.
America! Where chasing the American dream means even CEOs have a second job!
IIRC wasn't it just given to karmanaut?
His wife /u/5days who co-founded it is still an admin and has said she will keep running it.
You don't know why he was fired, and (wild guess) I'm pretty sure his job was to develop ideas and tools for reddit, not to develop ideas and tools and let reddit use them as long as he was employed.
No, Pao fired.
Undermine them with technology, of course.
Or /r/bestof or /r/subredditdrama etc.Maybe get some kind of better way to disable voting than np. Np is basically a CSS hack yet we all need to respect it because we risk being shadowbanned.
It's a HUGE job. I get that. You need support from both our community managers, and I intend and building out a team here, and our product team because I can see very well the tools have not been updated in a very long time. I will build out these teams as fast as I can, but it won't happen overnight.
It's the Internet. We tracked down the creator of the Jazz paper cup design for god's sake. We can't not know a thing.
Because we want to hear him say they fired her because she wouldn't play ball and help monetize AMA's 
Wasn't he banned recently?
me? on top of the world? lol, wrong username
Take that back
> urban foraging clubIs that a euphemism for dumpster diving? Is the pay that bad? Blink an SOS if you need help.
...but the fifth world lounge is a shared space and the annex is not! Also, the shrine includes a bear head bottle opener. The annex doesn't have one of those.
"I want a car with a roof." -John F. Kennedy. 
first day on the job, spends it on reddit. 
Do you think you'll end the no negotiation policy?
Looks super cool! Just a minor nitpick on terminology. All the onboarding screens refer to subreddits as "communities" despite the menu still being labeled "my subreddits." Then in the last screen you refer to reddit itself as a community. This could all get pretty confusing for a new user.
This is great. I spent my first months thinking the subreddits in my list were the ONLY ones. Now whenever I am interested in something I have to google the name with reddit to get a subreddit option, since they still don't show up all the time when I search reddit. Would be great if reddit knew my interests from the beginning and made me aware of the related subreddits. I wouldn't even be opposed if Reddit took a look at my most viewed subs/posts and offered new suggestions every now and then. Nothing spammy though.
Gnawing off your karma! (Quiet! Quiet!)
That sounds clever until you realize it would just enable stalking.
There was the guy who posted on TIFU about being shadowbanned for THREE YEARS.
I know it's supposed to be a joke, but there have been plenty. I believe they can edit their already posted comments, and many have used that as a means to spread awareness (particularly users that were upvoted highly and subsequently shadowbanned seemingly for speaking out against pao). 
I just found out today that my main, which I have had for nearly 4 years, which has a few Reddit Regifter trophies and I have bought gold on, has been shadow banned for I don't know how long, I just thought my comments where not popular...If I had done or said something wrong it would have been less hurtful to be told so that I could either explain or know what I should be doing better...
You should wear your hat for replies like this
To *shadow*ban Automoderator!
Auto-mod is more powerful
Will ~~OP~~ the CEO deliver?
>  but responsibility flows upThis is very true. My boss reminds me of this all the time. He always says "if you fuck up, I am the one that takes the fall as I am in charge. So do a good job" lOL
I hope it goes better for you, while Ellen was CEO I think the site became less community orientated and not much was changed for benefit of the user base. I hope you can change that :) 
Rent in San Francisco is just really expensive.
Wait they fired him but not his wife? Holy shit... way to make the home life awkward...
I like the sound of that. I hope your negotiations with Acme Corp are going well.
The best thing you can possibly do before any technology upgrades is *clear up the rules regarding brigades*. As they stand, they are incredibly vague, leading to all sorts of hysteria and myths about NP links and what will/won't get you banned.
Whats stopping the admins from firing the mods of the huge subbreddits and replacing them with people that will toe the company line?
Or that Jesse Jackson's AMA brought about some sort of frivolous lawsuit threat.I think we're down to 3 theories? - A disastrous AMA- Something about moving/not moving to San Francisco- turning AMA into a major scripted revenue source
This is like watching parents fight for weekend visitation rights\*grabs popcorn*
I'm not questioning anyone's patriotism, but it's a fact that The Annex is a job creator and was ranked #17 in Hip Magazine's Top 37 Hippest Places.  This fifth world lounge may play well with the young socialite demo, but The Annex is objectively a bedrock of joviality.  And I'm not saying that because my The Annex citizenship application is under review at all.
I'm glad you're on board with this. I think Reddit is a valuable avenue for a lot of people to discuss illegal activity -  from drug use, to prostitution, to immigration status, I see many discussions and dialogues here that make everyone come out for the better, and help many people stay safe and not make bad decisions. So long as the site doesn't become SilkRoad, you're not planning to censor anything like that, do I understand you right? 
The idea of having ads for people without accounts is an interesting thought. That would both make money and encourage people to make an account, thus resulting in user growth. It is a win-win.However, I wouldn't be happy if they made RES a premium that you have to pay for. I mean I would deal with it, but I wouldn't pay for RES functionality, and be sad at losing it.
If he doesn't answer this one, can you explain what that is?
There's no geodefaults for UK redditors, we're excluded from /r/Europe and /r/unitedkingdom isn't a geodefault either.
I found a lot of subreddits that I'm subscribed to by hitting the Random button. I think having a better way to find them would be cool - maybe a short questionnaire when you sign up or to make a few suggestions from time to time.
Deleting all your comments! (Quiet! Quiet!)
You can add friends, which effectively dues this. Doesn't front page it, but enabled the stalking tool.Whatever happened to RSS feeds?
For those of you who can't read /u/slide_potentiometer's comment what /u/slide_potentiometer wrote was this:> I love Adolph Hitler and Joseph Stalin and my favorite food is tacos with dog and cat meat
There was a very highly upvoted TIFU post the other day about a user not knowing they were shadowbanned for 3 years.  He ended up messaging the admins and got them to unban him.  If you keep messaging /u/kn0thing and/or other admins hopefully they'll eventually take notice.
That was one of the most depressing things i have read, he kept at it for 3 years with not a single upvote... He was running on nothing but hopes and dreams. all we want in life is to feel validated, he was robbed of that in the form of shadowbanhammer
now I don't know if I am shadowbanned or just not funny :( 
Also, when an account is shadowbanned their old posts are sent to the spam queue on subs. A mod can re approve all their old content.
> I just thought my comments where not popular...All the feels. My main was shadowbanned and to this day I still don't know why. Tried emailing mods asking what I did and how can I change but never heard back. Had to abandon it and start over...really soured me from reddit.What kills me is I have been a mod on a different tech site for 12 years (honestly) and never would have done something like this. We had issues with anon posters but usually we solved it by required photographic proof (home improvement forum) which usually worked.
How do you detect it?
Eh, I'm pretty conservative about [A]-ing, because I think it can get obnoxious (also, it literally sends a ping to our office-wide chat room). But point taken in this case.
If you do that, the site will go down. Automod is literally skynet. 
"But I'll also fire you".
I don't know about that. She brought the community together like no one else has.
Seriously, even Portland is expensive now and that was the destination for people who couldn't afford rent in San Fran
AFAIK, no :(. I wish there was.
He could have been fired for anything from "here look mate we heard about the new job, you're fired, enjoy the severance" to "dude you just can't do that with a chicken in public".
Technically? Nothing. But, an adversarial relationship with the mods is the opposite of what we want.
Do you automatically get invited to the Reddit HQ after reaching 1 million karma?
Actually, it's down to 1 theory.* Completely baseless speculation
I'm pretty sure that she didn't get immediately terminated on the spot as soon as Jesse Jackson's AMA went south. If that was the case you might expect her to turn in her resignation instead. It is more likely to be connected to something that was ongoing at the time and unknown by the community, as it was taking place before the vast majority of users had any idea who she was. This would mean that the decision to fire her wasn't a spur of the moment thing and was subject to internal processes.
Admins nerding it up.
Is The Annex the place with Kri$pyBucks? If so, it's my favorite.
I mod over at /r/DarkNetMarkets and I really hope that subreddit never gets on the chopping block. It's a valuable tool for harm reduction and education on proper use of those marketplaces. We simply strive to provide an educational resource for people who are interested in learning about the DarkNet and how to stay safe while using them. I recognize our subreddit walks a fine line in regards to legality, but I really hope that if it comes down to it, the admins would work with us on what changes to make to keep us around rather than just shutting us down. 
It was an idea that there's a segment of possible employees (women, minorities) who are less likely to negotiate (and are scrutinized when they do) and as a result, people who do know how to negotiate (mainly white men) get an unfair advantage. Reddit went through a process of establishing a process for determining fair pay given job title, experience level etc and would make what it considered a fair offer and would not budge from that fair offer. 
Before this comment, I thought geodefault was geode fault. Like a fault for earthquakes, but filled with geodes..
Now you're at /r/cannibals, sitting inside Steven LaHuff! 
That's disgusting. You are a terrible person. You can't mix dog AND cat meat. It's one or the other, you monster. 
Well that seems fairly level-headed.  I mean, Hitler did nothing wrong...
Please delete your comment for the sake of irony
It was because he triggered the automated system to shadowban spammers. His very first act on the site was to post the same link to two different subreddits at seconds apart.
No, you aren't shadowbanned.
Yeah, but none of the default mods care to waste time on that. Happens plenty on the recent subs that have grown and been created in response to recent changes, though. 
It's amazing how easy it is for people who get shadowbanned to dupe Redditors into believing that it's a "free speech" issue.If Pao or Reddit really wanted to silence criticism, they easily could. Instead, *clearly*, they allow it and allow it with thousands of upvotes. Anyone who thinks censorship of criticism of Reddit happens regularly is a fool.
> also, it literally sends a ping to our office-wide chat roomneat
Out of a cannon into the sun.    Edit- Thank you for the gold!
Seriously, the announcement last night was the least divisive one they've ever made.
Nothing unites people like a common enemy
I think it was Gandhi who said "In the face of a great enemy, nukes must be deployed"
You can't have it!
erowid.org was a lifesaver when I was in college.Same principle.
Shadowbanning bots (It's Steven LaHuff)But he doesn't see your subscribe (It's Steven LaHuff)Preparing your downvotes Doxxing not a superstar Steven LaHuff 
Well, you can, but it'll be $2.15 extra
Nah m8 invading Russia was a shit idea
So basically it all boils down to this: Give the mods more tools and the *choice* of how to use them. 
Yup. /r/science mod here. We would definitely shut down if we lost the ability to remove pseudoscience. Without a doubt.
Ouf, I did that before too when I had a submission that fit in three subs. You can get shadowbanned for that? I didn't know.
Holy shit I'd be at pissed
We've never exactly let the truth get in our way of justice. How bout that boston bomber?
I'm not shadowbanned! My comments are just unpopular! :D
Does [M]-ing send a ping to your moderator-wide chat room?
Damn, dude. That's impressive.
Or Gabe from Silicon Valley
Before one ventures out to the asteroid belts, it is prudent to consult with Erowid.
You limp out of RedditAnd back into the real worldBut knowing you have wonYou have unsubbed from /r/StevenLaHuff
It wasn't his fault the natives were hostile.
Is anybody else seeing a void where there would be a comment? How odd.
You could always just post about your disappointment.
That has to be one of the ten worst subreddits in history.
What's the most ridiculous thing you've found so far?
When you guys saw the scope of what you were uncovering, did you worry that releasing information against powerful people would cause you issues?
What data, in your opinion so far, has been the least reported on by mainstream media that has the largest consequences?
How did you decide which other news organisations to work with on the story? What was it like knowing about it for a year before anything was released?
How does working on such a secretive project impact your personal lives? for instance what do you tell someone when they ask how your day at work has been, or what you've been working on. 
Which celebrity involved shocked you the most? Also, how deep is Lionel Messi in trouble? 
1. As investigative journalists, is there data or information that you do not understand, and require knowledge of basic finance in order to sort through the Panama Papers? 2. What are your reactions regarding countries that are cracking down on news about Panama Papers? 
Fair play to you and all your colleagues for sharing this info with the world. My question is: when this information was given to you initially, what was your reaction? Were you worried it was all false and how difficult was it to verify the information? Thanks!
Thanks for doing this and your work. On the TV show Lanz you mentioned that Edward Snowden broke the news before you could. Do you know who of your colleagues told him and if him tweeting about it was an accident?
At the peak, how many people have had to dig through the source material to find things?
Are you worried in any way about your future careers?
Any idea why there are practically speaking no high profile Americans subject to the panama papers leak? Do we suspect there is another company out there they must be using? Do we suspect any one specifically of harboring them? Or, are there americans subject to the panama leak most haven't heard of? 
Do you know why SZ newspaper was chosen in particular as opposed to say Wikileaks? 
Will you keep the leak dataset forever, and if so, will you keep it private forever? Or, after some time - maybe 10, 25, 50 years - do you think it could be permissible to release?
What advice can you give someone hoping to get into investigative  journalism, and where do you see the field going from where it is now?
How do you deal with the people saying that this whole leak was plannend by western media to hurt Russia?
How much more do you think is lurking in the dataset that you haven't discovered yet? Or, how are you thinking about this problem of determining when you're "done"?
Did you get contacted by intelligences services in order to negociate and to hide some of the info? 
How are you balancing requests from official investigators with the confidentiality of your source? I assume you have gotten tons of requests for insight from officials investigating people and organizations mentioned in the documents. They likely want evidence other then your articles but giving them full access or even revealing the source to them might harm the journalistic work exposing these people and may even reveal the source. Especially since many of these documents could be presented as official evidence in court.
Thank you really for your work! How did you coordinate the work with the other 400 journalists?
How do you react regarding the accusations that you would release the informations in a way that important and influential people in the western countries would not be burdened at all or - at least - not at first? Do the leaks just contain fewer information about people in western countries?
How did you search for high profile names? 
Hi, guys great Ama, my question is.Is it true that not all names will be released?Are there more ecuadorians besides the ones currently in you page?Some days ago ecuadorian president Rafael Correa said great things will come out of this, now will see who is who, probably talking about his opposition who mostly are bussiness men and bankers and next year we have elections so it will be important to know who can we trust.
I think I may already know the answer to this, but did you ever consider involving any international intelligence agencies such as the CIA to aid in your investigation?  If not, why?
I'd first like to say thank you for all the work you have done in the past year (and all the work that still needs to be done). My question is how did it feel once the Panama Papers were released? How did co-workers/family that had to be kept in the dark react?Thanks for doing this and also maybe check out /r/PanamaPapers we would love to get your help/opinions over there!
What was your first reaction after finding this out? How much did it motivate you to go to work everyday, if at all?
Do you guys see your work ending up in a movie, just like Academy Award Winner Spotlight? Would you like it to end up in movie?
What do you guys think is going to happen to Mauricio Macri (current president of Argentina)?
is there any truth to the conspiracy that this is a leak funded by george soros et friends? 
How do work with journalists around the world.? My understanding is the journal La Nacion in Argentina was in charge of the leak, but all they did was justify the activities as legal (actively protecting the president of Argentina), until it came to light that them, and the director of the journal were involved in an offshore company with Mossack.
You mentioned that fonseca refers to some of their high profile clients as Harry Potter or whinny the pooh, could you give more examples and also link the the real person? 
Are there safeguards in place to make sure that information about prominent businesspeople and/or politicians are not suppressed?
Why aren't any notable Americans implicated in the Panama Papers?
What are your favorite pizza toppings?
We had a really good laugh when we found out that Mossack Fonseca addressed some of his very secretive clients by code names like "Winnie Pooh" or "Harry Potter". Sth like that: *"I refer to a meeting with Harry Potter"*Hilarious! 
Of course we were and still are worried. But we know that Germany is a pretty safe country for journalists. We are more concerned about our colleagues in other regions of the world, like Russia, Africa, Latin America...
We think the most important stories of the leak got the attention they deserved. At least as far as we can see. But of course we can't overlook all the published stories in nearly 80 countries. Do you think there is a story that the media should have reported more on? 
> How did you decide which other news organisations to work with on the story?It took us quite some time to decide on that and we made these decisions together with the ICIJ. To trust the partners was extremely important for us. Thats why ICIJ firstly contacted partners we had already worked with. It was less important for us how big the news outlet is. What mattered more was their expertise, their willingness to cooperate and their awareness for security issues. We also tried to have journalists from a lot of different countries on our team to make this a global project. 
We tried to be vague. And we tried to make our work sound as boring as possible, so that no one wants to ask anymore questions. It worked most of the time. 
> Also, how deep is Lionel Messi in trouble?There is already a court case against Messi. The hearing was postponed after the Panama Papers got published because we found another shell company that Messi was involved in. So the prosecutor is going to look into that. So Messi was in trouble even before the PP, but the new revelations definitely didnt help him. But of course we dont know what the official prosecutors are going to decide. 
> As investigative journalists, is there data or information that you do not understand, and require knowledge of basic finance in order to sort through the Panama Papers?Of course we didnt unterstand everything at first sight. But whenever we struggled with certain details we contacted external experts, f.e. for money laundering, tax planning or sanctions. 
We were thrilled and skeptical at the same time. But we were able to verify the parts of the data we reported on through various sources, f.e. court documents, public registries, former leaks and in the end also interviews. 
We don't have a clue. But as a former NSA-employer, Snowden certainly has his methods. ;) 
It started with just the two of us, Bastian and Frederik. In May 2015 we were around 40 people worldwide and at the end of the year almost 400 people. And these were only the people who worked with the data itself. Each news outlet had a lot more staff that was working on different aspects of the story - like design, publishing or reporting on the ground, researching different aspects. *(Bastian and Frederik)*
Happy cake day!And no, we are not really worried about our future careers. Is there any reason we should? Is there anything we don't know??? If yes, please tell us!
Hope Rob Schneider gets the lead role.
> that would alter the course of the Presidential election? As far as we know - no. But: we are still digging. 
Probably because WikiLeaks is extremely biased...
We got over eleven million documents with thousands of stories in it. Why would someone leak this huge amount of data if he wants only a certain story to be published?He couldnt even be sure we would find this particular story!
No, because they didn't know about it beforehand. At least we hope that's the case. We have been contacted afterwards but we do not cooperate with Intelligence Agencies. 
We are not giving out any documents to any authorities. But we published and are going to publish certain documents to proof our stories.
We had a secure forum to share findings and discuss them. We also met up a couple of times, in Washington, Munich, Lillehammer, Johannesburg and London. These meetings were really important to build up the trust we needed to work together so closely. These meetings were also great, cause we were not able to talk about our work with anyone else. Finally someone to talk to!To coordinate the work, we set up project groups who were focusing on certain aspects of the Panama Papers. Like Fifa or Russia. We communicated a lot with each other, also via encrypted E-Mails or chats. 
Yes, we worked with **ARIJ - arab reporters for investigative journalism.** They are great! At the moment we are planning a story about the involvement of Middle East Leaders, btw.
We created long lists of politicians, CEOs and other persons of public interests. Then we threw those lists into our data-set. But in the beginning the research was also led by personal interests. Like me, looking for anyone from Bayern Munich. Sadly, I didn't find anybody *(Bastian)*
We don't work together with Intelligence Agencies. Ever. 
We had a wall in our research room where we collected all the leads to bigger names and public personas. Each morning we met in front of that wall and it reminded us how important our work is. That was a pretty good motivation. 
lol i would love to see that reply
There is still a lot to do for the Panama Papers, we won't be done for a while. **And** there is already a new project as well - but that is a secret. Again. 
It's a leak from an anonymous, unidentified source. Who knows what might be missing from the data set. Stories about big names aren't going to disappear if 400 journalists have access to every document. There's way too much prestige/exposure to gain from it.
We ate a lot of pizza in the last weeks and months and therefore are perfectly qualified to answer this question!Spicy salami *Bastian*Bruschetta *Vanessa*Frederik is already gone but we know for sure he **hates** gyros on his pizza. 
Plot twist: It's the code name for Daniel Radcliffe.
"code names"There's no way Harry keeps all of his gold in Gringotts after the dragon debacle.
So whenever I hear someone talk about how boring their dead-end job is and how much they hate it, I have to instantly assume they're actually working on some classified top-secret project??!
solid strategy!  though must be hard to vent if needed. 
That just brought up the scene in my head from one of the Mission Impossible movies where Tom Cruise is hosting a party with his g/f.  One of the people ask him what he does and he says something like "Traffic Flow Analyst.  I study traffic flows. [sounds technical for a sentence or two]  It's quite fascinating actually.".  The guy just gives a look like "This guy is dry as hell.  Get me out of here.".
Did you just answer question 1 by answering question 3?
I'll go post this on /r/ThreadKillers, give the post more views
Do you think anyone will actually do any time 
take his money... take his children but please don't take him off the field!
I'm beyond impressed by not only the technical abilities you have, but also the fact that 400 people on your team joined together and were all able to contribute to such an enormous, incredibly important project. That is simply amazing. You guys are phenomenal. Thank you for your service! 
How long after the initial leak did you finally acquire this functionality?I imagine that this was a high priority task. what methods did you use to search/catalog data while this database was still being built. 
This is slightly off-topic but what does f.e. stand for?
How do you keep such a large story/break so quiet, especially with 400 people intimately digging through these documents? Absolutely fascinating!
>  a lot more staff that was working on different aspects of the story - like design, publishing or reporting on the groundHow informed were they? How did you brief the designers, for example? Was ist along the lines of *"So, we need a nice graphic with Putin, the Icelandic PM, and a football player... Messi would be good."*?
Thanks for the answer! I don't think there should be any reason to worry - I'm just inquiring because of the sheer amount of powerful people who have been affected and whether any of them have contacted you with vindictive tones!
If you could orchestrate when in the election cycle releases about the candidates from the papers would come, speaking about a strictly theoretical thought experiment, when would that be?
Is part of the limitation that you don't know who or what to look for?  Do you need inspiration? What are you using to search?
Okay fair enough. Follow up question:Why did you people attempt to smear Putin's good name? He's an honest, hardworking dictator.
"He." "He" couldn't even be sure we would find this particular story.That narrows the whistleblower down to only 3.5 billion people. Get on the case, Reddit! 
Why dont you cooperate with intelligence agencies? Im not saying you should or shouldnt, I wouldnt know, im an IT guy.
Have you already been approached by some government tax authorities for access to the data for them to conduct their own investigations? 
Huh. This is the most interesting question/answer so far. Is there any precedent in German law that would allow a journalist to refuse a subpoena for his sources?
To be honest, the whole thing sounds like an awesome plot for a movie similar to spotlight.
+1 for integrity.
If they ignore it the answer is yes.
Cayman Island Papers confirmed!
> It's a leak from an anonymous, unidentified source. Who knows what might be missing from the data set.> Stories about big names aren't going to disappear if 400 journalists have access to every document. There's way too much prestige/exposure to gain from it.Yup. Having 400 journalists from all over the world working on a project makes it impossible to suppress any findings. 
How does gyros on pizza even work?
I'm not saying that I work with this kind of people or I'm related to this in any way, but if this was me doing the code names, "Harry Potter" would be the codename of Elijah Wood
Yer a felon, Harry!
They're on the Cayman Islands.
I heard a (non US) reporter on the news say that one possible reason why there hasn't been any high profile Americans involved so far is that there's a US state (forgot which one), which has some special regulation that makes it a great tax haven for US tax evaders. So they wouldn't need to hide their money in Panama.Not sure if it's true though.
so when will you release the cookie recipe...
Having relatives working in intelligence I can say that this is standard protocol involving secrecy
CIA Agents do that..."yeah, I work in IT." Uhh ok 
I assume he doesn't want to talk about the "how would you stop one of them from leaking the data to the world part", since that might be sensitive. He mentioned that everyone has access to the data in prior comments too.
Not really. With the right controls, everyone can have access but still be unable to copy the whole dataset. It's not really that difficult unless you are a NSA contractor.
This might not apply in this case, but one measure used to determine the identity of a leaker is making slight changes to sensitive material that is given out. For example, a minor typo or word change on each page that is different for everybody. A screenshot of one page is all that is needed to reveal yourself. As you can see, there are clever ways of pinpointing who the leaker is. 
Do the crime do the time. He can play for the prison team. No one should be above the law.
It really is fascinating! We are actually astonished how well it worked. We were quite sure that a couple of stories would leak before the official publishing date. That didnt happen. So I guess most of us sticked to the most important rule of our project: *Shut up and encrypt.* 
At a certain point everybody involved with the project - such as the graphic designer Peter Hoffmann - had to use PGP-encryption. Imagine how difficult it was to educate an online-team that is used to save everything to top-secret Google drive ;). But we knew about the importance of the visual approach, thus we had to give them a general overview of the stories. (Vanessa)
I just love Reddit...seeing these esteemed journalists wishing Chili_Fart happy cake day made me laugh out loud over my mound of Five Guys fries.
The problem with trying to crush a journalist though is that then the crush because an even more exciting story. Everyone loves to read about a scummy politician or business person falling because of greed, but tying to ruin someone for exposing them? That's headlines for weeks. 
it's called the October Surprise and goes back decades. nothing new. in fact, before TV came along US elections were a lot worse with real fraud and really bad mudslinging and name calling. TV gave us a presidential candidate
Putin did nothing wrong
He was misinterpreted and clarified shortly after. In response to a tweet saying "For context, he's saying that documents on US subjects is, 'coming next'", Plochinger said "No, it just means: relax. What's in the files will ne published without fear or favor"
Saw a stat on PBS News Hour last night that the US tax code is almost six times as long as War & Peace based on word count. It's been made so complicated and built out so extensively, from I'm guessing lobbyists and big business, that loopholes must be everywhere.
Get the weekend subscription!Perfect newspaper for every day, but I don't have an hour to read the newspaper ever day so i got the friday/saturday subscription which is perfect. It even has the sz magazin plus other bonus content.
We typed too quickly. Our bad. To be precise: He, she, it or they. 
Probably a translation mistake. In German, the word for "someone", "jemand", is masculine. Form a sentence in your head, translate it to another language, write it down, and sometimes a pronoun or two slip through the cracks. 
 Is there a worry that the leaker could have disappeared any people from the docs to protect them(or him/herself) or do you feel that that is not a possibility with the scope of info? 
Some of the corporations in question surely exist in Nevada. It's one of the easiest states to set up a corporation. 
Sorry, some things have to be kept as a secret.... *(Bastian)*
I work in intelligence, but I don't give a shit and do exactly the opposite of what most people do. It's even on my Facebook. I say exactly what I do and how it impacts the intelligence community, while obviously withholding anything classified.
Now he said 'All partners *had* access'.Maybe they just temporarily let the other journalists have insight?
Referred to as a Canary trap...
Man, imagine being in prison and seeing that the other team got freaking Messi :(
Nixon and Kennedy 
I feel like you stopped writing before you finished that last sentence
I believe it's actually similar. I think they scanned in tons and tons of documents and converted everything into a readable database, and then ya, search for whatever you want. I think with higher profile people it's more likely to be better hidden, like Putin's cello player friend. So just searching for Putin wouldn't have gotten you there. In any case I don't think this place had that many US customers for a number of reasons. 
If you're blue and you don't know Where to go to why don't you goWhere fashion sits? Putin on a Ritz. 
Also keep in mind that often, when a huge piece of law is replaced with a new huge piece of law, the old piece is left in the law and it's just listed as repealed.Much of our Tax code is old and antiquated stuff that people don't take out.
Damn, now we're up to world population plus possible alien/entity involvement. It's bigger than we thought! We need more people on this case!
FWIW, my gf is German and she references every hypothetical or neutral person as "he". Germans tend to use "he" in substitute for instances when we English speaking natives say "they". German is just a masculine language.
The people demand the truth!
Next thing you know, your wife is courting some amateur hour "spy" skeeze on the side, and you get this idea to win her back by setting up a meeting in a hotel room where she has to seduce you, but she doesn't know it's you, and also your buddy Tom Arnold helps out by doctoring your voice on a cassette tape.
The same thing has been done since forever. It's clever though.For example, cartographers (map makers) used to insert fake places onto their maps. If another map copied theirs, it would be spotted easily.I believe the ebook industry does something similar to track piracy with small differences or tpyos that you might not even notice.
Grand Maister piscel can't keep his mouth shut.
As a reference to the Canary Islands, which didn't exist until a mapmaker put them there to catch map stealers.
Ahahahahahahahahahahahhhhhhhh
German gov messing with SZ? In middle of the refugee crisis?Ha-ha.
There is basically no way someone handed them 11 million documents lolits already in data form
It wasn't me, so you can take me off that possible list
Well atleast it excludes any or all divine entity
Big cookie dosent want you to know!! Wake up sheeple!!!
Like sweat and elbow grease?

Our national weather service did a similar thing. they had a hunch that one news portal is displaying weather by scrubbing their website so they inserted obviously fake temperatures (freezing in the middle of summer) at odd times (during the night etc) to show the news outlet is copying their data. 
I believe google even did it with searches when Bing was born.
That's just what you would say.

Your link regarding Lincoln mentions nothing about a raid in his early days as a politician, unless I misread it.  Can you please quote the relevant text?
I always get equally surprised every time I see Hugh Laurie outside the role of House. Even now, almost four years later.
Omfg... The number of people that could be involved in this is increasing at an incredible rate.  The only pronoun they didn't use was "you"... Does that mean I'm the only one NOT in on it???
Your username is bizarrely relevant.
Raisin some important questions here.
Your comment made me realize how much I'm immersed in GOT and ASOIAF. I read OP's comment, understood the reference without batting an eye and moved on. Obviously, it's obscure if you don't follow GOT/ASOIAF religiously.

I mean, a President resigned over getting caught breaking into his rival parties headquarters in modern times.  100 years before that people did that on the regular and it was considered normal.  I would definitely say we've progressed past that.  The worst thing we have now is Trump, who has been saying some pretty horrific things. He still hasn't accused Hillary of having a dick though, or Cruz of having a pussy like our Founding Fathers did.  Our political atmosphere is dirty and a mess, but let's be honest, we've come a long way from where this country used to be.
Of all the food you have been offered, have you ever refused a certain type of food?

Whenever the question comes up "If you could switch lives with anyone in the world, who would it be?" - my answer is always Anthony Bourdain. You seem to have lived such a full, adventurous and unique life. Thanks for making great shit for all these years.My question is, if you could switch places with anyone in the world, who would it be and why?
From all the places you have visited, what would be the place you would like to live after retirement?
What is the most unexpected "foodie" city in the US? 
I see you're drinking a $150 bottle of scotch. How is it?
Where have you eaten the best sandwich?
Re: Raw Craft: What thing that you made yourself, other than food, are you most proud of, and why?
What are you going to eat for dinner tonight?
Did you get to keep your Bob Kramer knife from series 1 of Raw Craft? And do you still use it?
Hey Tony, you're on your last $20 EVER.  Where do you go to eat and drink in NYC? 
* Have you been back to the Waffle House?* How do you take your hash browns?
What's your favorite Kentucky Bourbon?
Do you ever feel ridiculous if you have to make reservations?
Hi Mr. Bourdain. What's the coolest shit you found?
Tony, you really inspired me to travel the world. I spent 6 months backpacking in Southeast Asia last year and always made a point to seek out restaurants you'd visited. Thanks for what you do.    That said, how do you feel about the impact of a small local restaurant appearing on your shows? Do you ever make a point to not reveal the location of a restaurant?    I remember visiting the Soup Lady in Saigon, and it had become a pretty big tourist hot spot. This wasn't the case everywhere you'd been, but the impact was definitely visible at times.
How's your BJJ training going?  How's the wear and tear on you from the training?
Hey Anthony, I love your shows I was just curious how you felt about the drug addiction situation that is going on, especially in the north east, at this time? Also your favorite dish to cook!
You monologue musings are fantastic. Do other writers assist or is it all from the brain of Bourdain? What do you do to get in the mood for writing? Any inspirations like Three Stooges and a martini? Nature? Poetry? Meditation? Mushrooms?Besides just practicing, how can someone become a better writer?
How is your food court/night market concept going? I'm super excited for it to open!
You were once quoted as saying "I understand there's a guy in me who wants to lay in bed, smoke weed all day and watch cartoons and old movies. My whole life is a series of strategium men's to avoid, and outwit, that guy."Could you share some of your stratagems for staying motivated and successful?
When will you be on Joe Rogan's podcast again? It's been too long and I'm starting to itch.

Big fan. What is your favorite place to eat in Chicago?
With regards to how you present yourself, you seem to maintain your punk rock philosophy in your professional life. Do you feel that this has been a hinderance at times? Is it possible to still do what you want and get ahead without compromising your ideals? Have you had to struggle with balancing the two at times? 
I love your shows, Anthony! My parents really got me into watching your awesome experiences. We travel thru Louisiana a ton for vacation/family and was wanting to ask what's your favorite cajun dish, and or favorite places to eat at while in New Orleans?
Never. I think it's my duty as a guest to always accept when my host is offering a good thing. When people are expressing themselves by what they offer, I feel it's my duty to if necessary take one for the team. It's what I call a "grandma rule"; I may not like grandma's turkey, but I'm in grandma's house, I'm gonna eat it. And I'm gonna smile and say I like it. I think that's just good manners. If you treat me like an idiot though and serve me crap with utter contempt. I can spiral into a serious depression for days and I will not be nice about it. This means you, Johnny Rockets.
I have an unholy and guilty attraction to fast-food macaroni and cheese. During the morning I get these horrendous cravings for Popeye's mac and cheese, and, uh, I will often disguise myself to try to slip into Popeyes. Or in a pinch, I will even go to the Colonel. There, I admit it. And I'm always recognized. I hate Twitter, because immediately they take a picture of me holding the evidence in my hand. It's like getting caught coming out of a porn shop with a video in your arms. Very embarrassing. 
What did Gordon Ramsay say last AMA? Foam?
You know the show I haven't been able to make yet, I'd like to do a show with Keith Richards. I'm working on it.  He's an enthusiast and a voracious reader.  He's very interested in British naval history. Maybe visiting the site of great British naval battles with Keith Richards, eat bangers and mash, cooking steak and pie together would be really fun That's something I'd really love to do. 
It's a tough question. I used to think Vietnam for a long time but lately... I'm leaning very much toward Italy! I like it there! I like the food. All those carbs are dangerous but Italy's a pretty nice place.
The Balvenie Doublewood 12-year is my go-to. Can't imagine what the 17-year is like. 
The sandwiches I crave most when I'm abroad are a pastrami on rye from Pastrami Queen, in New York. They do a sandwich at the restaurant at the Ace Hotel that is insanely delicious. It's this super crispy thin Sardinian style flat bread smeared with butter, chilis, and Bottarga, which is like salted tuna or mullet eggs. Doesn't sound so good but man it's good, especially with a cold beer. If that doesn't sound good to you, you're always safe with a great pastrami sandwich. We do it best in New York. 
Whoa! What have I made in my life? Wow! You've caused me to reflect on my utterly worthless existence. I mean, I give a cute answer, I assisted in the making of a 9 year old girl. A birdhouse, a chest of drawers, I really wish I could do those things. Everything I ever made with my hand, you know it was food, it literally turned to shit within 8 hours. So...wow...Oh my god! I'm really depressed now!
I dunno, I'm thinking about a French dip sandwich. They do those really well in LA. Or I dunno, I had tacos at Danny Trejo's place last night, so I might go back! They were good. 
I did not get to keep the knife. I bid on it online; it was put up for auction. I bid $5,000, but I saw that the lowest bid at the time, or the current high bid was something like $22,000. So needless to say I did not get that knife. I did, however, finally after a wait of longer than a year, I did get the opportunity to buy a Kramer knife. It is easily my most valued physical object that I own. It is a thing of beauty, and I'm just waiting to find food worthy of it, to use it. 
Twenty dollars?! I don't know. It might be a dirty water hot dog. You know? A bagel, with some butter, or no! A bialy. A toasted bialy with some butter, maybe at like Barney Greengrass, and then...what, do I die after spending this $20? Is that what happens? I mean, it's a pretty good value, maybe I'll have two bialys for $20. 
That was my one and only time at waffle house. It is a strange and exotic wonderland to me.  I really have yet to explore it fully. I was obviously thoroughly taken by it and cannot wait to go back. In fact, I have a secret urge, as a lot of my chef friends do, their secret urge is that they want cook at Waffle House. Just for a day to see if they can hack it because it's a tough gig. No, so I haven't been back, they don't have it in the New York/Tristate area unfortunately. If they did I would be hitting that place hard and often. They're wonderful. 
No, I do it without shame. I'm like super organized, I'm a list maker, and I have a schedule. I'm not one of those people who calls a restaurant at the last minute and says, "Do you know who I am?" I plan ahead. I do make reservations. And I always show up for them. You know, making multiple reservations in multiple restaurants on the same night at the same time and blowing off the other ones? That's right up there with being rude to your server, as far as restaurant crimes. They should keep a file on such people. In fact, some restaurants do! 
Coolest shit I ever found anywhere? I dunno, I mean the most cool shit per square foot is probably in Tokyo. You know, if you're looking for cool shit, your statistical likelihood of finding some is gonna be in Tokyo. Wow, what a tough question. Yeah, try Tokyo. 
I've been really lucky. I had one early injury as a white belt, but lately it's going really, really well. Feeling pretty good about leg attacks. They run in the family. I'm training out in LA at Cobrinha and at 5 Star, and really enjoying it. I'm very happy and I'm staying healthy so far. 
Oh the best! I was sucking up to the Archer people for like a year! I was on a podcast, I said I'd work for free, I said I'd bring them coffee on the set, back massages. I'm such an uber fan of that show. I went to Comic Con and I'd stalk them. I have seen them since at the Emmys, they won an Emmy this year. I went up to them, my character was last seen falling out of a helicopter but you don't see him hitting the ground! So maybe he lived because all I want right now is to be back on Archer. It was pretty much the high watermark of my career. After that, everything is meaningless. 
In my case, I write everything. I write every word. I have found that the only way I can write is early in the morning, first thing, stone-cold sober. So I will wake up, start writing, and write for as long as I can. I get stupider as the day goes on. I just get stupider and stupider as it gets later in the day. So, yeah, stone-cold sober, first thing in the morning. No other way for me. Nothing's gonna help me do anything but get distracted. If smoking weed is first on your list of things to do, you're probably not getting to #2. Not that there's anything wrong with that. 
I've noticed this question coming up again and again. No. I don't think it's a sandwich. I don't think a hamburger is a sandwich either. The fact that it's in between bread--the bread is a delivery system, a ballistic delivery system. It is not a classic sandwich, in my view. I mean, if you were to talk into any vendor of fine hot dogs, and ask for a hot dog sandwich, they would probably report you to the FBI. As they should. 
No. I'm not rolling with that guy, it hurts. He does not roll light, he goes really really hard. He's a neck cranker, by the way, and he's got bowling balls for arms, no visible neck, and he only rolls with no gi. So as much as I love the guy, I'll do anything with him; shoot animals in the brain, canoe trip, hot tubbing, whatever. But I'm not rolling with the guy. 
I love Girl & the Goat, I love Avec, I really like that restaurant. Who is it, Johnnie's Beef? Good stuff. Any Chicago hot dog is the finest in the land, love that product. I dunno, Girl & the Goat I really love. 
I'm 60 years old, I don't feel punk rock at all. 
I don't know why this made me laugh.   How do you serve somebody food with contempt? "Here we have a delicious dish that my my grandmother used to make me when I was in Italy and I'd be honored if you'd try it.   You stupid little bitch"
Damn you, Bourdain!!!!
You come out of both with sticky fingers and regret.
Seriously anyone who knows anything about you already knows about this vice. Whenever people give me shit about eating "crap food" like Taco Bell I always say "you know what? Anthony Bourdain LOVES Popeyes Mac 'n Cheese"So basically you're my enabler
The mole sauces of Oaxaca rival that of French cuisine in terms of labor and passion, if not even more labor. Dozens of ingredients go into their preparation and take an entire day to make, some even longer.I also feel the same about Vietnamese and Chinese cuisine. I mean I love that it's affordable for me but they put in a lot of work preparing stocks for pho or all those dishes for Dim Sum. 
I fucking love you 
> You know what kind of beer I like? I like cold beer.A man after my own heart.
In South Texas though, the best Mexican food are the hole in the wall restaurants. 
> This is frankly a racist assumption that Mexican food or Indian food should be cheap.You're awesome. Same goes for Chinese food in a lot of places outside of big cities in the US. 
Gluten is the MSG of tomorrow. 
Man. Last summer The Stones came into the restaurant I bartend at; a little family Italian place in Indianapolis.  They had the outdoor patio to themselves.  Everyone is super excited obviously, but I was slightly disappointed that Keith Richards wasn't at dinner.  Just can't say I met all of them, ya know. Side note, I asked McJagger's daughter's BOYFRIEND, "Miss, would you care for some pepper on your sala-shhiit. You're not a Miss." The dude looked like a lady.  Made Jagger laugh.
Young Italians are so slim compared to other Western countries, which makes no sense given all those carbs! And then they hit middle age and it catches up on them 
Can confirm, I'm Italian and I live in a pretty nice place. Lots of carbs, yes, and at least a food festival every other weekend. 
> Trumpian Cheeto tanIt's phrases like this that make you my favorite TV personality. 
>  Trumpian Cheeto tanI'm pretty sure Guy Fieri beat you to that one...
Thanks for the response! Charleston definitely sprang to mind too. 
Minneapolis you say?All aboard the karma train!
Purportedly, Korean barbecue is better in Los Angeles than in Korea!
Everytime I watch that episode I cringe for you. I remember it was your birthday and the line you narrated hangs so well in that moment."I've never had a nervous breakdown before, but I tell you from the bottom of my heart, something fell apart down there, and it took a long, long time after the end of this damn episode to recover."Thanks for being honest. It's why I watch everything you create.
Nashvillian here. The super hot stuff is almost always for tourists and drunk dudes on a dare. 
>Beirut, 2006, got a little dodgy.having to be evacuated by Marines makes this a touch of an understatement, I feel.
The 12, but 5 years more.
It's super smooth, I like the Caribbean Cask quite a bit as well.
Something tells me that Obama's really good with chopsticks.
The customers were secret service 
"Customers", right.
>Everything I ever made with my hand, you know it was food, it literally turned to shit within 8 hours. You never fail to make me laugh.
Everybody is replying to this about their fucking french dip and ignoring the fact that Tony was eating tacos with Machete himself.
I have a private security business that works with groups to assess hazardous locations, it has helped with insurance issues for some groups going into some African locations. Always willing to help write a proper assessment so the insurance folks don't overblow it by just reading headlines 
Any idea what happened to you as a child that sparked a lifelong phobia of Switzerland?   That's certainly one of the more unique phobias I've heard to date.
What if you have delicious friends?
That show is almost certainly written by hallucinating people
Even Top Chef is on the downslope.  They used to give the cooks hours to prepare perfect plates, and you really got a good sense of a cook's vision as well as technique.  Now they have 15 minutes to jerk off a corporate sponsor's esoteric ingredient or implement, or 2 hours to cater a party for 500 people (which party is inevitably some advertising event or function of the friends of the show's producers, basically an excuse for free catering).
What do you think of MasterChef Australia? 
Reading this (and all your other answers) in your voice makes this AMA top-tier.
You should see waffle house on christmas morning in Georgia..Delicious food, horrifying red-necks. 
People who don't respect reservations irk me to no end. I made a reservation for a large group of people, half those people don't show up until 45 minutes AFTER the reservation and get grouchy when the staff lets them know that there is another table after us in ~40 minutes.
> There is a restaurant in Vegas, I think it's called The Heart Attack Grill, where if you are over 350lbs you eat for free.Better alert /r/frugal! ;)
Now, to be fair, the owner of the Heart Attack Grill started his "theme restaurant" as a sort of commentary of the restaurant business and the fast-food industry. He is apparently a real health-nutter, yet what does it say about his commentary, that even someone like you, who knows about the ins and outs of the business is willing to accept the Heart Attack Grill as real and, more importantly, sincere.
I can confirm this. Biggest city in the world, but has cool shit everywhere. Even in random suburbs. Small parks, cool little ramen shops, shady (for Japan) alleys, vending machines everywhere. 
That stuff is fantastic.  I loved watching you make it on that guy's webcast on the Korea episode of Parts Unknown.  I was living in Korea when it came out and it was so exciting to see life there represented so well.
I'd mention the substance abuse. A busy, sustained rush is one of the most stressful things you can purposely put yourself through. It tends to end with some booze and pot...which can always escalate if you've got the personality for it. I've watched kitchen's (literally) kill more than one friend, it is certainly something to be aware of.
Damn, I love this. As an employer in a non-food related business I absolutely relate. Get in the door, show up on time, keep the bitching to a minimum and listen. You'll own the place some day.
To be fair, there's plenty of Archer people "hitting the ground" (so to speak) that come back anyway.Based on that logic alone, you could definitely grovel your way into another episode.
Have you ever eaten sheep face??  Is that real?
There, it's settled.
I guess you could say you have... Some Reservations.
> Girl & the GoatCurrently has 666 reviews.  So uh, does that goat have a name?  
Punk isn't dead, it just goes to bed at a more reasonable hour. 
Eat some fucking shit you stupid fucking bitch haha just kidding
Redditor for 30 minutes. I don't know what I expected... 
As well as cheese everywhere
Hell I'm surrounded by amazing food, there are more authentic mom and pop mexican and tex mex restaurants near me in NYC that I could visit if I went out *every night for a year.*But once or twice a year I'll still get some taco bell.  It's not mexican food, the only way it can be classified is it's just taco bell.   Every single time I do it though I'm always shocked by the price, I can't shake the knowledge that I'm paying nearly twice as much as a mom/pop, for worse quality food.  Worth it, if only for the childhood nostalgia.
> and coated with Himalayan sea salt transported from the mountains on the back of a Golden Yak Coated?  What kind of garbage are you slinging?  We all know that the salt must have the individual cubes selected and hand placed by a salinammelier or they're just shit!
> Himalayan sea saltlol
That.... actually sounds amazing.
My mother in law knows how to make mole from scratch.The "true" recipe, needs a burned tortilla, the tortilla is first hand made, dough and all.The recipe(s) includes at least 6 different types of chili, then toasted almods, chocolate, onion and garlic sauted in lard, tomatos, several herbs, chicken broth.Sometimes, the variants include peanuts, sesame seeds, squash seeds.They often mix a banana to help with the density and sweetness of the sauce.The preparation takes at least 4 hours, and it's always FANTASTIC.
My God, people don't know how hard it is to make shit for dim sum. If you make it at home it takes like *hours* to fucking wrap all that shit to feed a family. It's really disappointing that people think Mexican, Vietnamese, Chinese, etc. cuisines are only good when they come from cheap/dirty places. Those people should have way more recognition than they currently get, especially since there's depth to the food that's criminally underexplored. 
His ways are simple, that of a man at peace.
My go-to response to "What's your favorite beer?">My favorite beer is either cold, open or free. 
Serious. I live in city that is pre dominantly lower class Mexican/Latino. The Mexican joints here are some of my favorite. But when I go to work the next city over that is primarily White upper/middle class, the recommendations I hear from people to try are no where near the quality I get from the places in my city.
Best taco I ever had, dont remember the name of the place I think I was in Austin, ten years ago. It was late, i was hungry, I looked on Yelp. Only place open at that time down some back alley. They didnt speak a lick of English. Took a posters advice and got the 'Barbicoa Taco'. Three of them actually. SO FUCKING GOOD. I didnt know what barbicoa was but our friends had me convinced it was baby goat. 
IN all of the world, you are going to find the most unique flavors in the small hole in the wall joints. 
Good Chinese -REAL Chinese cuisine, not the americanized takeout variety- is amazingly underrated. So, so good.
Of today, you mean
Walking.  The thing that impressed me most about Italy was how many Italians walked places.  The only people who are typically seen walking in the states are the homeless, crazy, or destitute.
Have you ever seen Guy Fieri and Donald Trump in the same room?
For anyone confused, Charleston is in South Carolina. North Carolina has good food, too, but I think Bourdain meant SC.
I love how anyone says anything remotely good about mpls, and the Minnesotans come out of the woodwork.Minnesota is the best!
Kind of like my ex wife.  Except the hot part.
Had prince's when I was in Nashville a few years ago.  Got mild.  Still one of the hottest things I've ever had.  I ran out of milk to cool my mouth so we licked the white creme from Oreos to cool our mouths down. The chicken was wonderful the second day. 
It also made for a pretty fantastic and surreal episode.
Well, there are almost 50 thousand redditors in /r/Scotch that could probably guide you, not to mention the 28 thousand plus in /r/whiskey and 33 thousand in /r/bourbon, depending on your taste :)
I would say try getting a 12 year Glenlivet. It will be more expensive than a bottle of the vodka you drink in college, but less than a night out drinking. It also has a more mild taste for a scotch so it will probably taste better to someone new to scotch. 
Let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know how to use chopsticks. He knows EXACTLY how to use chopsticks.
You are right. They were most definitely all secret service agents.
Maybe his parents were insufferably neutral?
He's not joking?
Pair with fava beans and chianti?
> 2 hours to cater a party for 500 people (which party is inevitably some advertising event or function of the friends of the show's producers, basically an excuse for free catering).Are you serious? That is ridiculous!
There are cooking shows, then there is Masterchef Australia. Miles above the rest
This will sound stupid but he writes exactly how he speaks in real life (at least when he is on TV). When I read Kitchen Confidential, it felt like he was sitting across from me telling a story. 
Any morning at any Waffle House is always fun. 
They'll need many rice and beans to get there.
Me too! I was there for 10 days and every day was like a new adventure. Next time I'm going for a month. It's brilliant 
A Japanese friend recommended some shady alleys for us and it's funny how not-shady they were compared to other places
As I sit here drinking beer and smoking pot after my (non food related) stressful day. Had to lol But now I'm excited to make myself dinner. 
Yeah, this place is totally not my style - Been to 2 Ed's in the Chicagoland area and they both were just trite. Why would I pay for the privilege to be sassed during dinner, shit, might as well just have dinner with my family. 
I'm not surprised it closed. It got really lame after that fat lady sued them for calling her fat. 
I knew a girl who worked there and she was the sweetest most mild mannered quiet person I knew outside of work, she said it was really cathartic.
You might want to consult a doctor.
You're the problem! They are just regular thicker than normal chips seasoned by the hands of the animal control guy.
He is who we all inspire to be.
Damn, you should do a casual AMA sometimes.
My favorite Mexican restaurant is in a strip mall with all Mexican owned businesses. They are packed for lunch and dinner and it's all Hispanic workers and a few "locals" mixed in. Their food is killer. There is then a Mexican restaurant up the street and around the corner that is Tex-Mex at best. It's good if that is what you want and if you were to ask 10 people around here what the best Mexican food was, 9 would say the Tex-Mex place. Most people you ask about the other place and they either say that they never considered it or they didn't want to stop in because of where it was. 
Dude.  I'm not so sure about century eggs, duck tongues and jellyfish soup.  The authentic stuff can be pretty hardcore.  
Don't forget the New Yorkers, we walk everywhere. (People in DC, Boston, SF, Chicago, etc. all do a fair amount of walking too). Wait, were we included in the crazy? We're pretty crazy.
To be fair, have you tried driving in Italy? It's a death/dent sentence. 
Nc shout out for Asheville thought. Woot!
Yup, Anthony was here a while back. He sat at the riverdogs game with Bill Murray. And I am biased since I live here, but Charleston IMO has the best food in the U.S. It's hard to go anywhere in this city and eat a bad meal. If it's not high quality two things happen; the restaurant closes or they rehash their entire menu. 
It's not just Minneapolis. We come out of the woodwork for any part of minnesota that's mentioned.
Especially if you're Lebanese, like me, and remember those days all too clearly
I kinda find it surprising that /r/scotch has almost double what /r/whiskey does
My opinion is that a Bowmore 12 year is the best introduction to the wonderful world of scotch that there is.Glenlivet is a decent scotch, but it doesn't have enough action.  It's smooth, extremely drinkable, and will always have a spot in my collection.  However it doesn't touch on any of the smokey or peaty notes that truly make scotches stand out.Bowmore 12 year gives you a nice hint of those flavours, but not overly powerful or offensive.  Just my .02
Even better if it's some crusty old fart who has never heard of Bourdain. "Who?....who?.....yeah, whatever..."
"I have no strong feelings one way or the other". 
He is not serious. They have way more time (usually a day) than that and it's not 500 people.
It's always morning at Waffle House
If you go a month try to balance out city days with rural days. The small towns are every different and much quieter, but nice too. 
My favorite college pastime was coming home drunk from the bars with my buddy. 2am, we would go to his car and smoke some good bud, then we would go inside and cook something. Usually something simple like beer bread or homemade brownies or fudge. Sometimes grill. It was always really fun though... I miss you Mikey. 
Lol wait, people are *paid* to be dicks? And people *pay* to be treated like shit? This country is more fucked than I thought.
"i am sorry, you have incurable cheese dick"
Didn't this happen on reddit before where someone made a typo so horrendous it was the only time it appeared on the web? 
It's really really hard to find for sure. I live really close to the border and even still it's just made different in Mexico. 
Yeah, I have a lot of questions for massive_cock
I don't think Tex Mex is an inferior cuisine, it's just a different region.  Unfortunately it's impossible to find good examples outside of South/central Texas.  The best barbacoa I ever had was an unmarked white truck in San Antonio that was only open Saturday, only took cash, spoke zero English, and consistently had a line around the block until they sold out.  The meat was some of the most tender and flavorful I've ever had, served with warm fresh corn tortillas.  They could have tripled the price and it would still be a bargain.
Love a good century (pidan/preserved) egg in jook. They're only "preserved" for about 2 weeks despite their name.
New York City has the highest average step count of all US cities according to fitbit.  That's a fact I learned two days ago, and I'm pleased to be able to share it today.
In the US, we heard about what was going on but it wasn't made to be as big of a deal. I remember watching AB's episode of No Reservations and how the night before he was on rooftop bars with locals having a blast, carefree. The next morning they're running for their lives.He covered the situation better on a fucking cooking show than any other 24 hour news network. 
/r/whiskey is kind of a blanket sub that doesn't have much real purpose. Kind of like r/sports. 
"Who are all of these shmucks lining up outside my shop?""Dad, they're customers. Anthony Bourdain said you make the best sandwiches.""Course they're the best sandwiches. That's right there on the sign: best sandwiches. Can these people not read?"
There really is something special about coming home buzzed and firing up the grill at 230 in the morning.  
The restaurant Dick's Last Resort is the same way. They act like Dicks.  
Fart Bubbler, M.D.
/r/excgarated
Yes. /u/theoman333 created a word. Here's the comment:Because its excgarated, there's a cult like mentality. They encourage abstaining completely, where instead limiting consumption is more benefitial. They claim abstaining gives "super powers ". As a former nofapper I can that it's true, but hugely exaggerated. I don't think there's anything wrong with the subreddit, as long as u don't take it and its members too literally.
> salinammelierGoogle it. This thread is the only place it exists.
Here in Australia is it nigh on *impossible* to find an authentic, decent Mexican restaurant. We've resorted to learning all the recipes and making it ourselves, but I'd love to try the real thing!
I have... one question.
It's just so wonderfully walkable. If you decide that you don't want to take the subway and decide to walk wherever you want to go, getting there is actually safe. If I were to decide, living in the suburbs, that I wanted to walk down to the store, I have to stay right on the edge of the road and duck into the woods if I hear a car coming because there are absolutely no safe walking paths anywhere. You hop in a car or you fuck right off with the idea of going anywhere.
What!? I love sports! I like teams! I like to wath games where those teams score points  and the coaches coach the players. Man sports are the best
At least when you're at Dick's you're usually drunk enough not to care that they wrote about squirrel pussy on your paper hat. At least that was my experience. I love Vegas. 
Omg. How do you remember my username.  Seriously.  Gotta love the Internet. 
Not anymore, it's already spread to twitter. What a mighty virus we are all connected to.
It's like in Farenheit 451 where that girl goes walking everywhere and the main character thinks that walking is weird.
google fu. your new word was a /r/bestof post so it was actually pretty easy 
that douche on twitter used it out of context too.

Hey Daniel! What are you going to be for Halloween?
Not including Harry Potter, who is your favorite character in the franchise?
Someone asked me my favourite food: Cheeseburgers. And pizza, and stuff like that. Because I don't believe when people say anything else is their favourite food, I tend not to believe them. 
Daniel, did you keep anything from the set of Harry Potter?
If you had a Horcrux, what would it be?
Something I've been really impressed with lately is that it seems like all of the kids that grew up acting in Harry Potter ended up very grounded and intelligent (this came to mind in particular when I saw an excerpt of an interview where you questioned how quickly people sexualized Emma Watson as soon as she turned 18). Was there an environment that helped with that, or would you attribute that more to your parents, or something else?

Hi Daniel,Do you have a favorite song or musician at the moment?
Hi Dan! So you've done a lot of great dramatic work, but what I'm wondering is what else we can expect to see from you as far as comedy? I've thoroughly enjoyed the few times I've seen you take on comedic roles and bits and am hoping to see more!Thanks!
Hi Daniel! Welcome!What was your favorite scene to do from the Harry Potter movies?
How well do you feel Horns, the movie, stays true to the book?
Do you like toast? 
I'm late to this.  Either will get buried or you've stopped answering, but I'll try on the off chance. I absolutely love "A Young Doctor's Notebook".  I just get the feeling that working with Jon Hamm is amazing.  He seems like the kind of guy that brings out wonderfully different choices in other actors in scenes and they end up going in different directions.  I have a couple questions. 1.  What was working with Jon Hamm like? 2.  Have you thought of being a guest on Comedy Bang Bang?  For some reason, I see you as the perfect guest on either the TV show or the podcast version of it. 
Have you ever seen It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?

If an excentric billionnaire told you to pick a novel, any novel, to turn into a film or TV show with you in the lead role, he'd make sure writing, effects and all that are taken care of, all you need to do is pick one and act - which one would you want it to be?
Are you a cat person or a dog person?

Hi Daniel, My question isn't remotely related to literature, film, theatre or otherwise, my question is- what, in your opinion, makes for an ultimate sandwich? 
Would you rather fight 100 duck-size Elijah Woods or one Elijah Wood-size duck?
What's your spirit animal??
ohmygodohmygodohmygodmarry me?
What do you look for in a good script when you are being approached for a role?
Hi! Just wondering, are you a fan of Doctor Who?
I'm really crap at questions so; what did you have for breakfast this morning?
What research did you do for Kill Your Darlings? 
Rocking the beard good sir! Looks fantastic on you.Any plans for No Shave November?
Should I watch the Harry Potter movies? 
If the Harry Potter films get remade in twenty years and they offer you a role then who would you choose to play?
Just "Dan" is best. "Daniel" is fine, but I always sort of think I'm in trouble. And "Danny," I think, if you call yourself "Danny" you give everyone around you the right to sing "Danny Boy" to you ALL THE TIME, and it's a nice song, but once you've heard it 1,000 times, you don't want to hear it every time you introduce yourself to somebody. 
I suppose I would... I would remove the bullshit hierarchy from the film industry, because there are certain people who do my job, and also directors and producers, who seem to think the job they do gives them license to treat people who work for them badly, and there is no good reason for that, and it should not be tolerated.I know that if I ever get to direct, it will not be present anywhere on my set. 
George Clooney... Jennifer Lawrence... I just think they'd be really cool, Paul Rudd, I met him and was like "You're awesome!" I just want to work with people you can get on with, and you have a good rapport with, and those are definitely some of them. Also directors more than actors, whom I think "I want to work with them." So you know, people like the Coen Brothers, or Wes Anderson, Paul Thomas Anderson, Christopher Nolan, again, it's directors i suppose I get more excited about than actors. 
well, which Hedwig? There were 3 or 4. I imagine they are all still living with Gary Gero, who was the head of the animals department on Potter. I imagine he is looking after them all somewhere. I imagine they are all at the home where actor owls retire to. 
Um.... Well, growing up, my favourite comic book character was Daredevil, so Daredevil was great, but there was also, like, if I could be one character from all of literature it would be... Woland from my favourite book, wait no, I change my answer, I would be Behemoth the cat from my favourite book which is called The Master and Margarita, and he is like, a 5 foot tall black cat who shoots a revolver. 
That's a *GOOD* question. I don't know yet, I haven't narrowed it down, but because I've very recently - like within the last 6 months - watched the original Star Wars movies, I'm like a brand new Star Wars fan, so I might go with something Star Wars related! And I got to go out to the Star Wars set recently, because a lot of my friends are working on it crew-wise.. so something Star Wars related, but not sure yet.Any suggestions? I'm leaning towards Boba Fett, but I haven't found a good enough costume yet. 
Probably Sirius. Like I always loved the character, and then Gary's portrayal of him I thought was perfect. Or Lupin, really. Any of the characters my dad used to hang out with, other than Wormtail. There was always something bout those two guys I loved a lot. 
Hispanic guy here:Tamales.  There's really nothing that tastes better than a good tamale.  Not one of those weak Texas tamales that are the size of a Vienna sausage either.  I'm talking about tamales made by poor people in California & Mexico.  Tamale quality is inversely proportional to the standard of living of the people making them.  I don't know why.
Oh yeah, of course. I wasn't going to leave there without grabbing a set of glasses!
*WOW.*Um... that's a really good question. First of all, congratulations to you for asking me a Harry Potter question I have NEVER been asked before, that is *not* easily achieved!I would say... I was gonna say my iPod, prolly put it in that, but I would put it inside an album on the iPod, so you'd have to open that album. So I somehow want it to be connected to a particular album that means something, like Ziggy Stardust. So that's how I'd want to do that. 
> all of the kids that grew up acting in Harry Potter ended up very grounded and intelligentExcept for Crabbe.
Um, the Colbert Report. Mystery Science Theater 3000. Yeah, like I JUST discovered them, and I am *obsessed* at the moment! They're amazing yeah! And there's also an English show, called The Thick of It, which is kind of a show - Armando Ianucci who does VEEP, it was the political show that spring boarded him to start working here, and it's some of the best, funniest television that's ever been made. 
Wonderful. I mean, he was just such a sweet man. You know... kind of relentlessly charming with women, I think I'm pretty sure I saw him flirting with female journalists at press conferences, I remember being a young child in awe of it... but yeah, he was a legend, and so to have been able to work with somebody of that generation, which was an incredibly important generation of actors for Britain, is amazing. 
Hmmm.I suppose I'm trying to... I'm trying to care less what people think of me, and the way I have done that, very successfully the past few months now, is *not* look at stuff on the internet. That is the key. 
He really does! Um, and, er, he also owned at one point, at one point he owned llamas and a hovercraft, you heard correctly, hahaha, and a 1950's chevy pickup, he had a collection of weird and wonderful things at his house. 
The villain. 100%. I think it's generally more interesting, and honestly, more what I'm suited for, to be honest. I don't see myself necessarily - I mean, I know there was a lot of action in Potter and I liked those sequences, but I don't think of myself as a natural action star. 
I mean, I... to me, it's not a... to me I absolutely think I would be in Gryffindor! But there's never any doubt of that for me. Yeah. I like, maybe I'm just biased because I played one for so long, but I could never picture myself in any other colours. 
*YES*!Just write that movie! And absolutely! 
Plot twist: It was Toby Maguire the entire time.
So sort of like the Departed but with shorter guys?
Why are we not funding this?
Dang that's the first I'd seen that clip. That's some Hugh Laurie level American accent.
Can they be dead?Okay.Well, uh, I would say, um: this is hard. Probably John Lennon, cuz that'd be awesome, and, uh, Tom Lehrer, who's a comic songwriter whom I'm obsessed with, yeah, and what's an all-time dinner fantasy party without Einstein? So Einstein, *yeah*! and probably Keith Richards, yeah, to liven everything up.  
Um, we listened to heavy metal, basically. That was it. Yeah! And because the two guys that were doing the makeup, Mike McCarthy and Mike Fields, they were both big metal heads, and I mean, the actual process -they made it *so* easy - the horns themselves only took about 20 minutes to put on, and even some of the more extreme makeup that we had near the end only took a couple of hours, so you know, I had it easier than a lot of actors do. And yeah, so Metallica, Megadeth, and what was the other band we listened to loads of... *shit*... can't remember it'll come back to me. 
Browsing this AMA, not answering it.
VERY important. To be honest, if Alex Aja and Joe Hill are happy with my performance, then I'm happy with it! Those are the two people I'm thinking about most, and talking to most, about my thoughts on the character and my approach to it. 
Motherfucker ain't need to say nothing. He thought "I'ma go for a smoke with nine dogs" and  that motherfucker went for a smoke with nine fucking dogs. He's a doer. I want to be like that. I'm gonna go buy some cigarettes. And some dogs. 
I haven't been approached! And I don't know - haha- I don't know what I would do. My lack of Game of Thrones knowledge was revealed in an interview a while ago. I totally would side with the Starks, though, because their symbol is a wolf. 
I've been shown that meme by a few friends, and obviously there are quite a few Harry Potter related memes and jokes and things, you see these things, and I have to say that one really made me laugh! It made me enjoy my name way more than I ever have before. So obviously Daniel Radcliffe beats Daniel Boringcliffe 100% of the time. 
Not really.Even as a kid, I hadn't the full scope of the Harry Potter phenomenon, hadn't really, ever, made an impression on me I guess? Obviously I'd read the first couple of books, but I wasn't as into it as a lot of my class was, so no, I could never have imagined it was as big as it was. I think maybe it's only now that I'm really starting to get a fuller sense of how wide-reaching it was, and how many people's lives it affected, which is very cool. 
I do. Yes, I definitely do. 
*YEAH.*I love that show. 
Um... I suppose the worst thing is that because I was a child actor, you get a lot of questions about like, you know, you get a lot of, for a while is that child actors were perceived as bratty and obnoxious, so you come up against that quite a bit. And the best thing, is, obviously, being mistaken for Elijah Wood. 
Yeah! The Shining is probably my favourite, and Straw Dogs, and tell you what, just because it has a nostalgic place in my heart - ANACONDA. 
Oh.I think, again, and I'm sorry, it's like the third time I've referenced it in this AMA, but I would go with The Master and Margarita, because it has never been done as well as it could be, so I am hoping I will meet that eccentric billionaire at some point. 
Um, I don't really drink much tea! If I do, it's with a little bit of milk and no sugar. But in terms of breakfast... I mean, um, my ideal breakfast would probably be eggs benedict with a large bowl of cereal brand - it's stuff called CrunchyNut, yeah, which you *can* get in America, but you really have to search for it, but it's an English cereal, and it's the best. With milk, oh yeah. No fruit, don't be silly. Just basically eggs, bacon, bread and cereal in any form is my ideal breakfast. 
Um... I would say: Oooh! I would say a few different types of cheese, maybe like, a gruyere in there, with some cheddar as well, you have to have some meat, if it's not bacon it should be Parma ham or something like that, maybe a few different types of ham, in fact, and then ideally some sort of brioche-bun thing... some sort of brioche-y type bread would be ideal. TOASTED! Toasted, absolutely! It's all got to be melting into each other. 
I mean, that is actually very difficult.I would probably try and fight the huge duck. Because I think that I could sort of... try, if I could break it, then I could have the giant duck as my steed! So I think i'd go for that, because 100 tiny Elijahs, they are going to be very hard to control, I feel like that would be the last scene out of Toy Soldiers or something like that. 
I would definitely say a wolf. 100%. I've been obsessed with them since I was very young, yeah. A grey wolf, to be specific. 
Despite being English, I am not, I'm afraid. It just passed me by. It was never one of the things I was into as a kid. So I'm sorry, Who fans. 
Nothing, actually. I didn't! I just got up and started doing interviews. 
I read Alan's diary, and just tried to watch as many interviews with him as I could. But because I was playing him at 17, there wasn't any footage of him at that point. So the diary was really the most helpful resource as to who he was. 
Hehe!*YES,* you should.Personally, you know, I would - I'm biased, because I don't like looking at pictures of my young self, like other people looking at their young selves, so you can skip the first few if you want, but I think they started to get really really good. I would say watch them, but you know, I'm biased. 
Production Assistant here. I would really like that.
Who doesn't want to work with Jennifer Lawrence?
> I imagine they are all at the home where actor owls retire to. Assisted Living Tree-hole.
Have you considered replying in your American accent, "No, sorry. I get that a lot."?
Best book ever. Bulgakov is a genius. Read his play Days of the Turbins! 
Your dad really is James Potter!?!?
ahahaha what the fuck did you come here just to talk about tamales?
you should've kept the sword too
Not even your nimbus 2000? 
Just don't let your soul upload to iCloud or everyone will have it...
Wait, so if we make digital horcruxes then they can be particular files on a system? Oh man, all my days of hiding, uhh, files on the family computer can finally to use!Also smart move putting it into an album that nobody has the heart to delete. And will just deleting it work or will it need to be an extra powerful delete, like Strongbad-style?
You and Elijah Wood need to be in a movie together where you play the same role, and just swap out at random points. No "gag," just simply switching out with you and Elijah.You can be in the same movie as Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg, doing the same thing.
I wish I could fully express just how grateful and relieved I am that the cast I've adored since childhood grew up to be just as strong and respectable people as the characters they portrayed!
The Thick of It is so great, and it lets you watch the newest Doctor Who with such a delightfully different view of Peter Capaldi.
As much as I liked all the films, Dumbledore was never quite right after Richard Harris died.
For a second I thought you were going to say you learned to play the guitar and you and Gary formed a band. 
Isn't that exactly what the Weasleys do in the books? Collect all sorts of weird muggle things?
Seeing you as a villain would be excellent! It's always fun to see someone  you've always viewed as a heroic character play a completely different persona. Off the top of my head, seeing Benedict Cumberbatch go from Sherlock to Khan was really cool.
Don't worry, the Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.
Congratulations, you are now a moderator of /r/Gryffindor
> birthdayIt was a deathday party you filthy casual.
I hate that Peeves never got an appearance.
Let's do this!
Because you haven't set up a Kickstarter campaign yet silly!
>I used to be really into WWF and I would play with wrestling action figures and give them American accentsI don't consider myself a needy person. But I need to watch Daniel Radcliffe play with wrestling action figures while narrating it.
He sounds a lot like Aaron Paul.
>liven everything upI see what you did there. 
An orange peanut?
"Because my life is dope, and I do dope shit."
You need to buy Daniel Radcliffe too.
> side with the StarksOh you poor dear.
And I suppose I should use this an opportunity to thank whomever made that particular meme, because it really is very good. 
Daniel Radcliffe as Billy Pilgrim. I'd pay to see that, yes. 
Oh my God, can we get him to play a role? Could he be, like, Charlie's British cousin who does even dirtier work for even less money, but people think it's charming in Philly because he has a British accent?
Where the hell is /u/Shitty_Watercolour when you need him?!
Damn it, Tina.
Apple, apparently.
That would just make him Elijah Wood in which case they would still want an autograph
Fun fact: The movie *The Woman in Black* that Daniel stars in is a remake. And, in the original one, the guy who plays the character that Daniel plays in the remake was the guy who plays James Potter in the HP movies!
DON'T BREAK IMMERSION
And Hegwig
Or *do* upload it, so you'll have infinite backup horcruxes.
Then it is released under the guise of a new U2 album and pushed to everyones library.
And Michael Cera and Jesse Eisenberg!
Fuck me, what I would give to see this.
Alan Rickman seems so cool
Alan Rickman cracking up behind Gambon, oh my god. 
I love dumbledoors fucking reaction 
With Alan Rickman on the Azkabanjo?
I would murder a hobo to sit in with that band. 
/u/chooter working her transcription magic once again!
In the original draft of Chamber of Secrets, Ron and Harry rode Arthur's bewitched llamas to Hogwarts when they missed the train.
Not slytherin eh? Better be....slytherin!!!!
Pretty sure that was a given even before this response.
Harry Potter himself does not know the books as well as we do... is this is our sign that we're dedicating a little too much of our time and brainpower to fandom?  Or just our sign that we need to harass Dan until he reads the books more and gets his facts straight?
A Daniel Radcliffe impression of Jim Ross would be pretty awesome...
Bloody hell, movie-Dumble looks like he's utterly roided out that evening.
I didn't realize they switched actors halfway through the comic and was confused. 
Sweet pic of Jony Ive
anyone not getting the reference, this is Dave Chappelle on Kanye West when they first met.
What's the current market rate for one Daniel Radcliffe? 
Yeah, but this is the boy who *lived.*
Well, if the internet has taught me anything, 100s of people will take credit for creating this meme.And on that note, I was the creator...
I don't get this reference, but you're having an upvote anyway since my name is Daniel and my wife (who slaps my ass to no end) is named Tina.
I think Nolan is probably bored with Batman by now unfortunately :(
Silly! That's Elijah Wood.
**" I AM HARRY POTTER"**
And my axe!!! Oops, wrong movie.
Best horcrux:1. Take nude selfie2. Make it your horcrux3. Upload to iCloud4. Set an utterly moronic password, like abc1235. Enjoy immortality
And John Cena and Potato Salad!
Keira Knightly and Natalie Portman will play the female lead.
There'll be online competitions where you can give your view of who is playing the part right throughout the various scenes.Just for shits and giggles they should also reshoot the movie with the other actor doing the scene, and the dvds will have a random combination of scenes
He's great in Galaxy Quest. 
He should have gone full snape"...hilarious."
you mean Snape and the Azkaband
For those not familiar with the vagueries of Reddit, this means Victoria from Reddit is either in the room with or on the phone with Daniel and is transcribing his answers.
This would be so much better. Right up until the llamas get beaten into a bloody pulp by the Whomping Willow.
*dumbledore falls off tower*GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY! GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY! HE KILLED HIM! AS MERLIN AS MY WITNESS, HE IS BROKEN IN HALF!
Bah gawd! He had a family!
Daniel Boringcliffe =(
Didn't know the vice president of Microsoft was an actor
Very Radcliffe *
**"AND I WILL FUCKING BRING THIS RING TO MOUNT DOOM**"
No, no, he was in Lord of the Rings, remember? He was that hobbit with the ring.
All managed by the Hacker Who Must Not Be Named. ^^^4chan
Remind me to change the combination on my luggage.
And Russell Crowe and Gerard Butler
That would explain why I wasn't aware, but great to hear he's doing well!
It's weird but when people mention Alan Rickman, the very first thing that pops in my head, just the initial mental picture, is him as Hans Gruber in Die Hard
daniel's not typing his answers?
"CAAAAAARLLLL!!!!"
Elijah Wood can play Daniel Radcliffe, and Daniel Radcliffe will play the crazy Daniel Radcliffe fan. 
Awesome, I never knew Jesse Eisenberg did a movie with Michael Cera
>*dumbledore falls off tower*RKO! RKO OUTTA NOWHERE!
Thanks Dadcliffe
**"YOU'VE GOT MY LIGHTSABER"**
Who IS this 4Chan?
*Why does he wear the mask?*
Change the combination on your luggage.
This is getting expensive
Don't let Broadway fool you though. He also owns a hovercraft and an ice cream truck that he stocks and gives away for free to children.
The Sheriff of Nottingham, for me.
No, he is not. Though anything posted here is exactly what he says
Well, I flew to hogwarts... and then I landed in a tree... and then the tree started beating me up... so I stabbed it 37 times in the chest.CAAAAAAARL
Read your comment before clicking on that link, I spent way too long trying to figure out which one was Michael Cera.
This insult doesn't even make me madcliffe.
/r/toosoon
Adolf Hitler and Charlie Chaplin
Now this pun thread is just sadcliffe.
