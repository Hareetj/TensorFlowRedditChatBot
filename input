For anyone who is in Florida and was considering donating blood or plasma, come back on Tuesday to your local blood drives since they have already reached the need volume for today. So come back on Tuesday when the next round is needed.
I think the team at Orlando Regional Medical Center deserve some recognition here. My hat goes off to anyone working there during the time this tragic event was occurring, especially the nurses and surgeons. It takes a lot of gut to be able to keep cool and perform your duties on people so frightened, while under the stress of knowing that people have already died as a result of the event. Stay strong everyone.
As someone who witnessed the 26/11 shootings in India, I know what shooting at a crowd in a cramped space feels like. This is the saddest thing I've read today, I stand with with you from Mumbai, lots of love.
Still unable to locate my friend. I've called the hotline set up and had a friend drive to the hamptons inn where family center is set up and they are still not releasing any information at this time. I've called Orlando regional and other hospitals and I get nothing. 
So I imagine that Obama will give a televised speech about this shooting some time today? It would make sense since this shooting is now (unfortunately) historic in its death toll. 
Should we random acts of pizza the blood donation centers?
The shooting at PULSE is devastating. Two of my friend's family members were there and thankfully got out (one of them was shot, but will be ok). If you are in the Orlando area, PLEASE consider donating blood. They are in desperate need of O positive, O negative, and AB plasma blood donors.
My brother was club hopping and was on his way there but stopped to get some food with friends, he was five minutes away before it happened but decided to go home instead. It's so fucking crazy how close some things are to being completely different, i'm so grateful.
My best friend lives right around the corner from Pulse and spent the night hiding in her closet because she was hearing gunfire but didn't know where it was coming from or what was going on. I can't even imagine how terrifying it must have been for everyone there. 
Worst mass shooting in US history
From France, be strong. All our thoughts to you and your loved ones. 
I wonder what the police tactics were on this one? I hear the gunman took hostages and started executing. I'll be so pissed if it's a repeat of Columbine where the police waited outside for hours while those kids were getting executed. 
I live 500 meters from the concert hall called "bataclan" in Paris. So I kind of been there. Lost friends, got friends badly hurt. I have nothing smart to say. This is absolute horror. I stand with you from Paris as you guys were with us when we got hurt. Fuck those murderers. Love will prevail. Damn this is so sad. Sorry for not making sense. 
homophobic shooter?
This story hits so many buttons.Domestic terrorism.Radical Islamic terrorism.Muslim immigrants.Religious attacks on gays.Guns probably legally purchased.Assault rifles.Latino population.Florida gun laws.Another mass shooting.Media spin.Its like every hot button issue of the day rolled into one horrible tragedy.
Did [edited to remove name], that dumb fucking son of a bitch, not understand that this is going to make people at large *more* sympathetic to homosexuals and *less* sympathetic to Muslims? It's not even the horrific, utterly senseless loss of life, it's that even from his perspective, his actions will have the complete opposite effect of what he set out to do in the longer run. He wasn't just an evil fucking idiot, he was an *incompetent* evil fucking idiot. My sympathies go out to everyone affected by such a horrible tragedy. Love yourself and each other.
**LETS STOP TALKING ABOUT r/news, AND START TALKING ABOUT INFORMATION AND THE 50 PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES THIS MORNING.**
It breaks my heart that pride month will always have this bleak reminder of how much more we have to fight for. This was a vile homophobic act by a maniac. My heart goes out to the families and friends of those who were murdered, and everyone involved. I hope they find peace amongst the pain. 
Obama sounded tired, defeated and almost numb to this type of situation. 
This is incredibly sad.  This is the deadliest US mass shooting since Virginia Tech.
If 9/11 happened today, would it be censored by Reddit?
I live about 45 minutes from Orlando and have sooooo many friends who frequent this nightclub.I am praying right now. Not sure if any of them were there during this, but such a horrible moment... 
Hello there r/news
Fuck the mods at /r/news
Not only blood, but these centers need water bottles and snacks as well for the large influx of people donating blood. If you can't donate blood, think about donating food and drinks. 
These medical personnel are definitely deserving of recognition. I just found out my cousin was a victim of the shooting. He's currently in critical condition and has massive abdominal injuries. It's a small comfort to know he's in the care of people who are doing all they can to help. 
When explaining the events of today to my 11 year old I made a point of emphasizing the ratio of good people to the one evil. That many good people; people who care are working very hard to help and care for those hurt.  
this is something I had never even considered and it gives me chills to think about it
I remember reading a similar description after the Paris attacks, I think. It's inevitable in this age of communication ease & social media and it's so sad how many of those calls and messages will never get an answer.
Correct, I believe he will speak at 1:30 eastern time. 
Yes! Not only blood, but these centers need water bottles and snacks as well for the large influx of people donating blood. Random acts of pizza is an amazing thing to do right now if you can't donate blood. 
California Pizza Kitchen was handing out stacks of personal pizzas to people waiting in line at Waterford Lakes when I was waiting to donate.
Donation centers are at capacity for the day, but they're asking everyone to donate as the week goes on. 
sikhs are bro tier
I live right down the street from the club myself, absolutely crazy, I'm glad your friend is safe.
I literally live 300 feet from the club. Went out of town for the weekend to visit my family and woke up to this madness. It's insane.
Holy shit. That's so incredibly fucked up of them. 
I would say he wasn't thinking of the other people.He wanted to keep the shooter away from him.
I feel bad for all the nice people who get tangled up in this shit.
That's so sad...
Please make sure your friend knows that there are *many, many* Americans -- including in places where he might least expect to find them -- who understand that not all Muslims subscribe to the ISIS interpretation of Islam in the same way there are many Christians who do not subscribe to the beliefs of those so-called Christians who would discriminate against the LGBTQ community.  
It's now officially the worst shooting in US history. :(
And I'm hearing about in on /r/AskReddit . Reddit is pathetic now. I used hear about breaking news as soon as it happened. Now my wife is beating me to the punch with her Facebook feed. FUCKING FACEBOOK.  I don't know what the problem is but the admins need to get their shit together, or I'm going to have to find another site to get my news from. 
Fuck terrorism. 
And completely censored on Reddit...
Merci
An off-duty officer was working in the club, exchanged gunfire with the suspect when he began shooting on the main floor at approx 2 AM. Two additional officers responded, initiating the hostage-taking and subsequent standoff. 
Unfortunately, it's looks like SWAT waited outside for over 3 hours while he executed everyone inside.  They said it was a hostage situation while people inside were sending out texts that he was rounding up and killing everyone.
News said a police officer opened fire on him as he was going into the club at around 3am, they didn't go in after him until 5am because he had hostages.  Meanwhile accounts are coming out from inside saying during this time he was lining people up killing them anyways.  2 hours wasted while people still being killed.
God that is awful. I'm glad you and your friend are okay. What happened today was terrible, I hope we can one day live in a world where these kinds of tragedies don't occur. I definitely can't relate the kind of fear the victims and their loved ones must have felt, but I hope they can get through this. 
As an American who is appalled by this type of violence, thank you. I am terrible sorry for your lose and about what happened in Paris. 
These are kind words. Heartwarming in times like these. > Damn this is so sad. Sorry for no making sense. It's okay, you're French, so whatever. 
This comment brought tears to my eyes. I'm sorry you had to experience such horrific terror in your lifetime. 
The shooter's father has apparently said that he had become angry after seeing two guys kiss in Miami.  So yeah, seems like he hates gays and this was a hate killing.  
While it's too early to tell, I'd lean towards that was part of their MO last night. 
When I see something I don't like i don't get "murdery".
He was a U.S born citizen wasn't he?
> Decapitation: Leave alone. Do not pick up. That's... morbid. 
These  images are confusing as hell.
These are very hard to read through, I get lost halfway through each page and the graphics are confusing.
Thanks. Fwiw we do have "newsworthy" megathreads here time to time, hence the specific flair and purple coloring in the header. Robin Williams passing was our first "Breaking News" megathread, with Muhammad Ali passing being the most recent. There's also a link in the sidebar allowing you to filter only breaking news stories (along with our other flairs like "Serious" and "Modposts"). 
Hijacking, unsubscribe from r/news
Seriously, I first saw this on Facebook after being on reddit for 30 minutes. That's never happened before.
No joke, that subreddit is a warzone right now...
Yeah, that was nuts.
Yep, nice job on the mods.  
Probably is. How many times has he had to make the same speech during his presidency? Gotta get disheartening 
On r/news? Mos def.
I got banned for mentioning that the shooter is Muslim.
That is a *great* recommendation that I never would have thought of. 
Also thank you to the amazing transfusion service laboratory technologists! 
Always look for the helpers.  - Mr Rogers
Do not forget to unsubscribe.
After what happened this morning, that's not even shocking.
18th time he will have done this during his presidency. Shame. 
Cookies come to mind. And if you're in the area, you can make those! My thoughts go out to everyone impacted by this.
Target donated liked 500 cases of water, and the publix in South Downtown did the same. 
For real. I was talking to a Sikh guy in my area once, and he told me that Sikhs wear turbans and keep small knives (kirpans) as an indicator to those around them that the Sikhs are there to help those in need.
I'm glad you're safe.  Something like this, happening in my own neighborhood... I couldn't even imagine.
Well that was officially the most reluctant upvote I've ever given.
I feel like there really is no "right" thing to do in that situation, especially given the fact that you would be in save my ass mode. I don't how i feel about it, but i can Definately see rationale.
People will say "you can't blame them." But I am totally blaming them. 
It really, really sucks.As someone who has personally lost friends (both muslim and non-muslim) to extremists, to see so many people blame our entire population hurts a lot.
For some reason, that I can't even explain, when I heard that the Orlando Mayor declared a State of Emergency it really sunk in. It's terrible, but you have to give all of the rescue works/police extreme credit. From the things I read the shooter had no plans on letting anyone in the club live. It's something that just makes you feel numb and sad. Thoughts are with all the people affected by this tragedy. 
The mods censored it. This is the first time Ive seen both liberals AND conservatives so pissed about something. Both the liberal subs AND Donald Trumps subs both have the censorship as their top post right now. Not the shooting itself, but how the mods of /r/news censored it. First time Ive ever seen both sides this pissed about the same thing. 
I wouldn't be surprised if r/news loses default status over this. They are censoring discussion of a serious tragedy because of their political views. Though it doesn't matter *why* they're doing it, the fact is that THE default news subreddit is not allowing discussion of the absolutely most newsworthy event right now. I suspect the admins will do something in response.
Bizarre that it can found here in an askreddit thread - unbelievable 
Sadly, we know too well what you're going through. 
I heard that since incidences like Columbine, the strategy is to rush the shooter(s) with SWAT asap rather than playing it out.  
To be fair hindsight is 20-20 and the police might not have had all the info on what was happening on the inside, I'm sure it was very chaotic and they didn't want to charge in and make a mistake
Thanks for your kindness.  we need to stick together. 
Angry about two guys kissing in Miami? You may as well get angry about the sun shining in Miami. What a fucking stupid crazy evil sonofabitch. 
possible my ass
His parents weren't. Media likes controversy, don't forget. Next week is going to be really shitty for me -.-
i love how the character in the graphic is standing there awkwardly like 'so....yeah'
/r/news is currently losing 250 subscribers a minute
 Hijacking endorsed, UNSUB FROM /r/NEWS
My girlfriends parents (Seniors) heard about this before I saw it on Reddit. 
What happened?
Reddit says its the front page of the internet. The fact we have to get info from non news subs makes me question that. This is how you piss off users, both acounted and casusal readers. Makes me think ill go somewhere else for the next big news story. 
CAN SOMEONE GET MOS DEF ON THE PHONE? I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HE MAKES OF ALL THIS
What the fuck is wrong with /r/news and is there anything we can do about that mod on a power trip
Can you recommend any good alternatives? 
Out of the loop and /r/news mods. Mind giving a summary? 
I lived in a commuter town in New Jersey for most of my life.After the 9/11 attacks, there were several cars that stayed in the parking lots at the local train station. Their tires would get more chalk marks every day as the parking attendants noted their time not moving. Tickets would accumulate in the windows. And eventually it became clear that the people who owned those cars weren't ever coming home again. They'd get towed, or claimed by family members or next of kin.Eventually, they'd all gone.And I'm not sure which was worse, seeing them there, or seeing the empty lots after.
It seems as though every time this event comes up on Reddit, I learn of a new thing to bring me to tears, but somehow this did me in worse than anything ever has. The thought of being a firefighter, and knowing what that sound is, standing there and hearing so many of them, and you're totally helpless. I just cannot imagine what that must have felt like. 
As someone who has participated in the planning and tactical side of things, they have to have a plan.  Rushing a building full of civilians and getting in a call of duty style gun battle would make things infinitely  worse. People won't just stay down, you'd have gun fire, people running for cover, running right through the line of fire, the gunman just starts blindly firing, things really go south.  3 hours seems forever, when you armchair qb it, but from initial call, to resolution is an acceptable span of time in my mind. 
On Facebook someone posted a video of a health care worker reading the patients they received through out all of Orlando. Unfortunately my friend Frank is not on that list. My heart is heavy. Thank you Reddit for your kind words. 
It's visible how much he has aged mentally and physically throughout his presidency.
We could always order stuff from Amazon Prime Now for them. Get them what they need.
I dunno how their badass hats are gonna help but the thought is appreciated. 
I'm not even trying to be insensitive. As a gay man, this is terrifying to me. It's going to make me think twice about being open about my orientation to anyone who isn't a very close friend.
According to the edit, the alleyway was already filled with people piling on top of each other to get out a hole in the fence. I'm choosing to believe that guy barricaded the door to save the lives of the people he was witnessing, clamoring to get out of a fence.
Because the guy had gay hysteria?  Holy crap
Unsubbed /r/news . May I request everyone to please do the same and teach those biased mods a lesson. Throw their subreddit into the garbage.
Was reading about this about 2 hours ago, went to do other things, my friend told me the death toll is up to 50 now, went back on reddit to read about it and had to keep scrolling down and down and down...
Russia got a lot of shit for the (likely) carfentanil / remifentanil gas used in the moscow theater hostage crisis of ~~2012~~ 2002. The gas itself was probably responsible for the deaths of many hostages, but a coordinated response team with naltrexone / medics with bag masks, especially in a young, relatively healthy population (not the food / water deprived hostages in the moscow theater), could become a viable strategy, especially if the assumption is going to be that hostages will die anyway.  
FBI seems to be indicating there were ties to terrorism as well, so it may have been a planned attack
"Hey man, I know this looks bad but you'll be fine. You just gotta keep your head up."
Mods started nuking everything once FBI confirmed he was Muslim.
WHERE IS JA?!?
UNSUBSCRIBE FROM /r/news !!
Every other sub. r/askreddit at this point. Why subscribe to something that isn't gonna do its job anyway?
I assume the families didn't have to pay the tickets right?
Can you imagine him being woken up at 4 o'clock this morning and what must have been going through his head. I mean when I get woken up in the middle of the night and it's bad news there's a limited amount of things that I think it might be. But as president of the United States oh my God could be anything.
Amazon should engineer a disaster relief button on their app where organizations like Red Cross and Blood Donation centers can create a wish list for anyone to buy and send to them. 
The turban is worn to show that the person wearing it is a Sikh. So that everyone who see can see that said person is a Skih. 
I'm not sure it was the shooter's intent, but that's literally the definition of terrorism.
They weren't at first. The story was on the front page when it started to come out but as soon as they found out who the shooter was they started censoring the hell out of everything.
they've been doing it for a while with anything to do with radical Islamic terrorism and right side politics in general.  IIRC there is a major conflict of interest with some of the mods.  They might just be trying to reduce the chance of a witch hunt but it sure as hell looks like censorship to me.  
I will unsub from /r/news but are there any better news subs? 
I can see they're actively removing threads for it...
The gas was a good idea but the execution of the whole event was awful. They didn't have enough medication to treat everyone affected by the gas and they let people choke to death unconscious. 
Did Eddie make it out?
I strongly suspect this is an ISIS-fan terrorism attack. He probably had no actual ties to ISIS, just wanted to do "his part" to ... uhh what is it they want to do? Well killing gay people probably looked like a good way to help the global effort to this guy. 
Well that is a good idea or you would have to rename it r/partiallycensorednews
Actually though, shout out to the /r/askreddit mods because this was a better thread than the ones at /r/news.
Shit, I learned about this shooting from /r/smashbrosWhen the Super Smash Bros subreddit is breaking news before /r/news, something is *seriously* wrong.
We need a new news sub
I'm sure you have to become somewhat desensitized. You see a lot of shit in 8 years as Prez, at this point it's probably a sigh and an audible "fuck"
Well I feel like out of all of the presidents Lincoln had more reason than any to look that way.
I think that Lincoln comparison is more to do with camera quality than his own aging. I mean, he did age but the overexposure and poor focus are clearly doing him some favors in the first image and are nonexistent in the second.
That is actually a genius idea. You should submit it to them. No joke.The only thing about amazon is that it takes a while for delivery. But I'm sure something could be worked out for situations like this. 
If you didn't, I sent off a couple emails to amazon linking your comment with the urging that they at least research the possibility of implementing this. I hope you have as well, I feel we aren't the only people who would help. 
So like a homing beacon of badassitude and honor.For real, whenever shit hits the fan, standing near brown people with cool hats always seems to be the wise choice.
I'm sad to say the death toll in this one is probably not finished. The trauma surgeon at ORMC said he expects to see that number climb throughout the day; many of the victims transported to the hospital were in very critical condition. 
Throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Gays, guns, Muslims, terror, we have pretty much everything contentious topic in this country in one event, of course it's going to be a shit storm. 
I agree 100% r/news is now dead. Worst censorship scandal ever. 
I've seen /r/QualityNews and /r/TrueNews advertised a good bit today, in light of the /r/news *failure*.
He honestly seems really upset every time there is an attack like this. It's something I really admire about him. Especially when he spoke about Sandy Hook, I felt like he was speaking as a father, not just as a president.  
"Honestly, if I were two-faced, would I be showing you this one?"- Abraham Lincoln in response to an accusation by Stephen Douglas 
Yea I can agree with that, the most striking issues though are his hairline being insane and the forehead creases.
I think i will. Prime Now can deliver in 2 hours. Even if some sort of disaster extends that delivery window to much longer, it can still be pretty valuable. Amazon has massive wearhouses full of emergency essentials. This can also help to thwart misuse of funds a little if we are sending the necessary items directly.
Disney World sort of is. They've got an entire land mass bought out, which holds all four parks, security, transportation, emergency response (police/fire/medical), and even water/power facilities. 
I don't understand. Why are the mods censoring? Like, what are they gaining from it? Thanks 
I'm sure Amazon could kick in the accelerated delivery charge if people are buying disaster relief goods from their site... this is a really good idea
apparently he pledged to ISIS just before this. Also, Ramadan just started, and ISIL leaders are proclaiming mega-rewards to anyone who does acts like these during this time. 
My guess is that they delete any comment mentioning Islam. Only a guess, though. Can't imagine any other reason they'd delete so many comments.
How do you claim your ISIS mega-reward when you're dead?

That which is dead for millenia tends to stay dead; only by unholy machinations of a macabre nature could something be resurrected beyond its time.

>but it decided to focus on a love triangle instead of the interesting stuff.To be fair, vampire mythology has been done to death in many other series. The idea that a teenage girl would care more about her love life in the midst of a great inter-species conflict is a fun idea, I just think it was executed in the most shallow and boring way possible.
Pratchett taking a go at Le Carre' or Flemming would be interesting.

As a non-native speaker of the English language who's reading Lovecraft for the first time, in English, I must say that this here reads exactly like his work. I must confess that many times  my brain hurts when I'm reading his tales because of how he uses some words and phrasings that are not very used nowadays.

Same thing with the sparkly skin. The idea that vampires avoid sunlight for some reason *other than it hurts them* is a pretty cool idea. I wouldn't have gone with glittering diamond skin, but it's still a fun thought. Every other story I've read either has vampires hurt by the sun, or it doesn't affect them at all.The premise -and even the worldbuilding- had so much potential, but it wasn't very well executed in the end.
This sounds like run to the hills

Nah. They'd be forced to wander the desert to search for something they can't find, and once they find it, they can go home to the promised land. Only to find that what they were searching for is a mystic form of death itself. In doing so, making them quasi immortal because it takes so long to find it and they can't die until they do.

Roald Dahl regularly had articles published in Playboy. Few people know because the magazine is better known for its photo journalism.
Stick to the stuff he actually wrote. After a while he got famous enough that he began "collaborating" with other authors. They write the books, using his characters and world building, and Clancy puts his name in big letters on the front of the book. The quality suffered immensely. Try Red Storm Rising to start. It's a stand alone work about war between NATO and the USSR set mostly in the north Atlantic and Europe.

Honestly, the same way as a normal person.I hear the voices of guys and it just sounds attractive to me.Even though i can't "see" them physically mentally i can picture how they look.I wasn't blind until i was age 14, but i realized i was gay when i was 18.( my boyfriend is blind, i just typed this out for him :] )
Watch the film "The Way He Looks", beautiful story about a blind gay teen and his love for a classmate.
You ever just smell a food from afar and think to yourself "that must be delicious"?It's like that. Except it's dicks.
I've been blind since birth and extremely gay. You know when you see someone and are attracted to them? It's kind of like that but I can't see.
Wonder how many blind people use reddit.....Wonder how many gay blind people use reddit...
This issue is extremely relevant to me now.
People are attracted to voices, personality, pheromones and physical touch. What kind of bodies do you want to feel? Etc. Sexuality is not strictly visual. But I'm a woman so maybe the male experience is much different
I am typing this for my gay blind friend. He said and I quote **"My cock is so fun to play with, I assume different ones would be too!"**

I've never wanted to know the answer to something so badly. 
I'd imagine it's the same way blind straight people know they are straight, or how straight blind people know they are blind.
How do blind people know if they are straight? 
Serious tag would've helped
how are they going to read this
This may be one of the best questions I have ever seen on here OP. Now everyone be weary of the next question that will come from this one. " Deaf gay people of reddit, how did you know you were a man bear pig?" or something like that.
Not blind, but I imagine I would know I was gay because I would find a man's voice sexier than a woman's.  Growing up if I was roughhousing with another boy, it would give me a different feeling than casually touching a girl.  I would imagine I would get to know other guys and have crushes on them , since you don't need to see someone to get to know them through conversation and eventually find their personality attractive.  
Interesting how overwhelmingly responders are focussed only on male homosexuals and not females. Just saying. 
The age old question
I've corresponded with him over email for the past few years. He's a fascinating guy. Very sad story.
> I somehow knew that this was not the way it should be, and never mentioned it to anyone.This ends so abruptly and on such a sad note. Did he learn that there is nothing wrong with being gay? Was he ashamed? I feel like he's saying "so I stayed in the closet and try to act normal". I hope everything worked out. Such a difficult hand to be dealt. 
>My friend was born blind and she is a lesbian.>She is white and is highly attracted to black girls, especially >Beyonce and used to have pictures of her on her wall.Blind people love pictures.
>When I was a senior, some students who I had heard were gay decided to start a discussion group. I wanted to go, but was afraid to ask for directions to where the discussion was taking place, because I did not want others on campus to realize I was gay.Poor fella. I don't know why but that hit me hard.
That's really cool and interesting... and annoying. My brain doesn't know what to do with this information. Whether we're gay or straight seems completely arbitrary and random, very strange.
Now that you mention it, I think a more interesting question is how blind people know they're straight. In the top comment right now there's a quote from a blind man who didn't even know the difference between boys and girls at the age of 15. The only thing you could notice that was different would be their voices! Now days blind kids probably read a lot online, but I imagine it's a difficult way to absorb that information.
I also suggest crossposting to r/blindandgay.
Wow, what's it like finding out he's gay just now?
Love this movie! It was incredibly moving. I watched it the other day and was curious about the experiences of others and if they were able to relate. I probably should have worded the question differently... 
Is there a scene where he touches his classmate's face and realises he's really cute?
Ahh, that takes me back to the golden afternoons of my youth, where, as a just-blossoming maiden, I was enchanted by the smell of dicks floating intoxicatingly on summer breezes.
i'm a boy who likes pussy but when i smell it from afar "that must be delicious" is not what I'm thinking.
You can smell dicks from afar?
Best answer in this thread and nobody will ever see it.

Are you dating a blind man?
I'm pretty sure it's a cultural trope that most people (men and women, gay and straight) prefer to close their eyes while kissing and turn the lights down (or even off) during sex. We might think we're all about visuals, but actually when it comes down to it, there's a lot more going on that we often don't think about.

No it would have hurt it.  Here's why.  The sample size this pertains to it ridiculously small,  Gay, Blind, and on Reddit I think 5 of them would be a high estimate.  So a serious tag gets a lot less comments and a lot less attention if its this specialized so with a bunch of pricks goofing around you're liable to head toward the front page, where it might be found by one of the five.

I can usually sense the sex of people close to me if we're close enough, even if i can't see them.  I dunno if it's smell specifically though, i think we're kinda wired to be cued in to the differences.  Animals always seem to know.
Is that how it works? They blow each other's minds?
I mean, I get how they post stuff, but imagine having to start reading a post, not knowing at that point if it's going to be a shitpost.

this makes me think that there is some scofflaw somewhere who is illegally blind.

I am sighted, but I met my current boyfriend online through video games. Before I had ever seen a picture of him even, I was very attracted to his voice.  Later we met and everything worked out and here we are still dating 3 years later, so I think there is merit to being attracted to a person's voice.

My response will get buried, but I absolutely love hearing about significant others, gay or straight.  I'm a straight male, but love to gossip and chat like a beauty shop girl.  Weird, gross, interesting, or personal, I'm 100% game.  That's why I prefer having female friends and working with women, they seem to be way more open than guys are.  Or maybe I'm just nosy and/or a creep.
This love doesn't just happen, it is worked for. 
Sometimes the obvious jokes are the best ones.
Trust me, straight men feel the same way. In that, other men, even gay men, seem to make sense and act in understandable ways (albeit very stupid sometimes) - and women don't make a shit of sense.One of the reasons a straight man eventually 'connects' with a woman is because sometimes the ultra-machismo male bullshit of society prevents certain talk with your best male friends. Emotional 'pussy' stuff so to speak. Vulnerability.It's easy to do that with a person who's already seen your dick and bare ass and you nutted on and still likes you. How much lower can you go, ya know.

M'assault. *tips fedora*
That entire string of comments was wonderful.
was thinking the same way when i was reading that......now i imagine a blind person sitting there having a post read to them from a text to speech software and then it gets near the end of a long speech, then in 1998 ......
Fucking /u/_vargas_
In theory there should be an aria-label attribute on the save button for comments. 
Maybe. He also happened to be very stoned, so that may have weighed in.
The gayest of them are the loudest. 
If you've ever played with a pussy, that's fun too. 
I can see perfectly well and I needed this translation, thank you.
Funny story. I was at work a year or so ago and someone made a crack about gay for pay. One of my coworkers made the point that we would all be gay for the right amount of money. I think he posited that a million dollars would do anyone in, and that it sure as hell would work for him.So we started haggling him. Would you have gay sex for 900,000? Of course he said he would. Long story short we found out that he would enthusiastically suck a dick for like 2500.  
i used myself for sex. it was horrible and i think i need counseling. 
Ok, moving on then 
Well I think I know why they are sweaty... 
And who's sweat is on them since ferrets can't sweat.
/r/selffuck.NSFL
RIP your inbox....
No, that can't be it. It must be something in the water.
Nah I just sucked the dick wrong.
And some straight people like dick-shaped objects in their ass too!
What a relief!
goddammit you made me clear my history
The conspiracy theory is Stevie wonder has been playing us for all these years. 
r/redditwritesseinfeld
> He seemed rather surprised when I told him "dude, if you're telling me you're gay, I've known for a long time"I once did this but I got it wrong. Ohhhhh the cringe.
I knew my brother was gay long before he came out to the family.He asked me to get something from his room once, but forgot that he left all his gay porn mags on his bed.  Later he tried to claim that it was for a college class in Human Sexuality, but that was a total lie - they don't make you buy 30+ gay porn mags; if available at all, they'd be viewable in the reading room at no charge.Anyway, it was a shocker to walk in on that, but it certainly explained a lot of things about my brother to teenage me, like why he never had a girlfriend but had plenty of 'guy' friends.
My family had taken bets with each other (of 5 bucks) whether I would come out as Gay or Bi from when I was 5/6. My mum won big when I was bi.
I am a straight male but I get along WAY better with women and gay guys.  My two best friends are gay guys (both of whom I've known since childhood.) Why?  It seems like most of the straight guys I know are always trying to make fun of each other or out-wit each other, crack jokes, or talk about sports.--I don't like small talk, and I'm not into sports very much.  I like deeper, conversation-type questions and...conversations.  I hope that makes sense.  So, unfortunately, it's really, really hard for me to make new friends.
It's honestly the same stuff as what happens in straight relationships but with different pronouns, I've noticed. It's harder to deal with my poly friends, if only because trying to keep all their love interests straight gets a bit confusing after a while. 
You aren't. You're just you.
I tried to stifle a laugh while pooping and hurt my butthole.
You're wonderful! 
Did the blind gay person even know about Undertaker throwing Makind from Hell in a Cell in the first place?
Thank you to leading me to this glorious person. This is like reading poetry written by a particularly raunchy poet.
Do you smell like doritos?
WHY DO YOU SAY THIS!!!
Now I wonder why I'm not into bestiality.
I thought it was a guy sucking a dick. I mean it was what the thread was about, so we were already there.
Reread it, it's actually dark as fuck.
you have reading, comprehension problems 
Weather's nice
Dude. I got you.For people who don't want to click, this is a sub about putting your dick in your own ass. They say it's the best thing ever but it looks really uncomfortable.Apparently the goal is to put your balls in there too, what a world!Also I am triggered and literally shaking because of these shitlords who have big enough dicks that they can *fuck themselves*. Mine doesn't even reach past the gentleman vegetables. 
I think you mean RIP her guy's outbox.
Nah, just sucked the wrong dick.
This joke was so bad you need to frieze all further efforts at humor
use Reddit Is Fun next time lol, it lets you see the link before you go on the website :)
One of my favourite subs
This seems like it would be easy to play off as a joke though. I'm guessing you didn't think of that in the moment though.
I think you missed your target with that quoted word.
Sounds like we *ALL* won... ;)
I like your family.
Thanks man!  I know.  But sometimes I think being torn between two genders is a damn curse when everyone around you is so sure about themselves.
That's pretty interesting and I didn't expect it that fast, but I certainly skim through articles faster than that. Plus skipping to the end to check it it's a shitpost still works better. Also, I can't imagine how horrible continuous spelling errors must sound.
It's not a story a Jedi would tell you. 
I've been duped by Vargas a number of times. Never disappoints.
More like chipotle.
#STOP SAYING THAT!
Can't help you there, ask a Welshman. 
You should probably go play with a few more cocks to be sure. For science. 
Woah.....   omg.....  I'm also too high for this.... but I think I just witnessed an amazing joke....a super mega dark joke
No you have reading. 
I have no interest in clicking, but I'm curious about the logistics. I assuming these guy are tucking their dicks under and between their legs to insert into their butthole. Impressive lengths aside, surely this can't be done when the dick is hard? But if it's soft, how could they possibly get it in? So many questions, so little desire to be scarred for life!
Jesus dude. You start small, you don't bring out the Giant Black Horse Banger the first time you peg a guy. 
Ok I sucked a different dick. The good news is I got my job back. The bad news is now I have a reputation to uphold.
It was a bust.
Depends on if you're normally a dick like that though. I know I am so I could easily do it, but if you never joke?
>like why he never had a girlfriend but had plenty of guy 'friends'.Is that better?
You're not being torn dawg. You just get to enjoy the best of both worlds 
Now I'm just wondering how many times Microsoft Sam has spoken these words.
It's treason then.
We sure solved that one. This must be what Scooby and the Gang feel like when they rip the monster mask off the villain guy. 
WHAT? I CANT HEAR YOU ABOVE THE SOUND OF ALL THIS SHOUTING.
I feel this is a rare chance to respond to a comment simply because I'm Welsh on Reddit. But in doing so would imply I'm into beastiality....Argh well, I'm replying anyway.I'm here for any questions
Instructions unclear, dick stuck in sheep.
Yeah because even with the small sample size he's technically gay unless he plays with some more dicks. 
That's not all you have to uphold, eh eh?(I'm talking about balls)
Its a marble you could come up with that joke.
I'm in a successful straight relationship of 6 years.  She was the first person I really opened up to about it.  The bonus is, I guess you could say the relationship is "open" and I get to explore who "me" is.I think if I was expected to be either gay or straight and didn't have an understanding partner, I'd go nuts.
Because of how stoned Shaggy always was?
It's said the welsh invented the condom, thousands of years ago, from the intestines of a sheep. Later, an Englishman realized you could remove them from the sheep first!
What's the inside of a sheep feel like? Do they follow you around when you finish? Are they wondering if you'll call?
Well, he's enjoyed 72.72% (repeating oc) of the genetalia he's played with. 12.5% of those he enjoyed were dicks.
Mentos
Key question: how is the rice going to be prepared? Steamed? Fried? Any seasonings added to it?
Cereal 
Jelly beans.
Beer. Even when that beer is Coconut Curry Hefeweizen and it seems like it would taste good over rice. It definitely does not. ...not that I would know or anything. 
No fucking ice cream over rice...
pumpkin pie
Spaghetti
Your typo in the word disgusting is how my four year old son says that word. It makes me laugh.
Can you imagine the people working in the grocery store are thinking with some kid coming in every 15 or so minutes buying more rice and various other items?*There he is again, what the hell?*
Ice.Rice is amazing with almost anything else.
Orange juice.
Jello
Did you mean distrusting or disgusting? I need to know to answer the question properly. 
Mac and cheese with rice?
Cake.
Skittles. 
Nutella. 
This is so strange. What made you decide to do this? I really love Reddit at times like these.
Hot dogs and hamburgers (I have a theory that this is actually delicious but never tried it)
Rice crispy
Honey or Maple syrup.
Marshmallows 
Chocolate-covered bacon.
Pancakes
Coca cola 
Pizza
Pickles
Yogurt.
I read this thread entirely too long
Oranges.
ITT people forgetting the word 'tasty' as well as the word 'food' on occasion 
Mustard
Damn OP, if you really are eating all this shit you have a lot of cardio to do tomorrow. 
Bananas
OP: you should take a picture of your "experiments"!
Parmesan cheese, can confirm from experience 
Wait? You can make rice bad?
Tang, or Kool aid powder. 
Ricin
Can we start a subreddit devoted to this?
croutons 
Chewing gum.
Ghost pepper salsa
This is the best thread
Soggy bread
Nothing. Rice is fucking bomb yo.
Sweet bread fried in sheep blood
rice milk
MRE Do it now.
I do feel like rice goes with nearly everything... umm, maybe strawberry jam?OP, be careful that you don't get sick!
Red wine
Nothing, rice goes with everything. 
Are you actually trying these?
This thread is hilarious! I just wanted to be part of the Magic by commenting at the end. Thank you, OP. You're delightful! 
mercury
Potato
Holy shit, this entire thread is amazing.10/10, OP. You get gold.
So are we all in agreement that /u/DO_U_EVN_SPAGHETTI is definitely, completely, absolutely, (un)officially the Best OP Ever? Can we get like a really shitty internet plaque for him or something?
Ice cream, only because as a kid I was often lectured on not being able to have two good things together as in "You wouldn't eat ice cream with rice. That's why you can't have X with Y"
TIL that OP *does* deliver.
Toenails. If not, refried beans
Durian
Vanilla Extract.
Rice.
Are you a dog, OP?
Do Altoids count? 
I have upvoted every single comment in this thread by hand
This is probably the best thread I have seen on reddit in a *long* time. Thank you so much OP for making me laugh my ass off like a psychopath.
I'm so sad I missed this ):This is the shit I love seeing on Reddit. More meta community stuff!

Are all these ratings theoretical? Or are you trying each response yourself?
i didn't realize everybody was teleporting the food to you. 
are you using a rice cooker?
Pass, rice milk is not my favorite 
How old is the average Redditor, anyway?
Are you claiming to actually be eating these combinations? I don't see how that's possible since most of your comments are only a minute or two apart.
Username delivers

Someone get this man a science.
I've been on Reddit since I was 13 (5 years ago), and to date - you are my favorite OP yet.10/10 A+++++ would upvote again -IGN
dude your freaking hilarious how are you only 14?!?
I love this thread so much!!
*goes to find Nutella and Rice*
You delightful weirdo
I could imagine sticky rice wrapped around a hot dog and lightly fried until the rice is crispy would be quite tasty
Implying that there is a right cereal to be rice-d.
You should make a site doing nothing but this.I know I'd go to it.
Alright that sounds good. will try.
> Week old pizza hut leftovers: 9/10If you mark that 9/10, your 5/10 ratings must really taste like shit.
I like you, OP.
Didn't even thank for the suggestion
Is mayonnaise an instrument?Edit; glad to go meta!
Fair enough, genuinely wasn't expecting that.
My favorite machine at the gym is the snack machine
just take a picture with your phone... ??
Thank you for your suggestion.
You could burn the rice considerably. That would make it pretty bad.
I am weird, I used to eat the powdered drinks unmixed. It was a more of a love for the citric acid than anything else. I once got chemical burns on my tongue from eating pure citric acid. 
So like you when you were delivered by UPS! ^^^That's ^^^where ^^^babies ^^^come ^^^from ^^^right?

I like this one. Definitely the most begrudging "thank you." In your whole post.
Depends on what kind of sauce is in it.
You can't tell me Popeye gets buff from just spinach. That fucker must be on something. 
Consider moving then.
Seems like rice would be a vast improvement.
Then age 4 years, God. The youth today are such slackers!
I can't believe you're 14. You're the coolest 14 year old I've ever seen period. Question: how much money did you spend doing this thread?Also: make a youtube channel for this stuff. Would be amazing.
I love you. 
You're Asian aren't you
No, fuck you. You're getting gold and you're going to fucking like it. 
I try a bit of all of the suggestions I am able to do.
Does that mean I'm not an accident anymore?

I'm making and eating all of these over a time span, and then posting about them at the same time.
I always deliver!
Because I was born 14 years ago!
I love you so much.
*Proceeds to eat Nutella before adding rice. No regrets.*
I went to the store so many times so here's pretty much their reactions:First time, oh hey you're buying stuff.Third, oh look its you buying stuff again...Fifth, okay I can tell something is wrong with you.And every time after that they just look at me and I stare them in the eye and say nothing.
Deliver.
What kinda coke are we talking about here?
I like you too (:

You're welcome.Wait.
RIP OP
Of all your responses in this thread, this is my favorite. Thank you for doing this cross-over between an AskReddit and an AMA. Next time, you should do "spaghetti + [blank]". 
>not edibleYou aren't trying enough, OP:   5/10
Lava isn't the hottest thing known to man, but are you going near lava? Didn't think so. 
Four whole months of gold.
You are exactly what many should aspire to be: dedicated, creative, not afraid to get his hands dirty, kind. I'm really glad you exist.
It's kind of a sad and angry way of saying thanks for your useless crap.

The hilarious thing is that no one even cares if he's lying, the rice has spoken.

In a weird way, I miss the days when "I don't have a digital camera" and "I don't have a webcam" were excuses that anyone would buy. It made the internet more mysterious.

Seriously, Jesus Christ even if he's not actually doing all these his responses are making me laugh so hard I peed a little.

No sir, you're OP.
Now I really want to know what You said.
You can't tell me what to do!
Are you kidding me? That's almost an instant reply while you are on the frontpage getting flooded.I'm not sure I have ever seen so much potential in a person of your age.By the way, would you know a quick and easy way to count the number replies OP made in his thread? I'm suddenly very curious.

My neighbor who is 94 called me last week and said she is terminal and has about 4-8 weeks to live. Super nice lady I have always enjoyed talking to. She asked me to mow her front yard until she dies. I'm happy to help as long as it's one less thing she has to worry about. 
I work at a company that sells snacks. If anyone would like some, just PM me and I can put together something for you. I know its hardly anyones "BUCKET LIST" but hey, maybe someone out there just wants a cookie before they go. 
I have a very rare autoimmune disease called dermatomyositis. It's very similar to Lupus. I'm not terminally ill, but I'll probably have a shorter life than most. I'm not asking for anything but if anyone who has or knowns someone with a similar disease and wants to talk please PM me. :) 
 He doesn't need anything but I wanted to tell you all my dad has liver cancer  and it has metastisized. He still feels good but at his last  Dr appointment they wanted to get him started on paliative care so it's not looking good at all.  He wants to go fishing with his only grandson... but I only had him 3 weeks ago so he's not going to be up for fishing this year. 
Cirrhosis, 28, Apparently have had two versions of Hep C for a very long time, Day to day and I've accepted and don't let it bother me.
Reading all the comments here, wouldn't it be a great if we have a Make-A-Wish Reddit edition for people who are suffering and/or terminally ill?
I have inoperable grade IV  lymphoma and i have been relatively lucky with everything so far. The one thing i would change would have been for my wife to want to stay for the end, that would have been good. It's really hard to explain your situation to someone that doesn't have cancer. I am 32.
What I want more than anything in the world is to get better and live happily ever after with my husband, my kitten, and hopefully children someday. There is a chance I may get better if I find the right specialist and treatment. However, each day of pain I feel the life sucked out of me. I'm hoping to go cage diving with great whites. In October is my 10th anniversary so I'm hoping husband is up for that. I love sharks. I need to go to a few Red Sox baseball games too. 
I could die tomorrow, any one of us could. So how can we help each other today?
Just putting this out there... I am a professional tattoo artist in Scotland. My clients quite often tell me of their "bucket list", and getting the tattoo is definitely on it. If anyone is from Scotland here, and in such a situation, I'd be more than happy to help you out with it. Just drop me a pm or something. 
Made an account just to share this. I have been diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer and have been given 6 months to live. My doctor is pushing chemotherapy but I really don't want to die that way. I haven't told my family yet. My wife wouldn't understand and my father is getting married in a month. I'm going to wait to tell them until I feel the time is right. In the meantime, I have no one to talk to about this. If someone has the time, I'd love someone that I can talk to about this. Getting the stuff off my chest would be absolutely fantastic. 
I'd also love to help but am jaded by scam artists. All I imagine are people conjuring up well crafted fake stories to get free stuff.
Actually, I'm going to go ahead and chime in here, if there's really someone who reads this, please PM me, and I will do whatever is within my power to get you what you need.  I'm in a rough spot and feel the need to give back.  :)  So this thread will be my outlet. 
Also, is it too late to make this a [serious] post?
Is it good that there's no terminally ill people posting here?
My cat has a little under a month to live, and although I don't know exactly what she wants, I've been giving her non stop attention, any food she wants, and a Christmas tree to sit under since that was her favorite.
One thing I've seen people do when it comes to their children is to record messages for them at different stages of their lives. Graduations, driving, maybe a marriage. I've also seen people write out cards and noted for every bday that they will miss. It might be heart breaking, but I know that your kids would love and cherish those cards/videos for their entire lives. Might be something to think about. Maybe even recording a video of a hike, and guiding/showing them the world through your eyes. Something that will stick with them no matter what happens to you. Hope this helps.
I'm gonna keep you in mind!
This is seriously so awesome of you. My dad has cancer and my mom has trouble taking care of him and our big yard. Our neighbors who we rarely talk to have started mowing our yard when they mow theirs. It means so much to just have someone help. Way to go! 
If your dad wants to go on a ride on a coast guard boat. Let me know. I can give you a tour of the harbor if I am not on leave when you show up. 
I honestly and sincerely hope that your father looks nothing like Hemingway and just wants to have one good trolling before he goes.
This is awesome. Stop in at Captain Tony's on Greene St if your dad wants to hang in the actual bar that Papa frequented. It was Sloppy Joes then, but they later moved.
Key West is wonderful. Skip the Irish bar (my wife was the most Irish thing in there) and eat at Blue Heaven instead. But do go to the Hemingway house and pet a 6 toed cat.
where can we send cards to? 
Pm me a name and an address and I'll get something sent from Manchester UK :) 
She may or may not be into this, but I believe there's a /r/randomactsofcards or something like that. People send kind postcards/letters/greeting cards at someone's request. 
I have 2 1972 VW Buses sitting in a warehouse outside Cleveland, OH. One is a green and yellow tin top the other is a yellow Westfalia. They both run, not split widows but still fun enough for a good road trip. Let me know if you are interested.  You can certainly borrow them.
My dad's in the other room, dying of Stage 4 pancreatic cancer right now. You probably already have heard this a billion times, and most likely are already doing it, but please please ***please*** take the time to openly speak to him. Tell him you forgive him for anything you might have ever felt wronged for, tell him you love him for everything he's given you or done for you. Because without it all, good and bad, you wouldn't be where you are today. I love you stranger and hope you can cherish every single second of being with him.
u/unsuitablewoodchuck , this comment needs more upvotes and comments.  Surely we could crowdsource this. u/itsamamaluigi what part of the country/world should everyone look in?
In all seriousness, if you drive through Utah to see the salt lake or salt flats, message me. Family time is important, but expensive. I'd be happy to host you guys for a night or two to save on hotel costs. Those places add up. 
Let me know if you hit the DC area on your road trip.  I have tons of hook ups in the city and can definitely get you some interesting sites to see ;) 
Are you doing anything for you kids to remember you by? Like writing them letters for the future, or making videos of yourself?
I'm not dying, that I know of, and only have had one health issue that's popped up a few times (spontaneous pneumothorax).What you said is spot on though. People go through life like their jobs, possessions, and money are everything.It's what it gets you that matters. Financial security is important, but beyond that, I don't care about my job. Living your life is what matters, however you want to do it.
Hey man, I really needed to hear this today. First thing I'm gonna do tommorow morning is call my mom and tell her how much I love her. Thank you so much for writing out this beautiful message. 
It's 14 that's the MMO. There's a new expansion pack that comes out on the 20th (16th for early access for those that pre-ordered) of this month called Stormblood. There's a bunch of stuff on the cash shop that you can buy for him, too, like emotes, costumes, housing items, etc.Check your PMs for a little something to send your dad.
I could send him an original soundtrack CD I got signed by the game director a few years ago if you think that could make him happy. PM me. 
I just got back into FF14 myself. My headcanon now includes the fact that one of my Bard's Songs is about a Southern Rogue who fought for the people of Eorzea with such ferocity and compassion that Death himself was reluctant to go after him. And if Death did, it was only grudgingly, knowing there'd be one HELL of a battle to do his job. :)
I would love that, but I'm just chronically depressed and anxious. Don't want you to be taken advantage of. 
My sister has this.  She's doing a lot better than when she was first diagnosed but it was rough the first couple of years.  That is very nice of you to offer your support for those struggling with similar diseases. 
Take him anyway, even if the kid is in a carrier.  Let your Dad talk to him and tell him about fishing and show him things.  Record it with your phone and save a copy to your computer and keep it for when the kid gets older. Learning those things from a Grandfather is just absolutely awesome, even if it is years after that time it actually happens.  Also, watching your Dad talk to your kid will be something special for you as well.
I see in your AMA that you might someone to write a musical about you and your stuggle. I'm a composer (not professional). I don't know if I'll be able to write a whole musical, but I could write something maybe.
I really wish I could donate but - I'm gay, so I'm not allowed to. Wish things were different.
Oddly, buried beneath a bunch of "look how huggy we are!" posts.  Does it affect your quality of life?
I assume you've talked with your doctors about the new drugs for Hepatitis C, Harvoni and Sovaldi from Gilead Sciences.  I had to bring it up because, if they haven't discussed it with you, you should ask about it.
I've got a chest freezer and questionable morals, maybe even some dry ice (and a LOT of weed)?  It's not quite what you're looking for, but I'm sure we could rig something up if you can make it here.
Gotta be honest, this post made me realize how uncomfortable I actually feel about my own mortality. I'm right around your age, and to feel the expectation that I won't life longer than another year gives me pause. I could be in your situation at our age. I admire your ability to function with that cloud, because honestly, you might live til 2050, and I might have an aneurysm next week. Peace, blessings and full life to you. 
Your family members aren't liable for your debt once you pass. So stop stressing about it, and make sure they know that so creditors can't pressure them into paying!
My dad died from the same cancer. He had the same conclusion about his bucket list. Just quality time. I flew down to see him once a month in his last 6 months because that's what we both wanted. Nothing fancy, just spending time together. People who knew him knew that about him and funded a big portion of my plane tickets. I'll be grateful forever for that. 
I'm so sorry, let me know if he does need anything and I'll try to help! I'm pretty good at macaroni art and glitter covered cards, so that could be neat.All jokes aside, I'm willing to help if I can :)
The good news is, with early enough detection the survival rate is somewhere around 70% I think for cervical cancer, and the treatments are so much better than they used to be. I am so sorry you are going through this, let me know if there's anything I can do to help.  I've actually been through this before (my didn't spread, but the uncertainty while I waited to find out) so I'm always a PM away.
PM me and I will do you one better. I will introduce you to someone at Disney, working in the Imagineering department. Because dreams are worth pursuing.
This is a great idea! I'll look into the the 501(c)(3) requirements to create one. Anyone know what the best way to be visibility on this is?
I'm right there with you bud. I have permanent back pain. I used to play hockey, rock climb, wakeboard, snowboard...etc... but now I can't do anything anymore. I'm 23 and getting married next month. All I hope for at this moment is that I can bare the pain through the dance with my wife and mom...
> At a certain point that whole "stay positive, you can do it" attitude can really fuck right off.Yeah, I feel you there.  But you got to keep trudging through it because that's life.  Have you looked into more experimental treatments?  The "bleeding edge" of technology?  I am so sorry you are going through this.  I had a friend who had a similar problem and lyrica helped, but now she's addicted to it and can't live without it.  :(  Hugs to you, and let me know if you ever need to talk or vent <3 
You're a fantastic human.  Wishing you all the luck and hope.
I'm a mod at /r/redsox, I'll keep you in mind as sometimes last minute tickets show up on the sub. Do you live close to Fenway for short notice games or would you require some more advanced notice? Weekday vs. weekend games?
That's why you should always dress nicely. You never know when you'll die unexpectedly and be stuck with that as your ghost outfit forever.
This world isn't easy -  It's hard on your own -  We're richer united,  and poorer alone.It's fine to ignore it -  For better or ill -  To scorn it before it  collapses your will.But if you can *fight* it -  Or choose to be *strong* -   Perhaps you can right it,  repairing a wrong.It's plainly apparent -  It's simple to see -  Together,  we'll weather  whatever will be.&nbsp;^^^:) 
+1  This is the way I try and live my life.
Am ill. Send moni. Brother
Don't think that's needed mate, from the comments here I can safely say Reddit isn't that bad.
No, that means we're too late!
Thanks. I've been journalling the past months for each of them and just basically rambling and telling stories. I've thought about the birthday cards idea as well, but haven't done it yet. Great thoughts about the video hike! I'll definitely add that things to do for them!
This was touching, my grandmother is very far gone with dementia right now and I'm glad your neighbour was focusing on a happy memory you gave to her, even if it did get elaborated over time in her mind, you obviously made quite the impact! my grandma is 8+ hours away from me and with a lot of my moms side (who are all wonderful) but I have guilt for not being there as much as I want to due to work that's hard to get away from and life and finances ...I hope she's thinking happy thoughts about me, even if they are made up ! 
Again you go unnoticed.
Totally unrelated to this thread, but I love your username! I'm a huge fan of Dashboard Confessional! Also, that's really sweet of you. My dad passed recently, and he was Coast Guard for years. We want to scatter his ashes from a Coast Guard boat, if that's possible. We think he would have loved that. Thank you for being awesome! 
This is why I love Reddit. 
I'm working on getting that information together. Thank you so much!
Wow, great to see someone from Manchester reaching out considering what you guys have just been through.Props to you my friend! 
We're in Twin Cities area.Thanks for responding! Maybe there's someone near us who'd be willing to share their bus for a few hours. I'm just not sure how to even look for something like that.
So much this. I'm in the same boat, my friend.
"It's ok to die" would be a good epitaph. I could imagine something along "It's ok to die, don't let that prevent you from living" for mine if I decided to be buried (which I wouldn't)
If you drive through Arizona, I'm in Tucson and would also be happy to host. I have one cat. 
Me too. could we set up a crowd funding page for you, if you don't have one already or if anyone else has done so?
Omg. I dont know you or the OP but your offer just made me cry. That is so incredibly kind of you.
> and only have had one health issue that's popped up a few times (spontaneous pneumothorax).Imma guess you're a tall thin male?
You are an awesome person. Thank you. I already bought that expansion for him as a Father's Day gift, but thank you for the suggestion!
No, please keep it! He won't be able to keep it for long, so it's better kept by you. THANK YOU for the offer, though 
wow it sounds like she's really living with a lot. Your happiness is just as important as hers so if you two are happy today I wouldn't stress so much about the distant future. Like you said, who knows what could happen?! And adoption is always an option if you want a family. Who knows, there could be a medical breakthrough/ better treatments in the future. Stay strong!
Totally agree...i missed an opportunity for my son to meet his great grandmother before she died. Even if he never remembers it, having a picture or video of that fishing trip would be priceless.
I was in 3d animation and design for a long time. Wanna do a video together? I'll handle the visual aspect.
Nope, nothing really, just letting it happen, listed as an organ donar so hopefully something good comes out of it.
I hate to sound stupid, but what gets transplanted for this? I've never heard of it.
Nah, just the whole if i wanna end on my terms or not and how in the back of the head.
My mom had hep c for most of her life and was getting bad cirrhosis. She got approved after trying for a long time to get Harvoni, she went through it and is since completely clear of hep c and her liver is going back to normal. If you can get your insurance to approve it, it really does work.
Work as a pharm tech. Filled Harvoni once.... $33,000 a bottle of I think 28 tablets.
Depending on the country, that may or may not be true. 
My Uncle died of the same cancer as well. My mother was in denial so my wife and I pushed her hard to go out there as much as possible. He lived five months from diagnosis and she ended up being there when he passed. All things considered that was a good last five months where they focused on being together as a family.
Most good doctors look at the risks vs reward. If it's a 99% chance that the patient will be in a wheelchair peeing in a bag to leek an extra 3 years out of their life then you would much rather take the next 1 year and get lucky. Also make sure that it is the patients decision to go along with the surgery and it is not the pressure of the family or the family overruns the patients decision. So live with what you have but extra days does not always equal/ determine more enjoyment/ happiness. 
> He was originally randomized into the placebo group of a trial for treatment. She tells me the treatment worked so well, they had to switch everbody over from the placebo group to the treatment group.That is amazing.We hear about the cure for AIDS every month on the front page, but has this made the front page yet?
I know where to get a 2,000 lbs crate of dry macaroni. (Seriously, they're huge) 
Thank you, I appreciate it! I'm more scared for my kids if anything, you know? I don't want them to be scared or worried. They are all under 6, so I obviously haven't told them. I left work for the pregnancy, and now this. Times are tough.If you don't mind me asking, what did you have done to get rid of it? 
Fucking Reddit. I like this place.
Great idea, but I can't seem to find a valid file there, without installing extra extensions and add-ons that I don't care to install. Thanks for the idea though!
How'd you end up with the permanent pain?
Appreciate it :).I tried lyrica, along with pretty much everything else. Sadly I get the same effect: nothing. I don't know why but drugs in general don't seem to work on me, I always feel the same as before.This unfortunately extends to painkillers as well. I have oxy and stuff (prescribed) but even that doesn't really worK well enough to bother and simply increasing the dosage won't ever end well.
I've never been so early to a sprog comment. But, fuck man, that was beautiful. You're seriously talented.
 "'And what would humans be without love?' RARE, said Death."
Not this time. We are talking about it via PM. It should happen when they come down. I'll keep you posted. 
Once you have it send me a pm as well.  Also if they have any particular interests.
You forgot to pay the tax of one picture of your cat.
Interested as well. Japan is a great place.
That's very sweet, but don't shed a tear on my behalf. Ive spent a lot of time and money on vapid, selfish arrogance and complete disregard for the feelings of others.Im just trying to put a dent in my innumerable sins.
Not OP, but also had a spontaneous pneumothorax and yep! Tall thin male.
I don't remember where I first heard/saw this, but I never saw a gravestone that read "John Smith, A beloved, hard working employee"...
I'm an FFXIV player too. I'd be willing to get him a little something for in-game. Do you know his character's name and server?
My paternal grandfather was dying in the same hospital I was born in, and my mom told me when I was younger, that my dad grabbed teeny-brand-new me, ignored all the nurses, and brought me to see his father for one visit before he passed on. My dad's a whacko, but I'm glad he did that.
We definitely could
As a 15+ gallon whole blood donor, I heartily endorse all your advice!
Wouldn't having hep make you nonviable as a donor?
Liver, I believe.
I have had hep c and b since I was 18. I'm over 60 now.  Main thing is avoid alcohol.  Also avoid rough sports where you could get struck where your liver is.  Don't dwell on it and try to lead a normal life. The doctors told me I would die of cirhossis or liver cancer. Jokes on them,  I'm dying from lung cancer. Just take it one day at a time and remember,  everybody dies,  and doctors are not always right.  Good luck. .
I finished a 3 month course of Harvoni recently, my stepfather is Egyptian and managed to source it for me from Egypt. It was $600 total. It breaks my heart and saddens me that such an amazing cure is so inaccessible here when it's so cheap everywhere else. 
This is what I am terrified of.  There is no happily ever after with this tumor.  The outcome scares me to death and I don't want to think of a life without him, but know that is reality.  I am so sorry for everyone's losses.  Cancer sucks, but Glioblastoma is a horrific asshole that never goes away (sort of like my ex-husband).
My wife and I work in a hospital, I wish more people understood this simple logic. Don't prolong someone's life for your own selfish desires. 
...Where is this pasta heaven and do they have take out
I have no cervix now.  They cut it all out because it didn't spread, and then I took some pill form of chemo just to make sure.  It was super easy, but like I said, the waiting for the results was the WORST.  :(  Also, I don't have kids, so between that and my missing ovary due to another medical issue, I'll probably never have them, so that sucks too.And yes - telling the kids definitely requires something more definitive. :)  
> Fucking Reddit. I ~~like~~ *love* this place.FTFY
Thanks for the info. You have some knowledge in this area? Right now I am brainstorming ways how the non-profit would work generally (ex. funding, making sure the story is true, logistics of making a wish happen, visibility, how to build a sustainable foundation, etc)
Hi! I'm from Delaware!
Took a bad fall while snowboarding. Apparently my joints in my back are permanently inflamed.
Serious, have you tried weed? (At least for temporary relief). I know someone who has fibromyalgia and they get relief from it.
I'm pretty sure he's never written a comment in non-poem form. Hold on I'll ask him. OH great almighty Mr. /u/Poem_for_your_sprogHave you ever written a comment in non poem form all along?
Take your upvote!
I'm in the SF Bay Area. I have a 1969 VW Bus. It has a new engine, but it is just a shell, no interior other than a driver & passenger seat. How can I help?
at this point the thread, I am suspending disbelief
I'll ask him. It's SouthernRogue, I'm pretty sure, but I will double check!
Seconded. I'd like to send him things. 
Very good. PM me, we'll trade details. Let's talk to him and see what he has in mind. Shouldn't be too hard.
You too friend, how bad are the lungs?
Holy crap that's an insane difference. Unless there's an under-supply, they really do just want to juice out the money. 
Never though of it like that. I guess that's why euthanasia is such a difficult subject when we put our own feelings and beliefs over the person who needs help. Thanks for this comment, puts things into perspective. 
It depends, can you carry a ton of macaroni?  
I'm sorry about that :( there is always adoption, or other options, if you decide having a child is right for you and your future :)How was the process and recovery of them cutting it out?
Yup - I have tons of knowledge in this area. :)  If you want you can PM me and we can talk about it.  I probably don't have time to handle the day to day but I can definitely help with paperwork, process, and technology side :)  Almost like a board member :-P
dela where?
I think it's crazy that opiates/oxy has no effect, on him. Like, if you upped the dosage enough, it'll numb it all but possibly get you so high you wouldn't like it. If those don't work, would weed really be strong enough?
The one time upboat makes sense and we blew it.
I always love to see older gentlemen/woman enjoying Video games!I'll login tonight and see about sending him something.
SUPER easy.  I mean, it's not the most pleasant when it's occurring, but I was walking the next day like nothing had happened.  You have to wear pads though, and no tampons or anything for a while.   :)  Overall I'd say it's one of the easiest (but grossest because of the whole pad thing) medical procedures available.  
Goddamn it. 
You are too awesome!! I'll confirm his name! 
I'm a member on bethematch.org and curious how they notified you?
That makes me feel a lot better. So they kept you awake through it? I'm a wuss when it comes to pain and procedures. 
again, it went unnoticed.
Oh you can't miss it lol, I got multiple emails, texts, letters, and phone calls, even other members of my family got phone calls asking to get in touch with me. If they manage to match you they'll make sure they find you one way or another.  
Not this time.
I honestly can't believe it, how is it possible that virtually every model was so wrong? 2016 has been quite a year
I feel like I'm living in a future GCSE history exam question.  'In 2016, the UK voted to leave the EU,and Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. Discuss.'
I like to believe that the silver lining in this is that both parties will see how broken they are and make some changes, leading to future candidates that are actually likeable, trustworthy, and honest people. A girl can dream, right?
My favorite part about watching this victory speech is watching Trump JR try to stay awake
It feels like I'm watching a South Park episode unfold before my very eyes
Somewhere John Oliver is choking on a Jaffa Cake
So this is the outcome of the Berenstain timeline.
God dammit cubs, last time you won you brought the Ottoman empire down, now you go and do this. 
Dormammu I've come to bargain 
Man, I'm still pretty shocked.2016 will be a memorable year.
Man, 2016 has been a weird year. I don't think anyone would have guessed that Donald Trump of all people would be the US president.
This will ruin so many Thanksgiving dinners.
"Donald Trump Beats Woman to Take Black Man's Job."
Can you imagine if someone had been in a coma for like 6 months and woke up to find out that the Cubs have won the World Series and Donald Trump is the new President-Elect of the United States?
No. Way.It actually happened. 
Fingers crossed Trump is just the biggest troll in America and ends up becoming the greatest president we've ever had. *please* 
I don't ever want to be told I need experience for a job ever again. 
Must be the one of the most embarrassing defeats in political history for Clinton.
The Simpsons joke came true...
YouTube comments represent this country more accurately than I thought.
I have only seen one or two Trump supporters on my facebook feed until today. Now just about every post is thanking God Trump won. It is shocking how many supporters were in hiding.
More afraid that both the Senate and House are majority Republican along with the president than just Trump being elected president. 
2016 does seem to be the year, right or wrong, that people said 'no' to the establishment. An uncertain and risky future maybe. Well, Americans wanted to know what Brexit felt like.
Trump caused the GOP establishment to implode and for whatever reason the establishment Democrats thought it was a good idea to double down on business as usual instead of taking the progressive agenda seriously. No presidency, no Senate, no House. Good fucking job.
Can we go to JaRule to get his thoughts on the election? 
Chapter 34: How America Meme'd a Man Into office 
As a Canadian in Mexico right now, I'm frightened. I have to get back over 2 walls.
Breaking news : jokes about Trump being president not funny anymore
Are we in a Black Mirror episode about how being presumptuous with major decisions can backfire horribly if not taken seriously?
Imagine when interdimensional travel become possible..."Hey what dimension are you from?""F-402, Where Trump wins presidency in 2016"And the whole room goes silent. 
11,000 people voted for a dead fucking gorilla.
HOLY SHIT. DOES THIS MEAN THE 2020 ELECTION....WILL BE **Donald Trump VS Kanye West**?!What....the actual fuck.....Battle of the memes.
Celebrities, Reddit and other social media were so vocal about their support for Hillary that I actually thought she was going to win.Looks like conservatives are just quiet.We got M. Night Shamalangadingdonged.
We have Hoverboards, The Cubs won the World Series and now Biff Tannen is going to run the country.  Back to the Future ll was a goddamn documentary!
People are talking about Trump and I'm just here worried about Vice President MIKE PENCE. He's the real threat in my opinion..
Brexit 2: American Boogaloo
Trump won as the anti-establishment candidate. If only the Dems could have nominated an anti-establishment candidate... Oh wait.
What ever happened to that Bernie Sanders guy?
Kanye 2020 seems entirely possible now
Biff tannen just became president.
BARRY, YOU HAVE TO SAVE THE TIMELINE. GO BACK. PLEASE, BARRY. 
Random tip: go out and buy some newspapers today. Your grandchildren will be able to sell these headlines for a nice amount of money if you preserve them well.
I like how all of a sudden, /r/conspiracy acts like they never said the system was rigged. Fucking lol.
Did we just Brexit? 
I'm really worried about the environment....
First 9/11 and now 11/9.. These numbers aren't good for America. 
Just posting here coz noone will notice but I'm gay and I had to tell someone eventually
I have a very low opinion of the man and very little belief that this his winning will be good for the country but I'd love to be surprised.
>Grandpa, what was 2016 like?A fucking dumpster fire of a year kid.
Canadian female here. Anyone want a free green card?
"Brexit totally can't happen!"*One election later..***Brexit happens.**"No way will the people of USA elect Trump as POTUS!"*One election later..***Trump is POTUS.**I think it's our collective moral responsibility to now use the power of 2016 to get GRRM release his next book.Let's all think: "GRRM totally will not finish his books before the end of the year!"And by law of 2016, we'll get The Winds of Winter by the year's end.Then let's do it for another season of Firefly.
what about cubs?
There are already a bunch of articles about this exact topic. From what I gather from a few of them, pollsters were thrown off by the voters who didn't want to admit they supported Trump (being called "Shy Trump" voters), and by the rural white folks who tend not to respond to pollsters' calls but turned out in huge numbers in this election. I'm sure that this election will bring about a change in the pollster profession. Most of them got schooled yesterday. 
'Well there was this cartoon frog on the Internet...'
Well most presidents never get to follow through with most of the things they promised. Let's hope this is also the case.Oh fuck, I forgot republicans got the Senate and house. 
My guess is that he will abolish ACA. He has already backed away from the Muslim thing, and I don't think the wall will ever really get built.  But I do see him cracking down on illegal immigration. I am also curious to see if he pushes for charges against Hillary.  I think a lot of people would like to see a trial at least.  But will he even care about her anymore?  Or will he just leave her in his rear view mirror? 
I'm surprised no one else really commented on this. He was really struggling at the end. I got the impression he really needed to go to the toilet too. 
I thought so too. But then I remembered that it was nearly 3am. Gotta give a kid that young some slack. He probably wanted nothing more than to just go to bed.
Oh, geez!
He's gonna have to drink so much Bud Light Lime...
Don't forget Colbert as well
Can't wait for the next episode of LWT
Let's hope the Berenstein one did better...
I'm still remembering Berenstein.
Cubs are evil, we must burn them. 
What scares me the most is his opinion on climate change. That's something that really affect every single one of us. He can fuck up his own country as much as he likes, in my opinion. They voted for him, after all. But he could do critical damage to the progress we've already made and throw us back years, even decades.
Dormammu I've come to bargain
2016 is the Florida of years. 
If you told someone this would happen back in 2012, they would have thought you're insane.
>Cavaliers win NBA Finals>Cubs win World Series>A twitter meme wins the Presidency>Pope Francis and Patriach Kirill come together for the first time in a millennia>Controversial Rio OlympicsWhat a year. I'm sure I missed some. 
At least weed is legal in CA now...
Back to the future called it.  Also the World Series winning Chicago Cubs.
Back to coma
Moral: No lead is safe.- Warriors blow 3-1 lead to lose NBA championship- Indians blow 3-1 lead to lose MLB World Series- Hillary blows 4 point lead in polls to lose Presidential ElectionAlthough, one of these is not like the others...
I know right? I can't fucking believe it.Trump actually won. Trump will be our president. President Trump.This is the most... interesting? News I've ever read while taking a dump.The next few South Park episodes should be pretty interesting.
Given he's flipped flopped on TONS of social and political topics in the last few years, it's entirely possible. 
And that he doesn't die. Pence is worse than him. 
"I'm sorry, but you need ten years experience for this job starting out at minimum pay."Fuck you, Trump is president despite never holding office in any other sense of the word. I can sit at this computer for eight hours just fine.
I've never seen a more resounding "We don't like you". 
Oh she's done. for good. You cant come back from this kind of loss, ever. Kerry was the laughingstock of the democratic party, and he only lost George W.
The Simpsons are always right
It's not shocking at all to me.  As a bartender, there have been many a group discussion on politics while CNN played on the TVs.  Everyone would murmur how "both candidates suck" and how we're screwed.However, once the crowds cleared and there was nothing left but one-on-one conversation with the guests and I, their pro-Trump colors would show.
Ja? Ja?? Where is Ja!?!
You need a wife? I'm Spanish/Mexican and I can make some bomb tacos!
20+ years, hundreds of millions of dollars, all her political favors and influence, all leading up to a campaign where she was predicted to win easily, just to get annihilated?  I would image it will take her a while to regain enough composure to hide her anger and disappointment long enough to make a public appearance.
Yeap. She conceded over the phone. 
probably fleeing the country
It's actually funnier now for the rest of the world. 
Is this true? Source? 
I would like to reset the time line please....
That's the scary part to me too. Even if something were to happen and Trump were to step down, we would have *Pence,* who supports gay conversion therapy, very not pro choice, pro religion in government, etc. Trump is dangerous, but he seems to mostly want the title and the power to me, while Pence knows what he wants to do.
What I could only ever see as a joke has now become a reality. I feel like I'm being trolled by the entire American population. 
Hopefully that becomes a trend that continues. I didn't vote for him but I hope he does a good job.
I know right.  Maybe hes actually some kind of super intelligent savant who was just playing the fool all these years
Clinton campaign made the party stonewall him out of the nomination
Trump vs Kanye in 2020Like seriously what the actual fuck
Please, stop now before it becomes real. This started as a joke too.
And the best part is that it's 9/11 for most of the world.
Day before inauguration is 1/19...
I do, but I'm also female. Is that okay?
Lol you wild Wyd?
We joke, but the Internet had a huge impact on this campaign. It gave Trump a platform by which he turned from a laughing stock to a legitimate contender. "Discuss the influence of Internet memes in the politics of 2016" could definitely be a history question in a few decades. 
And he gets to break the tie in the supreme court in his favor.  There are effectively zero checks on his power at this point.
V
I don't think I heard anything Trump said. It was just hilarious watching his head bob up and down and him snap back awake lol
Yeah I realized that as well but it was still funny to see lol. He did well because we all know at his age he was also bored to death.
An East coast state got recreational weed, a southern state got full medical, AND WE GET THR MULTI MILLION DOLLAR ONLY ONE COPY EVER WUTANG ALBUM?this is not a half bad consolation prize

Don't forget literally the whole entertainment industry

Buckle-up buckaroos.
This whole fucking *year* has been Poe's Law incarnate.
What's Poe's Law?
Pence is insurance against assassination.
Thats what should be taken away from this. This was the democrats election to lose, all they had to do was put up fucking anyone else. Just some bland everyman or woman. But nope. They wanted a Clinton. 
Kerry became Secretary of State after his loss. Not bad. 
Because people don't want to be made fun of for supporting something 
I'm taking applications, in other words let's see about those tacos!
I'm surprised it wasn't by email.

I like how Florida voted for trump and weed it's like they know they are gonna need some serious help relaxing in the coming years
It was on twitter, they said about 11,000 people wrote Harambe in, sounds like a lot but America does have 300 million people. I'm sure there are a lot of other goofy write ins
This episode of Black Mirror is a little too weird for me. 
Exactly, I didn't vote for him either, but his tone and the content of his message make me hopeful. He mentioned he wanted to bring all Americans together and hopefully he will actually work toward that and not disappoint us. 
Stage 3: Bargaining
Yeah, and it also happens to be 9/11/16.
19+1+1+1+1=23!
The Dems can filibuster everything for four years. That's really their only gambit.The alternative is to let them run the country undivided and see what happens. The downside for them is that 2018, which would ordinarily be a great year for them, does not have a favorable electoral map since they have to defend a lot of purple seats Obama won in 2012.
Hahaha, I was looking at this the whole time too! Feel really bad for Baron and Melania, being a political family took them by surprise.There was one point where he scrunched his whole face up because he was holding in a yawn!
Also got self-assisted suicide in CO, don't forget about that. 
It's not all bad.  The entertainment industry just got 4 years worth of easy material to work with :)
Dormanmu I've come to bargain
Hell, earlier today I really couldn't fathom it.
Even yesterday it did being perfectly honest...
And Massachusetts 
* Trump gets reelected.
With the first ever unanimous MVP. 
Bowie dead, Cubs win World Series, Donald Trump is honest to god president. This is a satire's idea of the future.
I don't think anyone *Wanted* her, she just refused to let anyone else take her potential presidency.
Maybe Hillary Clinton can try her hand at Secreta -- oh wait.
And 4 years ago the GOP was having an autopsy because it was doomed due to demographics. 
If we're going by stereotypes, I can also clean the hell out of a house so there's that. 
Florida, Arkansas, and North Dakota are all red states that voted for marijuana decriminaliztion but only for medical reasons. Only blue states voted for recreational marijuana. 
I can understand this in other countries where voting is mandatory, and people who don't want to vote are forced to. But actually going out of your way to go out, line up on a Tuesday evening and vote for a dead gorilla is some next level shitposting. 
Pro wrestler Matt Hardy got thousands of votes too lol 
When he brought up Hillary, I was expecting bashing. Was pleasantly surprised and I sincerely hope he keeps that kind of tone in his presidency..
Rotate 180 degrees and its the same, minus the slashes of course. :D
I'm pretty sure 19+1+1+1+1 is less than 25852016738884976640000.
To be honest I think it took most of america by surprise. I'm really curious how the rest of the world that is on reddit will react to this.
> self-assisted suicideSo... suicide?
On the other side, House of Cards and South Park are fucked.
Dormammu I've come to bargain

Sometime last year we seem to have switched into a parallel universe
Uhh the DNC sure as shit wanted her
If only she would have refused a little harder and maybe, idk, campaign in places like Wisconsin.
Eh it's a vote of no confidence. I feel like it's saying I don't like anybody or I am not informed enough to vote so here's my vote anyway that I support the process but I don't believe I'm  being represented here.
I need a source on this please! My buddy was a huge Matt Hardy fan but doesn't watch anymore. He would love to see this.
Agreed, by all measures, that was a decent speech and a good starting tone hoping he can drop the 'crazy' act and act like a business mogul that is now fucking president of the U.S
If he proves that to be true, I will happily eat the "anyone but Trump" hat I have been wearing.
Dormammu I've come to bargain
Right? Sanders was cheated out of the damn primary because the DNC definitely wanted Clinton.
I live in Wisconsin and I know multiple people that flipped from Hillary to Bernie because her lack of campaigning. Bernie had 3 rallies at my campus and Hillary had one private speech. They also did not end up voting for her today either
It's up to Americans to hold him to his good promises (term limits, dropping TPP, finance regulation etc) and make him drop his bad ones (wall, Muslim ban, immigrant roundup, global warming denial etc).
RemindMe! 4 Years

Global warming denial is probably his worst 'promise', especially as he considers it a Chinese Hoax.

I think this is a sex joke. Pascal's law or the principle of transmission of fluid-pressure (also Pascal's Principle) is a principle in fluid mechanics that states that a pressure change occurring anywhere in a confined incompressible fluid is transmitted throughout the fluid such that the same change occurs everywhere. -googleI think he's asking if you can feel the change of pressure inside your vagina when penetrated.

I was one of 3 women in the class and was slightly annoyed by his misogynistic attitude.  One day he asked the guy next to me to explain a concept.  The student was stumbling over the answer, so I grabbed his hand, held it up to his face and said, "No, Frank.  Explain it to your girlfriend."The professor never used that phrase again.

I'm fairly certain women are not an incompressible fluid. 
Most people's vaginas are not full of fluid.
Can't someone make a simple scientific query without accusation of sexual connotation?
Great, now that we've figured it out, we just need to condense that understanding into a snappy, easy to read one-liner to reap thousands of well-earned upvotes. Shit.

My organic final is in two days and I *barely* understand E1 and E2. I'm so fucked it's not even funny.
Just took my ochem final a few days ago... What about those exceptions though?Just to name a few common ones:tertiary alkyl halide --> (KOH,EtOH) --> mainly E2 (and not E1/SN1)2 benzyl groups stabilize secondary carbocations, so they undergo more SN1 instead of SN2Also, on a quick note, SN2 has inversion, whereas SN1 produces a racemic mixtureOchem is hard...Good luck!
Nope, not sharing my Dynamics homework, either.
Found the virgin
I suspect vagina juice is at least mostly incompressible 
This is science, you've got to do stuff like imagine a perfectly spherical, frictionless vagina, in a total vacuum. Then you can do science at it properly.
People are mostly full of fluid
Air is a fluid
Not when you specify one gender. Then it's going to be sexual.

The wetness is evenly spread though.
I was just hoping you might give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the southern colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War, the economic modalities, especially in the southern colonies, could be most aptly described as agrarian pre-capitalist.

Okay, so this is very incomplete but you're in an emergency situation.  E1 is going to happen when you have sulfuric acid catalyzed elimination and E2 is going to happen when you have base catalyzed elimination.If you have any questions feel free to PM, I tutor organic chemistry all the time.
If you don't understand elimination mechanisms, things are gonna get brutal in the coming months. 
Jesus I already took my ochem final!
Already passed the class, friend.
So I want to check if that is true. I need a degent sample size, so if there's any girls out there willing to contribute that would be great. 
Would you feel a frictionless vagina? Like at all?
Mostly fluid is not people
So's your face.
Yes.
Holy shit you made my day thanks friend fellow siege engineer 
to shreds you say
We are ALL shitposters in this blessed day :-)
maybe every post is shit.
Vee muzt deel vith it. 
You're pretty dense, huh?
Though wetness may be even (same amount of fluid per volume, as most liquids are incompressible), going deeper into this thread and I can feel the potential (for puns) dropping, and the pressure (to perform) increasing. 
Of course that's your contention. You're a first-year grad student; you just got finished reading some Marxian historian, Pete Garrison probably. You're gonna be convinced of that 'till next month when you get to James Lemon. Then you're going to be talking about how the economies of Virginia and Pennsylvania were entrepreneurial and capitalist way back in 1740. That's gonna last until next year; you're gonna be in here regurgitating Gordon Wood, talkin' about, you know, the pre-revolutionary utopia and the capital-forming effects of military mobilization.

How much can you get for a 3 year old, 100k karma acct?
I don't get how that works. How do ad companies even use reddit accounts? Pushing products on redditors works as well as trying to teach a tiger quantum mechanics. Out of curiosity, how much do reddit accounts go for anyways? 
That is harder than you think.

Ew. Me and my calculator are exclusive. Go'way.
It's mostly water, water is incompressible. Therefore vag juice is mostly incompressible.
Yes, even without friction, the pristine baby cannon still applies force via constriction, which you can feel as pressure on your knobby bits.

"Reddit users admitting to using reddit rather than studying for his finals, desperately begs reddit for help."
Hmm, I like it.
Just started working at escape the room and we have rules about not jumping out the windows and not sticking keys into wall sockets because it has all happened before.
At our establishment we have a room called "Jailbreak" with a fake door towards the very end (it's covered with plywood). this girl takes one look at it and says "jail...break...." and charges the door full force and breaks through. 
Someone cleared all the boxes and locks off of a table in the corner, laid down on it, and went to sleep until the group escaped.
We give people a box for them to bring in, so they can store their belongings while they play. One time, about halfway in, an inquisitive older man started going through their own stuff. He pulled out a purse and shouts guys "guys, I found some... this is our stuff isn't it" It was hilarious. 
It was only a one-off escape room I designed for a university society event, but one guy was so desperate to find clues he tried to disassemble the wooden casing around a radiator. It scared me because I didn't own the room we were doing this in, so I could have been on serious trouble.
Did a space stationed themed room. We got paired with a mother and her adult sons. The sons did just fine but mom was clueless. There was a prop fire extinguisher on the wall that she was CERTAIN had to be for something. For an hour she wandered around aimlessly carrying a fire extinguisher. 
The guy gave some rules to us when we were doing the room. The first rule he gave us was "Please keep your clothes on."
Obligatory not an employee, but I'm sure my friend group looked pretty weird to them. We did the one where you get stuck in handcuffs and have to unlock them, but we couldn't get the key to work on one of my friends. We assumed that there was another key to get the last person, for some reason, and left her attached to the wall for like twenty minutes. Turns out her cuffs were broken and we had to pause the game so the employees could come get her out with bolt cutters. They were shocked that we'd just left her there but we thought it was part of it!
One time I did an escape room with some people from work. The final clue was "what time does Bible Study meet?" and a 4 digit combo lock. After we couldn't find any useful clues I just went over to the lock and put in 0600, 0615, etc. It opened at 0700. Apparently we were supposed to look out the window to where the church across the street had their schedule printed on a big sign. According to the attendant nobody had ever tried that before.
Actual escape room employee here.One couple couldn't agree on how to solve the puzzles and broke up inside the room.Another couple had the guy surprise the girl with a proposal. Another couple got a horror- themed escape room and just sat on the floor and cuddled. They didn't look scared. They didn't bother to solve anything either. They just cuddled with all the creepy props and sound effects surrounding them. I guess they couldn't find a creepy motel to cuddle in...?
I currently work at an escape roomWe had a youth group come in and play some rooms and halfway in we smell this horrendous smell (our control room is right next to the room)When we got them out we noticed they built a little tent and inside was two giant mounds of shit. Kid took a shit in the room, and we approached the adults and said "oh that wasn't us we thought you put that in there." So they denied it, even though the kid had brown stains down the back of his pants.Our owners called, they confessed and we deep cleaned the room while they got charged for it.Great times 
I'm not an escape room employee, but I asked this exact same question when I went to an escape room a few months ago. The guy working there said a man pulled out a pocket knife and started cutting the carpet out, convinced that there were clues under there
Not an employee, but partcipated in an escape room in which a key was stuck to a filing cabinet by one of those weird little metal puzzles. The key was to open a drawer in a desk on the opposite side of the room.No one could get the metal puzzle undone, so the guys just picked up the filing cabinet and carried it over to the desk. It was a mob themed room so we received a phone call warning about rearranging the furniture that was hilariously in character. We escaped the room :) 
I had a group pull out a tool kit. They unscrewed every furniture to find some combinations. They didn't escape and I made them fix everyrhing, took them about an hour.
A guy didn't help any of his friends he just sat and ate 2 pints of ice cream which he had snuck past me.
Some dude was eating this chick's ass when we checked on them
I went for a job interview at an escape room. My group didn't escape the room, so we didn't go through to the next round. I think they were using the process to get people to test new puzzles for free.
I work at a different escape game and have had customers drop kick doors,vomit all over the place but the one that takes the cake is a couple booked our latest game around midnight. After I did my intro and left the room he proceeded to bend her over a prop and take her from behind. I called in several times to no avail. So for the next hour I had to listen to them grunt an moan. 
We had a group come in last year who were doing really well, got about halfway through the game and then hit a wall. One guy left the room to go out to his car, and when he came back he had a whole 30 rack in his bag. The whole team proceeded to sit in a circle and use their remaining 30minutes to kill the entire thing. It was pretty damn impressive to watch. 
The "zombie" in our room cornered me while he was on all fours. Then he started rubbing the top of his head on my crotch and grunting and breathing really heavily. He did this for a good 10-15 seconds while I just stood there, frozen. At that point I said "well I guess if you can do that I'm out right?" And awkwardly shuffled past him (from the corner where he had me pinned) to the dead corner.It was a real hit for my co-workers to see that.
Escape room employee here.We have a zombie themed escape room where an actor dresses as a zombie and is chained to the corner of the room, and every 5 minutes he gets an extra foot of chain.Somebody once used the props to distracts the zombie (a chain hook used as a fishing hook on rope and pole) and stabed the zombie in the eye, the zombie screamed and the guy kept doing it thinking the scream was fake.
Not an Employee, but one time my group of friends walked into Breakout KC, and my friend proceeded to turn off the main circuit breaker. All the doors and some of the traps were locked electronically. So basically we beat the escape room in a record 9 seconds.
I've seen a divorce, a man came out as gay to his friends in the room. Various misuses of the props as in somebody not knowing how to you use a microscope or a MAGNET. I got mooned once. I think the msot wild stuff though, happens in the back room. The people rumning your room probably have 10x more fun than you do. Some weird shit happens there 
The easiest way to make our life miserable is the propose at one of these. It happened 3 time in the 9 months I worked there. It makes it so we have to get you to finish, and some people.... aren't smart enough
*Technically*, if you jump out of the window you do escape the room!
I mean I guess she figured it out right?
So is that not the correct way out?
Lateral thinking.
Shes a genius.
The files are IN the computer! 
I don't understand people sometimes. No matter how many times i've told them before the game, that climbing is strictly forbidden, the first thing they do is climb over the first obstacle
That's great. Were they apologetic about the whole thing?
How do you put a spy in? Isn't it obvious the one guy not part of the group is the spy. 
Sounds like something Stanley would do
This exact thing happened to our group in an escape room a few months ago.  I guess some of the people weren't listening in the beginning and missed that the box by the door was for our coats, purses, etc...So about 5 minutes into the escape room, someone in our group drags out a purse, dumps it on the floor, and proceeds to go though the wallet.  At one point, he says loudly "hey, this wallet has a lot of money in it" and we all turned and saw what he was doing, including the owner of the purse.  She was horrified.
I had the exact opposite experience, I was playing an escape room and my group all ignored an iPad that was sitting on a table because we all assumed it belonged to one of us.
The bright yellow is the problem. If you want someone to leave it alone you have to make it as dull as possible. Like don't even use all caps. Source: made panels with buttons, the wrong ones always got pushed first if they were colorful.

this is so much worse than all the sex ones
> fire extinguisher on the wall that she was CERTAIN had to be for something. For an hour she wandered around aimlessly carrying a fire extinguisher. Mom sounds like she played a lot of early 1990s computer adventure games: USE FIRE EXTINGUISHER ON DOOR"That doesn't work that way."USE FIRE EXTINGUISHER ON STAIRS"Nothing happens."
"That's not on fire"
group dynamics suck
> THE FUCKING ZOMBIEThere's your mistake right there, should've just used a regular zombie so as to avoid giving guys the wrong idea.
My friend's boyfriend completely ignored all the females in the room or talked condescendingly over them when we did an Exit room. There was a station where there was a counter that started at 24. It had four items that could be placed in any order, and it would count down until you got all the possible combinations. I told him that's what the 24 meant and he loudly and rudely proclaimed I was wrong because 4x4=16. I tried to explain it was 4! = 24 but he ignored me. I ended up just doing the puzzle behind his back while he was busy with some other puzzle. 
That's incredible 
> I guessed PENIS, it was PENIS. Case closed.  Worst episode of Sherlock ever.
What's a one-hitter?
> you rotten childNoooo stop pleasee
My group was guilty of not leaving after beating the room. We had found the cure to stop the virus, but we were still looking for clues. The game master had to come on the intercom and say "ESCAPE! ESCAPE! ESCAPE!"  
Take off clothes, get kicked out, room escaped. Winner!
Well crap, I'd never know how to get out. The only way I deal with stressful situations is to get naked. 
At least he went in A toilet.

My friends and I did the one in Dallas. You know the rule where you're out when the zombie touches you. Well, one of my friends had the idea of holding a rug in between him and the zombie. Technically he couldn't touch you. At one point we draped the rug over him. We got out and the actor said that no one has done that before. 
Your family sounds lovely and you don't sound lame at all. Congrats on the nuptials!!
"Sorry brenda, we can't all escape."
Weren't they curious the minute all but one person was unlocked? Or they just assumed you just didn't really like that friend. Believing you asshats all thought, "Oh fuck that bitch, let's just leave her cuffed!"
Oh man. Imagine breaking up in a room you can't get out of, then having to work together to solve puzzles to get away from each other. Was it fun to watch? This will be the plot of a rom-com in 6 months
Escape room 'the ultimate relations tester'

/u/fuckswithducks what is your opinion on this duck?

When I played, our train of logic  pointed to taking apart a hanging light. The people knocked on the door loudly and told us not to dismantle live electronics. 
Did the man happen to go by the name of Dwight Schrute
I own an escape room and we've had people rip up all types of flooring. You think they'd stop when they reached underlayment but no.
Did he find the clue? Did he win? Did he have to pay for it?
Can't blame you.
I put on the prisoner uniform in the one I went to. Why is it there if you're not supposed to wear it?
They say wearing a labcoat some how makes people think more critically, perhaps the space outfit got you in the space escapin mood?
Some people are boring, WHY WOULDN'T YOU PUT THE SPACESUIT ON?! *CMOOOOON*
I can't even imagine how you would be the first person to do it. My first instinct would be to put it on. 
The first escape room I did, we apologized for the mess we made as we were leaving - as we had piled everything up on the table in the center of the room, rather than returning everything to where we found it.I now understand why the escape room employee laughed.
Usually it's because it is obvious when a prop has been tampered with before. When you see a row of books, dusty and all placed neatly in order, you don't think much of it. I spent ten minutes looking through one book at an espace room because it was pulled out slightly and more clean than the other books. Turns out, it was not a prop at all, and the announcer had to tell me twice to stop.
That is so hilarious, like what good could it do to drink it when you can just pour it out. 
Couldn't the one dude just have played the room and when he came back with his company he'd already have the answers?
And then you kept checking on them.
Can't even tell those guys to get a room, they're already in one.
Seems like it would be courteous in this case for the couple to give the operator an extra large tip first and prepare them for what's to come.
The only thing I've ever heard measured in racks are ribs but somehow I imagine you mean beer?
How'd Selena do?
More please! I love escape games.
"Uhh shit, umm...use length of copper wire on...houseplant? No? Dammit. Use postcard on house plant. Fuck!"
And if you stick metal in electric sockets, you win on escaping life!
there is money between the space of the door and the wood, they're supposed to combine it with other props in the room for the code to get out. 
What was the obstacle? If it isn't supposed to be climbed over, it should be designed in a way where people don't think to climb over it. 
Yeah I don't understand either, maybe I'm just missing something, but how do you plant a spy in the group like this?
now i'm imagining an episode of the office where michael brings everyone to an escape room 
"Ah do naht get paid enough to escape this room, Michael."
I see this a lot too. One of our rooms has a jacket in it, and some people just assume its one of theirs.
"What's your job?""Oh, I make panels with buttons."
It's amazing what people will do to get out of Coventry. 
*turns page*
There's sex ones??
This is the most confounding behavior in this thread so far.
Similarly, I was doing a Jailbreak room with some friends and we got through pretty much the whole room but cannot for the love of god get our handcuffs off. One person tried to take mine off with a broken keychain we found in a cabinet but I told him that probably wasn't the intended purpose of the keychain. Eventually, we're almost through with the room when one friend reaches into the pocket of his orange jumpsuit and finds the handcuff key. It was supposed to be the first thing we found. 
My ex mother in law does this deliberately with puzzles. When getting close to the end she hides a piece just so she can put the last piece of the puzzle in. 
Frank?
Might have been easier to clean if he didn't. 
I don't think that would have mattered to the drunk guy... 
Because of the implication. 
Is that so weird?? Seems like a smart thing to inquire about. 
You can get out at anytime. There's usually a door that's not part of the puzzle. 
That would be IKEA, actually.
And what a shitty place to propose
I think the idea is that the teammate on the phone sacrificed himself (turned into a chicken and couldn't talk) in order to deliver the hint involving acting like a chicken.
They're too weird for me.  It's even weirder since duck penises are corkscrew-shaped, so this is just a human penis pasted on a duck.  I imagine they float upright well with a rudder like that, though.
At an escape room we went to we started taking apart a photo frame with a "do not disassemble" sticker on it. They seemed quite annoyed but in fairness they also had "do not open" writing on a lot of things you had to open to solve the puzzle.
We only have minutes to harvest!
Oh shit and then each time you repair it, it probably looks more like it's a clue, so people rip it up again! 
I'm not sure. The escape room employee said that he was scared to enter the room to tell the guy to stop. If I'm remembering correctly, he was asked to leave
Yea that actually sounds like a legit step to solve the puzzle
Why was this knife here if I wasn't supposed to murder the rest of the group with it? 
Why didn't you listen to them the first time?
they automatically refill if you try to do that without drinking them, DUH
Yes
Yup :/ that they in all fairness paid for.
One time I had a group of kind of redneck people come in and they all smelled funny. We assumed it was some weird pot and just got them in the room. One of the weirder gentlemen went outside in the middle of the game and came back in and released a large cloud of smoke into the room. After they failed to escape, we took their picture and the same guy screams "All right guys, let's go smoke some more meth!" We still don't have rules against this. 
If you played point and click games in the 90s you know those might actually be things you'd have to do in some of them!
It's pretty difficult to electrocute yourself with modern sockets. Not impossible but you have to try.
Her way was faster
The solution here is barbed wire.
So did the professor let you take his name off of it?I had an undergrad professor refuse to let us take a non-contributing person's name off of a project. We did it anyways and told him it would be academic dishonesty to put the person's name on it.  Sadly, I bet the professor credited the kid anyways, he was adament for some reason.
I'm a HS teacher.   I put the human leech kids into a group together.   It's like our own classroom version of hunger games.  
That would have made a great episode
One chick rode naked through the streets on a horse
He was the guy. 
(your username is student of jorvik)
yeah I haven't gotten to them yet neither. onwards we go
I gotta flush my shirt. 
But now he's added legitimacy to the prop.
Similar situation with a bar I was in, except it isn't well known. The bar staff said we have to find our own way in. Only after rescuing us from the cellar room  (once) and the electrical utility room (twice) did they relent and show us the way. They now have locks on those other hidden doors. 
Definitely smart to look at the books! But they are REAL published books, they have page numbers and words. If you need to use them you will probably have a clue/colormarker/hints.  No escape room should make you look through 10+ books blindly.
Reality has never stood in the way of a rom-com plot before.
We've had around 3 proposals in the escape rooms so far. The first one was really nice. The guy met us weeks beforehand and asked us to personalize our prettiest escape room. All the clues were about their relationship like where they first met, first kiss, etc and at the end of it all, was the ring.The second was shitty. We were not informed at all. The girl was chained and blindfolded in a small, black box room. No idea why he thought that would be a good place to propose.The third was hello kitty- themed. I just heard about it from my coworkers but w h y
I've seen proposals at TGI Fridays and Logan's Roadhouse, so there are worse places to propose. 
See I would have assumed I was supposed to decapitate the chicken
But then why did it have a dick?
So you'll fuck a rubber duck, but only if it's a female rubber duck? 
Stanley would sit in the room doing cross words and when the staff asked him if he is lost he'll flatly say "I'm not finished yet". When he is done he solves the room cause he is good at puzzles 
So you're saying that cutting up the carpet with a pocket knife *was* the key to escaping the room?!
He's the only one who survives when they complete the puzzle and the whole station rapidly depressurizes.
I'd totally have the glass/polycarbonate/acrylic on the helmet have some treatment on it for revealing hidden messages. 
The key is inside them!
"Fuck you. This book is growing on me. I'll read it to the end. I am a paying costumer."
The book was unlike the other books, and the pages were torn. I thought the ripped off page numbers would be a clue. Turns out it was just a fucked up book.
Should have told them they should check Pornhub to get a video of them 'finding clues'
Keep em coming, this is fascinating 
huh. this rubber chicken has a pulley in the middle.
She was doing a speedrun.
That's just evil, and clever! How does this work out? 
It's part of a larger company wide competition between branches. Near the beginning of the episode, Dwight openly suggests tying up the escape room attendant and torturing him for the information. The camera would then pan quickly over to a slightly nervous looking teenage boy and then back to Michael who briefly ponders it before telling Dwight to get serious.
That's fucking ridiculous. 
No, No! No one's in danger. They're not going to be forced to have sex with me... but they can't say no, because of the implication.
How did you end up in the utility room twice?
The first one is actually genius
Chained and blindfolded? That makes my country's escape rooms sound so mild
So I have to ask, having only been to a single, pirate-themed escape room...   Exactly what kind of escape room has one of the participants chained and blindfolded??
I'm curious to know what the answers to each of those proposals was. 
Friday's would be perfect. If she says yes you can celebrate with endless cheese sticks and potato skins. If she rejects you then you can wallow in self pity with endless cheese sticks and potato skins. It's a classic win/win scenario 
I don't fuck my duckies, it destroys them after a couple years and I don't want to ruin all the good ones I have left.
'But *could* I?' he wondered,  'and *should* I?' he thought -  'It's present,' he pondered,  'and *surely* I ought?  It's *clearly* included,  and *why* would it be -  If not with a purpose intended for me?'Perhaps it's a pointer?  Perhaps it's a clue?  I'll *never* be sure,  But I'll know when I do!  I'll do it!' he whispered,  'I'll do it!' he cried.  He sat in his suit and he watched as they died.&nbsp;^^^:)
When you think about it, the Saw movies are just really extreme Escape The Room scenarios
But he told you to stop.
As much as I wanted to record it I can't ! But it would've been great for pornhub. Definitely would almost be black couch worthy. 
Then Jim argues with Dwight and gets Dwight to say that he's impervious to all torture techniques and gets Dwight to agree to being subject to torture where in which Jim can get Dwight to confess his secret beet sauce recipe which turns into Jim tying Dwight to a chair in an empty room and then just leaving him there 
In some way or another for a reason I don't know why, this reminds me of the "game/competition" where you go door-to-door starting with a dollar store item, and get people to trade you for equal or more value if they want it. You see who ends up with the best item at the end of the day.Some people start with a toothbrush and end up with a piano or TV.
The second one might be making the best of a bad situation.
I dunno, the second one sounds better. She can't say no... because of the implication.
Yeah, OP that sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen. You sure that's a public attraction you're working at and not a BDSM meetup?
We went to one based on the saw movies where we were all chained to the walls/ chairs and blindfolded. Some of us had a little play in our chains.  So there would be a clue near one person, who would call it out and it would allow someone else to open a padlock or locked combination box to get keys. It was exciting. 
1) Yes2) *mmmph*3) B-b-baka
Sounds to me like you're just looking to be in a relationship with potato skins and cheese sticks.
Wait wait wait, you can get endless cheese sticks and potato skins at Fridays now? I haven't been to one in years...
U/doesntfuckwithducks
That tiny smiley face is horrifying 
That you didn't sign up for
At some point we get a camera pan to Creed standing in the corner of the room visibly sweating. He points to the camera above him.  "I did something like this in Kyoto for a lot of money a few years ago. Let me know if anybody brings in chili peppers."
It's like when Dwight traded for the magic beans. 
The third one sounds like something my fiance would like. For some reason she absolutely loves hello kitty. I dont get it, but if I get her something hello kitty themed, it makes her smile, so thats more than enough incentive for me.
Are you going to hurt women?
You have to remember it's fucksWITHducks not just fucksducks ;)
Many escape rooms use don't touch stickers, usually a hand print with a slash through it or something similar. But once you think you have everything labeled or included in the rules, people surprise you with new ways to be destructive.
:) 
But it's free.
Moments later, Kevin claims he is starving despite having been in the escape room for less than 3 minutes. 
Dennis: *sees old woman giving him stinkeye* "Well I don't know what you're looking at me like that for, you're certainly in no danger!"Mac: So they **are** in danger!
No one is in any danger! What are you not understanding about this?
Jesus I had this question at the end of a job interview. Here's the joke I told (I got the job):Two engineering students were walking across campus when one said, "Where did you get such a great bike?"The second engineer replied, "Well, I was walking along yesterday minding my own business when a beautiful woman rode up on this bike. She threw the bike to the ground, took off all her clothes and said, "Take what you want."The first engineer nodded approvingly, "Good choice; the clothes probably wouldn't have fit."
A farmer and his dog are herding sheep. They finish and his dog says "I counted 40 sheep". The farmer replies, "That's odd I only got 37". The dog replies "I rounded them up".

So there's two blue whales drinking at a bar. The first turns to the second and says (Now you make whale song noises as awkwardly and as cringe-inducingly as possible, until everyone in the room is clearly a little bit uncomfortable with how long this has gone on)To which the second whale turns to the first, and says: "Frank, go home, you're drunk."

We have no leprechaun nuns in this convent.""And mother, do you have any leprechaun nuns in all of Ireland?""No my son, I don't believe there's a single leprechaun nun in the whole church!"The first leprechaun rounds on his companion and shouts "AH TOL' YE YOU'D BEEN FOOKIN' A PENGUIN".
A guy goes to the doctor about a rash he's had for a while. The doctor finally enters the room and takes a look at the guy and says "Well sir, I'm going to have to advise you to stop masturbating."  "Why's that doc?" the guy asked.  And the doctor said, "So I can examine you."
Mickey and Minnie Mouse went in to see a marriage counsellor. The therapist first met with each of them one-on-one, then brought them together for a joint session."Let me start by restating in a neutral, non-threatening way, the concerns each of you raised in your individual sessions.  Mickey, Minnie says you are quick to anger, and suspicious of her friendships with other males. Minnie, Mickey is concerned about your mental health. He thinks you're crazy."At this Mickey jumped in.

"A gator ripped off me leg while burying gold in Florida." He asks next how he lost his hand. "A shark bit ma hand off while I was throwing the gator into the sea."Amazed at the pirate's bravery, he asked how the man lost his eye. "A seagull shit in me eye." The sailor was shocked and asked, "a bird shit in your eye and you lost it??"The pirate said, "it was my first day with the hook."

The absolute MOST important part of this joke is to take a massive breath before the second whale speaks, like you're about to go off again

In a similar vein, three logicians walk into a bar. The bartender asks, "Do you all want beers?" The first one says, "I don't know." The second one says, "I don't know," and the third one says, "Yes!"
Yeah but using the same cup used by infinite people are disgusting
Other version of this joke:An infinite number of mathematicians walk into a bar. Bartender asks, "what can I get you guys"? First mathematician says "I'd like a pint of beer please."

He pours himself one twelfth of a pint, drinks it and says "you know, you guys really ought to know your limits."

Good day to be the first mathematician.
I know right!? The others were good, this was incredible.
First 2 guys make typical and useful wishes while the last guy makes uncommon and bizarre wishes.  We as the audience expect the 3rd guy to have some clever plan on how to do something even better than the wishes of either of the other men.  But then we just get the imagery of a guy with spinning arms and a nodding head walking into the bar.
And of course it's Karl.
I'm so uncomfortable and happy watching that.
That is Karl Stefanovic, a national treasure! He has some hilarious moments on live Morning TV.

It's funnier if you think that the dog doesn't need a tree to pee because he's a dog, he can go where ever. The joke is he's holding his pee for no reason, or that his dog logic thinks he can't pee unless there's a tree.Or if you refer to a couple getting lost driving somewhere and one says they'll pee their pants if they don't find a bathroom soon. It's funny to think dogs share that experience.

The follow up to The Young Pope. 
I swear the internet literally has something for everything. Like if I were to say candy cane bubblegum sword fighting bear-men. Probably already exists.
I wasn't implying that it would be difficult to remember the specific sequence of events, just that I'm going to want to recall that this joke exists when the time comes that I want to tell a joke.
I like this version more. The punchline was more to the point so I knew immediately it was an anti joke, versus the other one left me wondering if I misread something

I knew the poem was a rendition of this joke from the first line but was still delighted. Top notch, Sprog. :)(My only complaint is that it needs to be much longer, for the full frustration-effect of the joke. Still fantastic though.)
If one of the logicians doesn't want a beer then he would say no. But if he does want a beer, he can't say "yes" because the question was do you all want beers. So the first two say I don't know - meaning they want a beer but don't know if the others do. The third one would then know that he and the other two all want beers and can answer yes.
Still don't get it...

I am not very cool (long story; very overprotective parents + orchestra-nerd-turned-science-geek-turned-medical-student) and had to google this reference... THIS SONG IS FANTASTIC AND THE FOO FIGHTERS ARE FANTASTIC WHERE HAS THIS SHIT BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!??
I feel like my life just found its purpose. That was to lead you to the Foo Fighters music.  I will tell this story to my children. 
I never trusted my ex bf's uncle. I just knew he was trouble and had issues with him visiting or my ex visiting him. He was arrested in Florida last year for production and selling meth and hosting a prostitution ring out of his home. Later learned the ex partook in all the activities at his uncle's home. Apparently my gut was right about the uncle, but not about my ex. 
My snake did.  I had the sweetest, chillest ball python who never nipped or hissed or reared up or anything.  She'd just curl up with you and hang out.  One day a friend brought over some of his friends and all of a sudden my snake went nuts - standing straight up in her tank and hissing at one of the guys.  A couple of weeks later, that dude robbed my house while I was out of town.RIP Guinevere.  A good snake.
My childhood best friend's mother's boyfriend. He creeped me out and I hated being over her house when he was there. Her family went on a ski trip with mine, and my parents both thought he was great-funny, charming etc. They didn't understand why I didn't like him. Years later, my best friend told me that he sexually abused her starting when she was about 9.  I probably was picking up on her fear of him. 
My mom brought her new boyfriend over the house one time for me to meet him. He weirded me out. I can't tell you why but I didn't like him. Maybe it's because he was a 35 year old man who wore visors. Friendly and funny guy who my family liked. A year into their relationship he beat the hell out of my mom and stole her dog. Probably the closest I've come to an assassination attempt. Edit 1: I didn't go after him as not to implicate my mom. Also, we got her dog back :) Edit 2: Yep, he's in jail.
While in the Army we moved into a new house in upstate New York. We were being neighborly and talked to a guy across the street. He had 5 kids. No wife. He also had multiple neighborhood kids playing in the yard. He told us We can always send ours over. He gave us both this horrible feeling so we smiled and gtfo. About a year later my wife told me (i was in Kandahar) that his kids were taken from him. He had been molesting them at least ever since his wife died. 
My older mother got this "boyfriend."  Mom was in her 60s and the boyfriend was probably mid-sixties also.  One day she brought him over to my house, where I was a single mom to a 3 year old boy.  I'm usually friendly, or at the least polite, but I looked at that guy and said "no, don't come in my house."  My mom was SHOCKED. She said "Wang_Dipthong, this is Blah Blah, my boyfriend!"   I told her I was sorry. I shut the door. About 6 months later he went to jail for raping boys. 
Exwifes second husband. Took 10 years but i was right. He is currently on year 1 of a 32 year sentence for repeated rape of his daughter.  
Yes, but I suppressed it so quickly and fast, because I felt like it was horribly ungracious since she was being so friendly.  Over the next couple years, she became my closest friend in the new town I had moved to.  Then the following couple years it vacillated between being close, but just feeling like she really didn't want me around or was messing with me a little bit.  Turns out she was having an affair with my husband and was literally intentionally driving me crazy.
My former handball coach:Everybody liked him, but I had a weird feel about him;After training he would come into our showers and give out shower caps for us to use, or in the winter, he would bring us snow to play.A few years later, he got arrested for sexual assault, when he went to a training camp with younger girls. Apparently he got into their tents and "played" with them.
My mom was a single mom and did the best she could.  However, she thought it might be better to leave me with the neighbor than at home alone.  From the age of 6, I pleaded with my mom to let me stay home alone until she got home from work,  that I would be ok.  My intuition was right. The neighbor was convicted of multiple murders of single mom one and two towns over when DNA evidence came into being.  He only liked to date and kill nonobese women.  Fortunately my mother was fat.
Apparently, when I was 4 or 5, my grandma introduced me to some new boyfriend. Everyone liked him, but I would have nothing to do with him. Wrinkled my nose, wouldn't be left alone by him.  I guess he just came into her apartment one day and walked at her with something behind his back, said nothing. She got an eerie feeling and said, "Are you going to kill me?" With a dead faced stare he came at her. She managed to jump over some furniture and get away (she's always been in great shape, running 3 miles a day until age 80).She got somewhere safe, called the police and never saw him again..
Not me, but my sister. She has this uncanny ability to detect crazy people. My first boyfriend who was secretly abusive, she called it after knowing him for two days. My next boyfriends mom who eventually forced me to take a pregnancy test because I had been "looking rather pregnant" and she wanted to know, she knew after the first visit meeting her. My toxic ex best friend of *seven years*, she knew after 1 year. All of the people my sister calls out for being crazy, I now believe and avoid wholeheartedly.
A pastor who was involved in the community outreach program for a prison (which i volunteered to for the first time).. seemed very friendly on the outside but seems really creepy to me... he kept putting his hands on my shoulder on that day and got my number from one of the volunteers and called me non stop that night to say he is lonely and wants to talk.. i was 14 at the time.. 
My first girlfriends husband. She and I had a bad breakup, but eventually got to be friends again, hanging out with the same crowd all the time. She met a guy who lived out of state and fell in love with him. I disliked him immediately. Everybody else thought he was fine. They got married, and a couple of years later, he started beating the crap out of her. She wised up and left.
Jimmy Saville. Turned out everyone had same thought and a lot of people knew.
Guy at my school. Everybody else liked but I had a bad vibe. My girlfriend at the time told me to not be so negative and automatically dislike people. Since then he lied to her about something I said, lied to me about talking to her. And then lied to everyone saying we broke up because I cheated on her.And guess who she's dating now?
I'm a chef and within one minute of hiring someone I know if they are going to work or will need to be replaced. First impressions mean a lot, so if you bring up killing your wife (happened last week) or pain pills (yesterday) within the first 5 minutes of your first shift its not gonna work out, because you're an idiot. 
A guy here on reddit who had a lot of karma. I was nearly alone in my hatred of him over in r/centuryclub. They all loved him, but I could just tell that something was off about him. Then he got busted for fucking around with the wife of someone else in CC, and their PMs revealed that he was a fucking child molester who had dreams of having a son one day that he could sexually abuse. Fuck that guy. 
I wonder how many wrong feelings occur for each right one
Did he kill her?  :< 
That was one very good reptilian dog you had there.Did you catch the guy?
The amount of pedophile stories in this thread is freaking me out.
I like to think she actually said "Wang_Dipthong"
While he's obviously a scumbag, and I'm happy to believe that he intended to tie her up, I honestly believe *everyone* should have some sturdy rope in the back of their car.  I have two 12' lengths for securing loads, a 25' for if I need to pull anything/pull my car out (I have since gotten a tow strap), another 50' for whatever, a pick and shovel, several saws, trash bags, latex gloves, and a machete.  I promise I'm not trying to kill anyone.
>Took 10 years but i was right.Nice :)>He is currently on year 1 of a 32 year sentence for repeated rape of his daughter.  :(
Did you divorce your husband after that?
It's interesting, I think we (women) generally try to repress those feelings towards other women who appear to be friendly--even though we're getting a weird vibe.  We sort tell ourselves it's us, not them.  And then, turns out, it's them.
>Next thing I know he says, "Can I rub down a little further? In front? It's your decision, you're completely in charge here."I felt physically ill when I read this. 
What the actual fuck. This could be a lifetime movie. 
I'm sorry in advance but the most frustrating part of this is how absolutely fucking cowardly your Mom is. Even if you had a rough life growing up, how can you not see how fucked up everything is? It makes me so fucking angry when I read these posts and see their parents doing *nothing.*
This story was a ride all the way till the end... but what really got me was that your family owns an avocado farm.... Also, fuck Dave.
Yeah fuck Dave. But thats pretty awesome that you guys have an avocado farm. 
It must have been fucking horrible to see that in him and not be able to do anything about it.  
Oh man, I can't imagine how that poor girl who was gonna live with him felt after she found out.
How did the "I told you so" go with the girlfriend and friends?
I just read the article. It said the mom was stabbed over 178 times. That alone creeps me out. Imagine how much pent up anger you have to have to stab some one consecutively for what was probably minutes after they had already passed. My morning is ruined. 
This is next-level shit... one life ended, and two more ruined, all because some guy grossly abused his power over a minor.... I feel so bad for the biodaughter :( 
So he walked into the shower with a bunch of naked girls? And no one else thought it was strange?
He would bring snow into the showers?  So you could throw snowballs in the shower?  Wth?
Yo momma so fat, she survived and lives a happy life!
I thought nonobese was someone from a country i hadn't heard of, but then I realized you meant non-obese. Anyway that's so scary, I'm glad you're ok!
Fuck, are y'all still friends?
It's amazing how people choose to ignore multiple very obvious red flags. 
Your grandma sounds awesome. Leaping over furniture and escaping from a murderer. 
What was behind his back, were the cops called? Answers! We need ANSWERS!...........seriously though, please answer these questions.
This is obviously mean but, she fucking deserved it. I just couldn't believe that your mother's cousin actually picked that bitch over his own parents.
Let's not forget your uncle is also a HUGE asshole in this situation. 
So he lied about owning and selling the store? 
I want to meet your sister and find out about myself.
Damn. She's got the sight. 
Report him to the police.
Wait, so your birthmother knew and still was on decent terms with her rapist? That's messed up.
This is super well written. I didn't realize I wasn't breathing until I got to the end and let out a sigh of relief. Damn. What a scary situation. Good on your for noticing and making yourself prepared to counter though. 
"You're just jealous you're not hot enough to get hit on by a creepy teacher" that sounds like many of the popular girls in my high school & middle school. I wonder how they felt when he got caught. Keep trusting your gut! 
If he made fun of you instead of flirting with you because you were unattractive, does that not bolster your argument?
I'm a bit surprised but very happy your parents believed you. Did you ever try googling her name and locale?
How did your brother find out?
A girl I know is doing this. All my friends love her but something in my gut told me something wasn't right. She was always flirting with all the lads, acting very single. Find out she's seeing a guy I know from other friends. Not only that, it turns out she also has another boyfriend she's had for years. So she has a long term boyfriend, is seeing this other guy, and is by all means, trying to get with my friends too. Was very surreal. But I was just jealous of her when I didn't warm to her straight away like everyone else. 
If I were you, I would feel bad for my brother, of course, but I would also feel such a victorious "I told you so" toward my mom. I can't help it. 
I used to work at a place with a rock climbing wall. It was my favorite attraction to run because I could swing the younger kids around by their harness and they loved it. Usually.I'm just glad there's only ever been one incident of someone commenting on the way I touch people as I fit their harness. It was a guy who jokingly said "Stop fondling my wife!" And I replied with something along the lines of "Don't be jealous I'm getting paid to touch her and you're stuck doing it for free."His wife was amused. He was not.
This is a great story, but for a second I thought the story was going to be that everyone loved this dog and you had bad feelings about it.
Who's good fluffy domestic assault detector?! 
This is a great story, but I have set off dogs that love everyone before. I don't have evil intentions, I've never slapped anyone and I am a dog person, so sometimes it's random.
One of my husbands Aunts has a German Shepard. He's a big, dumb, scared of his own shadow and fireworks type. He once knocked down a cousin and growled at her because "he thought I was being rough with my kid". No sweetie he saw you being rough and protected the kid. It was literally his first time jumping on anyone. Let alone knocking them over. He's seen us rough house and LARP. I would argue he knows the difference between real violence and play. He's a good dog and always get table scraps from me now. (And cuddles when there are fireworks)
> Sometimes our guts really know what's up.On that topic, read Gavin de Becker's *The Gift of Fear*.The book is full of examples how and why you get that uneasy feeling, and it teaches you how to pinpoint the source.
I'm glad that this is the top comment. A lot of people have this really naive and almost cartoonish idea of what a sexual predator or an abuser is going to be. They think that they're going to be obvious; an ugly, overtly & objectively creepy guy who openly shows deviant behaviour to others in an obviously way. NOPE. 99% of the time an abuser or a sexual predator is someone who other people *like*. Someone who is charming and who others simply "can't believe" could ever be a bad guy. Trust no one completely, man.
Do you work in Gary, Indiana?
Wait... pot?  How much pot was the guy smoking?
> added a photo to instagram while studying in a library and he showed up a few years laterhours maybe?
Stacy?
Not saying you did, but even if you made this up, you're a great storyteller. I honestly don't mean this is a backhanded compliment or anything - you just wrote this really well.
Assuming you're indeed from South Africa and that your story is true, you are far from the first person I've seen on the internet tell stories of how much of a piece of shit pistorious was/is.
I hate that I know who you're talking about. 
Let her keep that $60 as a gift. Someone like that should not bring a child into this world. The child would suffer too much.
> To be picked up by friend who had raped her.Yeah, the fact she said it was a stranger, then it was the friend but didn't want to tell the police, then he's the one that rescues her when she gets kicked out? Plus literally everything else about her? I don't buy her story. 
Well now I'm self-conscious about the fact that I prefer playing with kids to drinking beer and watching sports...Thanks for that.
While your gut instinct was correct, please don't demonize every guy who would rather play with children than watch sports. Male childcare workers have an extremely tough go as it is. 
He even took away her right to dump him? Evil. 
Not for that caper, but I think he got popped for something else.  And I got a phone call a few months later from an angry ex-girlfriend telling me my suspicions were correct and which pawn shop he used.  The police were just like, "Meh."
To be fair, it's not a thread about people who gave a good first impression and later turned out to have an exemplary character.
Classic narcissistic behavior.  You don't do what they want, they go scorched earth on you.  Sorry you got caught up in that.
Not yet.  Complicated, lengthy, messy, and almost entirely on Reddit (see feed)
I sometimes think my life story could have been a fantastic book for Oprah's book club.Maybe this is why I hate things like that and prefer humor? Sometimes dark, sometimes with cream and sugar.
This reminds me of our close family friends - father had been molesting his daughter for years and his wife (my mum's best friend) treated her like the *other woman* in an affair.
Yes, Dave sucks. But I, too, would like to know more about this avocado ranch. Specifically why it's not a farm, but a ranch. Also the avocados. 
Right? How's she going to afford the rent without a roommate??
From own experience: it never goes well, and the person who tried to warn the others becomes a cynical bastard because of it. 
Wanna come over for waffles? Maybe it'll make your day better :)
Why not just get a divorce, holy fuck. 
Um. Life Insurance money was 785k and bail was 785k? Either that's a ridiculous coincidence or someone in the article fucked up. 
I guess some did, I'm still friends with a girl, that also went there and she left the club for the same reason I did. I think they were either too embarassed to tell or they really didn't think of it as strange. As I said, he was loved by everyone, he also was teacher at my elemantary school. People trusted him. 
It was a legit reason for him to enter the showers and us being seven years olds somehow liked the idea of having a snowball fight...
It was a wedding ring. She asked if he was going to kill her, and his heart shattered, but he made sure not to falter. The only thing he could muster was a dead stare, unable to show any form of false happiness, but enough not to show his extreme sadness. He confessed his love, but she was out the door. The police were called, charges were dropped, and he moved away. A broken and shattered man, that will never allow his heart to love again.
How would they not notice the missing equipment the first time it happened?
Yep, and then to keep up with the lie (since he actually was just working there) he had to build more lies about going back to the store to work there. And then build another lie about how he's also rich from the stock market to explain the income he was getting from stealing and eBay sales.
I think if you spend time worrying that you might be secretly bad, you're probably not too bad.
Unfortunately where i lived (when this happened), these things won't be taken seriously by the police.. 
Yup, my birth family is really messed up. He moved to Australia a couple of years ago cause stuff got brought up from the past and a huge family brawl was close to happening.
Not only did I trust my gut, I also drew dicks on his car when I could find it in the parking lot.
Don't remember her name, unfortunately. My parents were really good about not being dismissive when I was a kid.
As long as my kid doesn't say that about most people, I'm 100% going to believe them if they say someone was being inappropriate with them. You would have to be insane not to. 
Now I'm wondering if OP just mistook a cute "You are so cute I want to take you home and bake cookies for you" for an actual kidnapping attempt. 
Having witnessed some weird-assed socially clueless but harmless mom behavior over the years (particularly from my own), this is hilariously believable.
Her other guy came to see her one day and she told my brother that he was an old coworker. So my brother said he'd take them all out to lunch and she lost her shit, and it all unraveled. She admitted to everything, from using my brother for money to having this whole relationship for their entire relationship. 
I know a Bulgarian girl doing this. Shes attractive and has a good job, and is married to an English guy, but has a 'soul mate' in Bulgaria. She also goes on dates with other guys, as long as they're rich or really handsome. It's weird, because all her Bulgarian girlfriends think she's perfectly entitled to do this, and being married doesn't take her off the market, while her husband is in total denial and thinks she's just friendly with other guys. 
I used to get people to pull their own harness up, and would show them how to close the buckles. When it came time to thread the rope through the loops, there was a good 5-6 inches of rope between my hand and the harness. Can't be too careful.Speaking of careful, I always double and triple checked harnesses, both to make sure they were tight enough and that they were properly done up.
Same here, turns out the dog had secretly been evil etc
Dogs always know dude.  Just turn yourself in to the police now and save everyone the trouble.
i finally understand why in english class they say to define pronouns
I had a friend who had a German Shepard. We lived about a half mile apart on a mountain road. At night, when I would leave his house, the dog would "escort" me home. Never beside me though, he would walk through the brush.It was really scary the first time it happened. All of a sudden I could hear something off the road. I quickened my pace until I got to my driveway then turned around. There he was, watching me. I gave him a wave and he turned and went home.GSD's are a wonderful breed.
I like to recommend this book as well, particularly for women, we are socially trained to be nice even when our inner alarms are blaring.
Convicted for sexual spying on a childLet off easy because he has children. Huh. 
Yeah, turns out some pensioner in the pub I drink in was a prolific pedophile, it turns out he was at it for decades, generally against very vulnerable people; disabled children etc, basically the worst you can get. What was horrific is that he was reasonably normal, you expect these people to be monsters, the idea that they're walking amongst you is the scary part. 
Not quite the same but the youth minister at my church when I was in high school set off my gaydar hardcore. He also gave several sermons about homosexuality being a sin. He ended up getting fired for cheating on his wife with at least 2 men, I think one may have been underaged. He was the epitome of the closeted gay bigot. 
My understanding of it is that people give off micro expressions and your brain notices these even when you don't.  So while, as you say the person controls the outer appearance, small expressions push through of their real thoughts.  Some people are better at seeing these than others.
Good ole' Gary. Make sure you gas up before you get there. You don't want to stop. 
No, she sat in the library for years 
Can't you see?
Username checks out. History shows posts about Africa. I'm almost 99% sure OP is really Oscar Pistorius and is just trying to be relevant again. 
Yup, my boyfriend was like "she probably just cheated" but me and my guy friend I guess were being nice and giving the benefit of the doubt.
People like that are the minority, but they're the ones that stick in people's brains and turn our whole society to think "men can't like playing with kids or they're pervs".
Try being a *dad* without your wife present at all times. I've had to defend myself from strangers accusing me of pedo intentions towards my own children on the playground. Though to be fair, this is more a statement on the sorts of people that would attack somebody they simply assume is a predator, than society itself - which seems to have more and more of those people in it anyways.
Somebody should make that thread
Don't let it get to you.  Sometimes you cannot fix stupid.  You saw the problem when nobody else could.  That is a very important skill.  Keep your eyes open man!
My gut instinct says no
He wanted the insurance money and didn't want to lose custody of his 3 year old. Source: the article.
That in itself is creepy.  Just the snowball thing... Yuck. 
Seven year olds had to shower after practice? That feels unusual to me.
Stand up move, contacting affected customers. If a restaurant did that for me over 5 bucks months ago,  I would become a fan. 
I think they did but just did not expect it from their prized employee
Reminds me of my favorite Mark Twain quote: "If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything." I don't know how people have the energy to keep up an elaborate web of lies.  I've lived by this for many years, and it has made life pretty easy, bitching even.  
Ugh. That's terrible. Sorry you had to deal with that.
Could it be a common "joking" thing to say in [asian country] that's meant to be flattering to the parents, but just doesn't translate across the languages?  Like "oh, your child is so well behaved, I wish he/she were mine." 
My Asian mom has also done some things that would freak out Americans. Once on a road trip we were getting ready to leave a ratty motel/apartments in a hick town, mom sees one of the live-in children watching her eat cookies. She has the kid come into our van to eat cookies with her. Needless to say when I came upon the scene I quickly explained in non-English why this shit could get her in some big trouble, this isn't Asia, get that kid the fuck out of the van before someone sees. 
So she is dead now? 
Do you happen to know if this is common among Bulgarians? Or just a one off thing 
>  statistically your child more likely to be abused/abducted by someone you know vs. a van-driving strangerI keep this in mind. And then I receive a mass-text from my daughter's school warning us parents to talk to our kids about not getting into cars with strangers, because of an incident where someone tried to lure a kid into his car on the way back home. Nothing bad happened, the kid bolted, told his parents and the police got involved. But the fact that the classical "white van" scenario does happen, and *is* happening in my back-yard gives me the absolute heebiejeebies. 
It's a tradition in our family to give a copy of this book to every girl graduating from high school. Really, everyone should read it, though.
> generally against very vulnerable peopleThis is important to remember. The poor, the disabled, the shy, the lonely...serial abusers learn who to hurt.
I had a similar experience with my uncle. He was always super friendly at family events, but as a kid I just had an intuitive feeling to stay the hell away from him. I guess he was just a little too touchy, especially considering how everyone else in my family would barely give you a handshake, even if they hadn't seen you for years. Turns out her raped both my female cousins, his daughters, the entire time they were growing up. 
Seems like its always the ones obsessing from the pulpit about homosexuality that turn out to be cock crazy.  
Your mom coordinated the attack.
You're just not the girl for me...
I had my infant son out shopping at Staples with my wife's Guncle and a random lady literally tried to take the baby out of his arms because a baby that young "must have a mother" and we clearly stole him. It was insane. She went from, "aww, cute baby" to "I'm saving him from you perverted gay kidnappers" in 5 seconds flat. Thankfully store management escorted her out.
I dunno man. I make pretty killer waffles
Yeah fuck snowballs. Snowballs are fucking pedophiles man.
It still doesn't check out. First time something goes missing at night you have your security system improved. Most people don't sit there and go "oh darn it, an electric piano disappeared again" and then forget about it.
that is an oddly heartwarming story
No, she's actually completely single. Apparently other dude didn't know she had been dating my brother, so when he found out he kicked her to the curb. 
I know couple of Bulgarian girls and they're nothing like this Might be it's just that group. 
His aunt has a really passive German Shephard. The dog was watching his female cousin play with female cousin's kid and saw that the cousin was being rough with the kid so the dog tackled her(the cousin not the kid). Her(the cousin who was tackled) excuse was that she was only pretending or wasn't being rough. This dog had seen OP Larp and rough house for fun so the dog likely knows when the violence is real or not. Doggie gets rewarded now for being good doggie.
Right, but in your area, how many "white van" incidents have there been, versus the amount of familial child abuse? Your fear is misproportioned, because your bias tells you that the people in *your* life wouldn't do something like that.
As the father of a severely autistic girl, this scares the shit out of me. I know if someone took advantage of her I would kill them. How do you protect a 7 year old who can't even tell you she's hungry, or needs to go to the bathroom. This is a terrible thread to start my day.
That is so fucked up. How does someone do that to their own children (well, any child)? What a monster.
It's the only thing that makes sense.Omama bin Laden?
I know it might be wrong
I think it depends on how often they check their inventory. Do they count their items in stock every day, once a week/month? By the time they checked, several items could've been taken over a period of days/weeks. As an insider, he knew their system and worked around it. 
Run away or run towards him with fists raised?
Did your brother start dating the other guy?
Please tell me he and your brother then went on to drink a beer together and became friends?
I used to work at a rape crisis center.  One of the staff had a FIL who had raped his wife, all his daughters, all his DILs, all his granddaughters and god knows who else. She finally put her foot down and made their family be no contact.  But no one ever stopped him.  It can totally be generational.  Which makes me want to puke.
More like Yomama bin Laden. 
I'm in love with Stacy's Mom
Work in a store, and now count our inventory every monday. But before we did it 2 times a year. You could have stolen a shit ton of products in that time, but once you do inventory, you finally realize how much you're missing.
I was actually gonna say or beat him to a pulp lol. But I don't want anyone being done for randomly fucking up a bad man with no actual evidence on what he did.
Though that would have been the best conclusion to bring this all full circle, no. 
Not that I know of. My brother moved five hours away shortly after that so I doubt it. 
> DILsHer raped his daughters-in-law?!? And his adult married sons reacted how? O.o
Right. I'm a teacher, so I have been able to observe the results of all of that in, oh, about 1300 children over the years. I HATE the stranger danger stuff. Kids very badly need to be able to deal with and interact with strangers. I wish families would teach healthy boundaries and assertiveness instead of the stranger bullshit.
I have a friend that works for a professional inventory counting service.  They go to huge warehouses to count inventory and have these weird hip mounted computers they use to count and keep track of stuff.  When I knew him in high school he could barely do math but now he has Rainman level skill at counting a group of matched items close together.  
Yeah mob mentality can be a lovely thing... I feel bad for all the innocent older men who look like Elvis and sing like him in Australian bars.
Schools should just make kids who are bad at math do inventory.
If it helps he has a kiwi accent.
Korean living in Canada here. It wasn't exactly hidden from kids even when they're young. I remember being aware of North Korea's existence as long as I can remember because of the whole reunification movement that is visible in everyday life, even before I started going to school. The general vibe was that they were taken away from us, living in harsh conditions and that we should try to reunite as a favour to them. I left before being taught any proper Korean history, so maybe somebody else will have more to say in that sense. 
I grew up in South Korea. It's probably the same stuff that an average redditor would know about North Korea, I guess the difference is that it gets taught at school and is brought up more often. Things like how North Koreans are suffering because of their horrible dictatorship government but their citizens are our brothers, how tragic the Korean War was, and peaceful reunification is the goal. To add a little bit more context, there was a stronger anti-Japan sentiment than an anti-NK sentiment, at least when I was growing up. This was in the late 90's early 00's.
Yup quite strange when we had a North Korean student coming to our school and the South Koreans tried to befriend him but he kept to hinself
>  he never found out what happened to his previous family.That's so fucked up.  Imagine going on a business trip one day from North Carolina to South Carolina and while you're on the trip the government suddenly says no one can ever go into or come out of North Carolina ever again.  You live the rest of your entire life not knowing what happened to your whole family.
This is probably the most accurate description of how south koreans learn about NK. Just note that the older generation that have been taught with anti-communism regime will probably not be using reddit  so you will not read their opinion here.
> we are taught to feel sympathy toward the NK people and hate the dictatorship.That is good I feel, hatred of the government but sympathy for NK people means there is still a slight hope of NK reunification.
US Air Force guy here, I was stationed in Korea for two years (loved it btw, you guys are great). How do you guys honestly feel about the American presence there? Everyone I met seemed pretty happy to see us, but I may not have gotten the full picture, you know?
Letters were allowed to be passed like that? Did you get a reply back?
It's always depressing when a born and bred South Korean uses the English language better than you (a born and bred Englishman. Your level of English is astounding. 
Any recommendations for a good film in regards to the SK/NK struggle?
I've heard from many Koreans that reunification right now isn't practical as there would be a huge refugee crisis and a huge cost for humanitarian aid.This seems contrary to your post, so I'm wondering if the above stance is mostly by a minority pragmatic group of people or do most people have this view but hope for "some day" of reunification?
That's a really compassionate way of seeing the North Korea situation
Ive heard that back probably when your parents were in school, kids were taught that North Koreans had horns and other demon like qualities and that some of that characterization still persists these days.I was listening to a radio interview where some North Koreans who escaped to the south and then came to America were shocked when people asked them where their horns are and similar questions about others in the North.  It was an interesting segment and ended with getting opinions from people in the South about how they feel towards NK now.
There seems to be a lot of Koreans living in Canada answering in this thread. Serious question, is Canada a popular country for Koreans to immigrate to?
From your perspective, is it one of SK's goals to actively reunite with NK? Or is the separation more or less accepted now?
It sounds like "eat your veggies because there are starving kids" is a universal tactic of parents.  At least in SK you are close enough to NK that the "well why don't you give it to them" comeback is actually viable.
The eat your vegetables part - not Korean, but my parents always told me this. Confession: I used to scrape a little from my plate into the bin everyday, in the hope that when a little kid found it, he or she'd be happy to have something to eat, instead of having nothing since no one was wasting food. :/
Interesting, this is sort of like for me Britain in world war 2, teaching children to watch out for suspicious activity.So, from what you tell me, they don't really teach you much about why North Korea is evil and dangerous, rather, it just is.
My family is also from Kaesong before the conflict! I wonder how they are... 
Which opinion is more popular in South Korea 
Did your parents talk to you about it? How did they bring up the topic!
> NK was still starving and forever looking for ways to attack SKIs that why Seoul subway stations are so far deep underground? When I visited I was surprised how many stairs I had to drag my luggage up before reaching ground level. I also noticed gas mask stations, which I didn't piece together until after I left.
Just got back from SK had many nights drinking where people got visibly uncomfortable with me speaking Japanese and being Chinese too. They would relax when i swapped to English and my British accent though.
Wow it's amazing that you grandpa managed to reunite with his brother at a marketplace! He must have been so happy.
It is due to the isolation and difference in North Korean language and culture in comparison to the South I believe.60 Years of total separation has its affects.
Why did you mom banned you from eating the North Korean candies? 
How was your grandfather able to go visit?
Huh, so that's where the racial slur "gook" came from. Unfortunate that such a nice word was twisted around for such cruel purposes.Do you think the American/SK alliance had an influence on the choice "miguk"?
Is that show propaganda itself? I don't know that I've ever viewed NK as anything more than impoverished. To think kids  received free fish with school supplies sounds wildly imaginative. I've been reading into this thread all day I'll have to check out those videos, thanks. 
As a parent I couldn't imagine. The darkness I would descend into...
Yea my parents' generation, they used to have regular evacuation drills and stuff. But they do not Reddit. 
I think most Koreans want reunification-- I, as a Korean-American do.  I'm afraid that that the only way that will happen is via a war where tens of millions die.
As long as Kim stays in power then I don't think there will be reunification, he wouldn't want that because then he wouldn't be treated as God and he would lose all of his authority and power. 
yeah this is what I wanted to ask. Can't imagine that there were actually children receiving these letters, NK government probably wouldn't allow it.
They probably didn't want to tell children anything worse. 
I think the difference is that North American media focuses on DPRK's leadership, while it seems like the people in ROK focus on the people of the DPRK.  My perspective on the North American obsession with DPRK villainy ends at it's leadership and government.  I feel for the North Korean people and wish they could be reunited with their families in the south.  
I heard there's a lot of prejudice towards NK defectors trying to find work at SK. People don't trust them and think of them as a lower class. Is that true? I would seem opposite of what you were taught in school growing up, that they just need a helping hand.
>What I always thought it was weird is that North Korea is portrayed as a crazy villain in North America Media. Have you even paid attention to North Korean messaging?   That's certainly the message they try to convey.  Plus they seem mostly to interact with the world in crazy villanous ways.  Kidnapping  foreign stars (and random seabathing Japanese)?  Assassinating people?  Selling drugs?  Counterfeiting U.S. currency?  Those aren't things normal governments do.   
People forget that South Korea was once a fascist dictatorship.
For younger generations, the consensus is to stay where they are now. SK people sacrificed a lot to get to where they are economically and does not want to lose their sons/brothers/fathers to war.My perspective is that the country must be united once again. Depends on what party takes over the government. If liberal, peaceful merge. If conservative, hit me and we will hit you back harder. However, both parties have aims to reunite. Just different methods
Well, we had to watch the videos of those kids and we felt bad for them. It hits you hard when kids who look like you and speaks the same language dies off from starvation
I was always told (living on US) of "starving kids in Africa".    I actually wanted to send them my half eaten bowl of cereal, and got upset when my parents told me it was impossible.   
They did, but not the people. Implication was that NK people are just "hypnotized" by communism ideology and needs to be save.
My parents were strict about speaking Korean in the house. I watched Korean news and debate programs to get more sophisticated vocabulary. Its hard to be bilingual. I can write full college level essays and speak both languages, but it took me a long time to get to that level. I still have the weekend hangover from speaking Korean all during the weekend and try to get my English together on Monday morning.
And do South Koreans even want North Korea back? 
I don't know when you were stationed in Korea, but younger generation does not even seem to care nowadays
which part of Seoul were you visiting? I find it hard to believe people were visibly uncomfortable with someone speaking Japanese, there are Japanese tourists everywhere.
She didn't trust it. Said something about not being regulated or something
No. Probably from the Chinese character for the U.S. which means "beautiful" and is pronounced "Mei" in Chinese. Same character is likely pronounced "Mi" in Korean. 
Same here but my mom and dad defected from Dresden in 79 and made it to NYC via Italy and Portugal on forged documents. Crazy to think. 
It would be awesome if South and North Korea unified like we in Germany did, but I wouldnt expect it. The leaders of the DDR are quite different to the leaders of North Korea after all.But you should never stop to hope.
I mean Korea transformed so completely during their lives, can I ask how they talk about this transformation and how the country was under the elder Park, or how they use industrial tools that they might not have had as children if they were especially poor?
I could potentially see a coup of sympathetic North Koreans finally overthrowing them.
Not to mention the fact that, you know, he's committed war crimes and will probably end up in prison for the rest of his life and/or executed.  Pretty sure he mostly doesn't wanna die. 
<3 I for one am glad I got the chance to follow in my grandfather's footsteps and stand beside you guys against the North. You were amazing hosts and I'd love to return one day.
Would you mind describing some the differences in culture and etiquette?
Oh believe me I feel awful for the North Koreans, I just expected the view of them in SK to be much more bitter and it cheered me up a bit to see that. Those people are fellow humans that need to be helped. We can't hate them for their leader. Not everyone in Germany in the 1940's was a Nazi
That could be the case. We definitely don't tell our children about the atrocities we've committed in the US until much later
there is a good reason for that. in the rather cruel and gruesome korean war about a third of the north korean population died.its easy to make fun of north koreas paranoia and hatred for the US when its expressed by a silly looking fat kid, but there are few countries and societes that were devastated to such an extent as (north) korea by us bombs and napalm.
By people do you mean South Koreans?  The demonizing of North Korea was probably done under the exact dictatorship you're talking about.  The people today are not ignorant of the dictatorships, and are very much resentful about it.  This is especially so after the impeachment of the recent corrupt president, who was the daughter of the dictator.
When I was talking to people who worked for reunification efforts in Korea, I heard that often times Koreans from abroad feel more strongly about reunification than native Koreans. He stated that unfortunately many people in Korea have become ambivalent towards the idea of reunifying. Would you say that's accurate? 
How much of that kind of footage exists? It seems like something NK wouldn't allow to be shot, let alone let out of the country.
My father, who grew up in a communist country, was told of the poor starving kids in America.
I'm European and I said the same thing. Then my dad said: "If you don't start eating quickly, I'm not sending food to Africa, I'm sending you off to Africa!" So I ate.It's about acknowledging the fact that you are in way better position than a lot of others in the world and being picky while other kids don't even have water or normal food is ungrateful to those who provided you with that food.But good luck explaining that to a 7 year old.
I once put my leftover bread in an envelope and my grandma "mailed" it to Africa to feed the kids
For me, it started out as, "starving kids in China," and then morphed into "starving kids in Africa" as I got older and China grew more prosperous and developed better food security.
Lack of modern healthcare (for the common man), food shortages, oppression, and lack of clean water most of the timeAll of that would cause us to freak out and do something if it was in a nation that would allow us to help but ug NK
hey man. How's your family doing after the whole government fiasco? I had people I was familiar with go into pretty bad situations because of it
Can you imagine the "re-education" programs that would have to happen, with all the people who are brainwashed into believing the god like status of Kim Il Sung, etc.  Funny story, after the German defeat in WWII, the allied government in western germany tried to have a "denazification" in which they would penalize and not allow former nazi party member to be in civil service jobs, but eventually the program was scrapped for a variety of reasons, one being that there were too many former nazi's.  Wonder how it would go with North Korea. 
Older gen: yesYounger gen: look at West Germany, our economy is gonna collapse
It was 2001, so 16 years ago. Times change fast so this wouldn't surprise me at all. I had hopes that the South Koreans would help the North Koreans if given the opportunity.
That's an amazing story. It sounds like your father has been through a lot. I'm glad to hear your family is together and I'm sorry that you face discrimination now. I hope South Koreans will get more education about North Koreans so they are not scared of them.Do you know anyone else from North Korea apart from your family? I wonder if you would become friends and support each other.
Very reasonable to say that, since there's not much science going on there, god knows what kind of food regulations they have over there.
> sympathetic North Koreans:\
> Pretty sure he mostly doesn't wanna dieIf he were to step down willingly, I am quite certain there could be an offer of amnesty and nice retirement package. If he is deposed, he will likely be killed in country long before he gets an opportunity to face war crimes trials (which is likley why Uncle died). Whatever amnesty is granted, it won't be the same as being dictator for life, so as long as he believes he can keep it together, he won't surrender. 
There's really no reason for south koreans to be bitter. You have to remember the split was ~65 years ago. A lot of people still have family in nk. During the war many families were split up because only some were willing to make the trek through dangerous conditions to escape north korea. My grandma had to cross through war zones at the age of 11 with her parents so we technically still have relatives over there. 
Well the view on reunification is pretty divided in SK. Let's not forget that they were under a military dictatorship as recent as the 80's. SK has quickly turned themselves around and become an economic power and there are still a lot of people who remember what it was like when SK was dirt poor. Because of past financial hardships and their recent economic turnaround there are a lot of South Koreans who are hesitant to reunify due to the strain it will put on the SK economy.
Japanese internment camps, trail of tears 
Most times it's not even explicitly told to them, regardless of how old they get. The only way you can find out about most of it is through research, since nobody wants to talk about the awful things their country has done in the past. It's always so interesting to learn about history from multiple points of view. It starts to show you how much history differs based on who is telling it. 
The fact that she was elected in the first place suggests the resentment is not as total as you suggest.
Maybe more like East and West Germany. Merging once  the government one one falls. 
I guess the same way actual photos we get from tourists that go there. Risk their freedom to get unauthorized shots. 
It dosn't have to be recent footage. NK was a fairly normal Soviet regime until 1990 or so. After that it went into Hermit mode. But before many Russian, Chinese tourists and visitors could go there. Presumably they filmed stuff. Other footage could be propoganda, accurate but staged. Both NK and SK have been "at war" for 60 years. Plenty of time to get footage.
He wasn't entirely misplaced. Tens of thousands of inner-city youth were and still are starving. And I understand that the Soviets in particular liked to portray the problems of racism and black poverty as endemic of the inequalities of the capitalist system. It was a "you may not have much, but at least you're not left to fend for yourself like those poor people capitalism brushes aside". 
It's just how you phrase it. Don't form a causal relationship between the food they waste and people not having enough. The finish your plate mentality isn't healthy anyway.
For me was always Africa. My mom gave me a kids book that had a spin wheel on it and on the spin wheel was an about 70% chance of hitting a third world country and it was supposed to say how lucky you are for not being born in shitty countries. She made me spin it if I didn't eat all my green beans.
A lot of people buy in bulk because it's cheaper than individual portions and can last longer. Poverty mindset is hard to get out of.
Biggest is food shortage. During famine, cannibalism happens often in rural areas. Also if 1 person defects, public execution for all family members left behind
Isn't there also huge mineral wealth and industrial capacity in North Korea though?  I'd expect the Unified Korea would be a powerhouse similar to Japan (probably more powerful economically) 
German here: Our economy didnt collapse! The east drags us down a bit, but overall it works out.
West Germany didn't collapse when reunification happened. Germany is a thriving and powerful economy and was that way before reunification just as SK is today
I mean like a general or something secretly wanting to end the regime.
They are the kind that will send millions to their death before making personal sacrifices.
Hell, there are people in the Republic of Ireland who are concerned about the economic impacts of reunification with Northern Ireland and that situation doesn't even touch that of the Korean Peninsula. I'll give those South Koreans a pass. It's an absolute clusterfuck of a situation. Although in both cases I think reunification is ultimately the best decision. What's a few years/decades of economic hardship versus fostering an unnatural divide amongst a people that doesn't need to exist. 
I'd say slavery is quite a big one
I've seen this said elsewhere and it confuses me and makes me wonder if education has changed. I certainly learned about all the atrocities against the Native Americans and slavery. We didn't get all the grisly details in elementary school, of course. But we did in high school. This was 25 years ago though.
Unfortunately, yes.  Although it has heightened definitely since then.  There are people who regard her father as a great person, since he was the only dictator that used his absolute power for "good" (for certain people).  People who lived during his rule, that benefited from it, still hail him.  Even today, there are protests by older conservatives calling for the decriminalization of the former president.  The rest of us are hardly sympathetic, and a lot of this resentment is also being carried on to such people.
To add a similar perspective to this from Cyprus, divided into 2 by Turkey in 1974: The efforts are very much geared towards reunification but amongst 20-40 year old who have lived in this situation all of their lives there is a lot of worry about how much the economy (especially) will be affected in trying to unify with a state that is very much lagging behind. I suspect this is many times more pronounced in the NK / SK story
I suppose there'd also be the lingual gap between North and South Koreans as well. Because of how isolated North Korea is from the rest of the world, even from its southern neighbour, there is beginning to be a noticeable difference between the dialects spoken by the people on either side of the border.
It would probably be a million times worse than Germany's reunification.  East Germany was backwards and poor but nothing like the disparity between the Koreas.
I could never see them doing this especially with Kim Jong Un in power 
The tourists are only brought to Pyongyang and other areas which are permitted.  The tourists don't get to see the real North Korea, the villages, or obviously the forced labor camps.  
> And I understand that the Soviets in particular liked to portray the problems of racism and black poverty as endemic of the inequalities of the capitalist system. They got many things wrong but this isn't one of them. 
> The finish your plate mentality isn't healthy anyway.Why, if I may ask?
Did this book also have a package of rice in it with a semi metallic cover? 
Definitely. If it's non-perishable (canned, frozen, dry) I buy in bulk. Otherwise not. Very little waste, and it's much cheaper buying rice in 10 kilo bags instead of little cardboard boxes.
What does buying in bulk have to do with "poverty mindset?" If you have the space to store it and will use the item buying in bulk is smart.  
:/ fuck me
Excellent point. I'm sure SKorean realtors would get excited too.
There was a 3:1 GDP per capita ratio between West Germany and East Germany. Between North Korea and South Korea it's something like 40:1.
But the situation in NK is a lot worse, people don't even have enough to eat. 
As if an economic depression is a good reason to keep people living in a totalitarian gestapo state.
Those at the top got there due to being complicit in the regime's practices, self-interests, and bootlicking.  They're not all of a sudden going to have an epiphany about altruism and risk their life to save the peasants.  Furthermore, a coup would take more than just one general-- it would take a group of people all risking their lives and the lives of their families for generations to come.  Why would they take that risk when they're generals with the best lifestyles already in NK?
That's really awesome. I think I only had one teacher who emphasized how terrible internment was. 
A few years back, I was at some function where an elderly woman spoke of her experiences growing up in an American WWII internment camp. She was probably late 70's/early 80's Japanese American that never considered herself to be very Japanese as she was born and raised on the American Pacific coast and spoke better English than I do. The part that stuck with me was how she talked about how she could never understand why they were there. 
That sounds a lot like my knowledge of reunification Germany
I agree, I recall reading from several sources that regardless of the problems in communist East Germany, their quality of products and volume of production was better per worker than just about any other communist bloc nation. I personally believe it was due to the German culture. NK has been more completely transformed in such an entrenched fashion, I think the difficulty of orienting their population into any kind of a modern economy would be profoundly difficult. I do not believe the pre-communist NK culture had a society as modern as the pre-WWII German example.
Are those areas visible on like google earth?
Starving ethnic minorities? I don't think the Soviets really should have thrown stones that way
Because you may well end up overeating by feeling obliged to finish your plate. I've seen American portion sizes in some restaurants; some of them are far, far bigger than I would ever get for myself at home.More to the point, if it's a house dinner, I'd find it better to bring items out and serve them out for yourself, then come back for seconds if you still want them. Any leftovers can then be saved for breakfast/packed lunch/quick dinner the next day because they're still clean, helping to reduce food wastage too.
And if someone commits a crime, 3 generations of their family have to be held in concentration camps 
Also, crucially, the West Germans were very highly educated. That's one thing the Eastern Bloc did get right. Building physical capital is easy once you've already got human capital.That sure as hell ain't the case with North Korea, especially because malnutrition as children stunts people intellectually.
No, but a giant war may be...
You're thinking of Midway.  Pearl Harbor was when the Luftwaffles bombed Ireland.  
Shit, if we give them all semi-auto Barretts, that would probably fix itself pretty quickly.
>Real-world politics doesn't work like fictional stories.>Or hell, after this last year, maybe they do, I don't know.I think it is important to note that although something has happened in the past, that doesn't mean thats how it will happen in the future.Circumstances change :)
People at the top may live a more luxurious lifestyle, but they are also in more danger as the Kim dynasty regularly "purges" the ranks of anyone they have the slightest suspicion of. It's possible that at some point Kim Jong Un will leave the wrong person with nothing left to lose, then it's just a matter of deciding if they like their revenge hot or cold.
My 2nd grade teacher was actually born in one. That's all she ever told us, I guess we were too young to get any real details
My understanding is that the culture, wealth and education gap between North and South Korea is way more severe (now) than the gap between East and West Germany was in 1989.FWIW, even now it's pretty easy to tell East and West Germans apart if they're above a certain age (~ 35)
I would imagine that the reunification would be more like nation-building after a fallen dictator. SK would have a lot of help from Western powers if NK government were to collapse. It would take time, but I don't think it would harm SK's economy in the long run.
I mean, NK was way behind the curve 25 years ago. Since then, they have additionally missed the internet age. Can't even imagine how that would go...their infrastructure is as behind as their culture. The problem if the longer this goes on, the more incompatible they become. One might point out that Cuba is similar, but they seem far more aware and open to the rest of the world.
It probably had more to the fact those people that were absorbed and running industry started from the height of German industrialism to their date. They were already well educated and highly skilled.
No, they just look like low-resolution brown and green. Same with large parts of Africa, unfortunately- I wanna see some elephants from space 
I have always wondered how they determined 3 generations. Like if the women don't have kids are they raped?
Yeah, at least the East Germans were well educated and had enough to eat, they just were like 2 decades behind in societal development and weren't used to personal freedom or an open society. North Koreans are neither well educated or well fed, and are close to a century behind.
You're thinking of Iceland. Ireland was where 99 Luftballons bombed North Korea.
> will leave the wrong person with nothing left to lose,I think you watch too many movies.Hard to picture a 60 year old aristocrat *John Wick*ing a whole government.
> it's pretty easy to tell East and West Germans apart if they're above a certain ageHow?
I still remember that picture of the Wartberg being passed by a Mercedes or Porsche on the Autobahn after reunification.  Very iconic.  
Keep in mind China lives next door. I doubt they'd be thrilled about American GIs handing out freedom on every North Korean street corner...
My understanding was that most of the time these family lines simply end in the concentration camp. The women are often raped, though not specifically to create a third generation.
Not a movie but a tv series called Black Mirror. The episodes are like an hour long, and focus on technology and psychological torment. Totally a fucked up show.
Threads. Especially as I live in Sheffield where it's set
Prisoners.  It had me terrified and on the edge of my seat the entire movie.  It was every parent's nightmare.  I am not even a parent and I was worried for my children. 
One Hour Photo - Robin Williams is a nightmare.
Frailty.  
Jacobs Ladder. Without a doubt, the most thrilling horror movie I've seen. 
Misery - No need for jump scares. The terror comes from Annie's swift changes in mood, and suddenly you find yourself fearing for Paul's life. 
Eraserhead gave me nightmares for a couple of days.
The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre - those long, still shots where the horror just comes into frame and you are helpless and can only sit and watch as it unfolds.
Silence of the lambs.  Most of the violence isn't even on the screen. But because we don't see it we started putting it together in our heads. Hopkins and Foster sucked me into that movie and had me looking over my shoulder for days.
We Need to Talk About Kevin.     Don't look up anything about it, just watch it. More horrifying than scary, though, TBH.edit- fucked up the title  edit2- should be on Netflix (US, anyways) for those who want to watch it.
Although the second half of the movie resorts to some cheap scares the first half of 'The Descent' is terrifying.
Mothman Prophecies to me was quite scary. Also, Coherence which is a really low budget movie gets me quite anxious and scared when watching it because I can imagine myself in their shoes if that stuff were to happen to me on a normal night. It is on Amazon Prime if anyone is interested if you like relativity and alternate reality stuff. 
Rosemary's Baby with zero jump scare scenes
The Shining. While less scary and more intense and dreadful, it's still awesome.
The Last House on the Left. The 70's one is great but the remake is pretty solid too. The idea of knowing your temporary houseguests harmed someone close to you is an interesting idea. Made me think about what I might do in that situation.Oldboy is a good example of this too. The more you think about it, the scarier it becomes.
Se7en (David Fincher). Saw it when I was 12 or something, barely slept for a week
Session 9. It's what you never see that really gets to you.
John Carpenter's the thing.
Zodiac scared the absolute fuck out of me.
Not traditionally a horror film but terrifying in a different way, Bone Tomahawk.
Coraline, that movie is scary
The Girl Next Door. Not the comedy one, the other one loosely based on Sylvia Likens.  Poor girl got mutilated and raped to death orchestrated by someone who was supposed to be a caregiver. 
Event Horizon. Sam Neil's a legend.
A Spanish film called El Orfanato (The Orphanage). 
Black Swan. A slow descent into madness is creepy and realistic and totally within the realm of possibility for most people
The original Blair Witch project. The fact that is was the first "found footage" and you never saw the witch or anything because it was always off camera was freaky. Plus I remember when everyone left the theater the fact that everyone thought that was real footage and not a movie. 
VideoDrome
It follows was pretty good at creating a creepy atmosphere. 
The Fourth Kind pretty much did it for me. But I'm a sucker for "realistic" alien movies. 
Identity and 1408.  Very underrated films.
"The mist" was very good for this. All about suspense and the idea of not knowing what was out there, and the ending.... Very good
The VVitchThere's *one* jump scare in the film, which doesn't involve any horror at all. It's a fantastic period piece and creepy as fuck
For me.....i dunno about 'scariest' but as much as people shit on M. night Shamalananan, I thought SignsIt had good tension. There was a lot of quietness in the movie which made the atmosphere more creepy, almost like you're on the edge of your seat feeling like they might jam the volume up high as shit to scare you, but they never do. To this day, i'll never forget how scary it was when they show that video of the birthday party and the footage capturing the alien walking by. I still won't watch that movie alone.
Nightcrawler had me on the edge of my seat.It's a diffrent kind of scary...
The Strangers. The fear of being hunted is just fucking awful 
Creep.This one left me with a feeling of dread for days afterwards.
Halloween
For those who don't know, the show got its name from the way our devices resemble black mirrors when they aren't active / with their screen(s) locked.
I just watched this last week.  Wow!  Some of the stories stuck with long after. 
I watched this once. I won't watch it again. It was so well done but that heavy feeling stayed with me for days. 
Worked as a CVS photo technician when this came out.It was extra creepy for me because I realized how easy it would be for someone to be like that.I had been working there less than a year and already had so many people that I knew much of their family history and insight into their family vacations.
And people call this a "bad" Robin Williams movie. I think it was amazing. The only gripe I had was that they decided to weakly explain why he was the way he was at the end (molestation). I think it would have been fine to just leave it as "he's obsessed with this family and wants to be a part of it, and despises Will for betraying his family." 
There are a few jump scares, but in the context of Jacob's Ladder they don't seem cheap and they are legitimately unsettling.
The fucking shaking head in  the rear car window. Fuck. That. 
I believe I stopped watching that movie right after that lovely part where his wife gets fucked to death by a demon in front of him...
The book is like that as well. Even when she's being "sweet" you're on edge because you know she'll change in a snap. Such a haunting book. Need to see the movie.
Talk about a movie that's hard to watch again... just because of the sense of impending dread.  You just feel greasy watching that movie.
I've always loved how that movie just gets right to it and people start dropping like flies.
SPOILERS: I love how the original TCM ends. The final two shots make the film for me. The shot of Sally screaming in the back of the pickup truck as Letherface dances in the sunset. I use the term dances here because that is the best way to describe it. It is almost beautiful. The tagline to the original film is "who will survive and what will be left of them?" Even though Sally escapes, you are left asking what will be left of her? How can she go on after seeing what she has seen? Then to see Leatherface dancing almost triumphantly. I love that ending.
Somehow, even with me being a morbid kid born in 1974, I didn't see the original TCM until like 2003.  I really expected it to not hold up after decades of derivative works and desensitization, but it did.  That movie is horror art.
even though i love the film, it has plenty of jump scares, but they're done in a much better way. 
But that film has one of the most amazing jump-scares in cinema. You know, with the bag.
Ted Levine was so crazy as Buffalo Bill it really makes you wonder if it impacted his personal life. If he wasn't married at the time it must have been tough getting a date.  Who wants to date the guy who played Buffalo Bill. 
(Mild spoilers) The only actual "jump scare" I remember involves them mistaking the cat for the Alien. And that serves a different purpose than to be a cheap scare, obviously.The true horror is the lurking sense of dread that's there for the majority of the movie.
I don't know if you play video games at all but if you're a fan of the original Alien movie, then Alien: Isolation is a must play. 
Un, dos, tres, toca la pared...
And now that guy is The Flash. What were they thinking? Giving Kevin powers like that.
His mother. I don't think I've felt sorry for a character more than her in a film.
"We Need to Talk About Kevin".
I don't know why, but I always confused it with a comedy that had a similar title. (Or maybe not even that.) I was expecting a good laugh and was weirded out when I got Tilda Swinton.... and then it only got more horrifying.
Ok I literally just said the big jump scare in The Thing was the best of all time. But I take it back. The one in The Descent is the best of all time. It was literally the climax of the movie. 
Yeah that film still has me noping the fuck out of any caving expeditions a good ten years on. 
Oh man, I forgot about that movie!!! Mothman Prophecies scared the shit out of me as a teen, and then they casually add that it's based on real events? I just wanted to get that movie the fuck away from me forever. I gotta watch it again and see what I think of it now. 
The part where the kids are in the closet toward the end literally made me hyperventilate in the theatre. 
Oh, man, this deserves to be higher.The section where the husband comes back from the war, seems like he knows what's really going on, but is still haunted by having been there. Then has to go "back."Made me shudder.
Same, that was a damn good movie
The bathtub old woman is still one of the scariest things I've ever seen. That and the typewriter scene, which is one of the most clever and iconic horror movie scenes ever I reckon.
Sesevenen
To be fair, I can think of at least one jump scare in that movie.[Specifically, when the cop is hovering over the junkie's face and he wakes up](/spoiler)
The one part of that movie that always gets me in the last session tape where the doctor asks "Where do you live, Simon?" and the response is "I live in the weak and the wounded." 35 years old making my husband check under the goddamn bed and shit...
I've watched that movie. Once. I bought it. It still has the plastic on it. Every time I think about watching it, I get this ridiculous sense of dread and decide not to
Hands down the best acting by a Dog, EVER.
Well there is the part where the defibrillators go straight through that guy's chest.  Or the scene where they're testing the blood.  I guess what's cool about the movie is they basically tell you a jump scare's about to happen but it still always gets you, and they don't ever really feel cheap.  So, after writing all that I guess I totally agree with you. 
That last scene when they're in the basement was the scariest fucking scene I've ever watched.  And nothing happened!  It was just the tension and the realization of standing in a room all alone with a killer.
same, i'm not sure you would even call it a horror movie. but that scene where he stabs the two people having a picnic was the scariest shit ever and it happens in broad daylight. 
Making up a song about Coraliiiiiiiiiiine!First half of this movie I was like, "Pshhh this shit is for kids. Was my friend high recommending this as a scary movie?"Second half of the movie had me on the edge of my seat and gave me the kind of goosebumps that last for hours after it was over.
I didn't really like the movie when I saw it when I was like 14 but the final act with [the mom](/spoiler) is batshit insane and I love it.
The book went for a few jumpscare illustrations.
Ugh I can't do sexual violence films they make me so queasy
Peters: Justin open the doorJustin: Did you hear it?Peters: Yes, yes i heard it, do you know what it is?Justin: It shows you things, horrible....thingsPeters: What does?Justin: The dark inside me from the other place. I wont go back there, i wont.Peters: No baby bear, come on open the door. You stay with me Justin.Justin: If you could see the things ive seen you wouldnt try to stop me.Peters:Thats not you talking. Open the door.Justin activates airlock.Sends chills everytime i see that scene
That movie has a boat load of over-the-top jump scares.
I was so afraid during that movie that i honestly felt like i would die if i didn't stop watching it.  So i had to finish it the next night.
I'm sad TBWP is so low down the list. Easily the scariest movie I have seen.
That doorway part though. Fuck.
Hell of a film score as well!
You sound like an idiot describing the premise to someone. "Oh yeah it's a monster that comes after you but they'll go after someone else if you fuck them." Huh? But it's probably my all time favorite horror movie. It matched so perfectly what I find scary about dreams. The whole thing felt like all my worst nightmares. 
I saw this movie on the last day it was in the theatre. I was the only one in there. I knew nothing about it. I just assumed the footage was real. At the end, I was so terrified that aliens were real that I sat in the parking lot on Google for 20 minutes making sure that movie was fake. I'm a grown ass man, and I don't scare easily (or much at all, really). To this day, I have tricked 4 of my friends into watching it with the pretense that the footage is real. 2 of my friends - also grown ass men - had nightmares. Good times. 
I didn't really have any idea what I was getting into. I feel like the trailers did a good job of giving an overview without spoiling how intense it was going to be.
That movie kept making me second guess myself. When it started, I just knew Goodman's character was telling the absolute truth about the outside world. Then about halfway through, I wasn't so sure anymore, despite the evidence, or that it was something much different than what he described. I went back and forth a couple more times until the climax/reveal. ETA: this is probably a credit to the marketing team for not spoiling anything and yet still making it seem like something I wanted to watch.
The part where [Emmet died] (/spoiler) was one of the most unexpected things I've seen in a movie. 
I was pretty hyped about this movie after seeing the teaser trailer and I was not disappointed. I'm used to seeing Goodman play the "good guy" because he has such a warm voice and a great "dad" kind of demeanor, but WOW can he play the villain.
1408 has something for everyone. Are you afraid of heights, tight spaces, drowning, burning, freezing, dead bodies, ghosts, being drugged, or simply losing your mind? If so, then there's a bit in the movie that will make you uncomfortable. It's a hell of a trip. Definitely one of my favorite movies. 
If I remember correctly, Jake Gyllenhaal only blinks, like, three times in the whole movie...
"Why are you doing this to us?""Because you were home"*shudders*

"Attack warning red! Attack warning red!"Threads is terrifying, The Day After is a movie for children in comparisonEdit - typo
Robin Williams is typically light hearted a goofy in movies, especially since he is a career comedian. They probably walked into this not knowing to expect a different kind of performance, only to learn that Robin Williams is an extremely malleable actor that is extremely talented.I don't think people expected Robin to play such a creepy character, so they wrote it off as bad when really it's a fantastic movie.
Some actors become the character, and some characters become the actor. One Hour Photo and Insomnia are two roles where Robin Williams stepped out of his own persona and really became the character. Maybe people were expecting the usual Robin Williams performance, but I thought his acting was good in both movies particularly because it showed that he has more range that most directors utilized.
I've bought a cheap Jacob's ladder and I agree they are surprisingly unsettling 
Kathy Bates nailed it. 
What's truly haunting is that Stephen King wrote Annie to be a metaphor for his drug and alcohol problem at the time. This is a quote from him on the character:> Take the psychotic nurse in Misery, which I wrote when I was having such a tough time with dope. I knew what I was writing about. There was never any question. Annie was my drug problem, and she was my number-one fan. God, she never wanted to leave.
greeheeheasy
It was 100+ degrees the entire time they were filing it in Texas. The movie sweats. The terror is sweltering. 
That's why it's so scary.. There's seemingly no motive for the killings. They just like to kill people!
> Then to see Leatherface dancing almost triumphantly. I love that ending.He was really swinging that running chainsaw around pretty dangerously.  Someone needs to talk with him about safety in chainsawing.
Anthony Hopkins had only 16 minutes (some say even less) of screen time and won an Oscar for it, one of the shortest. He played the part so well.I'm also a fan of the TV series Hannibal, not quite as good as Hopkins, but Mads Mikkelsen plays the character pretty well too. 
When Lecter makes Migs kill himself just by talking to him through the bars of his cell, you really understand how evil and cunning the bastard is. Super creepy.
That scene is a perfect tapestry.Starling is in control, barely. She is terrified but has to stay in control, if she looses herself to the fear she's done.Bill has no fear, but has long ago become lost to something else. Bill is not in control. He savors what's happening. He cocks the hammer of his revolver almost sensually.Starling reacts to the click too fast for him. She rides her adrenaline, she stays in control.  Just like her doctor told her to."...when you gaze long into the abyss. The abyss gazes also into you."
I dunno, I'd marry me. I'd marry me so hard
Agreed, Stottlemeyer really nailed it there.
The crawling around in the airduct Jumpscare is definitely up there...but it's not cheap. You kinda expect it to come.However, the worst part of the movie is when you know it's coming, and you can see it... 
It's why I bought a Vive.That and E:D
Should have been Green Arrow
I love Tilda in it. She was fucking fantastic! I got stressed watching her driving around without saying anything.I am ambivalent about how I feel about her character though. I feel sorry for her but at the same time I feel like she demonised Kevin a lot. I'll stop here coz idk how to do a spoiler tag on mobile and I might reveal important plot points.
That film fucked me up. Everything he did was just cruel and evil but directed entirely at her. All the things he did were done to torment his mother. I have also never felt so sorry for someone in my life.A friend keeps telling me to read the book, I need to get around to that. 
****POSSIBLE SPOILERS**** There's an interesting nature vs. nurture message that could be taken away from the movie. Tilda Swinton's character clearly did not enjoy being a mother, she found it difficult and unrewarding and she missed her former life. Even childbirth was a painful, horrific experience for her, and she had no interest in holding her newborn baby. You could argue that the mother's passive attitude towards her child contributed to him being the way he is, rather than he was born evil.
I didn't know what it was about before I saw it.First half builds anxiety with touches of eerie and possible fantastic elements, and right after that scene, everything devolves to a rush of adrenaline. I love this movie.
I was holding my ex's hand during that part. We both jumped a bit and recoiled. He ended up snapping my wrist. I sat through the rest of the movie with a broken wrist.
The film that The Others was based on, The Innocents (1961) is also excellent, loads of chilling scenes that just unnerve and really get under your skin. Zero jump scares, no blood and guts, just great storytelling. Think I watched the whole movie on YouTube, def worth checking out.
When he is slowly walking up the stairs "Wendy. Let me finish. I'm not gonna hurt ya. I'm just gonna bash yer brains in". And he slides between such an eerily calm delivery to growling and back again in a way that is some of the best acting I have ever seen.
The typewriter reveal is some deeply intense horror
Sesevenen 2: The Sesevenening
Okay, but don't you agree that it's way too good of a film to say it resorts to cheap jump scares? And the jump scares aren't what makes the film so scary imo
It's October...you HAVE to watch it! ...again
Just re-watched this last night on a whim. And goddamn is that dog perfectly CREEPY.
Excellent point.  The blood jumping out of the petri dish is one of the most effective "jump scares" in the history of cinema, frankly.  
In summary - the jump scares are not cheap at all, they are effective and creative af.
and cigarettes. What is also crazy, is he went from Machinist size to Batman size in 3 months.
it is the writing and how they filmed it (it is stop motion after all) really helps, I believe they drop a few frames in the other world scenes for the uncanny effect
It also didn't have that pointless boy character. Coraline did everything on her own (plus cat). There was no "eek save me" moment in the book. She tricked the hand and saved the day. And they left out just how long she was alone while her parents were kidnapped. That's every child's nightmare. 
That's the first completely silent jumpscare that scared the shit out of me.
When the huge guy just walks right in. Scene went from 0 to 100 real fucking quick.
> 2 of my friends - also grown ass men - had nightmares. Those weren't nightmares, they were memories of the abductions. 
I went it pretty much blind, and I'd definitely recommend people do the same. All you need to know is that it's a very, very tense movie - so be up for that.
I was on edge expecting Goodman to dunk him face-first in the acid but no, *pop* and he was gone like that.
It also ended "openly"...and I absolutely loved it. We watch the main character go from absolutely helpless and easily killed to...a heroine of epic proportions giving her a role in future Cloverfield stories. 
Stephen Kings short story of 1408 scared the dogshit out of me.  It was just forty something pages.  But it was psychologically intense.  
hey man, some people are into that kinda stuff.  not me, but...you know, some people...I guess.
No idea, but the way he stares does stand out.
That's the part that really fucked with me.  There are actual psychopaths out there.  This could happen to anyone.
My parents saw 'cartoon' and thought I could watch it. It wasn't until about halfway through the movie they figured out that 8 year old NothingEverWorks shouldn't be watching this and he is now crying uncontrollably because he understood it. Was traumatized for a while over the horrors of nuclear war. 
Kind of like Bryan Cranston. I spent the first few episodes of Breaking Bad wondering why Walt hasn't done anything dumb and goofy yet. 
There are two people in Hollywood who ruined themselves for future roles by playing a monster too well: Anthony Hopkins and Kathy Bates.
Also, in *The Shining*, the hotel and its ghosts are King's alcoholism.  Unlike in *Misery* though, he didn't realize this at the time.  He later said, "I was the guy who ~~had written~~ wrote The Shining without even realizing that I was writing about myself."
Fuckin right, boys.
Oh, boy! Here I go killin' again!
I expected to hate the TV series. But Mads did a great job concealing the monster that his character was with a serene and confident exterior. Some of the CGI and first season "Killer of the Week" stories weren't great, but overall it was FAR too good and high concept for network television.
That's what made Lecter scary. Not the fact that he could easily overpower most people without breaking a sweat. The fact that he *didn't need to*. The fact that, given enough time and the right environment, he could simply convince someone that it was a good idea to let him eat them.
Odd how Levine seems to have been typecast as either a cop/military dude or a psycho in like 90% of his roles after Silence.
I don't understand how videogames still haven't come around to making ventilation shafts scary and suspenseful. The vents are always the safespot in every damn game.
I honestly don't think I could handle playing that game with a Vive haha. It already gave we way too much stress. 
I can't imagine what it must be like to be in her shoes. Even from an incredibly young age Kevin seemed to know what he was doing in regards to how he was around his father, to make it look like the mother was always at fault.   Imagine the mental battle of "my child hates me" and "but he's only young so I must be mad."
READ THE BOOK. it's very good. it's like the move, told through the POV of eva through letters to her husband.
I disagree. She clearly enjoyed being a mother to her daughter. I get what you mean, though. She also seemed to have regretted starting a family and wished for her old life back of travelling and having a lot of fun.
On subsequent watches you'll notice that a lot of the cave creatures are visible in the cave before the big reveal. Usually only partially or for a second, so they look like normal cave fauna to the unaware. Good movie. 
From what I understand, that "dog" was acting like that because it was half wolf and in a terrified state. It was confused and scared, so it went into super quiet stealth mode.
Palmers face just before they test is fantastic. A resigned "Oh fuck."What's more terrifying that it's the Alien impersonating him so well it's got his goddamn mannerisms.
Yes! It scares you because no one, not the characters nor the audience, was expecting Palmer to be the Thing. It scares you with the suddenness and the noise, but also scares you because you come to accept the fact that anyone can be the Thing, no matter how closely you thought you were watching them. It's brilliant.
Steroids are basically magical when used safely.
Check out Kubo and the two strings if you haven't already. Made by the same studio and has a similar animation too. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^(The aunts are also pretty creepy)
In an interview, the guys who adapted it added the little boy so coralline wasn't just talking to herself the whole time. It made for a better movie, but the book was perfect
It caught me off guard. No jumpscares for the entire movie then one out of nowhere. 
I know every other form looked normal but for some reason the huge guy had like no eyes and it was terrifying
Something different is Prisoners. He has a CRAZY stare in that. Basically hes a detective that is assigned to two missing girls case. Although it doesnt say it in the movie, you can tell his character is wired and barely has sleep. 
Kathy Bates seems to have really found her niche in American Horror Story. Love all her AHS characters. 
I disagree. Both Hopkins and Bates were nominated (and won) their first Oscar for playing that monster in 1990 but have gone on to have several successful non-typecast roles including performances that led to more Oscar nominations (3 more for Hopkins, 2 more for Bates). They're both highly respected, versatile actors.Anthony Perkins is a better example of an actor typecast by an early role as sadistic monster in Psycho; unlike Hopkins/Bates, Perkins ~~has~~ was never ~~been~~ able to escape that career-defining role.
Further, he laments that he does not remember writing the book Cujo. He was drunk throughout the entire writing of it
Canadian Trailerpark Massacre
I'll kill anyone!
That first season is some of the best television horror I've ever seen. They did a great job. 
"Why don't you try peeling off your face and feeding it to your dogs?"
Damnit. I swore I'd never watch this one again, but now you have me curious. I've already got goosebumps just thinking about watching that again.
I love the tension everyone else has too in that scene, implying some of them aren't even sure about whether or no they're the alien.
> the Alien impersonating him Major Oscar snub.
I wish I had personal trainers, physicians, and dieticians to show me how to do it properly :(
Donnie Darko is the same - to give the idea he's kinda detached from reality or psychopathic, or perhaps even lost in introspection.
That film is so underrated. Hugh Jackman and Terrence Howard also give amazing performances in it.
I thought she was really funny on The Office too.
Bates' very next movie was Fried Green Tomatoes.  She was nothing but a sweetheart in that one.  Although she does go a little psycho in the parking lot hehe
Halifax Cheeseburger Massacre
I couldn't believe it was cancelled when they announced it, it had amazing reviews, just a small audience. 
> One of my favorite TV editsFu-GET you!!
Absolutely. They caught that a brief amount in the fillings scene in the 2011 version... some of them clearly have that "How the fuck do I even know?!" look on their face (Chris Hulve sure does!)Naules at that point looks like he's just going to die regardless, the reactions and breakdown in the psyche of all of the guys is fantastic."Now, I understand you gentleman have been through a lot lately... but I'd rather not spend the rest of the winter TIED TO THIS FUCKING COUCH!"
Me too, man.. I'm so heartbroken by finding out all my goal bodies were roiders telling me all I had to do was work hard.
Paul Dano, too. He's always solid.
Indeed. Also water boy... She has that honesty that some actors have that even though I recognize her face, I don't have trouble seeing her as the character she's portraying. 
"I'm older and have better insurance".

Seriously though, these guys sold that tension. if this wasn't viewed by everyone at the time as one of those cheap special effects block busters these guys would probably have gotten awards for properly showing that tension and fear from this scene alone.

Cheeseburger Picnic Massacre
I just realized I haven't sneezed in about four days.Maybe this is really happening.
probably very quickly. some people have allergies and sneeze a lot-they would notice
I read this about 5 minutes ago and my nose hasn't stopped bleeding since. Please help.
As soon as Kleenex stock starts going down.
People working in hospitals might notice a little quicker, seeing everyone with illnesses stop sneezing at once. My bet would be a couple days, assuming the government doesn't try to cover it up or anything.
/r/AskReddit needs more of these kinds of questions. 
This is the deepest shit I've read all day. I'm perplexed by this. Would we even realise? I can't remember the last time someone sneezed, could it have happened already? when did I last sneeze? OH GOD
Is this like a twist on that movie The Children Of Men"???
What a tortuous condition that could be (if interpreted a certain way): you still felt like you had to sneeze like you normally would leading up to a sneeze, but you never could get the release that comes when you let out that sneeze. Damn dude.
A lot of times I sneeze if I look in the sun's direction, so I would probably realize after a few months. Most definitely by Summer.
I fucking love sneezing. Its a full body instaboner when i sneeze a couple times in a row. I even get jealous when i hear other people sneeze. So i think i'd definitely notice if I or nobody around me sneezed.  Sneeze. 
This is just a decoy. Hiccuping has already stopped worldwide.
OP, how high?
Put me (and several witnesses who know me) in a room with an hour for a cat. They'll spread the knowledge. I'm *extremely* allergic to them.
I'd realize it as soon as sunlight hit me and I didn't sneeze.
There are people in this world that have life long sneezing fits.  They would know immediately. 
The first people to notice will be those who are plagued by sneezing often. And even then they will just be happy they personally arent afflicted anymore and won't consider it to have effected everyone. Even when pointed out, most people will be like "huh, yeah I havnt sneezed in a while. odd" then move on with their life. It's going to take years to decades for a formal study to look into it. 
Oh man, damn, that's a crazy and interesting question. I think there's like a 60% chance that we wouldn't notice for decades. 
Not really. I sneezed 30 minutes ago. Sorry.
> How can someone be happy if their two biggest fears are commitment and dying alone? I don't know what I'm doing with my life> > > > Fuck> > > > Edit 11:18 2/12/15> > > > She just sneezed again. This is a goddamn work of art. Hats off to you. 
This is better than jenny. Keep it coming OP!
individuals, maybe they would think it's odd after a couple days. But having that translate to a global understanding and acceptance is unfathomable.
I doubt so. They of course would realize that *they* had quit sneezing... But how long would it take for them to realize that their friends had also quit? Even then, they'd probably think "wow it's crazy that both of us stopped sneezing" and so on.
You think this is funny but there are like 10 people with bleeding noses reading this and freaking out
Keep me updated damnit!
Eww, I just realized that undoubtedly some people must sneeze while their noses are bleeding.  Now I'm terrified.  Thanks.
my nose is bleeding too now wtf
Holy shit no joke my nose just started bleeding too
How do I guild your comment in black pepper
/u/copious_hyperbole hasn't posted anything in an hour./u/copious_hypebole is killRIP
In my entire life I have never seen a person that realizes they are about to sneeze race for a tissue.
Who the fuck uses kleenex for sneezes?
Good in theory, but as a nurse most people in the hospital aren't really sneezing. My thinking is that a day care worker or elementary school teacher might notice it first. Or someone with a severe allergy to cats or something. 
What an insidious government plot that could be. Truly could be a cover up on a huge scale. Aliens at Roswell, the grassy knoll shooter, and now nobody sneezes anymore. 
This is starting to sound like a Doctor  Who plot. 
It would be pretty hard to cover *that* up, people would be talking about it on social media within a day, and the knowledge would spread quickly.
/r/ShowerThoughts
that's what I'm saying man. 
I sneezed this afternoon, so we're probably good.  For now...
it's like Children of Men but for sneezingit's **Children of Nose**
I have allergies.. I would know within a few days and realize something was up...Edit -added "and"Edit 2 - I didn't realize many other people sneeze all the time... I thought I was bad..  thanks for the comments
Don't panic, I sneezed earlier today. I somehow managed to get some bacon and cheese omelette up my nose and ended up walking around the house looking up at the ceiling with a weird look on my face.When I finally sneezed it all shot out, or evaporated in my nose somewhere.Either way, I sneezed, so we are still sneezing.
My stepson sneezes like a complete knob and insists on making sure the whole house knows about it. Can confirm last sneeze at least within the past 5 hours.
I sneezed today. Rest easy. 
That'd be good. At the end all of the soldiers put their weapons down as a sneezing man comes staggering out of the building. They weep.
No it's like the twist from Shawshank Redemption.
Define tortuous?
Every post is assuming people on reddit will be the first to notice.
I am right there with you. Fuckin love it. Especially when you sneeze like 5 times in succession and your eyes water and your nose just goes numb, like you didn't even have one. 
...has anyone hiccuped?
I wish! At least once a year I have a horribly painful hiccuping episode
I'm guessing he's anywhere from 5'5 to 6'3.
You are the third person to mention this. Can you illuminate? Bad pun was intended, to my dying shame.
HOW DO WE KNOW YOURE NOT LYING FOR ATTENTION
it'd take like a week max.  sick patients that sneeze no longer sneeze.  allergy sufferers no longer sneeze.  social media connects us all easily.  it would get noticed, go viral, and it wouldn't be hard to test the results.  i think you're looking at 3-5 days for the general global community to be aware.
Yep, I'm one of them. WTF
Like me right now. No seriously it's bleeding.
We can confirm that /u/copious_hyperbole is dead to his lack of response.goodnight sweat princ

Kleenex suddenly starts being sold exclusively in Adult stores, and advertising on porn sites. Kimberly-Clark buys Vivid Entertainment.
Really? It sounds like people store that sort of thing in jars and boxes.
I do this all of the time
Any sanitary person who doesn't want mucus on his clothes?
Yeah, it would definitely be all the people with allergies first
With 7 billion people in the world, I'm sure there is someone, somewhere, who is doing research specifically on sneezing. Maybe they pay test subjects to sniff pepper and then measure the force of their sneeze, I dunno. Anyway, that sneezologist would notice right away and put the word out.
Well, *someone* is bound to overreact though.  *This lack of sneezing is mentioned indirectly in Revaluations! The end is upon us!*
Yeah no way those non-first world countries would ever notice the lack on sneezing!
They could hire people to pretend to sneeze.

I think you're lying because I can't remember the last time I sneezed. OP is clearly a rogue government scientist that has decided to tell everyone the top secret research that governments perform to maintain control of the world.
I can't wait to see the cinematography for that.  A 10 minute long shot of Clive Owen walking with someone sneezing and everyone staring. 
The Mucous of Men makes *so much more sense*.

How do you know that wasn't the last sneeze ever? You could have been the last person to sneeze.
When he opens the box and its his wifes head??
This is so handy. You never have to suffer with the half sneeze that leaves you feeling like you need to sneeze but cant.

Playing safe with averages and a range, I see. /u/Dudwithacake, I'm going all in with 5'3.
>  but it'd get mentioned on big internet hubs like reddit or 4chan.DAE not sneeze??
Excellent answer, followed up by an excellent followup question. Imagine if we all had lost the ability to sneeze a while ago, but still had that buildup feeling. You know how much it sucks when you're just about to sneeze and then you can't? So if that just happened every time you would have sneezed otherwise. How would such a phenomenon be interpreted/discussed? "Hey man, you know that feeling when you really have to.... do something with your nose or face or something but then you can't?" "Yeah that sucks I hate that"
I just keep thinking about what it'd be like trying to explain sneezing to my kids. "Daddy tell us again what it was like, in the before-time.""Well, kids, your nose would feel kind of funny for a second, then there'd be like, a nose-explosion that you can't control, and you sometimes involuntarily made a sound like, 'achoo,' and then you just went on with your day.""And what caused it?""Cats, for some people. Pollen. Too much pepper. Sexual arousal, for one guy I knew in high school."
Your nose, of all noses, shouldn't be bleeding! *Oh God it's happening.....*
Mine was bleeding a bit earlier, but I think that was because I accidentally inhaled some powdered benzoic acid in the lab earlier. Hasn't bled since, so it hopefully killed any eggs that were in there.

You guys don't wipe anything other than sperm and snot? 
The worst is when the tissue box starts getting low and the tissue falls inside the box.Then when you have to sneeze you have be like a fucking ninja to reach inside the box, carefully lift off the next sheet, and pull it back to your face with 1-2 seconds. Anything less than perfection results in grabbing a whole stack of tissues, flipping the tissue box across the table, and sneezing all over your arm.
But who has kleenex always within reach?
"Huh, that's funny, I'm *not* miserable right now. Something's not right..."

2 Kings 4:35>Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.
TIL the Bible has a section about adjusting the value on things
>Revaluations /r/TheyDidTheHolyMath.
They would, but lacking the ability to sneeze, while annoying, isn't life threatening. So while they'd notice, it'd be slower, as developed countries tend to have a higher availability of care and they're likely to have more important things to worry about than lack of sneezing.Not being able to sneeze would be odd, but when you've still got epidemics of TB and Polio, then it's pretty low down the list of things that you report to the WHO.

This actually made me look like a fool many times before I knew about it.  I, too, thought it affected everyone, and more than once when someone said something like "argh I really need to sneeze but can't" I would respond "just look at the sun!"People looked at me like I was fucking crazy, but never said anything.  It wasn't until a few years ago that I learned about photic sneeze reflex, and suddenly felt like an idiot for all the times the above situation happened.
That's a bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see if it pays off for 'em.
And so it begins.
Then a post asking that would result in answers exactly like in this one."Shit... I don't know... when was the last time I sneezed?"
The next big question is how long before /r/circlejerk picked it up.
I prefer to call it Photosynthesneeze
I have it. I kind of like it though. Sneezing feels good. I induce sneezing a lot.

Yeah, we only stopped sneezing god knows when, let's be realistic.
Sure...blood. Not mine though...wait.
No, you're still miserable but now it's even worse because you *can't sneeze*. You don't *lack* the symptoms or need.
Yeah, but he would probably lose his funding when there was no one to sneeze for his research.
What is it with the fucking number 7 and the bible.  Every other goddamn story has the numeral 7 or 40 in it.  What the fuck.
Is the past merely the future making sense of itself?***MY GOD***
Well be the solution! Lets go fill that sub up again!
I sneezed less than an hour ago. We need to set up a headquarters to monitor and lapse in sneeze reports. [6]
Same..I wonder if you zoned out as long as I just did..
Just ripped from my brand new bong and I must say, I concur!
have not sneezed sense op posted, so i think we can safely say humans can no longer sneeze, confirmed here first
I can confidently say no. Oh well, civilization had a good run but i'm gonna celebrate our new lizard overlords with some good old fashioned looting.
I sneezed at about 12:36 PM EST TwiceWe're good.
The sled in the middle of the room was the jigsaw killer the whole time too.
Apparently it's something they test for in fighter pilots. Can't be colorblind. Can't sneeze when looking into the sun.
6'5"
Wait...*sneezes* okay now 
we need to start /r/nosneeze as a place to post that you just sneezed. that way, if you're ever unsure, you can check the subreddit to make sure that the world is still sneezing.
I have something very similar but it happens when I'm thinking about making a sexual advance. It's very specific, I can imagine sexy stuff and nothing happens but if I'm lying in bed and I get the idea to make a move on my wife some wire crosses and I sneeze and I hate it. 
Good lord, what's happe
May OPs eggs hatch into beautiful young ravioli
Damn Dude
F
It's pretty basic, really. 
Someone has their red wings. 
Oh God it'd just be the eternal need to sneeze, but you never could
Google "sneeze Bible".
Why? Please tell me it sounds better in context.
They are both symbolic numbers. 7 is a sign of completion or fulfillment, and 40 is a sign of renewal or cleansing. There are a lot of symbolic numbers in the bible. 7, 12, 40, 3, 6, 50, 10 and others.
And the Lord spake, saying, "Thou shalt sneeze seven times, no more, no less. Seven shall be the number thou shalt sneeze, and the number of the sneezing shall be seven. Eight shalt thou not sneeze, neither sneeze thou six, excepting that thou then proceed to seven. Ten is right out. Once the number seven, being the seventh number, be reached, then wipest thou thy face of thy booger.
40 generally doesn't mean the actual number 40, in context it kinda means "until it's done"/"a large number".
God likes certain numbers. 7 just happens to be one of them. 
**STAHP**
**WHAT'S HAPPENING ANYMORE? WHAT'S COMING ON IN FROM THE FUCKING HERE?**
I just sneezed. And will probably sneeze again within ten minutes. Yay, allergies!
Did i read the word confirmed? HL3 (fingers crossed)
the jigsaw killer was only pretending to be the handicaped killer from scary movie, he was in fact Keiser Soze. 
annnddddddd I'm 0 for 2.
Wait do you have a source for this? I'm a little concerned my superpower is going to affect my future career now O.o
achooo
Then naturally /r/nosneezecirclejerk as comedic relief from our sneeze-less judgement day. 
You know you're in a good /r/AskReddit thread when an entire new sub spins off of it. 
As you may have noticed, I am definitely on board with this humanitarian initiative, but also deeply concerned for the fate of our sneezes. I believe we are almost 10 minutes out from our last.
RI
This got weird quick. 
F
never thought I'd see those particular 3 words in 1 sentence.
If Man is five, and the Devil is six, then God is seven. 
What is this from? It sounds really familiar minus the sneezing part.
Checkmate atheists.
EMINEM IS *GAY*?
9 min old post, did it happen yet?
Yep, Confirmed HL3, picture Lord Gabe sitting at his desk writing dialog for the game windows open listing to Born Free, all of a sudden he has a sneeze attack and sneezes all of his work on HL3 out the window. Now before you have a stroke, know this cant happen now because we are free of sneezing.  
Yes, but now you can join the ranks of the photic vanguard and be forever vigilant...watching and waiting for the day when the sneeze stops.  
^^^**shit**
And of course, the inevitable /r/nosneezecirclebroke.
F
And when the sneeze cancels it still goes on cooldown, so you need to wait to cast it again.Just infuriating.
Sneezes should be more courteous and call at least 24 hours in advance.
*magical bible sneezing*
Why is the Devil afraid of God? Because God eight nine...wait
11 minutes. It had to have happened by now.
So far just itchiness and stuffiness, no actual sneezing. I also made the mistake of putting on mascara this morning so my eyes are killing me.
Nothing's worse than when you sneeze and you shit
*sneezing magically into the bible*
The government got to him first.
Thought you were a dude til the mascara part. Ehh, maybe you still are.
Early interaction with my boyfriend-Me: "That suit looks great on you. It would look better on the floor."Him: "That would wrinkle the suit."
My then-not-boyfriend and I were waiting at the train station on my train home; he would leave with the bus after it arrived. My train came and I thought 'fuck it' and kissed my then-not-boyfriend on the mouth. Immediately after, I jumped on the train, on which the doors then closed. I didn't see his reaction nor felt it so I sat pretty anxious on the train, thinking I ruined it all. About 5 minutes later, I got a text saying:'That was meant as a friends kiss, right?'Lol, bless his heart. 
Put out my hand for him to hold and he high fived me. 
Last summer I was doing my best to seduce who is my current boyfriend. We were going swimming at a friend's house, and while they were changing into their bathing suits in the house, me and him make our way to the pool.  I take advantage of this moment to strip in front of him, as sensual as possible. (Bathing suit was underneath my clothes.)He runs past me, full sprint, and cannonballs into the pool. 
"You are really cute and I like you" met with complete silence.... Later on that dude told me that he does not accept compliments well. We have already planned the next few dates.
I love to share this one:A long time before my husband and I started dating we were partying in my apartment. He said he was going to crash on the couch. I told him "you can come sleep in my bed".I shit you not he said "well where would you sleep? I can't kick you out of your bed."
Not exactly an answer to the Q but related.I was dating a guy who told me upfront that he was terrible at picking up the signs that someone liked him, was flirting, etc. So on our third (?) date, we planned that he would stay the night at my place. I thought that was pretty obvious, but just to make sure, I put a bunch of condoms on a platter on the bed, with notes all around it, pointing to the platter that said "This is a sign!"He thought it was hilarious. We had sex. It was awesome. 
Hint: "Want to have sex in the shower later?"Response: "sure!"~*later, in the shower, waiting forever, door left cracked open... I give up.*~Question: "Why didn't you come into the shower??"Response: "Oh! I didn't know you wanted me to!"~*crickets*~This has happened more than once.
This girl was sitting with our group of boys and saying "if I was to get with one of you, it would be you [my name]"And I was just like "Ah thanks very much, very kind of you to say that"
Hitting on my now boyfriend of three years. I was complimenting him on how handsome he was and how he had beautiful eyes. I wanted a closer view of them so he texted me this creepy ass shot of his eyeball with his eye as widely opened as possible. He legitimately thought that's what I wanted. After our first date, I immediately started talking about potential future dates and how much fun I had with him. I stayed out so late that I missed my friends party. However, because  I didn't hug him properly and asked to split the cost of the meal, he thought I wasn't actually interested. 
After a conversation with my boyfriend about not being obvious enough when trying to initiate sex, I decided to entice him by posing naked on the corner of the bed and seductively whispering "Hey, you" as he walked in the room.His reaction? He walks in the room, gives me a bro nod, and says, "Hey, babe! I gotta poop."We did NOT end up having sex that night.
All these comments are making me not want to try any hints at all....for now on I'm just going to be straight forward
I was living with my then-boyfriend a few years ago. Feeling a little flirtatious, I suggested we could take a shower together, you know, to save water, wink wink. His response? "Why? We don't pay for water."Shut. Down. 
Asked a guy for his number after a Meetup. Went on a date with him that he didn't realize was a date until his friend that we ran into texted him to apologize for crashing it. Currently sitting on the couch next to him, 3 years later, looking at dogs that are available for adoption. He eventually caught on.
I started talking to a guy who was behind on Game Of Thrones. So I offered to give him my HBO password so we could watch it at his place, thinking it would be a good excuse to hang out. He ends up marathoning the show without me. We're dating now, but he sure as hell not watch season 7 without me 
I was at a party drinking with a guy I had a bit of a crush on. We were joking around and I told him to touch my boob, because he jokingly accused me of padding my bra (since they're quite large).He DID touch them for a second, but then he just kept going on with the conversation. I figured he wasn't interested and I got over it.I think he realized his mistake cause he always made it a point to like everything I post on facebook.
When i was 18 and foolish a girl once asked me if i was into 'role-playing games' I said of course! And promptly started showing her my WOW account... she left pretty soon after.
In high school I sat next to a very quiet guy that I liked and whenever I was cold I made my arm touch his. He would never move but never talked to me other than to ask about class. Ten years later I messaged him on Facebook asking about the reunion and jokingly asked him to be my date. He said sure why not. We've been married for year next month. He said he didn't remember me from high school.
Him: "I dont want to pressure you, but it's pretty late and I think you should spend the night. My couch is super comfortable and I can make it up for you if you'd like.' Me: "Maybe I could sleep in your bed with you."Him: "I promise the couch isn't bad" Brutal.
I asked him if he wanted to go to my dorm for Netflix and chill. We watched Parks and Rec for two hours and then he went home without touching me once.
Not a lady, but I had this girl visit me and sleep with me in the same bed on four different occasions...from half across the country.    I thought we were just friends.    Ten years later I was taking a shit and it dawned on me that she didn't travel across the country just to sleep ffs.    I feel bad for the girl now, because I was really into her too.
One of my employees, whenever she is drunk, (brewery, not just kicking it with drunk employees) will constantly say how cute she thinks I am and how adorable my nerdiness is. Will ask me to go to bars after we close down, or to come over to hers and drink.I pretend every time I don't notice. She's pretty and all, but I like my job.I wonder if she thinks I am that dense. 
LPT: Don't beat around the bush
We were married two full years before I finally understood that if she took a bath at night I was going to get some.  Watched a lot of baseball while she lay sparkling clean in bed alone.
I had a very attractive young lady lay down on my bedroom floor, pull her pants down and showed me her newly installed clit ring.I told her it was nice and shuffled out of the room like the autist I am. Pretty sure it was a hint. I'll never know.
I'm the guy who didn't notice, but I was driving her home (we went to school together and she was on my route), and she started talking about how her boyfriend loves her blowjobs, and how good they are. I was like "lol okay that's cool".Also even if I had picked up on it I'm not a piece of shit so....
When I was 14 or 15 the neighbor girl asked if I had any porn (I did, duh, and on VHS!) and if I wanted to come over and watch it. Absolutely took her up on that offer. And after an hour or so went home with my tape and jacked off. In retrospect she wanted it and I missed the hint. 
I stripped completely naked, played sexy music and started rubbing his shoulders. He didn't even turn around and just asked if I wanted to order pizza for dinner...
Not a chick, but my fiancee  was laying on our bed in her thing and a t-shirt (on her belly) with our "pink thing" (vibrator)  next to my pillow. I came out of the shower and sat next to her an grabbed her ass and kissed her neck...she didn't react and I noticed she was on her Facebook..the digital cock block... So I tried again, nothing. So I sat back and waited like 10 mins and she goes "wow way to miss the fucking hint"WHAT THE FUCK
(I'm the oblivious guy, not the lady.)Before our third(?) date, she said I could stay over at her place if it got late. So we're watching a movie on TV there, and at the end of it, I said "I guess I better let you head off to bed. I'll take the couch."She literally had to say "I was hoping we could snuggle" before I got the hint.
Me: I think you're really cute and I like you. A lot.Him:.... uh, thanks.Accepting this unrequited crush, I decided I was happy being friends with him. 3 months down the line he spent hours comforting me after a disastrous night and then finally confessed he had feelings for me, going back 6 months. When I asked why he didn't say anything when I told him my feelings "but I wasn't sure you liked me"That was 4 years ago, he's still as cute and dense now, and is fast asleep next to me.
My current boyfriend and I started out in this weird friends that flirt stage.  I was trying to find a way to get him to make a move.  One very hot evening (middle of august) we were sitting in his backyard with a few of our friends drinking beer.  I sat on the SAME lawn chair as him, kind of wiggled in, and said "I'm cold".  He left me alone in the chair and proceeded to build a giant fire.  It took like an hour.  When he was finished making the fire he sat back down in a DIFFERENT lawn chair.  
My fiance and I were chatting on FB Messenger near the start of our relationship and it went something like this:Him: I haven't had sex in 2 yearsMe: That's quite a streak, I'd hate to mess it up ;)Him: Yeah it's been awhile....Wait, whatI then lured him into a hotel, fucked his brains out, and now we're getting married.
As a guy, I completely see your hints all the time but I'm afraid that I'm wrong and going to get rejected/made a fool out of myself so I don't do anything.
Wife started to slowly pull my shorts down as I'm playing video games. Tell her she's going to ruin my kill streak. Got punched in the dick
Her: How much do you wank during a week?Me: Well, too much lolHer friend: Haha, we could have sex then, we're also lonely at nightMe: Yeah...Then I just continued on with the conversation because I thought they were joking...2 sexy girls where asking mefor a threesome... And I didn't get it...
I wish I came close to getting any of these opportunities.
For a question that was directed at women, it sure is a sausage fest in here...
I straight up told a dude he had a glorious dick, still didn't get the "hint"
When it's hammered into your brain your whole life that it's creepy and predatory  to get forward with a girl because you think she's into you, you learn to ignore any signal that isn't bright flashing neon. The risk/reward ratio for responding to hints is not at all in our favor. Guys like to say they're just dense, but this is deeply-ingrained cultural training. Sorry ladies, until the culture changes we're going to remain oblivious.
As a guy, here's a hint to the ladies: if it's a hint, it's too subtle.
He probably thought you were going for his cheek and missed. 
Did you expect him to leave you hanging?
God... in middle school me and my best friend watched Scrubs all the time. We'd do a Todd high five in the hallways whenever we'd see each other, and one time the girl I had a crush on put up her hand like she wanted a five, so I smacked her hand as hard as I could and snapped... turns out she was waving to her friend behind me. I had forgotten until your comment.. 
Him: " Oh God, not going to be a guinea pig for that experement."
He was probably hiding his boner
The problem here is that you were hedging against rejection by turning it into a hypothetical, which also made it unclear. 
Gotta give her credit for having the confidence to just start masturbating in front of someone she doesn't know is interested...
Follow up, how do you feel about Hugo Weaving currently?
The only hint that is actually foolproof. Well done.
To be honest, I'd think you were kidding unless I was your SO. It would be too awkward to walk in on you showering and be wrong. 
> morning> walked right past me and looked for coffee in the kitchenYup, adds up. Please come back after 3pm.
Jesus. Back in highschool, I would regularly have coffee at a friend's place. She was one of those people that put a ton of effort into clothes and makeup, so it took her 30 mins to get ready.On several occasions, I'd guess 10 or so, she answered the door in a white t-shirt. Nothing but that, or at least she might have been commando, the shirt was *just* long enough to cover up.I figured she just got up late and hasn't had the time to go through the 30 min routine.FML
The extra "e" turning fiance into fiancee means your fiancee is female. If he is male, it only has the one "e": fiance.
At least you seem like a really polite guy.
I think some cases is about low selfsteem right? I used to talk with a girl online every day. And one day she told me    "I love you".    And I thought "no way someone can love ME", so I asked her    "Is it a joke?"    "Yes"    And then I thought "wait what if she is serious"    "are you sure?"    "yes, it was a joke"    Now I think maybe she felt I rejected her so she just make a save.
I don't get it, who's that Matt? (not joking....please explain)
That sounds like a joke someone would say tbh
>so he texted me this creepy ass shot of his eyeball with his eye as widely opened as possibleMY BRAND
I'm ashamed to admit I did something very similar to the eye thing
> he texted me this creepy ass shot of his eyeball with his eye as widely opened as possibleok that's actually hilarious, dude sounds like he has a great sense of humor
That's an amazing way to tell you that you missed a hint
Her: *sends link* Him: "Thanks! I could use this in the future"
That video is hilarious. 
Haha, my boyfriend came over to watch Netflix 3 nights in a row without making any moves on me or reacting to my moves. We watched Wall-E twice. I figured if I restarted it having just seen it, it wouldnt be a distraction. I was wrong. 
this is BY FAR the most hilarious one 
if only you'd said "blow your penis" that might have worked
Probably too focused on not getting an erection to notice hints.
He was in need of oxygen at that time, since before we can speak, we have to be able to breathe.  I'm gonna venture here (thousands of miles away and never having met either of you before) that you took more than his breath away with what you said.:)Source:  Have lived it.:/
We did it Reddit!
WE DID IT! WE GOT ONE GUYS!
Honestly, I would probably do this just because I hate my landlord
I thought the dogs were in your living room for a minute and was confused. See what happens!
I know it was probably more smooth, but the thought of you saying "I could do better than that", pausing, and internally deciding "alright, let me talk about why the Alien would have easily gotten Ripley there" is too funny. 
Liking everything you post on social media is the guy version of dropping hints
if you're doing all that, why not move the inch to kiss him?
The arm thing is too subtle tbh. It could just be you being clumsy. Yesterday a girl I was sitting next to touched my arm three times in about a minute and the first two I thought might have been on accident, but the third time I said "what's up?" And she said that it was an accident. So yeah :/
i do the arm thing too i dont think it works asdf
I don't know what went down or how things ended but you should call this person. Like right now. You can't make up for being an idiot in the past but in 10 years you'll look back at this and think 'why did I never reach out to her after that stupid ex gf drama?'Reread your last sentence and apply that to your current situation dummy. 
I think you may have gotten rejected
Sometimes Netflix and chill just means Netflix and chill... Doesn't it? ...Shit!
I dunno man. I had a lady friend visit me in a different country while I was working abroad, share a bed with me for two weeks, and practically act like a wife with me. I told her I was into her and when I directly asked her if there was anything going on between us she said no. 
Are you a philosopher on the toilet?
Actually I think that one might work.
It's ok...I can literally invite my husband to get in the tub with me, and he doesn't get it. Sigh..
(Voice drifting down the stairs:)*Dear, second and third bases are up here waiting for you!*
Good on ya. Always cut that shit off immediately
It's been eight mins. That's like 6 mins longer than average. For ant killing I mean.
So what happened 
Well, did you?
What was he so engrossed in? Video game? Newspaper?
Rub his penis. Touch the parts that are most involved in sex. 
Plot Twist: She was a ghost that haunted the Gym and therefore couldn't leave
Just tryna get free attention from you.... drop her
Omg reading this makes me rethink all the times I was flat out rejected. Maybe the guys were just dense.
Sadly I think I'm even more bone headed than you. I was sleeping over at a friends after a party when the hot girl I had been talking to all night suggested we sleep on the pull out together so neither of us had to take the floor. We lay down:Her: "You have great lips."Me: "That's really nice, thanks." *rolls over and goes to bed*
But where was the tattoo?
Honestly, good on you for not assuming. 
I mean are you?
Her : I want to have sex with youMe : Thanks.
Love this one. Glad it worked out.
Fire is much more effective at keeping warmth than cuddles. That man's a keeper.
The guy made a fire for you because you said "I'm cold". It took him like an hour.Marry him.
jesus that sounds like what i would do. my thought process would be, hmm she's cold oh i'll build her a fire to keep her warm. aw yea she looks comfy now, better not ruin it by crowding her in that tiny lawn chair, oooh look an empty lawn chair..... yea i did good, i'm so thoughtful!
No man passes up a good excuse to light shit on fire.
Man brain:*"Female, cold. Fire, hot. Female couldn't possibly be attracted to me. Must build fire."*
Oh god that's a hint I'd miss. I have an awful addiction to solving problems like that.I'd build a fire too :(
What the nut are "kiss me" eyes?
My wife and I have worked out a code phrase, for when one of us isn't picking up on the obvious signals. We say, "Howdy partner."It's a quote from Shanghai Noon, and it works like a charm.
Just saying I would do the same thing in his shoes.
No offense but smoking weed and watching saw sounds like the least sexual/romantic thing I could ever think to do
> palms were sweatyKnees weak arms spaghetti
Upstairs and coffee was the old Netflix and chill.
 Can't tell if Seinfeld reference
To be fair, X Movie was insane!!!! I remember waiting in line for hours for that premiere. So freakin nuts!!
I wouldn't have got this one to be fair. In fact, I still wouldn't even think that's an obvious hint even after reading it
>  lured him into a hotelWhat bait did you use?
> I then lured him into a hotel, fucked his brains out, and now we're getting married.OK but is he still oblivious or no? I reading a lot of mixed signals here.
If that was me, I'd have thought you were being sincere when you said you hate the thought of ending the streak.
You find her and you explain it, you dense mother fucker. I NEED CLOSURE. THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU.
Smerk a jernt
Idk man I feel like this goes both ways right?If you spend months with someone for the purpose of sleeping with them you might want to just say it after awhile haha.
also as a guy, its hard to tell to what extent that hint goesfrom a simple "i think you're a cool person and we should be friends"to a "you're pretty attractive and i wouldn't be opposed to having a relationship"to "perform intercourse with me"to "im being polite and keeping the party vibes up, but to be honest I am indifferent to you."its hard man. i can barely read books 
I think this is the REAL story. Some hints are a little too subtle, but for the most part, men just don't wanna be considered creepy if they're wrong.
As is tradition
Why'd you see his dong 
Rookie mistake I have made before
Definitely
And yet, if I do the exact same thing ONE TIME...
"Better not risk it, could be meant for someone else" 
Hahaha! Okay, I see your point.Counterpoint: I'm married to this guy. And I was married to him on every occasion of the above scenario. :P
Matt's gay
"How about we go back to my place and do what they did in the movie""Oh I'll show you a move or two"*leaves to rewatch the movie to know what you were referring to*
Seriously
GRAB US BY THE DICKS!
I think the "I'm serious" is an important addition. 
I hear you. I've had bad landlords too. Unfortunately in this particular instance...our landlord was pretty great. 
That's pretty solid confidence. "Yeah I could do better than that and I don't even need to prove it."
I did this for shits and giggles to a friend's dog instagram. I sure hope that dog doesn't get the wrong idea.
Dude. You opened my eyes. This happened to me all through middle school and I blew it off every time. I didn't know that was a hint, I thought they were just teasing me. Which they also could've been doing
Reminds me of a time I accidentally touched a girl's ass 2 or 3 times in the cafeteria line. I kept dropping something, and every time I picked it up, she'd back her ass into my head.Before somebody suggests she did it intentionally, I received a death glare after the second time.
Yep, that's my husband. I've tried being coy and he picks up on it like 30% of the time. I've gotten to the point where I just say "Wanna go fuck?" rather than being coy. Works like a charm.
I killed an ant and she said "thanks, ttyl." Fuck this fantasy world it's outrageously misleading 
Hunger
If your guy is still not getting the hint, try placing your vagina *around* his penis. With many men this may quickly result in arousal.
You can not underestimate the denseness. 
A lot of guys are very dense or they think maybe you're hitting on them but then they think they are reading too much into it and you're gonna freak out, which is pretty dense, so yeah.
> "That's really nice, thanks." I haven't laughed this hard in ages. That is truly a spectacular fail 
A surprising number of these are young men unsure what constitutes consent, and young women unsure how to grant consent in a way that doesn't disturb the sexual tension. It's almost as if the sexes have trouble clearly communicating their needs and desires to each other because of some unspeakable chasm.
Me: Hahaha. Sure you do. 
Me too thanks 
Worked out?  She has him captured and tranquilized!
Teach a man to cuddle and he'll fuck for one night. Teach a man to fire and he'll fuck for life. 
Seriously. She said jump and he built a plane, overachiever in my mind.
Yup yup yup, she's probably amazed at my fire building mad skillz.   Wait, she's not smiling. Why is she staring at me? Oh shit. Did I take too long to build a fire? Is the fire not big enough? Is it TOO big? That must be it. Oh nonononono. She thinks I'm a wood wasting blockhead.  I blew it. I'm never gonna get a girlfriend. Dude life sucks. I gotta go play counterstrike.*storms out of the chair into the night...*
*Build fire, demonstrate worth. Perhaps then female* will *be attracted to me.*
*Inner man-fire not as efficient as burning wood fire. Proceed with obvious course of action*
It's when the woman is staring at the man thinking "kiss me", and the man is wondering "do I have something stuck between my teeth?"
Mine and my boyfriend's code in public is, "Wanna watch Predator?"
Yea...that's a terrible hint, tbh. That would basically be screaming to me that it was a joke and to turn around/look away/give privacy.
Coffee at 3am is not coffee, coffee at 3am means sex!
"So where are you sleeping tonight?" totally sounds like she's making sure you have plans to sleep somewhere else. If a friend is drunk at your place and you want them gone before they crash there, you would ask, "So who's driving you back home?"
Vagina
There's no way to tell. Maybe she's just being polite?
Hahaha, I have an SO now so that's a ship long sailed...I also wouldn't know how to find her if I wanted to. Last I heard from our mutual friend, she went to Asia to teach English.
Im laughing way to hard at this
Dont worry. I can mostly read books, and I havent really figured it out either.
We had sex twice, I guess he didn't understand all I wanted was more sex later on 
 >It's like she handed me a one-colored Rubix cube and I still had trouble solving it. And the only color was "SEX." On the bright side, you've certainly got a way with words.
"So she's sucking my dick and I'm here thinking, 'Does she like me, or...'"
YOU'RE CHEATING ON ME???
Okay then that's a missed hint
I have literally dragged my husband by his penis to the bedroom. He's pulled my hair. It's been a fun 10 years.
My first time I swear the entire time up until we were actually fucking, and I mean up until I was balls deep I doubted she wanted to actually have sex and thought it was just some joke and she would stop joking before I did. Welp, neither stopped joking for 3 years after that. 
I dunno... I've seen the movie Carrie. People be evil.
I hate that. Or when you're deep in thought, staring into space and you realize that you are looking right at some girl and it's awkward
We have a code now. "Want to take a nap?" The problem now with two kids, one a newborn, is I'm never quite sure if we are going to sleep or have sex until we get to the bedroom. Usually we have a nap and then have a nap.
Damn that ant died and you didn't even get any 
idk she might just be being polite
It's not even denseness, just a failure to properly escalate. Dollars to donuts says they picked up on it but thought "There's no way, she's just being nice or goofy or whatever".
This exactly. Girls are still under the impression that the guy is just supposed to "act" on his urges and make a move. I've always been worried that I will cross some line that I didn't see thinking I was getting "make a move" signals. Girls, if you want to give signals do something physical like touching his hand or taking his arm. We will 100% get the signal if it's physical rather than verbal.
But what if you're not good looking but can build an amazing fire?!
That, or he sucks at making fires
I knew my LV. 99 fire making skill would one day come in handy [EDIT]: and then you can wrap her in your skill cape to keep warm [EDIT2]: wow, first time getting gold, thanks. May Saradomin forever guide your path:)
Ok so I think I've understood the "kiss me eyes" finally. When I feel awkward that they are staring at me I should kiss them 
"She's staring directly at my face and hasn't said anything for 45 seconds....I don't like this" 
Me and my girlfriends code is "Wanna go to the garage?" Because the first night in my bedroom she said, "So this is your bedroom?" And I said, "No this is my garage."
As a military man, most of my 0300 coffees don't mean sex.They sure feel like it though.
Damn Canadians
You drove her off the continent!
Look at you, Mr. Fancy Pants. I saw a book once. I've never even been close to figuring it out as well. 
"She's probably just being nice, probably feels bad for me or something. It doesn't mean anything."
WHEN I SPECIFICALLY ASKED YOU NOT TO?
You're 100% sure he got the hint? Some of these comments are making me wonder if that was enough.
People suck sometimes, but pad yourself on the back for doing the right thing - even though it backfired
Do you nap first? Or nap first?
Maybe she's from Canada
...guilty of this. When in doubt, I default to this.
Well, yesterday I told a good guy friend of mine that I wanted to have sex with him. Just straight out. He was really surprised but hey, guess who got laid today?
He had to chop down a tree and split it into logs first.
"FIGHT OR FLIGHT"
Here in my garage...
What did you say about me?
Yeah you really cant tell in this situation. Shes probably just canadain and beig polite.
Sex happened so either he got the hint or just said "fuck it" and decided since the kids were outside and we were in the bedroom, why the hell not? Haha
As goofy as that sound, reading all those comments, I'm starting to think we really need to find a universal code. 
Probably Chris Evans 
When I was 8 or so my old nanny/baby sitter (choose which you prefer) was showing me a video of her time with her boyfriend in Paris. After it blacks out for a few seconds it then suddenly cuts to her lying on her hotel bed completely naked, legs spread, telling her boyfriend to 'come get it'. She jumped out of her seat tried to cover my eyes and told me to never tell anyone. I have now told potentially thousands of random strangers
Was getting a vasectomy and the doctor told me not to look down.I looked down....I shouldn't have looked down.
I was helping MIL cleaning out her closet. All was jokes and laughter until I pull out an unopened massive dildo. We were both paralyzed for a moment before she slowly took it out of my hands and mumbled something about the dildo not being what she tought it would be like and that she ordered it online. She then backed out of the room and threw it in a cupboard. We then proceeded to clean the rest of the closet.I desperately wanted to tell SO about this awkward event but decided to spare him. 
My boss forwarded me an email telling me to do something. I noticed the email chain had his bosses on it so I read through the chain. They had asked him to rate all my co-workers and I from best to worse earlier in the conversation. 
I used to do a little work after school at a local comic shop. One day after school I was bagging comics when the owners buddy came in. "Look at these!  Came out great!"  He had a stack of glossy amateur porn, featuring the shop owner, his buddy, and the owners wife fucking. He laid them out all over the counter and they started pawing through the stack excitedly. From what I could see it looked  like the three of them enjoyed one another's company equally and vigorously. Then they noticed I was there. I got sent home early with a stack of free comics. 
I was driving from West Berlin to West Germany in the late 1980's.  My bf gives me wrong instructions so I have to take an exit off the Autobahn to turn back and get back to the correct exit.  On the small country road on which we found ourselves, we see a large truck with a missile on it, surrounded by Russian soldiers.  They were as surprised as we were, but just laughed and waved at us, as we got the hell out of there as quickly as possible.
My teacher shoving a flask into his desk drawer when I came in unexpectedly.
I was about 8 or 9 and my parents were going to be out of town so they had me and siblings stay with a family from our church. Once we got to the house (which was really nice BTW) they had one rule, you can play wherever you want but the basement is off limits. Me being the little bastard that I was snuck down there first chance I got and was supremely disappointed to only find rows and rows of plants growing under lights.
More heard than seen, but...I was golfing with my mother's fiance when he got a phone call. He had his cell volume turned up really high, and I overheard a woman who wasn't my mother say some things, including the phrase "fuck and suck," in a seductive manner. I convinced myself that it wasn't my business, or that I'd misunderstood, and dropped it.A few years later, her now-husband was revealed to be a serial cheater, with active partners numbering in the dozens.Yes, I still feel like shit.Yes, they're divorced.
Saw a Homer Simpson keychain in my mom's desk drawer. Didn't say anything.Two weeks later its in my Christmas stocking and she goes "Wow, how did Santa know how much you like the Simpsons".Thats how I figured out Santa must've been sleeping with my mom.
Walking in on my cousins railing each other.....Now I understand why they were close at thanksgiving.
When I was younger, my family went to look round a house we were considering buying. Went into the owner's daughter's room and there was a blow up sex doll on the floor, it was really funny but we didn't end up buying the house.
Back in middle school we had this really strange gym teacher about 6'2 and ripped. Me and my friend were going to take a dump and thought that the locker room toilets would be clean since no one used them throughout the day. When we walked in to our left was one big shower room and there was our gym teacher showering while eating spaghetti out of a tupperware container. Thank god he was wearing swim trunks but he turned around and said you guys aren't supposed to be here so we left.
Was playing at my friends house once. His grandparents were staying in his room, and I forgot. Totally ran in on them getting ready to have sex. It was awkward. 
I saw a couple banging under a secluded water fall in the woods on a hiking trip with my parents when a was 12.  Majestic AF.
I was working the night shift doing post production on a well known reality show. I walked into the men's room and found our (lady) boss bent over the sink getting fucked by one of the other night guys. They both looked up, we made eye contact (in the mirror) and I closed the door without a word. I never brought it up, but she gave me the next night off "...for all your hard work."
I saw an employees check stub that he dropped. He had been there for a month and was making what I made after my first year and was not a very good worker. I got a raise
I went to my Aunt's house and walked in to see her standing over her boyfriend who was sitting on the couch. Her shirt was pulled up and he sucking on her breast. I quickly turned around, made a loud noise in the kitchen, and intercepted my mom who would have freaked out. 
My parents' collection of sex toys - that was way more reality than my 10-year-old mind was prepared to handle 
Beavis and Butt-Head Do America.My parents found out we went into that theater and they dragged us out REAL quick.
About 9 years ago, there were a couple of notes scattered across the computer desk in my parents' study. I happened to read them because words are in front of my face, what am I gonna do?They were notes my parents had written each other instead of just talking to each other.Because my dad had slept with 14 hookers.
One Christmas Eve I couldnt sleep at all so I went to the kitchen to get some water or something and out in the living room were my parents setting out presents and eating the cookies I had left out.  They said that Santa was running late and was in such a big hurry that he just dropped off the presents and asked them to put them out for him.
Alright, here it goes. I was in the 7th grade so I was almost 12. I woke up in the middle of the night and I heard my mom screaming. I jump up and get ready to defend my mom. I open up my parents bedroom door and my mom was definitely not in trouble. My dad was taking her from the behind. I didn't understand it at the time, but I wanted to get out of there before they noticed me. However, I fainted instead. That my friends is something I was definitely not supposed to see. Forever scarred. I'm 25 now and my dad still likes to bring it up at Christmas dinner. 
Similar story to the f-117 at the top. I was a contractor in Afghanistan working at Jalalabad air field (FOB Fenty). I woke up to take a piss and gave a cigarette. On the other side of the runway I saw a few helicopters take off but didn't hear anything. I thought it was strange as the base was dead silent but didn't think too much about it. It was only later when I read the news that it was the SEAL team raid to kill bin Laden. Because of my pea sized bladder I was probably the first non military or government person to see those stealth helicopters. 
A long time friend of mines dad was showing me pics of a car he was restoring. He accidentally pulled up nude pics of my friends mom instead. He looked awkward for a minute. He never said anything and then just started looking at car pics like it never happened.   
I worked at a fancy health food restaurant years ago. One day I was early and saw the owner mixing his homemade cold pressed garlic aioli, it was Cisco mayonnaise and a big jar of minced garlic.
An obese, greasy feller, sitting fully naked on a toilet, a mix of pain and confusion and surprise on his face as I walked into his stall at a Sizzlers restaurant.Stayed with me for a while, not gonna lie.
My dad's bank account balance when I was ~12, stopped asking for things after that
When I was about 4-5 years old I watched Eddie Murphy: Raw in its entirety around the corner from the living room while my parents were watching it. I was super quiet and they were laughing their ass off so they didn't notice. I learned all sorts of cool new words!
my mother's suicide note, unused
When I was little, my father set a password on a computer I was using for playing games. I wanted him to type the password (while I was away), but set a camera to record it. Hid it behind a pile of books.The trick was, the camera back in the days was only able to record for 30 seconds, so I had to call my father and run out of the room, so he could type it as quickly as possible. It stopped filming just as he hit Enter.
Ben Affleck's social security number.Years ago I was working for a company that I could access different departments' server files in.  I was bored one day and was poking through those files to see what else the company had going on.  I found a contract for a production deal with Ben Affleck, and his SSN was included (for payroll purposes).  I closed the file because I knew I should not have been looking at that, even if it was accessible. No, I didn't retain it or remember it.  No, I would not do anything with it if I did.  I don't care about his personal life.
As a middle schooler, I picked up a book at the library, flipped through the pages and found an application for a replacement birth certificate for some old man. It had every detail about his personal identification on it, so naturally I took it home thinking, "I'll just hold onto this incase I ever need to assume a fake identity by pretending to be an 80 year old man and flee the country." My mom found it and had to explain to me that no we don't steal people's identities.
When I was about 5, my mom took me to the bank because she needed something out of the safety deposit box. It was right when they were opening up. They asked us to turn around while they unlocked the vault, but I peeked. According to family lore, I went around the rest of the day chanting the numbers of the combination.
I walked in on my mom, dad, and stepmom having a threesome. 
My grandmother dying. I was 7 and the phone rang, so I answered it. I walked into the back bedroom where my mother, aunt, and grandfather were standing around my grandmother's bed. When I walked in the room, I noticed her move her head like she was looking at something on the ceiling. Then I heard someone say, "this is it..." I've heard my mother tell the story of the moment she died and it's exactly what I witnessed. I've never told anyone. I'm 25 now. 
It's more something that this person wasn't supposed to hear than see but back in the 80's, my AP US History teacher won an award and got to have lunch with Senator Ted Kennedy and hung out with him in his office. As he was leaving, he saw an aide walk up to Ted Kennedy and whispered something into Kennedy's ear. Then Ted Kennedy yelled "HOW THE FUCK DO YOU LOSE A NUCLEAR WARHEAD!" as my history teacher was just casually walking away. 
My dad's penis. He kept it covered, but I had the weird habit as a kid of coming downstairs at midnight and going for an hour long walk. When I came home, he was usually at the computer masturbating in a bathrobe. 
Two female long time coworkers in the office on a Saturday. One going down on the other in her cubicle. She popped her head up and looked right at me with that 'Oh shit!' Look.I gave her the thumbs up, said; 'I have seen nothing.' and walked away. I once walked in on my father masturbating. Nothing was said.
Luckily I didn't actually see it, but when I was about 10 years old I was awaken from sleep in our caravan by the sound my dad having sex with my aunt (both where drunk) in the other end of the caravan while my mom was passed out drunk outside.  Ah, fun vacation memories.
This isn't a particularly scandalous story, but I think it's amusing. My dad is a carpenter, and I used to come with him on installations to help out. One time we were putting in a cabinet for this nice Jewish couple, inside their study. I was walking by the computer on the desk, and I couldn't help noticing the open web page on it: OyWhatADeal.com 
I'm sure everyone can add the nudity of a friend to the list, so I'll skip that.  SPOILER ALERT: I learned at 6 that Santa was not really bringing me presents when I had my door cracked open on Christmas Eve and saw my dad and my cat wrestling with a present that my dad was trying in vain to get out of my cat's clutches. The scratches down his arm the next morning confirmed that it wasn't a dream. Sassy never took shit from anyone, though. 
I was on the doctor doom tower of terror, and when I was at the apex I could see Spiderman riding a four wheeler in an empty alley
Opposite side: I got married towards the end of law school, and after graduating stayed with my parents for a few months while I prepped for the bar exam. My wife and I were fooling around, when my then-18-year-old brother opened the door and walked in to a perfect shot of us both spread eagle, touching each other's bits. That was the last time that door went unlocked. 
For my HS lacrosse team, one of the parents put together a dvd of pictures and highlights from the season, they didn't double check all the footage so after a pic of my teammate scoring a goal, the video immediately transitioned into footage of said players dad taking a dildo up the ass with the wife watching. 
Oh I can share something that's has some value finally.So 16 year old me was swimming in the hotel pool when some girls about my age started swimming and every time she pushed off the top of her bikini would slip down revealing her nipples. Best holiday of my life and I must have stayed in that pool for at least two hours.... She wore a different bikini the next day :( I was wearing googles btw that's how I could see under water
My neighbor's panties, which were skidmarked to hell 
was drunk, walking with my friend. friend says he has to piss. I hear liquid hitting the ground. I look over, he has his dick in his hand pissing as we're walking.
The strange man eating a urinal cake in a public bathroom. He just stared back at me and we made really awkward eye contact as he shoved the remainder into his mouth.
When I was 9 my Mom wanted me to do some more advanced reading, so she went to the story and bought me an R.L. Stine "adult fiction" novel (Goosebumps were in their prime then). I started reading the book, and about page 5, a woman starts giving a bj. I learned a lot that day. I then went into my parents room and trolled my mom by reading the passage to her.
Not see but say. I was in a long 6+ hour car ride with the parents and I decided to randomly blurt out "Dad what ever happened to the girl you got pregnant?" I have no idea what prompted me to say that. Mom turned to dad and yelled "YOU TOLD HIM ABOUT THAT?" Turns out my dad got a girl pregnant at 15 and had to get an abortion before being in high school. It was a very interesting car ride thereafter. 
> old nanny/baby sitterWas *she* old, or does "old" in this case mean "the one you used to have?"
After my little girl's mum and I split up and I had her most of the time, being an apprentice with stupid amounts of bills I'd only normally cook dinner for my little girl (then 2) and I'd eat what she didn't. One night we had chicken bits I think? And I had a few and after I'd finish mine I looked at her eating hers and smiled at her, and she put some of hers onto my plate. I said " no you eat them" and she insisted. "You sure little bug?" (what I call her) and she said " yes! You are my daddy!!"I almost cried. Makes my heart melt
My MIL passed away suddenly a few years back and I ended up being the one to go through her things for donations because my husband and SIL were too emotional. I found 2 whole drawers of sex toys and homemade porn that went straight into a trash bag and into the dumpster. Never told my husband.  
How did you do? 
>"there's a problem with the disc."Brilliant. 
You stole from the Mob and lived to speak about it. Do an AMA!
So I'm assuming as an 8 or 9 year old, you didn't know it was weed.. so when did you figure it out exactly?*15 years later, in bed sleeping...*You: . . .You: . . .You: . . *WAKES UP* IT WAS POT
I expected more of these finds here. Were they orchids? ;)
she wanted you to see. You missed out.If you took that opportunity you would now be living with her on an island in Greece with 2 sons, one daughter and 2 grandchildren. Your grandchild Arthur would like playing football with the local kids and Jasmine would be the kind of girl that occasionally grabs a book but most of the time she would take a boat and paddle out into the sea and come back a few hours later with a sunburn.fucked up real bad.
Well, on the plus side we know how dad deals with his sexless marriage.
She could have been saying "it would fucking suck if I framed you as a serial cheater"
Please tell me that they are on different sides of the family
You and your friend were going to take a dump together. Damn. Friendship goals.
oh shit
You know, my first thought is they were smoking pot or doing lines or something, or even simply sneaking cigarettes. Seems way more plausible she would risk doing drugs/smoking with a friend -which presumably all the adults there would be cool with and merely hiding it from the kiddos- than two adults fucking with their spouses and children all downstairs *and* you not overhearing a single moan or grunt.Not calling you a liar or anything, just thinking from our adult perspective. There's more grown ups do in secret than bone.
ayyyy hell yea gramps you hit dat brah i'm out
I was once walking through the woods on a piece of property behind my parents property and saw two people fucking doggy style in the middle of a pathway. I was probably about 12 too. The brush was so dense I rounded a corner and was basically right behind them. It was not a majestic view at all. More like two cows going at it. I made eye contact with the guy, and he started cracking up. The woman seemed panicked and couldn't get her clothes back on. 0/10 would not recommend. 
I saw my dads successful hanging at three years old. That shit screws you up for life
Wow, no one should see that.  I'm sorry.
He wanted you to find it, so you could get a raise.What a bro!
> and intercepted my mom who would have freaked out.Such a good wingman for your aunt's boyfriend.
My parents never allowed me to watch Ed Edd and Eddy. They said bad words like "stupid".
This is bizarre.  I can't imagine that pills could be shipped in anything less than a tamper-proof container.  I always figured the procedure would be similar to how my company moves cash around- in thick plastic bags that are numbered with matching seals.
> HR gave 0 shits about its employees and only protected the managers.Worked at FedEx Ground. Can confirm. 
Something similar happened twice to me.  I'm not in HR and I grabbed a binder off the shelf that appeared to be empty that I was going to use for prepping and RFP.  Printed excel spreadsheet of every employees salary.5 years later, my boss sends me a budget spreadsheet for the entire team including my peers.  I'm making my own adjustments for my team and realized there are hidden columns.  Unhide.  And that's when I asked for a raise...  
Goddamnit Cyril!
14 is a very specific number.  No more, no less? Exactly 14? I have to wonder, how did she establish that it was 14.  Did he admit to 14, which would make the number suspicious.  Or did she find credit card evidence of 14 transactions at 'Happy Hands Massage Studio.'  Or what?  Wow, I'm way too curious.  I'm sorry you had to see those notes. 
Similar story: once I came home late at night when everyone else was asleep. My cat was sitting on the chair on the porch and there were about 5 or 6 strange cats sitting in the porch or the steps, all facing him. I watched for a moment and they seemed totally relaxed, all sitting with neutral body language. I took a step forward, they heard me and scattered in an instant, and my cat calmly asked to be let inside. He was fat, irritable, and a badass killer. I from then on assumed him to be some sort of cat mafioso. Happened in NJ btw. 
Man...I remember emptying my mom's purse out on her bed one time when I was a kid, and some condoms fell out. I'm being inquisitive, asking her what they are, I probably opened one? idk. Anyways, she claims they're balloons. And blows one up and ties it off. And that's how I got a balloon one summer day.
This makes me wonder if your cousin was just habitually chewing on condoms
You were standing there in a daze for so long that someone had to come looking for you.
" Used the bathroom "
What kind of helicopters were they again?
That's when you show him some nudes of your girlfriend so it won't be awkward
This happened with my wifes real hot aunt, and me. She was showing pics of her new backyard renevation to myself and her sister, and swiped onto a full nude shot.
This exact thing happened to me with my Uncle! He was showing me photos of an old Triumph he was restoring, and one swipe to many and I was looking at a picture my aunt must have sent him of her p*ssy. It's a real shame because she was my favourite aunt
Aww fuck man, sorry to hear 
Dude, same here. I was too young to know just how low that number was but I knew it wasn't much. Thinking back, I have no idea how they fed and clothed three kids with that. Oh wait, I do. It's called credit card debt. 
And a lifelong love of leather jumpsuits.
I found one of those, too. It made me feel very alone.
It's one of those, should i tell someone? would they believe me? Was it real spies or just dodgy companies?
Usually a dead drop is done so that you are never at the same place at the same time.  I know for a fact the the CIA likes to hide thing in airport bathroom toilet stalls.
Should have followed one of them lol
This reminded me of the time I pulled off some mission impossible level shit (at least to teenage me) with my dad.  I put the slightest amount of some face cream I found in the bathroom -- not oily, but left the faintest residue -- on the TV remote buttons, and got him to put in his pin # to unlock his blocked channels on the cable box for me.  I could see his fingerprints on the buttons and later while unsupervised, used that to figure out his code.
I realize if I had kids how screwed they would be with stuff like this."Hey dad can you log in?""Oh did you forget your login password? Here let me just reset it in AD for you."
This is so cute and innocent 
Similarly, Chris Pratt placed an order with us and i have his gmail address. i actually had looked the order up when i was investigating fraudulent purchases. People put in fake names sometimes. Sure enough, the address the package was going to was some huge mansion place so i deemed it not fraud. The email address is actually kind of funny, I'm sure he made it himself. No, I won't give it to any of you so don't ask. 
> No, I didn't retain it or remember it. No, I would not do anything with it if I did. I don't care about his personal life.That's exactly what I would expect a Slytherin to say...
To be fair IF you were ever to use it, the man would likely be dead by then. You wouldn't be ruining anyone's life by using it.
Did they at least tell you at some point?Didn't they wonder why you froze them both out?
> If there is one credit card number that you could get away with stealing, his would've been perfectI don't know.  If there's someone you don't want to fuck with it's an African dictator.
I'm so glad you caught that asshole. Did things get better with your wife once you let her know what had been going on?
A girl just took off her shirt in front of me at bible camp once before she realized I was there. 
Used to work in hotel Room Service. This used to happen ALOT! People order a sandwich and think the up to 45 minutes means it'll take 45 minutes. They then run a bath or something and answer the door half naked.The one that sticks in my mind was a 20 something business woman I'd built up a bit of a rapport with. Nice, but always working, quite serious and dressed quite conservatively. I was shocked when she opened the door half naked and I could not only see she had her nipples pierced, but was covered in tattoos. She did not seem the type.
She covered herself up but it was too late. I'd seen everything. 
To think bank robbers in movies lay these really elaborate plans to get into vaults, and then it turns out they could just go in early and see the combination for themselves
h-u-n-t-e-r-2
Oh man, a threesome with an ex sounds dicey.
Usually? So this was a habitual thing, and you didn't make a point to avoid it?
Hope it was the Aunt on your mom's side
We need a follow up. Does your mother know it happened?
I looked it up. It wants me to confirm my city, with the only option being Detroit. Then it asks for my email. No explanation or details are given. I'm too scared to proceed any further.
this one's kinda cute and not completely horrible compared to the others in this thread.  the same thing happened to me when I woke up when my dad was putting coins under my pillowcase and taking the teeth for the tooth fairy away.
Homeward Bound fan?
I wonder how many UFO sightings it's responsible for?
Who has sex in their parents house with an unlocked door?!?! That's protocol number 1 for sex in the folks house rookie!!!!!!
Then what happened?
My SO's brother once walked in on his 75+ year old grandparents having sex. I guess he wasn't expected to arrive until an hour or so later. The worst part was instead of being embarrassed, the grandpa got out of bed and went in for a hug. And shrugged "What? It's natural. You should be happy we can still do it." I'm pretty sure he still has PTSD dreams about it to this day. 
I've seen this porno
Nowadays you can just search on Goggle for nip slips.
Oh god I can't believe you sent that to your personal email.... 
Multitasking.
Jesus Christ. I ... don't have words for that 
wow, what a selfish, greedy, philandering piece of shit.  Even cheating on your spouse with one other person is already expensive and time consuming.
dicks are dicks, but the porn u end up at towards the end of a session... thats private!
One thing I've learned is if it were socially acceptable, a large percentage of woman would prefer to be naked pretty much all the time.  They probably would too if it weren't for all us men trying to mate with them.
as someone who for several years could only afford to heat my house when my daughter stayed over, I know how awful it can be. Hope things are better for you, I'm lucky enough to be alright financially now
Best administrative assistant ever.
The peasant! *At the diner...*He didn't pay his check.
I don't think I was. She had a good 30 years on me, and never implied anything before or after.
My best friend in my early twenties married his cousin.
And that's what he did.
Damn, I'm very sorry that you had to witness that.I morbidly think of how different/better/worse life would have been had she succeeded. My own mentality aside, if it weren't for her, I would have never come to America, but because of her she has single-handedly ruined my (half)brother's childhood, and in a way I basically had to raise a kid at 12 years old while keeping her bat-shit crazy ass away from him as much as I could. Families are fucking weird man haha.
It's like when Daryl gets Michael to ask for a raise cuz they make almost the same amount 
Me too. I also wasn't allowed to watch Spongebob 
When I was a PA I used to get sent spreadsheets from everywhere from my Manager which I then had to send out to the wider team. I always checked for hidden columns but also learned about hidden tabs. One time I almost sent out a spreadsheet to the wider team which had performance feedback per person and their ratings from their Manager and their peers. All this information was in a hidden tab. That could have been so damn messy. Silly HR.
That was in the past two weeks 
Your cat was definitely the leader of a cult
Haha. That reminds me of my brother who almost did the same. He found a pack of condoms in my dad's old jacket(coincidentally he was looking for chewing gum too) and he started blowing or filling them with water. When my mom came home he started asking why would they hide balloons from him.
She was a habitual condom chewer.
"Hey, your daughter makes that same face! Lemme see if I have a pic..."
and then what happened
Dude. The person who took my first username attempt. Well this is fun.
Sounds like he became awesome at that moment.  Plenty of kids wouldn't have given a fuuuck and been mad about it,
Shit man there are some days when I wonder how I'm able to feed and clothe myself
you're not the only one. i found one written by my sibling from when they were very young. still really messes me up. i hope things are alright with you and your family, solidarity and all that

Can you send him my nudes?
Though I'm Australian I was born on Papua New Guinea. A little while ago I couldn't find my birth certificate anywhere so I rang the hospital in PNG where I was born and gave them my name and DOB and my parents name. With little fuss I was just told to wire them $70 and they'd send me a copy. I then realised how easy it would be for me to steal someone else's identity either living or dead. 
We had the same friend group so it got passed on to them pretty quickly that I saw them. Those friends had my back and also stopped hanging out with them, which was nice.
I am now going to use the phrase "wombats ate my salad" when I need to send my girlfriend a message.I am not going to inform or clear it with her beforehand.

Yeah.

Sassy attacked him?
I believe the F-117 was responsible for a number of UFO reports before the government acknowledged its existence. 
Personally speaking, I was never to have my bedroom door closed growing up unless I was changing. Didn't matter what age I was. My mom threatened to remove the door when I wanted peace and quiet once and I had it closed. I actually live with my future in-laws currently and at first it weirded me out, because they give us *all* the privacy and don't bug us for shit. They don't come to our room whatsoever. We could probably die in there and they'd have no idea until our bodies started smelling.
No kidding. There are so many logs generated for that. If it ever comes out, it is going to be pretty easy to find out it was you.
Efficiency
I do, what a cunt. Did you manage to get some money off him?
That's sociopathic. I couldn't handle an affair to begin with, you have to be mentally fucked up to manage basically 3 families plus girlfriends.I knew a guy kind of like this, family friends. They had a normal life, big house in the OC, 2 kids, etc. Their life blew up 4-5 years back because he had another house and 6 kids with a woman 50 miles away. How the fuck...
For real. I'd have waited outside the door to see shit hit the fan.

I'll do you one better. A friend of mine and his wife MET at a family reunion. Cousins. Same last name. Everything. I think they are at least 3rd or 4th cousins. But woah. 
Haha he told Michael to ask for raise because Darryl himself asked Michael for a raise at which point he'd make more than Michael. One of my favorite episodes.
My younger cousin wasn't allowed to watch Spongebob, either. His mom was fucking insane, and one of her rules was "inoffensive words instead of swears are just as bad." She said "what the heck" was just as bad as "what the fuck." Spongebob used "barnacles" like an expletive, so it was banned 
What do you mean by hidden tab? A hidden sheet in the spreadsheet??
We had a cat like this in our neighbourhood, a big, white, haggard looking thing. Found him meowling outside my house when my cat went in heat, looked out and there's like 15 fucking male cats on my lawn behind this big badass motherfucker like "send out the wench, human". She gave birth to a couple white kittens a few months later. 
Can we talk about how good those condoms taste? And how often they break?

You go in the stall and say the secret password, "bumblebee." A dick slowly emerges from the hole in the stall. There is writing on it. You begin sucking, and slowly some of the writing wipes away from your effort, leaving only the permanent marker behind and revealing your next target.
Chris Pratt is such a nice friendly guy, he'll probably send you a box of chocolates and flowers."Nice dong buddy, but I'm happily married. May your whang find a friendly hole some day."
That is currently happening to my friend group we cut all contact with them 
I will do this, too. I don't even know what a wombat is, but I'm sure as hell gonna persist in saying that those fuckers ate my salad.
Hmmm, that's a short answer... 
I could probably write a book of the shit I saw in room service: prostitutes, danger sex, people in the middle of sex, half naked women, half naked men, sex toys, used condoms. I've had to give my opinion on lingerie, tattoos, and piercings. Oh and there once was an aggressive rent-boy!

Yeah, a bit like a danger wank. Couple call up, order 2 sandwiches. The thought of getting caught by the room service guy spurs them on. I mean she was still naked under the covers, and he was sweaty wearing just a towel. Gave me a tenner tip as well, so I'm not complaining!

"Oh, there's kind of a lot going on, but it's pretty......That's all the same guy... and... huh..."
This makes me think of the guy who took a picture at his desk with both hands in the shot and then posted further and further out pictures explaining how he took them.
Is that the horse-sized duck I have heard so much about?

Ok, that looks way to legit, I reckon it might not be photoshopped
People still think that's real. That was one of the first viral photoshopped I became aware of.

That would be super easy to explain. Everyone would just think that someone had painted a new version of the Mona Lisa with Mr. Bean's face.Unless losing our knowledge of photoshop also means we lost of knowledge of painting in general, in which case *every* painting would blow our minds.

By keeping the photo paper still under the enlarger, blocking the light from the enlarger from getting to certain places on the paper at certain times, and changing the negatives in the enlarger.  The way silver gelatin photo paper works is that the more light it gets, the darker it gets.  By making sure that only parts of the paper are getting light at a time, you can build up the image like stacking layers in photoshop.
you could be a sculpture

It's funny how people don't know (or forget) that Photoshop and its tools have the names they have *because* it's supposed to be a digital photo shop.The same way Avid Media Composer (and Premiere to a lesser extent) and its tools we made to mimic/emulate a physical film editing bay. *cut, splice, split...*(same goes with almost any other digitized process, cut, copy and paste anyone?) 
A literal photography shop.

When you gotta write 3000 words, but could get the point across in 2000.
Your point exactly. It's all because of when these programs launched, they were targeted for that industry. Using their terminology only makes sense. But now the history and context behind the terms is long gone for most. I remember when I was first learning avid in school, a foreign kid just couldn't understand why the terms were splice/ cut. While everyone else didn't even notice and assumed it was called those just because.
Also how cellphone cameras make a snapping noise
that's why things like this and also d.a.w's and video editing programs were created. to have every one of these tools at your literal fingertips

Drink for every fragmented sentence.
Every time he refers to himself as "humbled", snort an entire ounce of cocaine.
Drink everytime he mentions he has a friend
Drink every time he says "Believe me"
Every time he claims he's the only person to fix something, drink.Every time he says "great," drink.Every time he says "bigly," drink.Every time he says "fake news," drink.
Just start drinking and don't stop. 
When he finishes his speech and says "Obama, you're fired!"fuckin cringe. 
I'm for fun and all, but this just seems dangerous. 
I'm imagining it will play out like Scar's speech in the Lion King. It begins slowly, with Trump reflecting on Obama's presidency and the death of democracy. Then, he kicks it up. The skies turn red, his voice booms as Russian politicians slowly pour onto the stage behind him. Trump announces a new era where lion and hyena live together.
If he actually surprises us with a well delivered inaugural address, chug a pitcher of beer. 
Won't be watching. But I will be drinking. 
Repeated sentence = 1shot
Take a shot every time you feel displeased Trump is going to be president.  If you're a Trump supporter, take a shot every time you feel smug watching the speech.
I feel like any possible drinking game is inherently dangerous, because Trump only knows like, eight words
Drink for every vague superlative. "Huge" "Great" "Best" "amazing" all get shots.Dead by the third sentence.
> how can we turn it into a drinking game? By not watching and going out drinking. 
Drink heavily every day for the next 4 years. 
I feel like Trump will get wind of any drinking game and then edit his speech in such a way so that he kills all people trying to turn his speech into a drinking game.Sad!
Anytime "the best" is mentioned. Doesn't matter the context.
Take a sip any time you are concerned about your rights being violated. 
"China" = 1 shot
Drink everytime he makes THAT face
Pro Tip: If you're underage and still want to play a pseudo-drinking game, find some of those jelly beans that have a 50/50 chance of being disgusting (bean-boozled, I think) and replace "drink" with "pick a random bean"
Take a drink every time he audibly sniffles.
Take a shot every time the crowd gets loud and he stops talking.
A little off topic, but if you can, skip watching the address in any form and read the transcript later. Trump is an insatiable ratings whore and it would just kill him if people didn't tune in to watch his inauguration. 
Every time he says Trump... 
I'm literally too poor to afford that much alcohol. 
This might be one of the most dangerous suggestions.
Snort two ounces if you don't believe him.
I want comic relief not suicide-by-whiskey.
I believe it's spelt "Gyhna", just fyi.
Soooo, I'm not a native English speaker and I've never managed to get what is wrong with the way he says China. Care to help me?
A lot of friends...So many friends

If Kanye also announces Trump as his running mate, run to your nearest liquor store and drink everything.
HOLD MY LIQUOR
Yeezus will save us.
And "let me tell you".
This is the most dangerous suggestion.
Drink every time he says "tremendous".
I think we need to approach these kinds of things in a measured way - like, one drink every three or so times he says it.
But if it made sense from the beginning then don't stop drinking
You could be drinking watered down hard lemonades and this game would still kill you. 
I'd say drink everytime he says "yuuuge", but people may die.
He once claimed "I'm the best at military!" With no experience in the military whatsoever.
Two minutes in, and I'm out of vodka.   
I'm preemptively cringing at the thought of him doing this. 
I... I don't know what to think.
Whenever Trump says something you agree with, drink.It's only as dangerous as the rules make it.
And instead of Simba, Joe Biden comes back in several years and fights Trump atop the burning White House. 
To even suggest Trump could be a fraction as eloquent as Scar is an insult to Disney, Jeremy Irons, and lions. 
So no drinking then?
If you watched the RNC acceptance speech that's actually what he did. No idea if he actually wrote it or not, but if you want a preview go look it up, it was not the same as one of his rally speeches at all.Also a pitcher of beer isn't very much, it's like 3 and a half beers. I thought we were trying to get drunk here?

Don't worry, you won't have to be concerned with money after drinking that much.

SLIGHTLY SCRATCH YOUR MIDDLE CLASS
"People are saying..."
Yea. Even if you'd do a non-alcoholic version. You'd wind up with water poisoning.
by the end of the speech, you'll be so drunk you might actually believe him!
Do you get combo points? I see the "unspecified contradiction" bonus from a mile off
Never stop. 
Lawyer here. I'd say it's assumption of risk if you choose to play the game. An argument that you didn't know what you were getting into wouldn't hold any water because everyone knows Trump is a self-aggrandizing jackass.
I think we've found the issue: His lexicon contains so few words that no matter what word(s) we decide to drink to, he'll almost certainly use them so frequently that there's a real likelihood we end up with alcohol poisoning. 
LOL. How'd I forget that one! Yuuuge mistake... my bad.

Especially since it's so disturbingly plausible.

**It's Yuge**: Drink whenever Donald talks about any of his body parts (hands, penis, brain, etc.)
**Affirmative Action** : Every time that Trump says "Fake News" everyone exclaims "It's True!", last person takes a sip
**A reply from Daddy Don:** "That's a tremendous question, very very tremendous. There's a lot of questions like that, and you know, I get a lot of the, but only the best, only the best of the best and the best ones are always the ones I remember, I remember this one friend, Paul, and Paul was a great guy, great great guy, really an amazing guy. He told me Donald, he told me Donald, you're by far the best candidate to be president, no doubt, you're the best candidate of all of them. And you know, it's something I realized then, you know, he was right. Tremendous guy."
Fake News: Every time Trump criticizes major news outlet (e.g. CNN, NBC) as fake news because they wrote something he didn't like, take a shot.Orange Russian: If Trump mentions Russia take a shot. If he mentions Putin, take two shots. If Putin suddenly walks onstage, finish the bottle.
> Everyone else speaks in Spanish for 5 secondsdead
Everybody says it, all the time, everyone always says to me: "bLbGoldeN, you have the best of the best words, they're amazing, tremendous amazing!" and I know they're right, because everyone always tells me all the time and you know what? I've heard someone say that I had regular words folks, regular words and really, and really it's sad, sad!
You know there's a lot of research and complicated, very complicated stuff that goes on in the cyber, because it's made by very smart people. Some people once told me that China was the one that made it, but I look at them in the eyes and always tell them: "We're American, you can't fool us." Folks, we're at war, we are, we are, we're at war everywhere and there's people dying instead of being safe here with us, and having a tremendous time. Let me tell all of you something, I'm going to change all of it, I'll change things so much you wouldn't even believe, because I win, I win all the time.

If two of those are together, the penalty is added then squared. All three, and you drink the whole thing.

I started drinking heavily several years ago because of Trump.
Well if everyone who opposes Trump starts drinking heavily throughout his presidency, the only ones alive to vote in 2020 will be his supporters.
There's actually a documentary out there that floats the possibility that half the reason Trump ran in the first place was he was furious at getting embarrassed by Obama during the birther thing at the Correspondant's Dinner and this was his version of revenge. Might explain why he seems to be promising to replace Obamacare with Obamacare++
It's like Head-in-a-Jar Nixon, only much more terrifying.
It's okay, we can use it for 2024. Next election of course **has** to be "2020: Hindsight".

Funny enough, right now the odds on him saying "Fake News" are 10-1 against it. I put $20 on yes just for fun. I'm optimistic.

I think in mid-2018, trump is going to find out what happens when Obama gets bored. I don't think he's going to like it.

Pay another snail to seduce it and pretend to fall in love with it for exactly 6 months. During that time, they should have awesome sex every night. Once 6 months have passed, and my paid snail has left, the snail will be heartbroken, and wouldn't want to get out of his room ever. It might even become a drunkard, and waste away its immortality.
Put it in a concrete tomb.
A better question is: What would a snail do with a million dollars?  
I'd surround myself with whatever you're smoking, that would confuse the fucking snail to no end
At first I thought: "Why would anyone give a million dollars to a snail?" But then I realized "Why would anyone give a million dollars to me?"
Can't I just put it in a box?
Put the snail in a mason jar. Bury it in Antarctica. By the time he escapes imprisonment and being frozen solid, I'll be hundreds of years old and bored of life.
1. Spread the rumor that snails are poisonous,2. Give a dollar to every kid that traps a snail in a bottle,3. sell all the snails to a company that makes cosmetic products,4. Profit.5. Fuck OP's mom one last time.
Bit hard to do anything to the snail if it's always a decoy snail.
Buy one of those bubbles that you can walk in and live like that. Then he couldn't touch me :)
I have opposable fingers and a glass jar. Checkmate
Uhm, follow up questions might be in order... Like, how does the snail spend the money? Does it hire a butler or something that carries its debit card?It's highly intelligent but lacks vocal chords, can it communicate at all?How about airplane travel? Does it only travel by crawling?
I'll purchase a salt mine and live my immortal life in there, selling the salt is my new career.
Wasn't this on an rt podcast?
Pay someone to launch the snail into space using a small rocket with just enough power to launch it out of Earth's orbit. Its super intelligence means nothing if it physically is unable to do anything and is just floating through space.
put it in my ass
OP, this is exactly the kind of silly hypothetical shit I live for.  I'd build several houses on different continents surrounded by trenches filled with salt and rotate to each house every 5 years.
I spend five of those dollars on a hamster wheel. Pay someone three dollars to put the snail on it. When I finally want to die, I embrace my deathsnail as an old friend and go into the last unknown. But first I ask him what on earth he did with his million dollars. 
. . . wait but why does this snail *want* to touch me? Also 1 million doesn't really go that far these days . . .
The snail is super intelligent and rich, and immortal and will only die if I touch it. Yeah the villain in me is coming out. Seal him in a biodome, take his money and invest it. Then once we figure out snail/human communication I ask why he wants to kill us both by touching me. After talking it out if he agrees to not try to touch, I'll give him his money plus interest and set him free. If he still wants to touch and die I will seal him in acrylic and wear him as a necklace. That way when I want to stop being immortal and die, I can just drill in.
The snail has no real incentive to kill me so I'd probably just ask it not to.
Snails weigh 25 - 45 grams? Buy a tiny amount of freight on the next Space X project and launch that fucker toward Betelgeuse.
I go to walmart and buy a 5$ thing of morton salt and go dump it on that bitch
Rooster Teeth fan? 
Simple, I track down the wife of the snail and I implant an explosive on her spine. If the snail dares to touch me then I will blow his wife to kingdom come. 
Surround myself with salt. Lots and lots of salt. Like an absurd amount of salt. Like think of a quantity of salt that's too much, and multiply that by like, a lot. I'd probably buy from the manufacturer to get a bulk discount because of the sheer amount of salt I'd get. I mean, I would be investing most of my money into salt. Salt. 
Is there a rule against crushing the snail?Even if it immortal, I can still step on it right? Let's say I wait for him, for months if needed, at the end of a dead end hall. I see him, he sees me. I'm ready to pounce; he knows this. I start running. He starts running. I catch him and step on him, leaving his mashed and useless body there to whither away while he stays alive for the rest of eternity being unable to move. The snail is trying to kill me? Fuck him, he's a vegetable now.
Move to a different continent than the snail.  
With some reworking this could make for a lousy but successful horror flick about STDs
Can i have sex with the snail?
Easy.  Build a platform in the sky, where the snail cannot crawl up to touch you
Put a cup on it and enjoy my life
Decoy snail.
Imagine the irony of experiencing the entire heat death of the universe. No light or energy. Just bouncing around the void for countless eons hoping for death and wishing you kept tabs on that damn snail.
The flaw in this plan comes right at the beginning, when the friend you tell immediately throws the snail at you to "prove" you're delusional. Dead.
Eternity is plenty of time for the snail to not only get over the heartbreak, but also figure out that you are responsible. It would likely cause the snail to redouble it's efforts to get you.

It would actually be more interesting to give a million dollars to a snail.
Or you could put that box inside of another box, then mail that box to yourself and when it arrives you can smash it with a hammer.

Decoy snail.
30 years later you're making out with a girl.  Your hand brushes her cheek.  Suddenly, you feel your immortality draining away.  You look with horror at your hand, stained with makeup.  You taste her lipstick on your lips.  You realize that finally, after all these years, the snail has had its revenge.
Easy, make it hard for the snail by always being a decoy self.
If this snail keeps sending decoy snails to try and fuck up my plans then the stupid little shit will never catch me.He might be super intelligent, but only by snail standards.
That's the best solution I've read so far. Unfortunately, the snail hires a little boy to stab your ball :(Back to square one I guess
Except you just got baited by a decoy snail
I was thinking in the same way as this, with one million dollars, if it can only crawl, I would move accros the ocean, and first calculate it's crawl speed on avarage, and then at about 80% of that travel time I would move once more.
The snail is immortal. wtf does the salt do to an immortal snail.
Yes! I'm actually surprised that a mention of RT is so far down in the comments. I remember some other "Million Dollars But" and "Gavin or Google" scenarios posted here that got quite a bit of recognition. 
it wasn't just on there, they established this exact concept and premise verbatim, this is just copy/pasted from there.
Congratulations, you just stuck a decoy snail up your ass.
When your dead and they're doing your autopsy, there is some remaining waste that squeaks out of your ass. The guy hears the squirt, the a little "clink" noise and sees the snail. "Hmm I wonder how that got in there". He goes to pick it up, and the shitty acid burns through his glove, killing him too. The snail makes a dramatic sigh and takes in a gulp of fresh air. He climbs down the table and makes a dramatic slower than usual exit through the door. 
For one million dollars that might be a stretch
I don't think 1 million dollars is enough for that kind of travel/housing unless you want to live in trailers.
Not sure a super intelligent snail will willingly run on a hamster wheel for eternity

The snail sneaks into a plane to your destination 
You got me curious as to what movie you're referring to.
Decoy genitals.
But the thing is that he never took his eyes off the snail from the time the deal started. Also, i can only assume that since you got the money when the deal started the snail only got it's smarts when the deal started.  Therefore there is no conceivable way for there to be a decoy snail.
20 days later after you posted this, people still talk about a decoy snail. Did you start this trend?
How to check for decoy snails? Hit it with a hammer. If it dies it's a decoy snail. If not then there you go. 
I was thinking the same thing! After probably just a few million years, I'd wish I could die. Not just like when you get depressed when everyone you know dies, but pushing through all depression, I'd say only a few million years before I become Bowerick Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
"Someone I can trust with my life." I'd sure as hell hope my closest friend could trust me and not try to kill me for a million bucks right on the spot. I'd promise him way more money from the investments later on down the road.

Yo isn't it crazy how you could put a million dollars cash in front of a snail and it wouldn't give a fuck it will just crawl away

It was a decoy box
What if I box every snail I encounter? Will they all be decoys?
R/flatearth 
I could try to crush it with something first. If it lives, it's the immortal snail.
> you're making out with a girlThis plan is foolproof!
Use amazons mechanical turk service to create massive amounts of videos of people capturing snails then with some clever marketing you can have a fad of snail catching every 6 months to decimate and eventually exterminate the snail population. Then when only the immortal snail remains I buy a glass jar and trap the non decoy snail
He's super-intelligent, though. Can't fool that snail.
What if you hire a larger boy to stab the little boy?
You said "super intelligent". You never said the snail could talk. How would he hire anyone?
I have friends with opposable fingers and a glass jar. Checkmate
This is like the asshole at the playground who has a invisible invincible force field around them. 
...are you just looking for someone to say "figure out how long it takes to crawl a certain distance and just hop on a plane whenever that time is running out"?because if so, then that's my answer.E: I didn't make the question, guys. 
It could probably get on a plane in a few hours
The ocean is salty. Salt is painful for snails 
Wow that is literally the exact same premise.
Google or Gavin is one of my favourite games.
Also, after a couple years, the snail will probably get bored of trying to kill you. He's a super intelligent snail. He's got super intelligent snail stuff to do. 
That's a complicated situation to explain to the doctor.
I want to die
A hamsterball then. Intelligence isn't going to do much for a snail stuck in a hamsterball.
> snail> run
Could just be a mean fuck and surround the wheel in salt. 
Keep your friends close and your anemones closer. 
Correct. Rather unrelated to immortal snails, but the series doesn't get enough credit for how well it handles the concept of death. While it's absolutely still treated as a tragedy, it's never treated as a "loss," as in "this person has died, which means they 'lose' at whatever we're doing." It's an inevitability. And the tale of the Deathly Hollows concretes that idea perfectly by treating Death not as some Devil, but even as a potential old friend. "You will die, and that's okay."
is his GF a snail also? How did that work? did you break her? Is this how you developed your weakness to snails? did you steal your million dollars from Super smart snail's Girlfriend? Can snails have mustaches? These are things we need to know OP. 
Idk I think I could tell the difference between a real super intelligent snail and an ordinary snail pretending to be super intelligent
I feel like there's literally nothing that would be more efficient than "wandering away from the snail". 
Oh well then, lucky it was a decoy rocket.
ok then.  if it dies, it's a decoy.  If it doesn't, it's immortal.
mineral water company
Wait, I thought the snail thought I slept with his girlfriend? How recent was this divorce? Was the snail cheating on his snail wife with his snail girlfriend?
Hey, now. 
Plane probably takes off again after landing before he could get off
It is never stated that the snail would be presented, visually or otherwise. Therefore there is no way to keep your eyes on it. If you happen to be shown a snail by the person making the deal with you, you have know way of knowing if it is the intelligent snail or not.
I'd lose it in less than 200 easily. 25 is pushing it already.

I am the snail. I notice that periodically you move vast distances, presumably to keep your distance from me. I now make it my goal to position myself in anticipation of your next move, rather than mindlessly crawling in your direction like a not very intelligent snail.
I'm cracking the fuck up imagining a snail going through customs at an airport 
What is the motivation of the snail to touch you, seems like the intelligent thing to do would be to invest it's million dollars and live a simple retired life
Yes, but it's immortal and will forever crawl towards me, I will make it's life miserable :)
Well its copy/pasted of course
Burnie you got the name wrong.
Sounds pretty sweet. I wish it wasn't a death-touch snail, it would be cool to be a sidekick for super intelligent snail stuff.
"I fell on it"
Snail will bribe a person with $20,000 to get him out of the ball.I know I would free a magical snail from a hamster ball for less.
What if you just get a sense of it deconstructing you psychologically in the ball. You know that's what its doing right? It can see right through you
If a Magikarp can run from me, so can a snail.
And if you treat him well it's not like he has a reason to kill you. He knows your location and he knows that he can kill you if you touch him but he has no motive to actually go through with it if you treat him well. Also who wouldn't want an eternal companion if they're immortal since the death touch thing only works one-way.
Snail's immortal.
Snailed it. Actually that pun had very little to do with snails. So bad. 
Does anyone think if it as a "loss" in that way?I've only ever heard of people saying "loss" to family and friends that no longer have the deceased in their life.
It's pretty simple actually. You just put your micro penis in the shell
"Moving just like, a little" might have it tied for laziness though.
It was a decoy of a decoy snail, so it was the real snail, meaning you launched the real snail on a fake rocket so you just wasted money on a fake rocket that did nothing to the snail.
You're an all star.
I just spat my coffee on my desk, this is fucking hilarious
have friend smash the snail with a hammer to prove its the immortal snail. if it lives, proceed with the plan, if it dies, shit self.
/r/2meirl4meirl Seriously though, hang in there...you still have a long ways to go

Oh my god.
As long as she's at least old enough to get a senior discount, I see no issue.After 65, age is just a number, right?
Asking the important questions.
I have 25 square feet of room to dodge the snail for the next 10 years, who needs sleep anyways 
Oh then I'd just order a new ball every year.
can't believe I'm getting roasted on a post about a hypothetical murder snail 
You're moving the goal posts. The premise is that it crawls towards me, not towards where it thinks I will be. 
>And I'd be living in a place where snails can't survive - namely, the desert city of Las Vegas.  A man mysteriously arriving in Las Vegas with $1 MM, fleeing from a sentient mollusk, and constantly paranoid about every speck on the wall? Yeah, I'd watch that. 
> where snails can't survive - namely, the desert city of Las VegasScrew that, build a nice house out on the salt flats. 
The snail is a super intelligent being and as you know by reading this thread, with a own mineral water company. It probably made the 1 million it received already into 234 billion dollars. And it uses that money to create clones of itself to decoy you, hardcore advanced technology to track you and travel to you and probably also has its own human slave cyborgs that do its bidding.
> By my calculations, even if the snail was at the terminal, it still couldn't move fast enough to board a flight before it took off.Wrong. It'll move just as fast as you thanks to TSA.
"I was makin' vegetable soup and I dropped the carrot, and I tripped and landed on the carrot, and now there's a carrot in my butthole"
But how could the snail communicate with people in order to do that? OP's snail doesn't speak, and snail drool is transparent when it dries.
You could spraypaint the hamsterball black
What if the super intelligent death snail is tormented by its own immortality and decides the only way to end it is to end *you*?
Doesn't mean it doesn't hurt like hell
"Now it's time to escargot to heaven."
Decoy, not fake. The decoy rocket is headed to Arcturus. Bon voyage. 
Get your game on.
the snail would find a way to make it look like it died
I'm still not sure if it's all genuine or some meta-meme where it's hilarious to be not at all raunchy
I try. Each day I get a little closer.
Take my pen knife, my good man!
That salt? 
I have a pet snapping turtle.  I already pick up any snail I see with tongs (because they are slimy and gross) and feed them to my turtle.In this scenario, the snail which my turtle cannot destroy in the one that gets boxed up forever.
I think you can fit more than one snail in a box.
It's a very intelligent question. Watch out for this guy.
Ummm just put a glass cup over the snail. Too heavy to lift for the snail, and now you're safe. Why is everyone complicating things?
and hire someone to steal the snails money
It's not like he's embarrassing you in front of your friends.
Technically, every direction on Earth is towards you since it's a sphere that you can travel all the way around. The prompt doesn't say "towards you in the shortest path" so away from you is also towards you. Checkmate.
>you both become immortal
That snail is immortal though
Holy shit this snail doesn't fuck around 
But does it actually *want* to kill you, or is it just in its nature that when it's crawling around it tends to crawl toward you.Also, super-intelligent or not, if it must continue heading toward you, and directly toward you, that will make it difficult for it to stop to invest its money, to communicate with people, to find or head toward an airport, etc. In fact, that million dollars is just going to get left behind as the snail heads toward you.
Superintelligent snail goes to a beach and writes a message in the sand by rolling around. Good counterpoint though.  
You can't spraypaint your knowledge its harsh thoughts away though ;_;
Someone call the cops!
It's a smart/immortal snail. Not a damn reality-warper. We're talking Deadpool immortality here, not Mephisto.
Because I'M ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE SNAIL, SHIT THIS IS A MISTAKE!
Fission mailed!
He might be a snail.
Oh dear Lord forgive this young man for committing a murder.
He would live there to eliminate the chance of decoy snails. Only the immortal snail could survive coming after him. Then he could set a trap for him.
Just because it survives doesn't mean the journey needs to be pleasant.
Not invulnerable though. It would hurt the snail so much that it would probably think it isn't worth it.
He's tough asnails. 
Seriously, this part wasn't made clear at all.  Can the snail be reasoned with?  Maybe I can convince it that it's in the snail's own best interest to let me live.  Maybe he didn't read the rules too clearly either and only just ASSUMED he had to try and kill me.Everybody's all focused on running away from the snail or trying to trap or kill it first, but... Did anyone ever stop and just ask the snail why he's doing it?
Yes, you can.  It's called huffing.
I just witnessed a murder!
EVERYTHING YOU SAY TO MEEEEEEE
SHUT UP! 
We're on to you, snail 
>What are your deepest fears?>"The French for sure"lmao
The worst part is I can't even relate the story of this burn later without sounding like a loser. 
And then it all turns out to have taken place a) in a dream b) during a bad trip. I'd watch the shit outa this movie.... Actually, can you imagine the trailer for this? How boring would that trailer be? I'm just imagining a bunch of ominous cuts between a guy running and a snail crawling with a gleam in it's eye.
This would be a great way to fish out the decoy snails though. The one that survives the trek across the flats is obviously the one that can kill you.
Buddhists burn alive while sitting still and meditating. This snail is super intelligent, it can meditate across a salt flat
Well now the snail has a stillsuit
Seriously, the little guy doesn't gain anything from my death. It's not like I put him in my will or anything, why does he want me dead?

The snail would seek your death quite naturally.  You are both immortal.  You and artificial intelligence are the two concepts on this planet that represent a real existential threat to it.  Eventually even if people imprisoned it, their culture or even species, if someone doesn't try to free the snail for their own benifit prior, may go away.
My dad's stripper girlfriend is here and she's been farting nonstop since about a quarter after seven. 
Wife's at work till midnight and stepdaughter is taking a nap until then....the rest of my family is 1,000 miles away.
Christmas is for people to celebrate having a family, and disposable income.I have neither, so here I am.
There is only so many times I can listen to Mariah Carey 
Because I'm at work. How do you like all that electricity you're getting?Also, half of my family is in Mexico and half of them are in the Caribbean. 
My granddaughter is sitting on the arm of my chair watching a Christmas movie, as I type this.  
I'm taking a shit.
I lost at monopoly. Don't feel like family right now.
I'm doing both.
Oh fuck lol. This post got me. There'd a bunch of little kids running around downstairs, and I'm waiting for my cousin to get here so we can open presents and stuff. What about *YOU*, OP?
Alone Christmas is amazing. Zero stress. Tons of food. When it would cost $1200 to fly my small family one hour (in airplane time) away, I say fuck that and FaceTime instead. 
Because I'm cuddling in bed with my 2 yr old son.  Two weeks ago his dad told me he wanted a divorce because he's had a 2 yr affair.  I am so depressed this Christmas that I can't do anything but sit and stare.   
Because I'm at my in-laws house and yet again, after being in the family 10 years, nobody got me anything.  My wife and I got them all something and they only buy her stuff...I hate them.  This is garbage.Worse, I'm the bread winner in the house and bought all of this stuff.   I just don't have the energy to smile and be nice anymore.    Football and Reddit in the other room... 
Its 8am christmas morning, just woke up with a hangover. Whiskey w/ beer as chaser 5/7
This is the weirdest Xmas of my life. Parents both passed so it's just me and the sibs. Oldest bro was thrown in jail this morning until we managed to bail him out a few hours ago. Hit the bar to soothe our woes, then last minute grocery shopping at Walgreen's (and drunken flirting with the pseudo punk cashier girl).Now my brothers are blasting music and dancing like morons and I'm taking a break with a cig and some redditation.Happy Holidays, love all you idiots
Haven't talked to my parent's in over 3 years after I came out and was kicked out. Currently working overtime getting paid a fuck ton of money. 
I don't have a family...
Because I have nothing to do and pretty much nothing to talk about. If anybody talks to me I put down my phone.
I'm Jewish. It is Hannukah but it's not a super important holiday and we have seven more days of it, so I don't feel guilty about not being with them right now. 
My mom told me she didn't think I could handle being around family, so she left me at her house and went to theirs. I have a mood disorder and sometimes have issues keeping it together. This is absolutely the last year I am celebrating Christmas. 
No one loves me. This is fine.*edit* my family does love me, I just prefer to stay to myself, hang out with my cat, and browse reddit.
Big thing tomorrow. Wife is baking cookies and I am baking a doobie.All is well at the Compound.
I'm Jewish and my family is in another country
My family went to Paris for vacation and forgot to bring me. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to finish rigging the house with booby traps before some burglars show up.
damn. that hit hard.
I'm sitting on a drilling rig
My step-dad. He is the most religious, conservative, anti literally everything I believe in person I could even imagine. The rest of the family hates him too but they can tolerate him a lot better than I can. Oh yeah, he also sexually molested me and my sisters when we were younger, but the case ended up getting dropped.
> strokeHang in there. They're just never quite the same after a stroke. They can heal over time but it's just never the same and they get really frustrated/aggravated because they know something has drastically changed that they can't fix. And some of their less desirable qualities can really manifest themselves. 15 years ago we had to spend Christmas Eve/Day in an ICU waiting room. This time of year has forever changed for me. I've learned to make new traditions and have found new family. It takes time but you can get through it.Source: 16+ year caregiver of a stroke survivor
Wtf? Lol
I'm in the same boat. I did hang an Xmas wreath on my front door.This has been an absolute sucky year, made a gazillion times worse because my 12 yr-old dog died in August. He was the family I celebrated with.
Hey congrats on graduating! And happy holidays and birthday. I hope you have great friends to celebrate with, and enjoy every day. 
Well congrats on graduating college. Merry Christmas! Have a Happy New Year! I hope you have an awesome Birthday! 
I just want you to know that I read all that and greatly empathize with you. Your son and wife are blessed to have you 
I work in hospitality. You'd be surprised how many women in our restaurants freak the fuck out when Mariah Carey's "all I want for Christmas is you" comes on. It's alarming the screams from the grown women everywhere. 
...this is not what I expected but I'm inexplicably jealous.
Dude... I need to know more
I'm picturing the one from *Quantum of Solace*
That sounds pretty damn nice
Sisters getting a raw dog, we all thought it
Also working! Apparently people still expect an ambulance to come on holidays..
11pm to 9am here.  I'm the only one without kids who is trained on this shift.  It wouldn't be my first pick of places to be, but I took it because it's more important for them to be home tonight and in the morning than it is for me.
Is she a pug, too?
That's no excuse to not be spending time with your family.
Holy fuck. I just went bankrupt a few minutes ago. I feel you dude. 
And us <3
Better just you than fielding someone else's bullshit and being utterly unable to relax.
If you're both on the lease she still owes you for half the rent. You can sue her for what you've paid so far and any other costs associated I wth the eviction.  Small claims court. Check out r/legaladvice.  
I'm on the toilet, OP. Get off my ass, man. 
Same. Kids screaming and all. 
My Husband is browsing Imgur, my daughter is playing League, and my son is playing Helldivers, while I browse Reddit and tinker with WoW. :)
I'm really sorry to hear about this. :( Sounds like your mother has her own issues to sort out. Hope you're doing okay.
I'm sorry, friend.If it makes you feel any better, I also have a Chinese immigrant mother and am in a PhD program, and it doesn't make the nagging go away. All those "what if I stayed in China" rants are still there. You're not alone, and you didn't do anything wrong.
> my mother blew up at me for not being in a PhD program, which she upholds as the only way to become "a full person." And in what field did she earn her doctorate?
Poor kid is only going to get presents once a year. /s Congrats! 
Parents just divorced, at my grandparents house watching elf for the 70th time with my sister, love the holidays!
Look at Mr. Fancypants here flying one hour instead of driving.
It's my first christmas since my dad died. He was estranged from all of the family except me, so I'm sort of alone in this. The cancer care centre where he died gave me a hand-made quilt donated by volunteers, and I brought that with me to my family's, just so I'd have something of him with me. 
Damn dude, sorry for your loss.So watchya playin?
Hey friend, me too.  Mom passed in September and I've been thinking about her a great deal.  Feels weird going through the motions when you know you have to.
Sorry for your loss.
I'm still struggling with my soon to be ex wife's affair, the holidays are tough. It's been 4 years since I found out and everything fell apart and I'm still a wreck. If you need someone to talk to I'm here to listen, trust me you need to let it out or the holidays will fucking kill you.
My house burnt down earlier this year, so Christmas is total bullshit this year. Everyone's annoyed and frustrated and cranky..
You know what? Get your revenge by holding your head up high and enjoying yourself. It will take time but you will get past this.Source: Someone who's had their fair share of life ass kickings
Happy first night of Hanukkah
Why aren't you eating chinese food with your family?
Well then I Jewish you a Happy Hannukah. 
So? You should be watching a movie while nursing your Chinese food baby with your family.
Just a jew, a lonely jew, I'd be merry, but I'm HebrewOn Christmas...
we're Muslim, I feel you dude
There's a fuck up in every family.
It's only 7:52 PM Christmas Eve here. Trying to get your presents early you time traveling piece of shit?
1200 Xmas Day in Australia!
It's even worse when there are people you'd rather be with, but you're forced to be with your family.
r/eyebleach?
Just start singing "All Star" by Smash Mouth as loud as you can until they stop arguing and join in. 
Your day sounds like a great independent movie I'd put on a list to see once it hits the shitty cinema in my town which it never will so I'll forget about it until I see it on Netflix four years later after scrolling through my suggestions for half an hour.
We are your family :D
Exactly, people are always like, "YOU KIDS ARE ALWAYS ON YOUR DAMN PHONE YOU SHOULD TALK ONCE IN A WHILE""Ok what do you wanna talk about?""...""Exactly.bitch"
Psych nurse here. If your blood pressure is stable, ask your doctor about Prazosin (minipress). We use it specifically for nightmares related to PTSD.
If ya need a friend those 2 hours hit me up we can talk or play online games 
Hannukah isn't a big holiday?  Then what is?
Gotta get them 5 free loot boxes
I'm sure your cat loves you.
God damn, I wish I had a compound. Or at the least a barbed wire fence around my house.
Perhaps you could make something out of clay to play with?

Mom had a stroke on January 9th of this year. I'm the caretaker, brother too busy with work. Sucks but it is what it is. I'll get my life on track when I can.Hope your holidays are great and have a good new year!
Appropriate response lol 
Why are you 5000 miles away?
I can't help but think that the nearest animal shelter might have a lonely dog that's anxiously waiting to celebrate Christmas with someone who will love him back.  
Thanks, it means a lot (:
I'm a grown-ass man and you'd be surprised at how I freak the fuck out when it comes on. There's a diva in all of us.
I can explain my jealousy in crippling detail. 
So do astronomers, that is why they went there. 
It is :)  Had a hectic day. Last minute shopping, travelling for hours to get here (on public transport with an overexcited kid) and helping my folks prepare for tomorrow.  Now it's time to relax with shitposts and wine!  
Probably. She's out with her fiance.  
AND firetrucks.  *eyeroll*friggin' Divas.  Put out your own fires and drive yourselves to the hospital.  You'll never learn to take care of yourself if we're always doing it for you!
Someone coded on my floor tonight at work. Don't they know it's Christmas Eve?!Edit 1: Coding is a medical colloquialism for cardiopulmonary arrest.

You ungrateful little shit why I oughta send three ghosts over to your house to frighten you into realising the true joys of electricity millennial good for nothing you don't even know how electricity works dumb fucking shirt fuck youMerry christmas
3pm to 1am here. Single with no kids. I offered to work Christmas and Christmas Eve. Time and a half plus a two full day's worth of vacation. Gonna be a nice paycheck.  
This is my human granddaughter.  I also have a pug and chihuahua on my lap. 
The family that squats together, plops together.
We need a subreddit for people who lost Christmas games to recover.
As weird as it may sound here is where I can talk without being judged for who I am(instead of what my opinion is). No one in the family gives a shit about me till I am earning well and doing what I am supposed to. I could start doing drugs and I am sure no one would notice. All my friends live a thousand km away. So yeah.. this site/you guys <3.
Me too. I don't call it reddit, I call it brownit.
4 kids screaming, dogs going crazy, wife and mother gossiping with each other, blah blah blah. At least im in the same room
Ah, this is the nuclear family I can appreciate.
Thanks for your kind message. Despite reddit's imperfections, it blows my mind that ranting into the digital ether can bring out genuine support like yours, even at a time like Christmas Eve.
Thanks dude. I guess I've only delayed the inevitable; soon, she'll start demanding to know specifics of my "program." But it's reassuring to know this happens to other people out there.Out of curiosity, what are you studying?
Education, it turns out.
Mrs. Fancypants, and the drive is 9 hours over mountains with a two year old, so...nah. 
Oh gosh this hit me harder than some of the other emotional replies. 
Thanks man. Been playing Fifa and Final Fantasy XV! FF is so good! 
Hey buddy. I lost my mom in October 2012 and the first Christmas was absolutely awful. Four years later and it's a mostly happy affair for my family with a few sighs and sometimes the occasional tear.  The pain never goes away but it's less "front and center" as time goes on. I hope you'll come to appreciate it for the time you have with the family that's still here at some point like my family and I have.
I feel so hard for you people. I've never been married but my ex broke up with me after dating for 3 years on Thanksgiving 2 years ago and i found out she slept with a roommate of mine the day after christmas. Holiday's kicked my ass and I was only 19. I can't even fathom it being someone you trusted so mich to marry them and have kids with.
I had this happen 15 years ago.  My mom somehow managed to out together one of my all time favorite Christmases  it was a real rough year but I'll always have fond memories of that Christmas. 
on the first night of Hanukkah my true love gave to me
Because us jewy-jew-jews (everyone say that out loud) do that tomorrow night.
Do you have a "merry Christmas" saying for an Islamic festival? Something like "joyous Eid" or "happy Ramadan" would probably roll off the tongue.
And now, 3 hours later, it's still 12pm Christmas Day in Australia.Everyone forgets the west coast #bestcoast
Or the person you'd rather be with told you to fuck off and ran directly into her exes arms. 
This is a great suggestion OP. I did 5 years in the Army Infantry and got injured in Mosul Iraq. Every night afterwards was a nightmare(literally). VA prescribed me mini press and life has been much more tolerable. Even if your PTSD isn't service related don't hesitate to PM brother. We're all in this together. 
Now that is the holiday spirit! If you guys want a 3rd, let me know. 
Thanks! I will keep this in mind.
Damnit! Should have thought of that when the stores were still open. 
I could go on forever, baby.
Please make sure that you take care of yourself. You can really get worn down over time. The stress will really do a number on you physically and emotionally. My brother and her family could care less and it's taken a toll. I've let my life get off track for too long. Please don't make my mistake.I wish YOU awesome holidays and a fabulous New Year. Please PM me if you ever feel the the need. I never understood what far reaching impact strokes could have until my mom had both of hers.
If he doesn't have disposable income even after losing his dog, maybe taking on the long-term responsibility of another animal isn't the best choice. You really should be able to afford to care for an animal before you adopt one. I can't tell you how many people I've seen barely scraping by whose pets need to see a vet, but they put it off because they can't afford it.
if you don't have friends like me you can always shoot me a PM buddy
#&nbsp;#&nbsp;^^that's ^^deep.
That sounds exhausting.Have a Merry Christmas tomorrow! =)
Ugh, I guess I'll make sure the runway at this airport doesn't ice up so all you jerks can go see your families... Then again, I'm Jewish so I kinda volunteered to work.Edit - WOOWOO!!! ALL ABOARD THE GOLD TRAIN!!! SEE YOU SUCKERS IN THE LOUNGE!!! Seriously though, thank you muchly kind stranger! I hardly think doing what I do is gold worthy. Honestly, I'd do it for free. I get to be up close and personal with big trucks and planes.Edit 2 - Hanukkah started tonight?! I had no idea... /s
Number please! 
So... Was that the shitpost of Christmas Past, Present, or Future?
7pm to 7am here. Working at the front desk of a motel. Someone's gotta keep the rooms warm and doors open for hookers and junkies ;) 
"This is my human granddaughter." i can't stop laughing at this 
My mom refers to my cat as her granddaughter. She has settled for second best after she gave up on me ever having human children. And admittedly, I do spoil my cat. I bought her a quarter pound of King/Chinook Salmon for Christmas.
You see Ivan, when you of squat with fam, you share bonding time over hating of Capitalist pig.

I'm sorry dude. Here, take some love.
You're human man, there's no being worthy about it. Don't feel guilty for taking, when so much has been taken from you.
Sometimes it's reddit. Those are scary times
Are we in the same house?
We're not the typical household, but it works! :)
The way you write tells me that you are an intelligent well rounded and reasonable person. PhD or not, you'll be fine I am sure. 
Well, at least it sounds like you're living away from home. Distance definitely helps. Also, r/AsianParentStories is your friend.Applied math! Specifically, physics-based models that are used to study living systems.
The next time she starts in on you, tell her that you're just not smart enough to earn a PhD like her and your late father - and that's it's obviously because of the recessive defective genes they passed on to you.;>
Did you keep the maiden name of Fancypants when you wed, or did you marry into the Fancypants family?
Sorry :)
Nice! Ive been wanting to play FFXV but I can't justify getting another game with the 5 im already playing.
Similar situation after 5 years. I know plenty of people have it worse, but its been 10 months for me and feeling like shit is putting it pretty lightly. She was once my best friend and I don't think I will ever be the same again.
We have been really fortunate, we were donated a tree and ornaments. It's just been waves, I'm okay and trying to handle it, and then I just have a pity party. I go between pity/sadness and then guilt. I had so much, I'm fortunate, I'm lucky - why am I feeling bad for myself?? It's been a rough year.
One present
Lots of us did it tonight! In fact, I'm just heading home from a big ol Jewish Christmas Eve right now!
Eid Mubarak!
I have PTSD from something not service related, and I have constant nightmares. I haven't been able to reliably sleep in years. Is there really a medicine that I can get that would help out with that? I never mentioned it to my doc because I figured the nightmares were just something people dealt with...
I know you've been smooching with my brother
OK Johnny I'm sorry 
YOU BEEN SMOOCHIN WITH EVERYBODY! Al, Leo, Little Moe with the Gimpy leg!
It was. But we got there safe and sound and that's all that matters :)  Merry Christmas to you too! Have a great one <3
You're in Denver, I'm in the news station working because things like that still happen on holidays.
HAHAHA. YES. I AM HUMAN. COME, FELLOW HUMANS, LET US ENJOY COMPANY AND MERRY FESTIVITIES WHILE INJESTING GLUCOSE INTO OUR ONE-WAY DIGESTIVE TRACTS.
I am so sad that is not a thing.
I'm trying to force myself to think and feel that way. I'm just so terrified of people getting the wrong idea about me or something. I've never *ever* been good at accepting help from others, but lord knows, if I've ever been in a situation where I needed assistance, this is certainly that moment. 
Maybe, do you see a five year old wearing a Sonic costume and screaming that he's a "speed-type" Pokemon?
Sounds like a house I would like to live in.
Diabolical. She might respond by deciding to limit the spread of said defective genes by massacring me.
Oh, sorry, forgot the hyphen.Fan-Cypants. 
Stay unsinkable, friend. 
That's gaming in your 30s for you.  "This will look great on my shelf!"

As someone who's family insists on going to the movies during the holidays, I am so sorry and thank you so much
The movies are open? What a shitty tradition.
Just you wait 
Hey buddy: take the gift and pay it forward. One day when things are working better for you, you can do the same for someone else. That day will come!
When they get grounded they play games for my husband. They mentioned it to their friends and all of them were like, "I wish I could play video games for my punishment!"
Phone, or in public.Toxic parenting 101. They can't be an asshole in public. And if they are it's hilarious
Gonna give you to the count of ten... to get ya ugly, yella, no-good keester off my property...
as someone being dragged to the movies on xmas day, thank you for your sacrifice.

My tired eyes read that as on oxmas day, I imagined you having this awesome pagan holiday around a roast ox and bonfire with lots of mead.

That sounds like... 10x more exciting than Christmas. Someone needs to make this a thing.

In college I had a fair number of all nighters and usually had the tv going to help keep me up and help with concentration. Once a couple weeks after submitting an essay for a political science class I noticed that the message I sent with it to my professor went something like: "attached is my water for Italian cooking". My essay was completely fine and had nothing to do with Italy. I guess my brain just turned off as soon as I'd attached the paper and there must have been some cooking related infomercial on tv while I sent it. 
Was on the phone with my boss and she was getting really irritated about something, I don't even remember what. The combination of her irritation and my exhaustion made my brain misfire, and I ended the call with "okay bye bye Mom, I love you!". I was so embarrassed but she thought it was hilarious and started calling me her adopted daughter after that. I mean, she is the same age as my mom so it's not too weird, but I certainly felt like a child around her instead of a colleague until she left the company. I miss her ):
My husband and I had an inside joke. Whenever someone lost something, the other person always asked, "have you checked inside your butt?"  I was in a meeting at work (conservative and traditional corporate office) one day and a coworker said, "I can't find my pen." Without any thought or hesitation I quickly responded, "have you checked inside your butt?" As soon as I said it, I snapped back to reality and realized I was at work. As you can imagine, everyone went silent and stared at me as my face turned bright red. 
Not too weird because it does make sense, I recently moved to the apartment directly above the one I used to live in. My former roommate leaves the door unlocked. The frequency at which I just storm in and enter my empty old bedroom is staggering. 
I'm a security guard for Amazon and I have to do bathroom checks. Caught myself yelling "SECURITY!" right before going to the restroom at a bar on my day off. Thank God it was empty. 
When I was in school (6th grade I think) my mom would make my bagged lunch.  She would wrap soda cans with aluminum foil so they would stay cold (pretty sure that doesn't work).  One day I un-wrapped my soda and discovered she packed me a beer that day.
Cleaning up my face with electric clippers.  Thought, "Oh, missed a spot." and proceeded to shave off my fucking eyebrow.
Answered my cell phone"[911 center] what's the location of your emergency?"Makes my spouse laugh, my friends roll their eyes, and scares the fuck out of telemarketers. 12 hr night shifts are a bitch.
My wife and I were dying some Easter eggs and drinking wine this past Saturday night and I watched her take a big swig out of orange. There was an egg in the cup and everything.
Opening a Mozzarella cheese stick for my daughter, threw away the actual cheese stick and gave her the wrapper. 
I have two:1) Walking to work on a very straight path through a nature reserve. I fell asleep and sleepwalked for about 10 mins. It was so weird, i blinked and suddenly appeared near the end of my journey.2) Got into my car with coffee and a newspaper. Carefully held the rolled-up newspaper whilst hurling the coffee onto the passenger seat. 
I grabbed my "lunch" on my way out the door for work in the morning.I kept wondering what that beeping noise was the whole drive there. Couldn't figure it out.Got to work and grabbed my lunch, only to realize I had actually grabbed the baby monitor.
Instead of ground coffee, I put a couple scoops of sugar in my coffee filter and brewed it.
Once while playing an intense board game, I was concentrating so hard that my buddy realized that he could just hand random things to me and I'd take them and put them in my jacket pocket or place them on the table in front of me. I only realized when I ran out of space to put things. 
I cared for a horse for several years. First thing in the morning I would go put feed and water in the field, lead her out, and close the fence behind her.One morning as I'm walking back into my house, I hear a weird sound behind me. The sound of hooves on linoleum. She looked as surprised as I was that I had brought her into my kitchen. Luckily, she never told anyone so my secret is still safe.
Patted one of my coworkers on the butt. I was in the habit of walking up behind my husband and patting him on the butt, so it was just automatic. Fortunately, coworker wasn't offended.
I used to work in a call center and would answer my personal phone with my call center speech 
Woke up three hours early for some reason and didn't check the clock but thought I was running late. Rushed through getting ready for work and hit the road. Think it's a bit darker then usual but it could just be grey clouds before the rain. Roads are bit emptier then I'm expecting, must be lucky today. Finally pull up to work and start opening up the shop before anyone else gets in. Look over at the clock and realize I still have two hours to go before I even wake up. Almost went home but decided to stay and just take off three hours earlier then normal.
Texting my wife while cashing out at the grocery store. She had just done laundry so I wanted to thank her. Rather than typing, I spoke aloud to the cashier saying 'thanks, love you'
I used to work at the airport while in college, and one day I went to get groceries and drove 30 mins to the airport instead. 
I woke up one morning in college, got dressed, left my room and got halfway out of the dorm before I realized I had no pants on.
Spent ages cooking dinner only to pick the plate up and empty it straight into the bin. I was so tired and hungry, I cried
Raising my hand to voice my opinion while in a conversation not a school
I feed my cat while I make breakfast. One very sleep deprived morning I made cereal in her bowl and put her kibble in my cereal bowl. I didn't realize I fucked up until I shoved a giant spoonful of cat food in my mouth and chewed a few times. 
grabbing my keys, phone, wallet, etc. before work.why is there a tv remote in my car?the etc. included the tv remote
I tried to put a pacifier in my mother's mouth as opposed to infant she was holding. The best part is that she was nagging the hell out of me. 
When I was 18, hanging out with my then girlfriend at her place. Fell asleep for a bit, and when I woke up she said, "you're cute when you sleep." My immediate sleep-brain reply was, "not when seven people end up dead."
I drove a city bus in college.  My route and my commute home had a road that overlapped.  Driving home from work one night I ended up doing my bus route instead of my commute home and didn't realize it until I ended up in the bus terminal at the end of the line.  I guess it was better than driving into my apartment complex with the city bus.
Lose my phone in my hand while in the middle of a call.
put my phone in the fridge to "charge"
I asked a customer to let me know if we were out of something and I would grab it for them and instead of saying "come yell at me" I said "come at me". Also at different job told a customer "goodnight yourself"
probably the time i cracked 3 eggs into the sink. one after another.
Left my house extremely sleepy and drove to my old high school instead of the university. I'm in grad school and have been out of high school for 5 years. I was turning in before I realized what I did, thought I had stroked out for a minute.
I got out of work late, drove home. Must have dozed off because last thing I remembered was being on the freeway a couple of exits from home. Woke up in the garage 10 min later, with the car turned off. I got home safely without causing an accident. Scared me still thinking about it.
Post Duty ER. Was already home and asleep. Mom woke me up for dinner, saying "Food's gonna get cold", thought I heard "code", so I jumped up and shouted "where?" And ran down to the dining area only to realize I was at home.
Cooked my phone in the oven.
Had a pet rat out roaming with me while I made some toast.   cleaned up, put the rat in the fridge and didn't realise until I put the butter in the cage that *oh shit*Went to reclaim the rat, she was all "Fuck off, the food box is MINE now". Already gotten into the ham.
Locked keys in car then locked car inside house garage.good times
Someone knocked at my door and i knocked back...
Was at my fiances house for dinner. Had to leave early. Was in a rush. Kissed her dad on the way out. 
Sprayed my hair down with what I thought was hair spray. It was Lysol. 
I tried to put the cat into the tool drawer and then almost put the poor thing into the fridge 30 seconds later. 
I wear a fob watch at work. Pinned to my chest. On my days off I don't half get odd looks if someone asks me the time and I automatically start pawing at my boob. When my daughter was very young she loved trains. So I'd take her on short trips and the line passed some fields, where I'd point out the animals to her. Got some weird British alarmed looks that time I pointed out of the window and loudly said "look! Moo cows!" when was on the train by myself. 
Spent all afternoon making chicken soup with the remains of a whole baked chicken carcass. After hours of simmering, it tasted great out of the pot...so I walked over to the sink and poured the whole thing through a colander like it was pasta to be strained. It didn't hit me for a second. I just stood there stupidly looking at the non-fluid portion of the soup in the pot. I felt like such an idiot.
Put toothpaste on my razor and almost went to town on my mouth.
*sighs* It had been a long, rough day at work. Once I got home I really had to pee, I pulled down my pants, sat and started peeing. I forgot a step. Pull down underwear. You read it right everyone, I pissed myself on the toilet.  EDIT - Fun fact, I never shared my embarrassing moment with my husband. I wanted to share some of the funny responses I got and finally just told him. He hasn't stopped laughing yet. (He was having a bad day so I'm glad I shared.)
I was woken up at 3:30 in the morning for a random drug test for baseball last semester and after I pissed in the cup, I drank it.Don't know why, but I did it. Luckily there was still enough in the cup to test. 
I often have the urge to say "ok, love you, bye", when ending a work call.  
I kissed a teacher on the cheek, she told someone "I can't hear you" while tapping her fingers on her cheek and I thought she wanted a kiss...
Was typing up an essay, mind started spacing out, came back around and I had typed a page without any errors. Was strangely proud of myself
Walked into the bedroom and started peeing in the trashcan 
I ordered a meatlong football from subway. I then got upset when the dude had no idea what I wanted.Then we both laughed.
Poured orange juice instead of milk into my cereal, put the bowl of cereal into the fridge, walked back to the table with nothing wondering where the fuck I put my cereal.
Put the dinner on and realised I had no carrots.  Decided to drive to the shop to get carrots - ended up driving to work.  Burnt the shit out of all the pots and had to buy new ones :(
shaving my legs, i'm 20 so have been doing this for 7+ years. go to clean hair out of the razor blades between strokes: the usual way to do this is just swirl the razor in water/wipe with a flannel etc. for some reason i just ran my finger along the blades to get the hair out, instantly realised i had been a fucking idiot and was in massive pain 
I put on a coat I hadn't worn in awhile and felt an Altoid in the pocket. Sweet!, loose mint. I popped it in my mouth and it was a watch battery.
Responded to a question in the wrong language
Vigorously picking my nose while holding a cigarette and driving; crammed lit cigarette up my nose
I was in the midst of an 8 hour shift at work. I had to pee for over 2 hours at this point but I was in the middle of working a lunch rush (I worked at a restaurant) so I didn't have time to go. Suddenly things calm down. A-HA! My opportunity! I rejoiced. I run to the bathroom, unbutton my pants, and take a squatting position. In front of a urinal. In a bathroom with roughly six men inside. I am an 18 year old female. 
one time, one of the kids asked for... shit i don't even remember what. probably asked for a sandwich or something. on autopilot(i was tired and sick) i go into the kitchen, got a bowl out of the cabinet, sliced up a bunch of ham, put that in the bowl, poured in apple juice, stuck a slice of toast and a teabag on top and handed it to him with a steak knife. kiddo was smart. he watched me do all that, took the bowl and knife, said 'thank you', put it on the table and went and got my wife and said 'daddy's super tired' and showed her what i'd done. she put me to bed after that. 
When I was a kid, I was having breakfast, pancakes and apple juice.  Somehow, I poured myself a glass of maple syrup and took a slug, expecting apple juice.  Spit it across the room.
Lately when im browsing internet i suddenly get an idea strike and i have to search for something,i open up a new tab and instantly forget what i wanted to search for,i get really mad close my eyes and try to figure out what i wanted and succeed like 2/10 times, most of times i just close the new tab thinking that im a young man with a mind of a old man with some brain damage. it hurts
My wife and I had a really long day running all over the city with out daughter. This was three days after my second deployment where I had been gone for 12 months. We got in bed and I just sort of opened my laptop, put headphones on, and turned on the ol porn. I didn't understand why I had just gotten slapped until nearly 30 seconds after the fact.
Put my keys in the freezer
On a similar note, I did park maintenance for awhile and often entered the opposite sex bathroom to clean. I have found myself yelling "FEMALE MAINTENANCE WORKER!" before entering the ladies room
What did you do with the beer and why is the answer you chugged it?
Been giggling like mad at all the stories, but yours? yours pushed me over the edge. I think My laughing just woke up the neighborhood..
Thank you for the diabolical idea of how to get rid of telemarketers! 
"Fuck you, this is all you get."
I just burst out laughing at 2. Thanks for that.
Imagine you pick up someone elses signal with the baby monitor and start hearing voices in your car. 
How did it taste 
The other day I was checking in at an amusement park. After the guy scanned my ticket, I, for some unknown reason, held out my hand. And the guy handed me his scanner. 
Haha I've done that.I was walking through town with my gf at the time, looking at stalls and shops and she was in my periphery, or so I thought... She had stopped to look at something else and a woman of roughly the same height and hair colour was stood next to me.I checked my phone for time, gently caressed her shoulders and said "come on now, it's time for us to head off". And just walked away from this woman.I turned around a few meters later to see my gf a luminescent shade of embarrassed and this entirely freaked out little old Asian woman.
I had to go to Walmart once after finishing my midnight cashier shift from a competing grocery retailer across the street. I absentmindedly grabbed my stuff, approached the cashier and asked her if she found everything ok. We stared at each other blankly for a little bit.
I would always try to greet people when they walked into clothing stores/restaurants and then realize I'm shopping/eating too, that's not my job here. 
What flavor was Mister Peepers?
What did you used to do at the airport? I think airports are interesting
I did something like that when I was like 8. My dad was in the car getting ready to take me and my brother to the game room, and I didn't want to miss out so I ran to the car without pants on. Then I hear my mom yelling out the window, "YOU HAVE NO PANTS ON!"
I was making breakfast one early morning and cracked my eggs straight into the garbage.
Aw, I feel ya. That must have sucked. 
I once did this in a skype conversation
So.. how did it taste?
Every year I have a day or two where my first period learns something a bit wrong because my brain isn't working. I usually hope they're not paying too much attention and try to reteach it the next day. 
I have done this. Instead of grabbing my coffee, I got my tv remote and didn't notice until I got to work haha 
Once I was feeding my 1 year old a banana and talking to my mom. In the middle of the conversation, I pushed the banana in front of my moms face and just waited for her to take a bite. It took like 30 seconds to register that I was force feeding my 48 year old mother NOT my toddler. It was hilarious. 
My boyfriend tried to wake me up from a nap and he started tickling me and I started freaking out and getting scared because I thought he was a wire stabbing into me and I was a mountain? 
i was really hoping it was the other way around :(
I was on a bus with a guy new to the route but finished his training. He got mixed up, took a wrong turn, got more mixed up, and some people who were regulars to the route straightened him out and got the bus on track again. It was funny as hell. No one was mad, everyone just apologised and laughed because Canada eh.
It's better than looking for your glasses while you're wearing them. Not my proudest moment...
Makes sense.
Have done, but with just two. First egg: "oh, dammit!" *Rinses egg down sink*Second egg: "oh...oh, fucking come on"
What does code mean
That was the best day of that rat's life.
You reminded me of my favorite one!I kick my truck door closed all the time.  One time, I kicked it closed before grabbing my phone, and in a sleepy panic *threw my keys into the truck just before the door closed.*  I was so out of it I yelled "Yes!" because my sleep addled brain must have thought that was awesome.  Had to wait for my wife to get home to open the door to the house to get the spare.
I worked at a restaurant where we had to knock on the bar door before opening it, I probably did it about 20 times a day for 6 years. Almost every time I open a door that you just have to push open, like a bathroom door at a restaurant or something, I knock really hard like three times. Lots of weird looks. 
Ah crap something similar happened to me. I got to a party and saw people I knew, mostly female, so I gave them all a hug and a small peck on the cheek, get to the one guy in the group, both of us bearded men and proceeded to give him a peck on the cheek. We both just stopped and stared at each other. 
Oh god, I can't!How did he react?
Just who the fuck is Pete, Tiffani?
Do you know any Petes?
I can't stop giggling at the moo cows, now *I* look crazy
Yeah... they probably didn't need the pee to know if you were on drugs after that.
I drive a friend home from work as she has no car and its like 2 am. Done this a few times but one day I drove home about half hour ride. She didn't say anything until I got into my driveway. I was like omg. I forgot you where here as she was quiet. Apologized profusely as the implication could be misread. Took her home after we both got naked at wawa.Good times.
did you drink both?
I had this happen to me. I had procrastinated on a film study project, started working on it at 8pm the night before it was due, made it about 1/2 of the way through by midnight, and woke up in my bed at 5:30am to go to school with no recollection of anything after midnight. I was freaking out thinking I still had four hours of work to do to finish, but checked the document and it was *done*. Last saved at 3am. I got an A on a project that I barely remembered doing, and I had done the second half *faster* than when I was conscious.
That sounds more like drunk than auto pilot
What size sub?*meat long*
I've tried to put milk in the cabinet where the cereal goes a bunch of times.  I've even tried to put the box of cereal in the fridge. 
What are some other quotes?
When my husband and I started dating,  we were long distance, and often talked on the phone late at night, due in part to his job and the time difference. One night,  I fell asleep on the phone,  in the middle of my own sentence,  and finished the sentence with something like,  "... but then we need to find a place to camp." It was like my brain was playing mad libs and just filled in with "adjective, noun, verb," or whatever. 
Sounds like you forgot more than just her password. 
My boss was speaking to me in Italian the other day. Another co-worker, also Italian, had to remind him that he was speaking Italian to me and I couldn't understand him. He quickly realized why I had been ignoring him.
ouch
Did anyone say anything?
You have the best child.
that combination tho
Did the guy you walked in on say anything?
Had I been a year or two or I probably would have drank it.  I have it to the lunch room teacher who has known my mom for years.
this has been the most entertaining thread I've read in a while.  I think my heart is starting to beat irregularly from all the laughing.
My old girlfriends mom used to pay for fast food in a drive through then drive away.
Just the very image of him angrily hurling coffee at the passenger seat like it offended him somehow has me in tears.
I knew none of those people where paid. They all just pass on the torch.
Can confirm, as a dog, your shoes are delicious
I would be flattered personally if I were old and some young thing accidentally carted me off, but maybe that's just me.  When you're old it's always nice to have something random happen like that, as long as you're not being abducted lol.
I worked as a greeter at a store that isn't Walmart.  One day I was thinking about how I had to go to Walmart after work and greeted people with "Welcome to Walmart" several times.  
Nothing I could compare it to, to be honest 
He was an autopilot. 
I'm glad I'm not the only one, something about airports is really fascinating to me.
Skype meetings are the worst about this because you don't have any body language to clue you in that someone wants to say something.So usually one or two people just steamroll the conversation and you basically have to talk over them for 30 seconds to get them to stop and give you some time.It's honestly a real problem with conference calls in my experience.
Like old beef jerky flavoured sand.
I'm imagining the bus driver just pulling into the driveway, getting out, and leaving all the passengers ~~lol caked~~ *locked* inside.
If it was OCTranspo in Ottawa, people might have laughed about it in public but you can be damn certain they made a bunch of passive aggressive posts about it on /r/Ottawa.
Not as bad as not being able to find your glasses because you can't see without your glasses.
It's faster if you do it in the microwave
He just wanted to chill while watching TV. 
I cracked one right into the trash can. One tap on the side of the stove then right into the garbage you go! Liquid first, shell second, patience last. 
A heart stopped, or someone stopped breathing. Code red or code blue.  At least that's what I remember from when my mom worked in the emergency room. 
haha, oh jesus, those poor guys must get so stressed. I cannot imagine another profession as stressfull that would make you wake up mid panic. "The walk-in freezer is open! Someone left the Walk in freezer open and there's a problem with it's fans!"  Said no cook or waitress ever when waking up in the night. Poor Medical staff, you guys are all nerves. 
I rushed all over there concerned and apologetic and she's fuckin' arse-deep in a packet of ham and actually tried to cling to the door as I took her out.  She'd seen fuckin' paradise and wasn't leaving.  
I worked three jobs once, and they all had different ways of answering the phone, plus, of course, my own phone. One day, I picked up a call at one job, and my mind went completely blank. All the caller could hear from me was "Ah, uh, Thank, hello." Pause. "Thank, uh, This..." Then I hung up. 
Most of my friends would probably just roll with it
He smiled.And said.I know why my daughter likes you.It made it worse
He doesn't want to talk right now. 
No, but when I was a kid I was a bit of a tomboy and wanted people to refer to me as "Pete". I think it was a regression!
The guy who was monitoring our test was just like "WTF?!?!"
Wait what?
I did. 
He was piloting under influence. 
MEAT. LONG
I heard their meatlongs are not actually twelve meats long.
I did this once. In pretty warm weather. I didn't realize I did it until I came home from work and wondered why the whole apartment reeked of spoiled milk. 
A really common one is she asks me what I'm doing (through text), then asks me again a few minutes later (after I've answered, I'd like to add). I always respond "you just asked that" and she says "oh yea. Autopilot".
Nope. Dead silence. 
he has some serious moments, i admit. other times he's a shrieking pain in the ass.but sometimes he's pretty awesome. 
yeah it was so weird he didn't even blink he just thanked me and went and got his mom. 
He did not, no.My hope is that he didn't notice me.My fear is that he was only pretending to not notice me.
Sounds like you had a few beers before writing this.
I used to be pretty good at making people do this. If you say "Thank you, have a nice day" in the right tone of voice when you hand their card or change back, about 1/3 of the time they'll just drive away. I got two cars in a row to drive off one day. IIRC, only one of them came back, looking sheepish, to get their fried chicken.
It took me a minute to figure out what was going on. I looked down at my hand and I was like "uh, I think you need this," and handed it back to him. He just took it like "thanks..." and went on checking the next person like it was totally normal.
Sir, you are a potato.
Oh yeah? Then what's his vector, Victor?
I think it's because almost everyone at the airport is probably there for an important reason
Did the cat like the cereal?
My brain does that too. One time I couldn't decide between saying France or French, so I ended up with "Franch." To make matters worse, my brain has decided "yup, that works" and now if I'm not careful I'll always end up calling it Franch. 
Do you process the information at the moment and just don't store it? Or is this cool trick a cause of accidents? 
"There's a bug!""Uh-oh" said the programmer, as he rolls over into a more comfortable position.
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO BACK
Just keep rolling with it until after the marriage.
Is Norman available?
That's amazing. How did they respond?
Did you pass the test?
hahaahah that's so great. 
I love to see that good in people. "Oh look some stranger passed out on my couch, drunk. I should get him a blanket." Those people are awesome, and probably going to die from being too nice at some point.
You guys are amazing friends. Kudos to you.
AS LONG AS THE MEAT IS, SIR.
My mom will ask me the same question three times in succession, forgetting I already answered each time.
what happened after
I am laughing so hard thank you so much love you bye
We have clearance, Clarence.
"What's your favorite salad dressing?""Franch"
One phrase I do this all the time with. I often say "take care buddy" or "take care bro". More often than I'd like, it becomes "take care bruddy" or "brud". Makes me wonder if I English as good as I think.
I could do with a tasty dream bear myself...
"I HAVE SEEN WHAT LIES ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE HORIZON, MAN-BEAST. YOU WILL NOT CAST ME BACK TO MY PURGATORY OF IRON BARS AND PROTEIN PELLETS!"(Translated from *'Squeak!'*)
The brojob train has no brakes. 
No, just Walter, but he's shy. 
Shock and hysterical laughter ensued. 
By far the best in the thread so far. Just imagining the coworker's face is fucking killing me hahaha
I mean, If I was planning to kill someone, and they offered me a blanket and pillow, I'd probably change my mind.
... So like three inches?
It's been an hour. OP's dead.
You cannot even blame it. Kind of sad for the rat to having seen the truth.
So is Pete a nickname for you around them?
Not to mention that laying prone on someone else's couch is almost the worst killing strategy you could use
the men bit her, now she's turned into one of them. A manpire
Unfortunately. 
"Never pick a fight with an ugly person. They don't have anything to lose."  ~Robin WilliamsOut of the tens of thousands of hilarious things he said, this one always made me laugh the loudest for some reason. RIP, funny man. The world is a lesser place because you're no longer in it. :(
When I was maybe 10 years old, I was in the lobby of a hotel in Baltimore and my dad tapped me on the shoulder and pointed to a guy standing in line. I turned and saw a short, hairy guy with a big pack pack. When I realized who it was, I let out a gasp and made eye contact with Robin Williams. He then looked back at me and let out a gasp of his own. Small, insignificant story, but it makes me laugh thinking back to that. 
My favorite Robin Williams moment: He was asked by a reporter what he said to aspiring comedians who asked him if they should be a comedian.  He flatly said, "I tell them no. Don't do it."  When asked why he would say such a thing he replied; "If they have the drive to make it; they're not going to give a fuck about what I say. And if someone quits because I say that; then they were't going to make it anyway. I just saved that person from wasting their time."
I've always heard people talking about how a certain celebrity death really hurt them, and I couldn't honestly understand it. I had never really looked up to or had been effected by someone I never even met before. Now I know. This death hit me like a ton if bricks. I am at a loss of words truly. All I can say is I truly will miss this man and everything he has done. 
"If you're that depressed, reach out to someone. And remember, suicide is a permanent solution, to a temporary problem." -Robin WilliamsSo sad :(
Finally, the megathread is upon us. Does anyone have any favorite quotes? I like "You're only given one little spark of madness. You mustn't lose it."
One Hour Photo.... Anyone?
For every person who is saddened by this I feel Robin Williams did his job on earth. If you have the feels right now then he positively affected your life and he'd be happy he did. Mission complete. RIP
Favorite story about Robin Williams?
Just goes to show even the most happy, upbeat, and funny people can suffer from severe debilitating depression. He spent his entire life making other people happy. He will be sorely missed. E: Just wanted to add that I'm reading all of your replies and if anyone needs to talk, or perhaps let some of their burden go, my inbox is 100% open. 
Goodbye, Robin Williams. You will be missed. Why did he have to go? :(
Favorite Robin Williams movie?
His portrayal of Patch Adams inspired me in my medical career.  How did he inspire you?
How can we as a group rally to support the people we already love?  Will they speak out and accept the love that we have to give?  I just wish I could hug him and say everything will be all right...last week... 
He's not dead, he's only wandering the forests of Jumanji waiting for his time to return and take us away from the sadness and evil in the world. 
"I heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed, life is harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in threatening world. Doctor says, "Treatment is simple. The great clown Pagliacci is in town. Go see him. That should pick you up." Man bursts into tears."But doctor" He says, "I am Pagliacci." Good joke. Everybody laugh. Roll on snare drum. Curtains."RIP Mr. Williams
"Reality is just a crutch for people who can't cope with drugs." Robbin Williams
Your favorite thing about Robin Williams?
Jumanji?
I normally don't care about this sort of thing, people I've never met dying. This and Steve Irwin though really hit me in the feels. 
Who could play Robin Williams in the inevitable biopic?
Any Robin Williams stories from people who met him?
When your job is to make everyoe happy, i guess you forget how to make yourself happy..
He was a social genius among other things.
Patton Oswalt expressed my feelings exactly. 
Spoken like someone who's struggled with depression.
It makes me sad to think how overwhelmingly depressed he must have been to not take his own advice that he has given to millions of people.
Don't forget What Dreams May Come. 
Well, I think it's a pretty safe bet Louis will be at Robin's funeral.
The last time I saw him was in *Wilfred*. 
> The show ends with Robin and Louis agreeing that they'll at least go to each other's funeral, should the other die first.I started thinking about that episode after I heard the news and it really effected me emotionally.  Powerful in the current context.  I'd like to hear what Louie feels about this...  
Today, I learned that Hook has a 31% on rotten tomatoes which is ridiculous because everyone I know loves this movie.
He had a small part in my favorite movie, Artificial Intelligence, as Dr. Know. He recites this poem in his scene and I love it so much.Come away, O human child! To the waters and the wild With a faery, hand in hand. For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.
"Cricket is basically baseball on valium."
Fucking loved it. Proved he could step away from comedy and still nail a performance.Good Morning Vietnam was my favourite though.
You just made me sadder :(
I can just imagine the movie.... The new ash ketchum knock-off has a five minute montage thinking what his life will be like if he chooses the regular starter Pokemon.. Sees himself flying with charizard, blastoise surfing through the water and flying through the jungle like Tarzan off the back of venosaur... Instead the funny professor oak decides to give him a magickarp..... And a few pieces of candy.... That are quite rare.... And have magical properties...
I have been depressed lately, so the other day I went on Netflix looking for a movie to cheer me up. I ended up watching The Birdcage, even though I have seen it several times before. I picked it because I loved Robin Williams and he has never failed to make me laugh. I feel so honestly sad that there was no one and nothing to cheer him when he most needed it. I feel like one of the brightest lights in the universe just winked out and the world just got a little bit darker.
When he burst into Christopher Reeves room shortly after his accident portraying a russian doctor there to perform a colonoscopy...Reeves said it was the first time he laughed and knew things would be alright.
I had a friend that grew up in San Francisco and went to Robin Williams' house on Halloween and he told me Robin always had the best candy bars and made everybody that came to his door laugh. 
It seems to me that the most successful comedians always have an intimate understanding of how life can make jokes out of us.
Aaand that's the thing tonight that pushed me to tears. I feel fairly confident that this is the only presidential statement to say "bangarang"
<hug> to you.
Hug...  Can I have one too?
While this is a huge tragedy, it's important to remember that Williams had been struggling with severe depression for years.  One especially bad day with the ultimate consequence was always a possibility.  It's important to keep that in mind, especially if you have loved ones in a similar position.Don't forget there are great resources higher in the thread.
Good Morning Vietnam

You treat a disease, you win, you lose. You treat a person, I guarantee you, you'll win, no matter what the outcome.
Dead Poet's Society. I'm a teacher. 
He showed me that it's ok to be a goof as an adult. As a kid, seeing a grown man running around making funny voices and great jokes in movies made me realize the adulthood doesn't have to suck.
I'm silently sobbing watching hook with my kids (6, 4 and 2). They've been obsessed with it the last few days. 
RIP Mr. Williams. We'll all be waiting for God to roll a 5 or an 8.
Yes 
The thing is with Steve Irwin at least I could've expected to see him go in such a way. While tragic it was oddly fitting of him. But, I can't even imagine Robin Williams without a smile on his face much less depression and suicide. His death seems to hit something deeper because of how unexpected and unlike the image we all had of him. 
I don't think anyone could do it convincingly, this made me realize how one of a kind he truly was. 
My uncle saw him jogging in Hawaii--he yelled out, "That's Robin Williams!" Robin Williams heard him, turned around and screamed "Where!!!" Then continued on his run.
An excerpt from President Barack Obama's statement sent from the White House:>"Robin Williams was an airman, a doctor, a genie, a nanny, a president, a professor, a bangarang Peter Pan, and everything in between.  But he was one of a kind. He arrived in our lives as an alien -- but he ended up touching every element of the human spirit.  He made us laugh.  He made us cry.  He gave his immeasurable talent freely and generously to those who needed it most -- from our troops stationed abroad to the marginalized on our own streets."
"Heard a joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says, "Treatment is simple. Great clown Pagliacci is in town tonight. Go and see him. That should pick you up." Man bursts into tears. Says, "But doctor...I am Pagliacci." Alan Moore, Watchmen.
His words finally just broke the floodgates... As someone with a similar depressive disorder it really hurts to imagine that even at his age after starting a family and all his success that he was still hurting underneath it all.
I think Weinger's and Gottfried's comments got to me the most. It's wonderful to see the huge celebrity outreach in this time.
He also struggled with alcoholism. That is actually a quote thrown around in aa meetings quite a bit.
Now that's dark, because in it, he plays a man coming to terms with his wife's suicide. He dies and travels through hell to find her, only to see her cursed to relive all the pain and sorrow and rage that led her to that decision, again and again for all eternity. This hurts to type. 
If I see a picture of him at the funeral I'll burst into tears.
He also paid for treatments Christopher Reeves' family couldn't afford. 
"...will be the cornerstone of my administration. I'm proposing that America get behind a brand new biparitsan comprehensive medical coverage bill that is bangarang as all get out." - from Obama's 1st Inaugural Speech, Jan 20 2008
This one. I was talking to my son just last night about Robin Williams and told him he needed to see this movie. I think we'll watch it tonight.
It's not your fault.
Damn, he stole my line.    RIP
Guys, I've never seen Good Will Hunting.....
He brought humor to the role, but he preserved the character's dignity and humanity to prevent it from being a complete joke or a characture of a gay man.
This is one of the few movies that makes me laugh out loud any time I watch it.  I might watch this tonight.
You are the pan :(
This was mine too. Even though we couldn't see him, it's amazing how they got the genie to look *just a bit* like him in the face...So god damn sad right now...
This is one of my favorites. It was the first time I saw Robin Williams in a serious role. His character totally creeped me out in this movie.
Miranda: What happened?Mrs. Doubtfire: He was quite fond of the drink. It was the drink that killed him.Miranda: How awful. He was an alcoholic?Mrs. Doubtfire: No, he was hit by a Guinness truck.
It's a driveby fruiting!
I don't work with the males, because I used to be one. 
Oh captain my captain!
I have never seen this movie and I feel like it will have such a different feeling to it now. Too sad.
YES. This movie is SO underrated. And Robin just absolutely kills that role. 
Such an underrated film. I could never understand why the critics hated it so much. 
 You treat a disease, you win, you lose. You treat a person, I guarantee you, you'll win, no matter what the outcome.
That was my favorite quote.  The theme and ideas are so pure in that movie, the delivery is so perfect.
Oh god. His family. :(
I've read this multiple times, which makes me feel both better and worse about myself.
Whoever could do it hasn't been born yet.
I was just trying to explain this to my girlfriend. I use humor all the time to deflect my true feelings.Also dethklock: comedy is pain
How many of you just read this in Barack Obama's voice?
Good joke.
Prepare for tears.
Oh man, I forgot this fact and thanks for reminding me. God dammit Robbie, why did you have to go!?
I've always seen overdosing as a kind of suicide... Plenty of celebrities do that. 
I'm rather surprised this is so far down. I guess it must be a generational thing... 
I know.
It's not your fault.
So watch it now, it's on Netflix.
I started the movie thinking it was going to be dumb and over dramatic. In the end I was laughing every two minutes. He just played the role so well.
I always thought is was "lewd *crude* rude bag of pre-chewed food, dude!" 
but that poor boy, who wanted to be an actor... I was crying for days
Our job is improving the quality of life, not just delaying death.
Or discovered.
How could you *not*?
Everybody laughs.
They were roommates at Julliards and they promised each other that if one of them got successful they would take care of the other.  
/u/sucks_at_people probably meant intentional suicides. ODs are often accidental
It's not your fault.
Don't fuck with me!
From those bust blockers. 
Just checked. They took it off.
I just watched it two nights ago, and he played the perfect "straight" man (har har) to Nathan Lane's over-the-top hilarity. But the true star of that movie is Hank Azaria. He steals the show, which is saying a lot considering who he shared the stage with. 
Or invented
 Roll on snare drum.
And they did. The Williams family took care of Reeves' son after both Christopher and his wife passed away. 
I know!
Well, I was going to recommend he pirate it, but that seems wrong on a day like today.
I just want to say, I love you too. I wish I could hug you right now. 
It's not your fault.
What with Peter Pan and all.
Don't fuck with me!
My "stink eye" becomes a real thing and anyone that recieves it will be minorly inconvenienced in some way within the next 5 minutes: drop their keys, almost trip on something, find their shoelaces untied, whatever.Seems like the kind of thing a kind of shitty genie would find amusing.
I'd wish that for the next week, the days are 25 hours long so I can procrastinate just a little bit longer.
To instantly become bilingual, but only in a fictional language,  like Dothraki or the black speech of Mordor. 
My old Ford really needs new tires.  I could get by with two, if he wants to be really shitty about it.
He could clean my house, he could do a kind of shitty job too. 
I get to trade in my car any time I want at no cost to me.  But I can only ever get a 1986 Datsun.
That my fingernails and toenails will stop growing and stay at the appropriate length forever.
I would wish that every time someone around me said they lost something, I would instantly find it but I'd have to keep it for myself. It would be nice because I'd get all this new stuff but shitty because I could never use the new things around anyone since they would probably think I stole it. 
Can I get the ass and back hair to move back up to the top of my head where it used to be?
I can toast bread with my mind, but only a whole loaf at a time. I saw that somewhere once years ago and it still makes me laugh. 
The ability to throw my farts like a ventriloquist.
I'd ask him to make the walk to class 10 minutes shorter, but only when it's raining. Kind of a shitty wish since it'll make me slightly inconvenienced on sunny days, but not enough to actually do anything.
Be able to leave the house without forgetting something, especially that one specific thing you needed for work that you realize you forgot halfway to the office and have to decide to either go without or turn back and end up being late!
Some more cheap beer
You know when you're trying to put a fitted sheet on your mattress, but you can't seem to get one side to stay down and you think to yourself, "Man, if only I had someone here that could hold down one side of this fitted sheet while I'm putting it on my mattress?"I'd ask for a blowjob.
$500, won't make shit of a difference but I'll have $500. 
My wish would be to always have a couple drinks in the house for guests. Wouldn't change my life other than being a slightly better host.
I'd wish to have a clean shit every time.
I want to increase my likelihood of finding spare change on the ground by 500%
I wish for the ability to make an actual rimshot noise just by doing the hand motions, instead of having to say "badoom-tshh".
My wish; if I get drunk with someone who speaks a different first language, then for the duration of said drunkeness, I get the ability to speak that language as well as they can. My English skills also change to match my drinking colleague's.Basically, it would be useless for a job or anything like that, but it would lead to fun.
A burrito.  You know what? Two burritos. One for me and one for the little shit Genie
I'd probably wish to never have to cut my toenails again; I'd probably gain a cumulative hour of my life. 
Could I make my dick half an inch longer?
Every time I toss something at a garbage can from this day forward it goes in. Every fucking time. No look toss? In. Behind the back toss? In. From across the room? You know it's in. 
$1000 in loose change.  Significantly more shitty than $1000 in cash or check form because I'll either have to roll it or pay the Coinstar fee, not enough money to alter the course of my life, but would definitely moderately improve my life in the immediate short term.  I would probably spend most of it on food, or forget to take it to the bank and let it sit around collecting dust.
For the rest of my life, I never pull into a gas station on the wrong side. On my car, I know it's on the right. But sometimes I'm listening to the radio, or thinking about something, or just being fucking old and I pull into the wrong side. And I know on rentals or a buddy's car there's always an arrow on the gauge, but still, sometimes I'm jetlagged or distracted or shit and I pull into the wrong side. I would like the shitty genie to grant me always pulling into the correct side at the petrol stop. 
The ability to shoot queso out of my fingers.
I'd wish I could just click on some interesting looking Facebook articles and they'd load like a regular webpage, instead of taking an effing month to download a bunch of shitty ads and then randomly hang, reload the page and lag. 
I'd ask for my clothes to clean themselves every night, even if I'm sleeping in them.  I'd look like a cartoon character because I'd be wearing the same clothes for the rest of my life.
I'd ask that every time I take a shit at work the larger stall is available so I can live like a king for 15 minutes out of the day. 
I wanna know why the ice maker in my freezer keeps fucking up. Shitty Genie doesn't have to fix it necessarily, but I wish for him to tell me what the fuck is wrong with it.
If I have enough cash to pay for something then I will always have the exact combination of notes and coins to pay for it without having to deal with change
A slightly worse genie and so on until I get the worst genie you could get
Everytime I sneeze, a random person in a 1 mile radius of me shits their pants.
I'll wish that he curse those people who pissed me off that whenever they push or press a button, 75% of the time it wouldn't work.
I'd wish the farmer behind our house would fix the flooding problem. The whole field drains onto our property. The head of the drainage board in our county is best friends with the farmer so nothing will get done so the back part of our property is useless. 
Another shitty genie. Let's see if we can't get a party going.
I'd probably just ask for a brand new backyard fence so I don't have to worry about my dogs getting out all the time.By the way This is a really good question that should've been asked in peak hours because it probably won't get any traction now.
10 king size milky way bars. Though if it has to be shitty then I'll take them partially melted.
To always know which are the decoy snails
If I complete the hardest or most time consuming assignment, all my other assignments are automatically completed.
An endless supply of beer, but it's only Budwieser
Not have to cleanup after a wank. Can be a real downer
Not being able to stink.
a free meal at Denny's whenever i want
Could I get a magic carpet with a top speed of 10 mph
Give me a million reddit karma. The points mean nothing. 
Tan skin during the winter 
I would wish that every time someone sneezed it would be too loud and stuff would come out. 
About $8 for a Spicy Deluxe and fries at Chick fil a would be enough to keep me happy for a few hours...
I wish for my cell phone to always be at 60% battery life. 
I'd like to not go to a stupid meeting I have to go to tomorrow.
In each of Trump's tweets going forward, one random word is replaced by profanity
The ability to make other people piss themselves. Wouldn't make my life any better except that I can make people piss themselves for my own enjoyment 
To lose 10 lbs 
You've just described a Toyota Camry.
What if this is true, but you've never noticed? 
> My "stink eye" becomes a real thinga bad genie would probably turn that wish into you getting horrible body odor.
Oh man I'd kill for an extra hour of ~~sleep~~ watching old tv show reruns and playing with my phone.
Those extra hours happen when it's most inconvenient, like if you're stuck in traffic or have work to do.
DOVAHKIIN, DOVAHKIIN, NAAL OK ZIN LOS VAHRIIN!
It's not even one of the Tolkien languages people have heard of, so you get a useless L2 and a bunch of Tolkien nerds stalking you because you're the world expert on Avarin.
He'd clean the entire house thoroughly, then take all of the trash, dust, and misplaced items he's collected and toss them all into one important room. It would probably be most effective in a bathroom or bedroom. The genie could also "clean" the house of some things that would bother you if they went missing- batteries, some lightbulbs, a remote, maybe a door.
I see a loophole here. Buy one of those two dollar toy cars, classify it as 'your car', trade that in for a 1986 Datsun, sell the 1986 Datsun, repeat, profit.
Easy get a 240z? Call it a day. 
what if you accidently rip off one of your nails? you're fucked dude. 
"Oh no, I can't find Spot!"*Arf arf arf*"Aw fuck..."
And you would never be able to have friends over or you would look like a total klepto.
You'll end up with 70 TV remotes, 25 car keys, ass tons of socks and maybe a wallet or two.You might even find a virginity
I can kind of feel the emotion in this one.
Yes, but it still has the texture of ass and back hair.
This reminds me of the "shitty super powers" game I used to play with my friends whenever we went to to all-night diner after a closing shift. My favorite one was telekinesis, but only within the context of making soup.Other winners included:- creating sexual tension- always knowing how old a person is- being able to turn on lights with your mind, but not off again 
Imagine going into stores with this power and toasting every loaf of bread so when people open the package they're all "????? toast??"E: thank you for the gold, kind redditor!
Would it also throw the smell? If so, I choose this one too.
Is better dirt expensive? 
I did this today... I work in a oil refinery and they WILL NOT lemme in without my badge... And I forgot it... Had to drive 45 minutes home to get it and then 45 back... Lost $50.... :(
Shitty part: it's always warm and mostly flat
The ol' bait n' switch
Sound like an intro to a prono
Granted, but you'll get $500 worth of shit. 
$500 is a life changing amount of money for me right now. 
Fuck, I would use a real wish for that.
Take powdered Metamucil every day. Use to only think it was something old ppl drank until my buddy got me on it. Takes 2-3 days to kick in. Have had only no wipers (wipe once of course for confirmation) for about 2 years now. Best LPT I have ever learned to date. Orange flavor is excellent.
"I'm sorry, but this is beyond the power of the genie of Old Milwaukee."
I wish that, even if it were just for a day, my dog could converse with me as a normal intelligent human.Not only would I explain what you did, but also what thunder was and that it wasn't going to hurt him. Then I'd try to get a system of nonverbal communication worked out for various situations, as well as ask him what he dreamed about and what his favorite dog food was.
But it's only ever pennies...
I used to fantasise about having the power to know where every bit of dropped currency was in whatever city I was currently in. I would then realise I'd rather just have the power to give myself lots of money without having to walk around for it.
You should specify what type of rimshot.
Could substantially change your life, though.  You could use it to get laid a shitton, especially in tourist heavy areas.  You would speak the first language of every foreign girl in the bar.That would be life-altering.  In more ways than one.
this is my favorite so far
This is /r/writingprompts level. 
This is perfect.
You can get toilet hardware by itself for like $2
Why do you clip like you're running out of time?
So... double its size? 
Yes, too bad this isnt real and you still have a small dick
What if you're in a room with the door closed and it's outside the room?
You can turn this into a super power. Place garbage cans near an area a villain (Dr. Always Leaves Piss On The Toilet Rim or something like that) is going to be at and throw a bomb from long range and you're basically human artillery. 
Dump it into the self-checkout at your grocery store, or wherever. It'll take a few months to burn through that much change, but it's free, and using the self-checkout avoids the burning judgement of a minimum wage cashier.
Bring the jar to your bank and they can count and exchange it without a fee. 
There's not always an arrow, sometimes it's just an icon on the dial.AND ON MY PARENTS' 05 SUBURBAN, IT'S ON THE WRONG DAMN SIDE.That is all.
Dude that's not shitty at all, I would invite you to every shitty party I ever threw.
They said shitty genie, not download adblock.
I had a professor in college who only owned black slacks, brown dress shoes and white button-up shirts (the kind that are formal, but don't have an actual collar, so no ties ever). He owned a lot of each (showed us a picture of his closet), but it was all the same outfit. Great, smart guy but you're right, he was SUPER cartoonish. 
"This is the last one""Id like a sandwich""Here's a fucking bullet to the head""Thanks"
Definitely shitty when you're on a long drive by yourself
It will be amazing when that person is nearby.
That would harm me so badly. I'm obsessed with the old arcade game Snake. 
Do brakes count as a button?I feel like there's a fairly good chance this wish will kill everyone who pissed you off.
Burn his field to the ground. 
As someone with. Ridiculously heavy flow, you do not want this. I promise.
It's okay we'll just steal this question, reword it slightly, and ask it tomorrow while we have nothing better to do at work. 
What's peak time on reddit? Lol
The shitty part is that the genie is the one doing the other assignments. He dropped out of high school and doesn't particularly care, so the grade you get on them hovers just barely above failing.
> but it's only BudwieserOP only said *kind of* shitty.
Nah, the real wish here is to have chik fil a open on Sundays
would people be able to tell the difference?
You could easily test by doing it in a mirror and seeing if anything bad happens to you
That... that isn't sleep, buddy.
That sounds fucking fantastic. I bet the sex was angry as hell. 
Was that the couple who tried to raise a kid with Klingon as his first language?
> DOVAHKIIN, DOVAHKIIN, NAAL OK ZIN LOS VAHRIINGoogle Translate thinks this is Arabic.  Translation:He pushed you, pushed you, he got your ax
> sell the 1986 DatsunTwo dollars!  Yessss!
That seems like exactly the sort of wish a shitty genie would be happy to grant. Sure you could be rich, but only in a assortment of 1986 Datsuns and you must progessively go forth to travel the states until none of the dealerships have them anymore, or they're worth less then the 1$ hotwheel car. 
Who the fuck spilled spot remover on the dog again?
WHO THE FUCK SAID THEY LOST THEIR 3 FOOT DILDO?! WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE?!?!
Well, if op doesn't have theirs anymore, I feel like this could cause almost infinite virgininess.
Yeah, he misses the smell of ass hair on his head.
Does it have the shit bits in it still?
I like "able to breathe underwater but only in soup", "able to be invisible but only if no one could see you or record you anyways", and "able to teethshift - mildly change the shape and color of your teeth within normal human parameters".
I imagine it like a magician, like Gob from Arrested Development.."Ma'am, open that bag of bread.""It's toasted.""ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?"
I'd throw it into people's mouths
It's as cheap as dirt. 
My work is strictly about passes but they always keep a couple of temp ones spare if you forget...And you're nice to the receptionists.
Ok? It's easier to chug that way 
$50 bucks right now would make life so much more comfortable. Just enough to eliminate a few small worries.
Get a bidet. You won't care if it's a clean shit or not.
An Amazon review of Metamucil: 'It's difficult to fully convey how much I love this product. No single household item has so drastically impacted my life. It's like thinking that the whole world is black and white, and then someone flicks the colour switch in your brain and you see rainbows and Haribo for the first time.That's how I feel about my new found bowel movements. This is stuff if legit, yo.'
Holy shit really? This might change my life...
Came here to also tout the wonders of fiber.  It doesn't just help with shits, but also to regulate blood sugar.  Afternoon crashes are a thing of the past for me.
Stuff gives me hot peanut butter shits. Takes half a roll just to get enough of it out of my ass hair where I can roll into the shower to finish the job without having to waffle stomp turdtangled toilet paper down the drain too. 
still, adds up and is better than a kick in the teeth
[ ](/fl_excited)I call dibs on the other kind of rimshot. I've always wanted to be able to fart on command. 
Found the percussionist
Pray the clay away really did it for me.
You are perfect.
Like I said, not worth the effort. It's the mildest inconvenience in my life
Clip day and night like you're running out of time/Every day you clip like you're running out of timeKeep on fighting in the meantime. 
well, average size but yeah
ma soul
*THAT MAN HAD A FAMILY*
Ruined it with the edit tbh
You overestimate my throwing capabilities.
Having been a "minimum wage cashier," gotta say, we're not the ones burning with judgement.
Most banks aren't accepting loose change any more, only rolled.  They exist, but finding one would be an adventure.
The side the little nozzle of the tiny gas pump icon is on is *not* an indicator of which side it's on, some just don't have it
That's the shitty part.
And when you have a quick sneezing fit in the car on a back country road, that would lead to true discomfort.
Yeah but occasionally that person is going to be you. 
^started my period last night with PCOS. Sleep with tampon+pad, still have to get up every 2-3 hours to change both unless I want to change my sheets too. 
And if it gets really successful, we'll do it again next week. And the next week. And the next week. 
Looks like it's getting some traction to me.
When the Americans are all awake. 
OK fine Bud Light Lime it is then.
Make America fuck again
Holy shit! I did it and then I dropped the toilet paper roll in the toilet!**I HAVE THE POWER!**
So, like German sex, but less efficient.
The dad only spoke Klingon to the kid, the mom spoke English, kid started rejecting dad at about 7, and by 14ish could not speak or really hear Klingon
You could fix a inconvenient loose toilet seat with the profits!
Still, getting and selling 1 a week for $10,000 (that's how much decent ones are selling for on ebay) would still be $480,000 a year if you took 4 weeks holiday off. Granted the amount of money you could make would go down as time went on, but even if you worked for 10 years you could retire comfortably. Even if we assume the toy car trick didn't work and you had to buy a real, shitty, car for <$500 a week, that's still a lot of money.That doesn't seem like a shitty wish. It'd be life changing if used properly, so I doubt it'd be allowed.
A dildo with three feet? I likey.
Yeah but think off all the great olive oil OP could make
Only if you don't want it to
Me and a friend made up a superhero with the ability to turn street lamps orange, but with the weakness that if caught in the spotlight created by the lamp he would immediately lose the ability to use his legs.We called him Amberlamps.We were also very baked.
This one could actually be useful. Shoot/graze yourself twice in relatively painless or quick-healing areas, and then you've got one-time stray bullet protection forever. 
Who hurt you?
Yeah but the fertilizer is expensive as shit
God invented funnels for a reason
Shit, mate, I'd take 10 bucks now and be happy I don't have to starve myself for another few days.
Bidet? Don't mind if I bidoo.
>you see rainbows and Haribo for the first time.  That's how I feel about my new found bowel movements.If those are sugar-free Haribo, he'll be feeling those new-found bowel movements all right.
What's your daily intake of fiber?
Unless you're always down on your hands and knees picking up loose change, and end up getting kicked in the teeth anyway.
You probably use them just as often, it's an easy mixup. (this is probably funnier if you're Canadian, sorry)
You shall be called Sir douchebag, the dragon born.
$2 for a years worth of inconvenience?! Even if that isn't your property it's still your throne. Just poo it!
How do you measure? I start at the tip and stop until I reach a number that I'm comfortable with.
What did it say? 
Blessing in disguise; If you're ever suspicious of someone watching you, just throw something at the nearest bin and see if it lands or not.
Can confirm, the people behind you in line are probably much more annoyed by it.Looking at you, old lady who still uses checks, didn't even bother to write out part of the check ahead of time, and writes as slowly as is humanly fucking possible.
My credit union has a mechanical change sorter. It gives you a receipt to take to the teller, and that much gets deposited into your account. No fee if you're a member!
Given /u/AlienVoice lives somewhere like London with a population density of 1510 per square kilometre then there is roughly a 1 in 12,140 chance of it being them. I think that's pretty decent odds.However if you're out camping or something then you're in for a shitty time.
Still better than spending the night crying in a ball of pain on the bathroom floor waiting to puke again. (Me, age 13-23, until I went on birth control.) I would literally rather die than go back to that.
Anyway, what was the scandal at your high school?
Doesn't look like anything to me
Fuck America great again.
Yes, and probably bloodier. Lots more fighting and power struggle. 
If someone's selling one on the market every week, it'll drop below 10k pretty quick.
It adds character
Woah, Black Betty.
Every third bullet fired in the world then. You could get extremely lucky and have every one ever fired at you be useless, have it never work at all in a meaningful way, or somewhere in between 
Double dang!
Hallowed be thy funnel
If you have a paypal or something I'll send you 10$ right now. I'm pretty broke but I'm not "10$ will keep me from starving" broke.
I don't know why this is making me laugh so much.
Sugar free haribo and metamucil would have an epic battle over bowel movement consistency, in you.
A year in which I sit on the loo twice a week at most. I think you're vastly overestimating the size of this inconvenience, I literally picked the smallest flaw in my apartment. That loo seat will still outlive most of our society
Tip to asshole
Hook the measuring tape on your asshole.
Long ago when I worked at a grocery store, I asked a customer why she chose to use checks. She proceeded to fucking complain to management about me after I finished with her.Excuse me for trying to understand the benefits of using checks.
PREACH. I started using the Nuvaring to skip shark week because I had been given heavy narcotics that didn't put a dent in my cramps. Shark week free for nearly seven years. People always say something like "that isn't healthy, you shouldn't do that, blah blah blah," but even if it takes years off my life, I have a QUALITY of life that I wouldn't trade for the world (in terms of lady business, anyway - still a mental health clusterfuck who may have narcolepsy, but at least I'm not crippled for seven days each month). 
Make fuck great again.
With surplus rum, I will be drunk, on turps as I am on bourbon.
Thanks for the offer, but I wouldn't accept it even if you did.My mess to get through.
It reminds me of this joke: What's the difference between Dubai and Abu Dhabi? People in Dubai don't like the Flintstones, but people in Abu Dhabi doooooo  
*tips asshole*
**EDIT6:** HERE'S A FUCKING MUTANT SWORDFIGHTING A ROBOT. ^^^^/s
You can make a payment with no money I your account. Checks take 3 days to clear a bank. They can even bounce and then you didn't pay at all but you still have the food and now you're 3 days away.
Make America great fuck
Yeah, that's what I mean! Like an exoskeleton made from fingernails. That's fucking disgusting. 
Give us this day our daily Mead and forgive us all tresspasses as we did not see that this was not our own home...
I respect that.
As someone who is living in Abu Dhabi at the moment, this is my go to joke. love it! thanks for making me laugh.
m'anus
Teethless they bite, lipless they smile. Eyeless they watch.The trash misses again. Again and again. You think you sense a slight chortle and whip your head around. Eyes searching furiously into the void.
it doesn't always work like this anymore. a lot of places process your checks electronically right then and there like a debit card transaction. 
After that, what is your (not actually) controversial opinion that we all share?
Great America, make fuck?
Just gild him $10 worth. Then he'll still have had someone waste $10 on him, and he doesn't get to use the money. 
Shia Lebeouf
Can confirm. If they run your check through the little machine at the register it was just turned into an electronic transaction like a debit card.  Even if they don't do it right there in front of you it is pretty rare any more to have a few days before your account is debited.
Not my story, but my brothers.He lost his wallet and was retracing his steps looking for it. A homeless man approached him at a coffee shop and said to him "Don't worry. It's in the bathroom sink. Your wallet is in your bathroom sink"Later that night he did indeed find his wallet at home in the bathroom sink. A few days later, he saw the same homeless man and thanked him for his help. The guy became really irritated and told my brother he had never seen him before.Could have been a lucky guess, but I think Magical Bum makes for a better story. 
I've had glasses since the third grade. I was playing tackle football with friends after school (I wasn't wearing glasses), tackled one of my friends, really big collision, for a second I regained full eyesight...then I blinked and it was gone again.
When I was about 10 years old I saw my old dog catch a crow out of the air then just gently release it. 
My dad swears he once saw two cats, a raccoon and a skunk all meet up in the middle of the street at night. 
When I was about 10 they started putting missing children on milk cartons. Every morning for a while I was looking at this boy's face on the side of the milk while I would eat my cereal. Then one day a car went down my street while I was playing outside, and there was a boy in the back seat with his face up close to the window looking out. I'm 99% sure it was the boy from the milk carton. I told my parents but they didn't believe me.
Went and got the mail from the previous day at like 7 am. No one was around, but this massive black dog was walking around my neighbors Ford Windstar. By massive, the dog's head went to the windows and when his head was at the back bumper, his hind legs were still at the driver's door.
I was at the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago.  I walked up to the cuttlefish tank, and for some reason all 20 or so of the cuttlefish rushed over to me.  It was a big tank, maybe 10 feet long.  I walked the length of it, and they followed me.  I walked back, and they followed.  A few other people saw and tried it themselves.But alas, the cuttlefish only had eyes for me.My best guess as to the cause was that the guy who feeds them is my doppelganger.  
A chameleon escaped from a bag when my friend was giving it to me and it leapt into a big pile of snow. I looked around for it for a while but couldn't find it so I gave up. Several weeks later the snow all melted and I was out there and found the lizard partially frozen to the ground. I peeled him off and put it in one of those little plastic tanks and sat it by the radiator in my house. Within an hour or two the lizard was hopping around the cage like nothing ever happened. It lived for several years after that, and was known to my friend and I as Jesus the resurrection lizard. 
One day I was looking out the window of my office and four semi trucks drove past one after each other.  They were in order Costco, Cosco, Cisco, Sysco.  Half the people I mention it to don't care and the other half don't believe me.
I was snorkeling in Hawaii once, and I swear I saw something that looked like a clear chameleon, but as soon as I got close it buried itself in the sand. I still vividly remember discovering a new species. 
When I was around 10 years old I went down to a lake when I was on holiday. When I get down there I vividly remember a massive ball of lightning just hovering and then it struck the middle of the lake. I never ran so fast in my life back to the litte house we were staying in. 
As a child I touched some weird pest plant in our garden, I think it stung me. Then I saw everything in inverted colors for short time. And then back to normal. I was in such a shock, I couldn't explain it to my mom. I just went to her crying. 
I once saw a man in an Abraham Lincoln costume complete with top hat running for what seemed like his life along the street. I slowed down and when he turned to look at me he was missing an eye. I drove off and of course no one believes me.
My bathroom had a towel holder thing, which was a fastened bar parallel to the wall. It had started coming out of one of the holders and one day I accidentally pulled too hard on it. It came flying off and landed in a clatter, but I couldn't find it.Mind you, this was a small bathroom, maybe fifteen feet by six feet in area and the counter and cabinets are seamlessly fastened to the wall. I checked in the bath, behind the toilet, under the towers -- nowhere.To this day, I have no idea what the fuck happened to it.
I slipped on icy stairs last winter and swear I saw my own butt crack as I fell. No one believes me.
When I was at my family's cabin when I was like, 10, and It was the middle of the night, but me and some of my friends were just dicking around outside. Then, I swear we saw a blue flame on the water. Not just a light, it was actually fire.
My friend and I were watching basketball in the early days that Charles Barkley was a panelist. He was apologizing for calling a team "midgets" and saying that he now knew it was offensive. But as they were going to commercial, we both heard him say over a hot mic "Besides, they shouldn't hate me, they should hate God."My friend and I were amazed, and convinced he would be fired. But not only did we never hear about it again, the clip doesn't even exist online anywhere. It's as though we had a double delusion. 
A fat squirrel in a tree threw a piece of fried chicken at me. 
A monkey jumping from car to car on a busy street. I could probably draw a sketch of it even though this happened about 5 years ago. Definitely one of the most odd things I saw. Unfortunately everyone thinks I am telling a bad joke when I explain what I saw, or they just nod it off and continue not giving a fuck.
One time when I was really young, maybe like 10 years old, I came home after school and was making myself a salami sandwich.  I pulled the bag of salami out and took out two slices. I smacked the two slices together, and suddenly they became one. I tried my hardest to separate them, but there was no seam or anything that I could split them up with. I even showed it to my mom but not a single person believed me when I told them. I had fused two pieces of salami together.
I'm in line at a cafeteria.  The guy in front of me is holding a pudding cup.  Someone walking by stumbles and falls into pudding cup guy, knocking his pudding cup out of his hand.  While everyone is looking at stumbling guy, the pudding cup goes a good two feet straight up in the air.  Pudding cup guy is totally focused and at the last second turns and catches the pudding cup behind his back.  He looks at me, smiles and that was that.  No one else saw it.
When I was about twelve, I was riding in the backseat of the family car. I looked over and the car next to me had three people sitting in the front (this was in the 1980s) and it was a man, woman and man. In that order. At the stop light, the woman leaned down and the two men leaned in and started making out.This was the first time I had seen anything like this. I was so dumbfounded, I couldn't even tell my family.
I saw a bunch of crows, around 20+, gather around in a circle. I was like wtf and took a closer look to see 3 other crows in the middle of the circle, all on their backs. And some crows from the circle would hop in and try to peck at the 3 crows, while they cawed and tried to defend themselves with their feet. I know crows are smart and all but didn't expect this level of social behavior. It went on for a while before a kid ran in and scattered them all. 
While I was playing poker with a few friends, I was dealing and somehow managed to deal a royal flush on the board, giving every person a royal flush. This was well into our game and the cards were definitely well shuffled, and don't forget I'd also placed the burn cards down. The odds of this are so astronomical that, apart from the friends I was playing with, no one would believe it happened and would assume I'm just a liar. 
Years ago, when my mom was pregnant with me she saw a monkey in the tree outside her house. She went to tell everyone but no one believed her, "Sure, pregnant lady."But sure enough the news that night had a story about Zoo break out.
I was at the airport and saw a businessman with a carry on wheely bag get off the escalator.  He turned the corner, broke into a sprint carrying the bag by it's small strap handle on top.  He swung the bag forward and let go of the strap handle. While it was in mid-air he grabbed the currently unextended extending handle, pressed the button and on the back swing extended the handle and landed it on its wheels and continued sprinting, all without breaking stride.
I saw Tom Jones in a back street in Santiago, Chile, going in the back door if a club.
When I was 5 I liked to mix various liquids... playing chemistry, I guess.  My grandma let me play with all her bathroom stuff.  I mixed her shampoos and creams and cleaning products, etc.  (I just realize now this might have been dangerous if I had mixed ammonia and bleach, for example). I swear I created a white liquid that produced a single black bubble that would come to the surface and pop at a regular interval.  No one believes me, or maybe no one cares.  I guess it's not that cool. 
A cat impaling a roasted chicken on a fence and eating it while on said fence!
I saw my neighbor walking down the road in a red party dress around 3am.  I wasn't fucked up or on anything.  He denies it and the rest of the neighborhood thinks I'm making it up.  I saw you Tim.  You and I both know.
I was at my mom's side when she passed away.  I swear, seconds before she departed, I heard her and my grandmother (who had died in the 80s) behind me.  Mom said "I really look awful," and Grandma said "It's time to go."  I turned around but the sun was coming in through the window so a little bright.  It was at that very moment that mom passed away.
I don't believe in Alien invaders. I'm sure there's life on other planets, seems ridiculous that we'd be completely alone, but I'd imagine you couldn't keep a visit from interplanetary species a secret.That said, I swear to god I saw a tall thin, long armed, long legged thing walk from one wheat field across the road, in front of my car and over into the other. I thought my eyes were just playing tricks on me so I didn't say anything for a second but the. My friend in the seat next to me said '...wait... did you see something just now?.'No idea what it was but I saw.... something.
A man dressed as a confederate soldier walking down my street as I was heading home from work. There was a school bus coming and he stopped on the other side of the road, as if to let the bus pass before crossing, and I stopped at the stop sign. We looked at each other, the bus passed, and then he was gone. 
I saw Jon Voight outside the Baskin Robbins in colonial Williamsburg in 2010 or 2011... I swear it was him, I said it to my friend who was next to me and she didn't know who he was (we were students at William and Mary at the time). He must have overheard cause he come over and stood near me and said nothing waiting for me to ask if it was him... but I chickened out. JON VOIGHT, if you see this, WAS IT YOU?!
This happened when I was around 4. I was sitting on my grandparents' porch alone. There was a little piece of rubber sitting on the floor (imagine a rubber circle that had been cut in half). I was completely sure that I had seen it stand  up and walk away. I started screaming and crying, completely inconsolable. I remember this so vividly but no one else was there to see it. 
Once when I was a teenager I was watching a movie by myself. The tv room then had two chairs separated by a couch. I was on the chair to the right, and at one point I laughed really hard at the movie. I heard someone else laugh and saw what seemed to be a girl my age double over in laughter in the other chair. The weird thing is it didn't startle me; it just felt nice to share laughter. Then I realized that I was alone in the whole house and the chair was empty. So I turned off the tv and went outside lol. 
A giant. This guys feet were as long as a pillow, and his hands made a newspaper look small. My friends think I exaggerated how large he was. I don't. 
I was watching a football game a couple of years ago, and in one of the shots where they panned over the crowd I saw a girl look straight at the camera and mouth my name. Scared the shit out of me, but when I rewinded it the seat was actually fucking empty. Maybe I just need to find someone to fill that seat.
I lived in an income based apartment complex and I watched a kid take a shit behind a tree next to his apartment building and then step in it. 
I was riding in the back seat of a friend's car one night. I looked over to the side of the road and saw a dog. It's body looked something like an English bulldog. As we got closer, I could see that it had a human face. That freaked me out a little bit. 
One night I was sleeping at my grandparents place. I woke up around 3am needing to pee. I raised my head slightly and looked at the base of the mattress I was lying on and saw a gown just floating there near the wall at the height it would be if a person was wearing it. I froze for a couple of seconds before quickly rushing to get my phone to shine the light on it. By the time I did there was nothing there. Safe to say I was scared out of my mind when I finally worked up the courage to get up to pee. 
Growing up, we had a door in the lounge with that glass in that distorts whatever is behind it. This looked into the hallway where the stairs were. My family and cat were in the lounge, leaving the rest of the house empty, but we all saw someone walk down the stairs, but no noise. (We had no carpet on the stairs, just wooden steps and they were creaky as hell). So weird. 
When my Grandfather died (god bless his soul) my 12 year old self was quite upset.  I asked my dad for two dimes, I know it's odd. I put one in his breast coat pocket and held one myself. Years later my whole family has been finding dimes everywhere in random spots. They attributed this to "Grandpa looking over us" kind of turned into a thing. On that token, my dad forgot about the double dime I requested at gramps funeral, I brought up what happened at family dinner recently and they think I made it up. I hope they have reddit. 
My girlfriend insists she saw five deer sized rabbits running in formation on a weekly basis. The truth is out there 
Snoop Dogg on Chatroulette. It was only for a second but I'm convinced it was him.
I remember hearing that dying animals sometimes go to places they never normally went before before they died.
They call the Magical Bum homeless. What they don't know? The world is his home.
He probably realized what it was and didn't want to get taken to crow court.
Your dog was probably thinking "hmm... I didn't think I'd get this far"
Something similar happened to me. I was 5-6 and was playing outside with other kids. All of a sudden, those two cars stop by a sidewalk, they grab a girl on a tricycle and speed off. Only her bike was left. We ran to my mom to tell her someone got kidnapped. She was cooking, somewhat listened, nodded her head, smiled, "Oh, really?" and that was it. I think about it often. 
could have been the colour of your shirt as well.i work at an aquarium, and as someone who wears the uniform, animals get thrilled at the sight of me often, just because of my shirt colour.
Ball lightning lasts that long? I always assumed it just kinda came down from the sky and burst. 
Are you sure it was a chameleon? They don't really hop/jump. And they don't have sticky hands so it wouldn't have been able to climb around in a plastic tank 
And behind them was Sisqo's tour bus.
You need to name it, man
I saw the same thing! I told my dad and he looked at me like I was crazy :(
Our house was struck by lightening one night and my mom says she saw a hovering ball of lightning. Apparently it's something that can happen.
Ball lightning
You probably touched a Brugmansia. They are loaded with scopolamine and can cause you to see things that are not there. Inverse colors are a common hallucination from them. Brugmansia are a very common garden flower, despite their effects, because only small children will be effected by contact alone. Did you have big orange flowers that hang downwards in your garden?
You should have caught him. They evolve into Radicate when they level up.
My dad used to work in construction and built a lot of stuff around our house. He used this thing to mark long lines, it was like a tape measure made of string, covered in blue chalk. Bright, royal blue chalk. Maybe the mouse got into something like that? (Might have been why it was hauling ass too, it fell into that and got trapped or stuck, yall moved a board and it ran?)
Wait what do you mean exactly? Like you fell in such a way that your pants slipped down and your back twisted over? Or you like, saw a vision of your buttcrack appear before you?
Best post in this entire thread. I believe you. 
Could have been a Will-O'-Wisp especially if it was over a lake. The theory is certain gases like methane and phosphine are either ignited by lightning or chemically react and release light creating what looks like a floating light.
Kangaroo's do have a tendency to escape from travelling circuses. That's the only real explanation I can gather
I was walking to class and passed by a trashcan with a domed lid. On top was a bottom piece of a bun. As was walking by it, a squirrel came out of the trash can and put a Chick-fil-A chicken on top of the bun, then went back inside the trashcan. I assume it was to get the top bun. I really wish I took a photo of it.Another instance was a squirrel with a cigarette butt in its mouth.
My mom used to see her dead sister standing at the end of her bed watching her for years after she killed herself. It was always peaceful and tranquil, she says. She liked seeing her. But then one night it just didn't feel right. My mom got scared and shouted for her to go away. She never came back after that. 
The power to fuse and manipulate deli meats. Looks like X-Men is real and you are the Magneto of our reality.
You probably just smacked them together so hard one went flying and you didn't realize. I bet it's still stuck to the back of your head or something. 
At Wendy's about a year ago, I tipped my tray too far one direction and my soda fell off the end and did a full flip as it fell towards the ground. I reached down and caught it upright just before it hit the ground. I immediately looked up to see if any other customers saw it. Everyone was just looking at their phones, food or the people they were with. I was just about to get upset that no one saw when this little old lady in the back of the dining area stood up and shouted "I saw it! I saw that! Good job!". That was a good day.
How did they rule it as a drowning if they didn't find a body? 
We (people in southern Appalachia) call that a Crow Court. I've seen it happen too, just with one in the middle. While it definitely does happen, apparently no-one knows why. We all know that corvids are crazy smart, so I think the idea of a Crow Court isn't far off. Maybe the crows in the middle did something to endanger the Murder, or they're sick or something. Either way it really is surreal
I read this as cows at first and was seriously impressed.
crow fight club?1st rule of crow fight club = caw caw motherfucker
So you're saying you witnessed a murder of crows?
That is neat. I can't come close, but, in around 2001 I was playing online poker (hold 'em) on dialup. I'd been dealt AK suited, played it moderate cool, then the flop came up giving me an instant royal flush. Immediately my connection dropped, and by the time I got back online I'd been timed out and we were on the next hand. It took all I could muster to not put my monitor through.That was the end of online poker for me, but over the last sixteen years of casual kitchen table games I've never seen it since.
You obvious that you did not see any old businessman, but THE businessman from which all other businessmen are born.
I feel so sorry for you, my brother and sister taunted me for 'imagining' a baby raccoon when it was probably just a grey squirrel climbing down the tree right in front of our house. I called them back and smugly watched as another baby raccoon came, and another, and then 6 baby raccoons were snuffling around in our backyard with their huge fat parent staring at us for a bit and then they walked away after like 10 minutes.
Perhaps someone's pet escaped?
Going by the way it was moving I'd say experimental air craft or teenage aliens doing their version of donuts around the locals.
It's not unusual.
Investigate this! Surely theres a science subreddit who can explain? 
That's fucking Metal. 
Yeah, sorry about that, I was pretty hammered so I had to take breaks every few minutes of flying. Thanks for not running over me or something.
What the fuck Steve? You said you wouldn't tell...
Chills so hard wow
Well according to wikipedia one of the only two places they were naturally reintroduced was Zion national park, so I believe you. 
Some skinny, tall farmers feelings are hurt by this. *I'm not an alien guys!*
Slenderman?
All the atoms lined up perfectly and fell into the floor
Is your ashtray by any chance actually a guitar pick?
Did you recheck the top of your cupboard? I bet it's there and maybe you dreamed or hallucinated dropping it. It's worth a shot.
Just a heads up... if no one in your house smokes, putting an ashtray full of ash in your kitchen is the worst idea ever.  the non smokers 100% smell that.  Hate to break it to you, but you smoking is no secret in that house.
Are you in North Kansas city? Theres a guy in my girlfriends neighborhood that dresses up in a civil war uniform 3 or so times a week and walks his dogs. We finally saw him walk past her house the other day. Very strange, we even Googled to see if there were any reenactments near by but found nothing. He's a doctor of some sort so I suppose he just has a passion or heavy interest in that sort of thing and has the money to make or buy those uniforms.
So what does a Sprite look like?
Omg please get a picture of this squirrel!
What's the CIA blue space program?
My husband and I each saw strange aircraft while living in New Mexico (though we were both alone each time and the things we saw were not similar).What I saw was silver-ish, very narrow and hovered a hundred feet above ground; what he saw was bit higher, moved at high speeds and insanely sharp angles.Neither of us have seen anything like it before or since, have since moved away and the topic doesn't come up much. But once you mention "New Mexico", everyone thinks it's a joke anyway.
Insect?
That could've been the start to a real touching Rom-com or maybe even a drama, but you fucked it up.  
That was you from a different universe. Only the alternate you sat to the left. 
There's nothing like the laughter of a child.At 3 am.When you don't have kids.
That went to fucking terrifying to fucking beautiful real quick lol
Sounds like ball lightning
> about 9/10Damn you must be very good looking.
I've had similar experiences of this too, only with smells. My gran used to wear this cheap perfume that can only be described as old lady perfume. She was the only person I knew who wore it.                   I have moved house a lot since her passing, but every time we get moved in and semi-settled the smell of that perfume comes drifting through the house, my partner also smells it but he never knew my gran. I like to think she's just checking the place out and tutting to herself.
Here in Japan there is an urban legend about human-faced dogs called "Jinmenken". They are said to appear running along highways at night and have the ability to talk.
This one I can imagine is legit. Just not real. I used to get very real hallucinations right as I was waking up. 99.9% of the time it was seeing a spider or spiders climb up a wall or across the ceiling. Like, huge spiders. Sometimes bigger than could ever exist in nature. I used to go literally flying out of the bed, scared outta my mind (huge arachnophobe). But then one day I stared at one, too afraid to move, and it slowly faded away as it crawled. Still happens once in a while now- I just ignore it until it goes away. Anyway, it seems very similar to what you described.
My cat went to our neighbour's flowerbed. He was a roamer, so I can imagine that he'd been there before, but I remember him hiding under our rhubarb plant and meowing sadly a few hours before that. Poor baby.
I will defend any dog in crow court, I'm very educated in _bird law_
I once wore a maroon shirt to a zoo whose uniforms were maroon. I attracted the animals everywhere I went. This is probably the right answer.
I just googled it and you're right, not a chameleon. I think it was an Anole. 
I think humans reserved that name a while back. 
In Hawaii? 
Yeah, its called ball lightning. It can pass through windows, and is SCARY SHIT.
Brugmansia are terrifying! Not two days ago I read a "trip report" about some dude who took Brugmansia tea he made out of TWO LEAVES *AND* TWO FLOWERS (one leaf per 32oz+ of water is MORE than enough), and the guy ended up crashing knee-first through a plate glass window and then ripped the back door to his house off its hinges with his own two hands. Shit is terrifying.
And it was a Shiny, too! What a missed opportunity.
That's a chalk line. Sounds better than someone catching him and spray painting him which is what I first thought. 
Sounds like a skinwalker. People see them here in northern AZ. Never seen one but I think one came by my grandmas house one night when were spending the summer with her. Dogs went crazy outside and then all of a sudden went quiet. Then the smell of rotting flesh came in through the open windows. Me and my older brother were playing video games and were the only ones awake. Just remember my brother jump up, turn off all the lights, TV and GameCube and drag me to the bed and told me to be quiet and not move. Like he knew what was happening. Scariest experience of my life. 
His buttcrack flashed before his eyes.
I have just spent twenty minutes trying to understand what way he flexed in order to see his buttcrack, by twisting up a teddy bear. 
I have a cousin who lives in Kentucky that has a petting zoo.  She has a kangaroo, an alpaca, a camel, and various other animals you'd not normally see in Kentucky.  She's brought the kangaroo with her to family reunions a couple of times.
I think this is still possible occasionally? I remember last year when WWE broadcast from the UK someone picked up the raw feed and streamed it live online and you could sometimes hear the commentators during commercial breaks. It's fun to watch. 
The real question here is who threw away a whole Chik-fil-A sandwich?
Join the club. We've had a cougar in our backyard on several occasions and it has been seen around the other houses outside of town. People have pictures of the tracks but the DNR constantly says it's "just a big coyote". There have been a handful of farm animals mauled in the area. This is in central Wisconsin so it's not unlikely that it's actually a cougar. 
He sleight-of-handed himself
He was fishing with mates. They saw him go overboard. 
Crow mob justice 
So Bird Law is real
> the flop came up giving me an instant royal flush. Immediately my connection droppedThis just sounds deliberate on someone's part.
And his profession? Business.
There's also lots of small, barely-regulated zoos in Appalachia. It's far from certain that they'd report something like that.
As long as it's preceded by 7 What's New Pussycats
They will need the year this happened to research known substances available at the time, possibly any name brands and any measurements OP might recall.
There's a *LOT* more to the story of that day, this is just a quick summary of the last minute or so.  It was very very very surreal.  I have no idea if my brain was forcing me to see things a certain way or if it was very supernatural.  
LOL, and of course it's the guitar pick you juuuuuuuuuuuust bought.
Yes. Also the kitchen was recently redone and it still never turned up. 
I wasn't walking about 2 blocks from my house to 711 one night when a very low helicopter shone its light on me like that. A voice over the loudspeaker told me to get back inside immediately. I guess they were looking for someone dangerous. 
Or at least photoshop a squirrels head in a buff kangaroo with a buffalo wing.
> Neither of us have seen anything like it before or since, have since moved away and the topic doesn't come up much. But once you mention "New Mexico", everyone thinks it's a joke anyway.I don't think New Mexico has aliens, but it is where they developed the Atomic Bomb and there's still tons of rocket scientists and military people out there. Who knows what's going on at Los Alamos. 
More like a horror. OP wouldn't be living to tell this story if he decided to fuck with whatever freaky ghost bitch decided to join him. He did the right thing. 
HOW DO YOU NOT SPEAK OF IT?! Seriously, so often people experience something strange  and then say they never spoke of it again. If that was me I would still be talking about it to this day trying to figure out what happened. I mean how can you never mention the time an exact copy of you was mistaken to be you by your own parents and then vanished into thin air while nobody was looking? 
>When I was a little kidYou are now on a list.
LPT: when going to the zoo, where the same color shirt as the staff uniforms
/r/unexpecteddad
Ball lighting chasing some teenagers through some woods could make a good low budget movie.
Well, I think you just discouraged a lot people from experimenting with it.
I too have seen a coyote man. I was driving in my home town, which is a tiny little farm town, with my best friend. We were driving through a stretch of road that we call "the tunnel of trees" because the trees close above the road and it is very dark. At the end of the tunnel on the corner of a dirt road stood a humanoid creature on its hind legs. It had a coyote type face and it's front legs were bent in front of it very unnaturally. We both saw it and could describe it perfectly. We didn't talk about it for years. I've seen a lot of other coyote related terrors near my home. 
Did you ever ask him if he actually know what was happening? Or was it just in case it was your granma coming to tell you guys to go to bed? 
I think it just depends on whether the feed is scrambled. Most of it is these days :(
I did that once. It was a stressful day and I just wanted to enjoy a spicy Chicken sandwich. The bag broke which ruined the fries I was really looking forward to so I was already pretty upset. Then the first bite into the sandwich was that weird chewy feeling where maybe there's a tendon or something* that your teeth can't bite through and it grossed me out so I quit and gave up on the treat I bought myself. Just wanted to vent about that
From northwestern Iowa. We get a cougar every couple years wandering through neighborhoods. Last one they killed in front of a school bus. 
No, I wonder if that was Toby's choice going for 156 takes just to do it. Raimi: "Okay, we have the shot... We'll just add in the things later in post--" Toby: "No! I have a better idea! Let's just keep doing it until I get it for real! I wanna *be* spiderman!" 
I looked over and watched a guy rub his girlfriends back while she threw up all over one time
At the end of the day, you win some, I win some.I think I've made myself perfectly redundant.
LOL THE LADY "does anyone wanna go....break this up"
Holy shit. The one just continuously pecking the other in the head. Don't fuck with crows man.
Holy crap that's actually pretty scary. I wonder what he did? 
Started watching that because I was curious about crow combat. I can't say that I know a lot about bird "fighting styles," but in-species fighting is so different. I was expecting a lot of foot-biting, and some eye-pecking, but not at all for one to hold the "sentenced" bird down by the neck and bite it. Or for an attacker to use their feet to hold the other's feet down.Regardless, I couldn't make it through the video. Little too intense for me. I need to go hold my parrot.
Or perhaps 3 What's New Pussycats, and it's just a really long song.
Where do you guys live? I want to make sure I never go there.
Goddamnit I don't know what I expected 
Do we really have to assume that all ghosts are murdering assholes? Why cant they just be chilling watching game of thrones with us once in a while.
I know right? Not even to try to figure it out or anything, just to have a cool story to tell. I wish I had weird/cool life events like that to tell others. My go-to "interesting story" I tell others is about the time I tripped while running down the stairs and sprained my ankle for a week. I would trade my sprained ankle story for freaky doppelganger story in a heartbeat. 
Why is this not a thing
Yeah. He knew. I was young and didn't know much about them. Just knew I should be afraid of them. Smell of rotting meat can be a sign that one is near. He knew this and reacted. The smell lingered for about ten mins then went away. Followed by dogs barking like crazy again. 
You appear to have a tenuous grasp of the English language 
My mom always tells me that when I was born she thought I was abducted by aliens.
Maybe he went overboard, got amnesia from the lack of oxygen and forgot who he was, and then hitch hiked or died out of sight. 
I'm so sorry for your loss. That was really beautiful.
Gonads and strife...
Or faked his own death and took on a new identity to start a new life?
Was he part of operation treadstone?
Several years ago, my cousin went in for a tattoo at the shop from 'Inked'. The one in Vegas. It was an 'off' filming day, so NONE of the artists from the show were in. He got his tattoo started, and they asked him to come back in a few weeks when it was healed up to schedule an appointment to finish it. When he showed up, filming for the season was finished. The shop was closed, cleaned out, and the space was for sale.
I was on Jerry Springer. The episode never aired but the entire thing was fake. They even asked me to find friends to complete the storyline of a double love triangle. Coolest part of it all was when they literally asked me if I wanted a fake doctors note or a fake death certificate made out in a fake family members name in order to get me out of work. They literally had a guy on staff whos only job was to get people out of work so they could attend filming.
I was on set for a filming go Ghost Hunters in Buffalo. On the show, they are "investigating" an upper level of the Buffalo Central Terminal when they hear a "disembodied" voice say "Get out!"It was the property manager on a lower level yelling at some homeless people to clear out. Everyone knew it was him, but it somehow made it in the show as an "unexplained" event.
I was on "this morning" when I was about 7 and they did a big makeover for me and my siblings. The premise they created was that we were a nightmare and my poor mum  just  wanted  us to look smart for an upcoming christening. The main part I remember was them telling us to jump in the mud and shout no when our mum asked us to stop. Normally we wouldn't have dared so I remember that being fun! Oh and my sister ruined her hair three times before going on stage so they made us hold her hands so she couldn't touch it. 
In Holland there was a Dutch version of pimp my ride, a player of a football team we played against had his car ''pimped'' the car didnt even make it home, he had to call the car repair service on his way back from the studio...
My cousin was involved in filming for the bachelor (not a contestant) and said they film many scenes in several different ways. For example they might film them cuddling while walking and then walking while looking annoyed and so on. Not that fake but yeah... 
My mate was on "tattoo fixers" if you don't know what it is, basically they get people in with tattoos they regret and make a design they don't tell them about, tattoo it on and cover the old one up and "surprise" them at the end. He filmed the "big surprise reveal" like 5 times because he wasn't surprised enough. 
I was on a European version of "Survivor" where we went to an island and had to survive for 2 weeks.Whatever was seen on camera was what actually happening. The only fake thing is that we got some food to maintain a somewhat healthy diet.
My uncle was on Pawn Stars attempting to sell something. The item wasn't even his. He knew a guy who worked on the show.
I was on "Cops". It's pretty real.
My brother was on Xfactor UK. There are several rounds before the televised rounds, so all those rubbish acts you see on TV have been picked by producers to go through.I've also been in the audience of The Voice and Xfactor and they make you do loads of fake cheering, dancing and clapping before the show starts so they can cut it in to the actual show. 90% of the cheering you see/hear on the televised shows have been added in post production.
A guy did an AMA about being on Pimp My Ride. Everything done to the car was cosmetic. I believe his car didn't run before the show and didn't run after. Basically, a polished turd. 
I was on Stan Lee's Superhumans. Long shoot day at the high altitude chamber I worked at. They brought a guy who had climbed Mt. Everest a bunch of times without supplemental oxygen (29,000 ft) so we brought him to the same altitude in the chamber with some "westerners" to compare against. He asked for oxygen after 15 minutes, and after 30 they asked me to pretend to pass out. Looking back at what aired it's obvious to me I was faking. The way they edited the show, he does "win" the competition.     Season 2. "Spider Man" is the episode title.     Edit four speling
I had a cousin on the new Chris Hansen. I wish that was fake, it's not :/
Never been to the Pawn Stars store but one of my customers told be about going there.This must have been 4 years ago, they said they had to wait in line to go into the store, and they all pitched in $100 to have Chumlee come out from the back room.
A family aquantience had a house built for their disabled adopted kids from Extreme Home Makeover. I think Ty was a dick, but they were just so grateful to have the house that they didn't dwell on the negative aspects
Obligatory not me but my cousin: She was on Hell's Kitchen and said that they would film for over 10 hours on a day, then would go to sleep around 11pm only to get woken up at 2am to film again to make them more irritable. The producers would purposely bring up topics to create drama within the chefs. They re-tapped when they answered the door in the beginning a couple times to make them seem "more surprised." They portrayed my cousin as the "classic hot blonde". It was certainly more of a reality TV show then a cooking show...
I went into the Pawn Stars shop when I was in Las Vegas. They have a line on the side walk to get in, bouncers at the door, and none of the cast in the store. The place is pretty much packed all the time, so my guess is that if someone brings an really interesting item in, then employees have them come back in a week and clear out the store for filming. Either that, or none of the items are actually from real customers.
I had a friend who auditioned for The Voice on the second season I think? He has a beautiful voice but was told his "look" wasn't right for the show. Always thought that was pretty stupid.
Has anyone been on Impractical Jokers? How 'real' is it? Especially in the later seasons - since theyve become quite popular dont people recognise them on the street while they are doing various challenges?
I wonder if supernanny is fake? I know kids are good at acting but still...
Does anyone have an experience on the show Naked and Afraid? Something tells me that show is bs
That seems somewhat fraudulent...
My sister was asked to go on jerry springer by a coworker, but she declined. It was the episode where a man was dating a woman who turned out to be transgender. Not sure what my sister's role was supposed to be. 
My favorite is the episode (no idea which of the ghost shows it was) where they hear this wheeze. Most of the show was them freaking out about them. Come to find out it's a really fat cat just chilling on a bed upstairs with a breathing problem. It was pretty funny.
The first 10-15 minutes of those ghost shows, where they go through the history of the place, can be legitimately interesting though.
It's a running joke amongst friends that if you see a white guy driving a yellow taxi in Manhattan, be ready for Cash Cab. 
It would have been soop awkward if you lost just as he had gotten onto the fdr or west side into stopped traffic. Oh you lost well i cant let you out here or i would be at fault if a real taxi killed you. *sits in silence for the next 20 minutes*
Wow, that's fucked up lol. That almost feels illegal
I mean, if they're making you do things that you wouldn't do normally, that's literally fiction...
I tried out for Canadian Idol. Reading the contract they made us sign, it literally stated that the producers could override the  fan votes if needed to make sure the person they wanted to win, would win. So yeah. I still tried out. I was not the next Canadian Idol. 
"And everyone voted so hard that the palace caught fire and burned down."
Fuck me, that sounds like it sucks balls. 
I heard that because of mounting complaints and a couple lawsuits they had to change the way they conduct the show. Now they have to do a proper job of the make over and show the transformation in 60 minutes. Not sure how true that is though
"...we already agreed what it would look like after its done.""I know but at least act more surprised!"
Did he discuss what it was he wanted with them prior to filming? Because I always thought it was strange they'd make a decision as big as their next tattoo completely on the fly like that.
Out of all of them it doesn't surprise me one bit to hear that 16 and pregnant is the only one that has enough real ridiculous drama that they don't need to fabricate things.
I have no clue how people love his show so much... my gf is obsessed. And I'm like wtf it's so fake it's ridiclious. 
I was born in Henry County, VA and lived there until I was 8, and my sister is 40 and has lived there her whole life. Shining like that actually happens, but not nearly to the scale that it was shown. My sister's ex did have a cold water creek still and made illegal shine (albeit in Patrick County). Now I live in east TN, and everything here is legal. 
> profiteer rolls.That is an excellently accurate typo.
The CC prob cooks nothing ever, he prob puts his name on it even though a line cook made it
Fuckin Aristos
Can confirm, Survivor is some real shit. I had a lecturer who used to be part of the medic team. People got hurt pretty often, although it was usually the crew, since there's a lot more of them. But exhaustion was a big part of the cast's issues.He also watched a fellow cast member drown, while on an expedition/day off on one of the islands. Those islands can be genuinely dangerous places.
> I was on a European version of "Survivor" where we went to an island and had to survive for 2 weeks.Koh Lanta?
This shows how fake these show are.  It's a show about pigs and they're using bullshit.
When the production leaves for the night, do the wives stay at the house alone with the husband? well i know most of the families had kids (if not all), but im just curious.
Everyone seems to know a guy.
Did he just tell the *guy* that he wanted to be on the show so they just gave him a random item the shop already owned? haha Or did he borrow an item from *another* guy he knew?
I always wondered if they got to keep the furniture and whatnot. Do any of them offer to pay extra to keep it or try to set a budget for them to spend on it off camera? 
I'm just sitting here in this alley smoking Meth and next thing I know this 7 foot tall gorilla of a man and a skinny dude holding a bright camera are yelling at me. I start running and next thing I know the gorilla is on top of me, I'm sweating and bleeding from my forehead.
My uncle was on Reno 911! and he said the whole thing was fake.
My friend was one of the rubbish acts. He knew he was awful, the producers knew he was awful. He was only putting on a character for a laugh. He got called back for the novelty "shit act ensemble" at the end of the season.Also, this is why so many people come out with shit like "I quit work to be here!" and are devastated when they don't go through, the fact that they've got through the untelevised rounds already has gotten their hopes up.
I've heard this. Apparently you only go through to the actual auditions if you're great or really terrible. And then they add a couple of average people to make it seem more normal. 
A close friend of mine made a trip up there to check out the shop.  They were filming that day.  Friend and his wife were approached and asked if they'd like to play along.  They were handed a comic and told to ask about something specific.  Basically, it was a filler spot so the guys can have a chance to talk about their extensive knowledge.  They ended up not being able to use the footage because my friend is a manager at WDW.  Disney owns Marvel, yadda yadda.
With David Dickinson? How much more mahogany is he in real life?
Even as a viewer, I've reacted to that. They do a lot of stuff that looks good, but they don't do anything to the bits that keeps it running and safe.
As a car person I ALWAYS wondered about this. Never seen them touch the mechanicals.
It took me quite a while to realize that they just turn broken cars into glorified "ricers".I only realized it when I actually learned of that term, I enjoyed the show when I was younger tho. The thought of 2 TVs at the back of the car hooked up to PS2s or XBoxes was amazing to me.
For interviews if you want to be absolutly sure they cant edit the footage without it not making sense at all, interject random stuff into each sentence that way even the most experienced editor cant mash words together.
Had a friend of a friend enter this show. The only way I found out was I was watching the show and saw her. She wore baggy camo clothes and cowboy boots like 100% of the time, no matter the occasion. They gave her new clothes and hair style. But about 2 weeks after the episode aired, I saw her with her Camo get-up shopping at Walmart. 
I love What Not To Wear, but I'm surprised they would pick you for wearing punk stuff at a concert. It seems like most of the people on the show aren't people who just have an alternative style, but wear clothes that are really poorly fit/unflattering, outdated and worn out, or especially inappropriate for their lifestyle and job (i.e. a 40 year old attorney wearing clubwear and flip flops to court).
"This girl is way too boring for tv we can't use her""Tell her it's because her clothes looked too good so she doesn't feel bad"Lol I'm joking but totally off topic I looked through your post history and it turns out we have the same auto immune disorder! Woo!..?
"Wait, wait, can we try that entrance again? I don't think I seemed surprised enough."
I've always wondered what they do with the Taco Bell and Wine Coolers after they arrest the perp. Shame to see a Crunchwrap Supreme go to waste. 
A month ago Reddit told that the show was filmed in a recreated studio, due to laws pertaining to the filming inside pawn shops. Anyone know the truth?
Never understood the point of this show. Why don't you sell your stuff on Internet? Or at least when they call someone to evaluate your product and after that they give you shitty deal, why don't you tell them to screw themselves and use what the expert tell you to sell it yourself?
My dad volunteered as a carpenter for Extreme Makeover Home Edition awhile back when they came to our area. He had the same story. They would film what they called "camera ready" volunteers for a bit during the day and then a crew would come in and do all the real work. He also said Ty was an absolute asshole who never left his trailor other than to shoot his couple segments and looked like he had never actually swung a hammer in his life. I was really bummed about it because they do such a good job of making him look good on the show. 
The neighbors must have LOOVVEED that going on all night
Is it allowed in the US to work overnight in a residential district?Thats not possible in Germany.
Extreme Makeover did a home for a family here in town and their property tax and insurance went up so much they ended up having to move out of the house.
> go to sleep around 11pm only to get woken up at 2am to film again to make them more irritableIs that why most looked dead inside?
Did your cousin get to meet Gordon Ramsay?
> When she got out of the limo, she was at the airport and they were sending her home after the first episode.Haha, fucking savage.
Wait. So on a scale of History Channel being 0 and NatGeo being 10, where is Animal Planet?
I mean how do you know he didn't learn it from the ferret? 
My favorite thing about Pimp my Ride was the fact that it took months to do up the cars, not a couple weeks like they say.
THANKS OSAMA
One of my highschool friends who is trans ended up doing a Springer show where they did this whole "I'm a man" reveal to their boyfriend. They had never met before.
My favorite for this is Destination Truth. The host is an archaeologist and part of the Adventurer's Club. He does another show on the travel channel now that's a little less outlandish in what's being investigated, but with both shows they go into pretty nice detail about the areas they're visiting and some of the customs of the local people.
Those orbs are just dust motes that are close to the camera lens and out of focus. 
Haha for realz. To avoid that pitfall, the producer gave us an address that avoided highways 
When you get into the cab, they give you a rundown on the rules, and you'd be free to say "no thanks" and not ride anywhere.  But it seems fun, so I'd do it.I'd be annoyed at being hungry though.  There's no reason they had to tell to eat less at lunch.
> I mean, if they're making you do things that you wouldn't do normally do, that's literally fiction...Nah, don't you know? It's "REALITY" tv!
Not sure if it's true, but I heard they have that clause more in case they need to, but it's not something they actually use.ie- they find out a contestant is a convicted rapist, they can just vote him off the show without worrying that a convicted rapist will win the grand prize. 
There is no escape from the Bill Wurtz memes.
There's a few times (never aired of course) where the person came home and went apeshit that their house had been violated and that everyone had to put it back how it was otherwise lawyers, etc..
Wouldn't surprise me. Lord knows if that happened to me, and I was unaware of it beforehand, I'd sue. I like my furniture thank you very much.
I dont know, the show got aired on ''veronica'' i forgot the name, it was a blue orange car.
"When I say 'Hello, Mr Thompson' and press down on your foot, you smile and nod."
Or they hated it.  
Are  you saying that all reality shows should have their characters replaced by pregnant 16 year olds?Survivor just got *way* more interesting
Yeah "made me watch..." My husband says he hates my shows and yet he always seems to come around when I watch, and asks questions... 
people like to look at nice houses I guess
The international version is just interesting  to watch, especially if you are planning to visit or ever think about moving there.  The Australian ones have essentially confirmed I will never retire there due to the stupidly high prices for real estate.  "Bob and George want a three bedroom house near the beach, their budget is $1.6 billion..."
It seems kinda strange now that I think about it, but I enjoy the tours of the homes and the before/after of the one they got. I skip through most of the reality stuff.
I was on my phone and couldn't be bothered googling. Took a punt on the auto-correct. Totally wrong.Better change it before this hits front page and my inbox gets flooded with corrections. 
A restaurant I used to work for catered live celebrity chef events. Several of them were winners of Top Chef or various Food Network cast members (not the big names, but members of the teams that swoop in to help). They would send our owner a signature  recipe in advance, he would show up with one of his chefs and while the Celebrity Chef was making one serving of their dish out on stage to demonstrate the two of them would bust ass and make a few hundred copies to serve to the audience once the demonstration was over. 
Booze seems to be key for many reality shows. 
I was watching some American survivor like show and one of the guys who initially scouted out the island got bit by an extremely poisonous snake and had his flesh on his leg destroyed. 
"I know a guy who's a specialist in Napoleonic-era French enema kits, lemme give him a call."
Best episode of cops was"I'll get you bitch"or that episode where that lady was so angry at her husband she takes out scissors and starts cutting everything in their house.  Even her hair.
I'm glad he knew, I always felt bad for the shit acts because I thought they all believed they were good when they were basically being asked back for the public humiliation.
thats weird that just because he works for a company hes considered property of disney.
Not always.  A few people got lucky enough to have some decently impressive engines installed 
They are *really* experts at preventing this kind of thing from happening. I have heard stories of people on big brother where the staff was trying to push them to trash talk on other people and they would ask the most horrid manipulative leading questions and when they tried to refuse, they held up their contract and threatened to sue them for not cooperating.
Haha I actually have a feeling that might have been how it went down. I assume most people put together their worst outfit for the interview but I still had some self respect so I put on something I'd actually wear. I think if I had a pic everyone would agree it looked alright -- just looked like a movie assassin outfit or something. Woot let our spines fuse together! Ha pun. AS power. 
I've actually thought about how funny it would be if they show the guy getting taken down after he walks out the front door, and then it cuts back to Hansen just unwrapping the happy meal the guy brought with him. 
I went there a couple years ago. There is the pawn shop where you could buy stuff like a normal pawn shop. Apparently, the Pawn "Stars" come out sometimes to interact with people, but not very often.  One of the workers told us there was another shop they did the actual filming at. 
Everybody that appears on Pawn Stars has to apply and have their inventory pre-examined for authenticity.  It's not like random people bring in that kind of stuff. They also pick people with stuff that isn't real, to try to make the show seem authentic.
Adam Carolla actually called him out as being a fake. Asked him questions a real carpenter should know. It didnt go well, Ty is a phony.
I've heard that Ty Pennington is a dick and a fraud probably a dozen times on Reddit over the past few years and now I hate his stupid mortgage commercials even more.
Oh yeah. Plus the family was fairly wealthy and totally didn't need to be rescued. Meanwhile my friend's dad's house was still flattened.
You can, but local noise ordinances apply. Of course you can do whatever you want if no one enforces the laws or you bribe the neighbors. 
To be fair the 30 Mexicans were probably picked up in a Home Depot parking lot and being paid cash. Rules tend to not apply.
I'm from.CA, Mexicans were the hardest working dudes Iv ever seen. Never complained, even the illegal ones. They would do any job, they just wanted to work. Never even took breaks when they put a new roof on my house, I went out and got them.all lunch they didn't even speak English. Respect for them.
As a chef I can tell you we are all dead inside
He's just a dog trying to make his way in the universe.
Probably about a 2. You sometimes get an actual documentary about animals, but for the most part it's Finding Bigfoot season 23 and Jackson Galaxy Cat Whisperer reruns
My favourite part was on the show they got all this cool stuff and then as soon as it's over they take a lot of the cool stuff back. 
Was it where she was dressed as a hula girl? I didn't see the whole episode just a clip, I have no idea why she was dressed like a hula girl. 
We are all dead on this blessed day
Josh Gates is definitely in my Top 5 People to Have a Beer With list
But what would dust be doing in a haunted house?!
So are you saying that the cooking show opportunity was false, and that they baited you into cash cab?And that they abandon people hungry and alone and remote as standard operating practice?
Also on the x factor you usually have to have a sob story 
You could make a religion out of Bill Wurtz memes.
Completely understandable 
That would be me, but if they smashed my old stuff, lawyers would be inbound regardless.
I always assumed that, even though it's a surprise to them on-screen, surely they're in on it for this exact reason AND they'll need to grant permission for the team to get into their house?
Like seriously, who the fuck thinks it's a good idea to redecorate and repaint a person's house without their knowledge or informed consent?I'd be fuckin pissed too, even if it was a quality job. 
It must be "De grote beurt", what a fucking shit show that was.
My husband is a tattooer and I've watched the show. Based on the information I have available to me, this is probably the correct answer 
Okay so we found exactly what you were looking for, and, it's under budget!"I know, it just doesn't feel right, you know babe? I mean, did you see the backyard? It was so, not us." 
Nah I like on Property Brothers where they have a wishlist that's for a 4million home and a $9 budget - then they show them their dream home like **psyche!!!** You can't afford this you broke fool - here's a rat infested shithole we can show you! 
Oh crap! The real estate market has crashed??! *drops smashed avo on toast*
The international ones are always explained simply as "American wants to move to the other side of the world and live in an exact copy of his old American home." Half of the episode is spent highlighting that American guy wants X but 90% of the homes in Y don't have X and American guy is not pleased, but oh my god, look we found one that does have X but it is also located in the middle of an alligator pond and there's no kitchen. Needless  to say, it's fun to watch. 
Sarah wants to live in an ancient Italian flat, in a charming village. She wants 4 bedrooms, 3 bath, two car garage, full washer and dryer mud room, and a fenced in backyard. 
See I'm kinda more okay with that IF the recipe was made by the CC. I dont think it will be very smart time wise to just have the CC cook for the whole audience
It's part of the Aussie food pyramid.
People used to do enemas for medical reasons a lot. Tobacco enemas were a thing in the past.
Nah, hands down it's gotta be that "I can break these cuffs" dude.I was on the edge of my seat when he tried to break those cuffs. Turns out he couldn't break those cuffs.
Wasn't there one guy who got a brand new car because his old one was Frankensteind from two or three different cars?
True, but when they did that, they didn't do all the things needed to run such an engine safely, such as stiffening the chassis, better brakes and so on.
\*Chris Hansen turns to the crew\* "Hey guys what do you want for lunch? I can message the next perv from the bait account and ask them to bring some fast food."
You know you've hit rock bottom as a tv personality when you start doing mortgage commercials. 
That's OK, it's probably half made out of cardboard!
Noise ordinances aren't enforced based on who's making noise.
We have the same situation in the UK with polish guys. Hardest working people, do such a good job, never complain. And a lot of people regardless still have the same bullshit attitude to them, that they're terrible scrounging immigrants. 
> I rather not say because it would be easy to find the episode that way, and I'm trying to remain anonymous on my accountFair enough.Thanks for sharing! Pretty interesting as I remember watching that show when I was much younger and assuming it must all be exaggerated so interesting to see "behind the scenes" to some degree.
Back when History and Discovery were still decent, Animal Planet was pretty good too.
What seriously
Speak for yourself!
He definitely seems like an awesome guy. I imagine just listening to him talk about his adventures would be fun.
then they film them for survivor NYC
No, don't 
Hey guys I just found this cool new religion. It's called Wurtzism and I think you should all try it.
Where's the reality show for this? I'd rather watch this.
Right? What are they expecting? That the person is so overjoyed they completely forgot about all the other things that have been in their daily lives for years?
Yeah, if youre gonna fake anything, fake the reactions. Tell them beforehand, have em sign a waiver, then have him fake surprise
It was so bad that it was amazing!
The people on that show, specifically that Sketch guy, are universally hated by the tattoo scene. He also steals designs from other artists. All sorts of controversy about him and this show. 
When the adverts come on I genuinely have a bad time telling what's the bad tattoo and what's the 'fixed' one
My husband is a tattooer (we're in Australia fwiw). The first thing he says any time this show is mentioned is what a piece of shit that sketch guy is. He has the privilege of probably being the most internationally despised person in tattooing 
The woman always need a place to "entertain guests" and the man always needs a "man cave." Or it's just "not authentically [insert current county] enough."
Will it have an open concept floor plan?
It's the one with no personal items in it. The other two are other people's houses. 
There's always that one person in the couple that seems to complain about every little thing. "MMMm yeah I dunno bout this caaarpet""Mmmnoot feeling this kiiitchen""Yeeeah this one doesn't have a ocean viewwww"
She also wants to live in the middle of the city but also wants it to be quiet and charming. Her budget is $12 and she also has a sack of potatoes. 
It *is* the Aussie food pyramid.
Thread went from 0 to 100 real fucking quickly.
That's brilliant. Did they do a few takes for the awkward handshake with Holly Willoughby? It looks like she expected it
I specifically remember one episode where they had something like sacks of potatoes in the back of their pickup so their shitty brakes would at least get a little bit of braking power (I'm not sure if that even helps or makes it worse tbh) and Pimp My Ride actually gave them a proper set of brakes and made a big deal out of it actually braking now.
>The show is hosted by the guy who writes Black Mirror.somehow, feels as though it could never have been any other way
I love the way Ty justified himself "Nevermind", "of course" like he only knew the answers after it was reveled.That's not how it works buddy 
I got 30s into it before I had to stop... it is sooo brutal. You can hear the disappointment and frustration in Adam's voice. Lol
Look at mr. fancy walls, using cardboard! I built my home out of toilet paper and used McDonalds straws!
Noise ordinances are also probably not enforced when all the houses are flattened in the area.
stereotypes don't help anyone. I worked with poles for years and like any group many were hard working, especially the younger ones. Then I'd go home to my house share with 5 of them, 3 were on benefits and two were incredibly violent alcoholics who I could hear drinking all day and often woke me up belching. They were both women. People are people.
Steve irwin's death also killed Animal Planet
In said AMA the dude talked about how for example he had a cool TV put into his car for the show and once his episode was over they took it back. It's kinda funny in the end 
"No said everyone"
Trading Spaces used to air the ones where people were pissed. You should look for the purple house episode.

If I got the opportunity to hug Holly Willoughby, I'd insist on at least a few takes. 
I'm surprised they didn't just install a sack of gold plated potatoes.
Well, it's Death grilling you, I'd be 100% ashamed as well 
Shoulda made it out of bidets and straws, uses much less natural resources.
I hope this is only "the stuff we did was not actually street legal so we have to take this out so you're allowed to drive your car" and not "well show's over, pack it up boys"...
"Tryyyyy iittttttt" he said again
That show was terrible.  It was like they were trying to play practical jokes on each other instead of making something nice.  I saw one where they spray painted someones couch.  
I have a 100+ year old piano that's been passed down through my family. I would commit felony assault at the very least if I came home and found it gone/smashed in a dumpster.

In highschool my girlfriend and I would always make out to The Godfather part 2. To this day I still haven't seen the full movie, and can't watch it without getting turned on.

I'll give you a real comment. Bite their lower lip gently when you go to open your mouths. Also, move your hands all around their body, rub their back, stroke their thigh, grab a handful of hair. Good stuff

First of all Rat, you never let on how much you like a girl. "Oh, Debbie. Hi." Two, you always call the shots. "Kiss me. You won't regret it." Now three, act like wherever you are, that's the place to be. "Isn't this great?" Four, when ordering food, you find out what she wants, then order for the both of you. It's a classy move. "Now, the lady will have the linguini and white clam sauce, and a Coke with no ice." And five, now this is the most important, Rat. When it comes down to making out, whenever possible, put on side one of Led Zeppelin IV.
People just love movies man. But I found that killing that awkward silence the moment before by just announcing that you're going in for the kiss works well. Saying it right comes off as confident

I'm baffled by how many people misread the thread title, myself included.
This is the most unintentionally funny thread I've ever seen. 
I think most of us read "movies" then came to the comments, realized it wasn't, but didn't care enough to switch mental gears.

So, make out with your mom?
When you came, did everything slow down, and in the flickering light from the screen, did you see 12 copies of your girlfriend's face, dodging each rope of jizz,  one by one, in a manner that didn't seem humanly possible?

Seriously what is up with this mass hallucination, it happened to me too
With joy and excitement, he posted his thread -  'I wonder what answers they'll give me?' he said.  'Perhaps some advice on the best way to start?  The finest of moves for the amorous art.'And so, with elation, he waited a while -  He opened his inbox and read with a smile.  Misguided. Mistaken. Misread and misquote.  He frowned with confusion. '*Not movies*,' he wrote.
Hmm.. never heard of that movie.

I'm going to sum up my stupidity by saying not only did I see "movies" in the title, but "movies" in everyone's comments and was confused as to what everyone didn't get...
Every question on askreddit for the next week about movies is going to have "not movies" comments in it.

A weapon to surpass mental gears!
I assure you that's a movie.
>Also, people generally do to you what they want done to them, so that can be a good starting point.Mind=blown. I'm going to start out with a playful slap and then tell her what a huge pervert she is. Thanks bud!
How can I tell if she wants me to make our with her? Or even just kiss her?I was so tempted to kiss my crush earlier, but I didn't know how she'd respond. 
I assure you, that's a... hey wait a minute.

I don't get why people keep upvoting OP for claiming these movies aren't movies.
Look for unusually long moments of silence where your just kind of staring into each other's eyes, sound cheesy I guess. Also keep an eye out for if she drops her gaze and glances at your lips.
You could gaze in her eyes for 5 minutes, and still not get the hint. So the sure move is to just put your hand on her in kissing position. You know, side of her face, or on her chin, or on the back of her head/upper neck. She will deny you instantly if she doesn't want it, if she doesn't do anything, then you can spring on her face. 
I've never laughed so hard at a thread before. Bad puns, not movies, famous poem accounts chiming in. People stalking OPThis should be a movie.
I don't get why people keep upvoting OP for ... oh, are we not doing this?

I like the description. A rope of jizz. Now imagine climbing that rope to the top of Mount Everest. Now imagine it breaking up in mid air because it's not really a rope, but jizz. Now see yourself dodging that jizz like Neo from the Matrix as if your life depended on it. Now imagine you are at home getting a blowjob while watching the movie the Matrix.

I work at a bar, I tried to take a spoon back from someone who was leaving, but he wouldn't let me have it. He kept insisting that someone had knighted him with it. Hope you got home ok spoon knight...
I got so drunk, that about an hour after the new year I jumped off the balcony, fell to another party and stayed there for a few hours before realising I don't know anyone.
Had to convince my friend not to jump in the pool because he thought "This water is 2016 water, I gotta jump before it becomes 2017 water!"It wasn't even a pool party.
clapping to the beat of a song, a drunk man from holland comes up to me and says I have great, powerful claps and we should clap our hands together in the form of a high five
Grandpa got very racist towards my black cat
My gf started puking, and between outbursts says "At least this is all good wine, it doesn't taste so bad coming up!"
ER Nurse.Guy came in complaining of scrotal pain. Stated he was at home, in his living room, high on coke and quite drunk, sitting on a bicycle when he slipped and caught his marble purse on the sharp pedal. He felt wetness and assuming it was blood wrapped his manhood in TP and ran to the ER. He got back to my room and finally found the courage to check the damage himself. Noticed it was just urine and he had peed his pants. Ran straight back out into the night without another word.Happy new year central Ohio. 
I told someone I was done drinking for the night because I'm a pussy and he gave me this real emotional speech about never putting myself down.
He kept praising the invention of balloons
I threw the lighter away instead of the firecracker...
A guy sat in the corner in tears because he didn't want 2013 to end.
There were a few singles at my New Year's Eve party. They were joking about just all kissing each other when my buddy offers to kiss all of them. When asked how he's going to accomplish it he manages to slur out the words "Midnight is a whole minute, and I'm a slut"
This lady was much drunker than everyone thought and no one realized until around 12:10am when her husband tried to get her to leave and she grabbed him by the throat and push him down some stairs. He got up, dusted himself off, and calmly walked out the front door. She attempted to sober up in the dining room while someone downloaded uber to her phone so she could get home.I felt bad for the guy, but secretly I was so happy to see he said F This and bounced completely. 
Friends friend passed out on the couch still wearing his ski gear, let's out a huge fart waking himself up. He turned to look at his ass simply asking "What?" While looking confused.
My friend started belting out the theme tune to an old British kids show called "poddington peas".Then he started crying, and said "when I was a kid there was an episode, about a fucking pea who was too fat to get out of his house - all the other peas tried to help him, but they couldn't get him out - I remember identifying with that pea - that pea was me!"He cheered up once we bought him a kebab
I ate a 8 piece family bucket of fried chicken and chugged a few beers. While walking home I  vomited in the middle of the sidewalk and basically laid down on top of a bush to recover. Some guy with his lady walked past and when he saw the scene I just heard him say "Jesus Fuck". 
The most drunk person at my party was my friend's sister who went missing half-way through the party...that is until everyone got a snapchat from her in the bathroom,on the toilet,singing the lyrics to "All-Star" by Smash Mouth. 
"STOP TELLING ME WHAT TO DO, I HAVE NEVER DIED BEFORE." a  friend who got kicked out of 2 clubs and wanted to keep drinking and partying. 
Him: "Can I use the food garage?"Me: "The what?"Him: "Oh, the oven."
My bestfriend went over to the keg to get some beer. He pumped the keg and preceded to spray beer all over his phone which he thought was a cup. I was so stunned I didn't say anything for like 10 seconds and when I did he looked at me like I was stupid then looked back at his phone and threw it across the room. 
She called her husband a sad fat dragon. He's really not sad or a dragon. 
We asked our friend how drunk he was, he responded, "twice."
I found my friend hiding a statue of a mermaid in the top of a toilet. His reason? it needed to be back in the ocean.
My friend told me he will donate my car to Kars For Kids if I vomit.
"I fucking love Kidz Bop." As Fetty Wap was playing on the speakers 
Sent a dick pic to his long time good friend instead of who he wanted it to go to.
I work in a casino and this random drunk lady poked me in the butthole last night as I walked by.Kinda made me uncomfortable.
Was on the beach and this guy couldn't find anywhere to hide his bag so he just tossed it into the ocean and yelled "those fuckers can't steal my beer now!" 
"its not a real blowjob unless she works the balls"- my drunk uncle
I live in Texas and have a friend who moved here from Scotland a few years ago. Ever since she moved here she consistently has faked an "American" accent to fit in. Last night she got so drunk she forgot about her American accent and started calling everyone dirty sluts in the thickest Scottish accent for an hour or so.
Somebody ran through a closed door
Went with a friend to his coworkers party. By the time the party was settling down his supervisors girlfriend was all over him and I mean like sitting on his lap, trying to get him to dance, kissing him on his cheek on her way out, etc. Meanwhile his supervisor was right there, kinda drunk, fairly embarrassed. She kept looking over to her boyfriend and saying things like "It's okay if I dance with him right, you don't care right? See he doesn't care." I felt so bad watching the whole thing unravel in front of my very own eyes.
No Ubers were running late after the party ended so my two buddies caught a ride home with the Domino's delivery guy
Shook up an open bottle of champagne and sprayed the ceiling, TV, and the host's girlfriend. Party fell apart shortly after.
Had a small get together with friends, we were all getting stoned and playing the new VR I got for Christmas. One friend is playing and out of no where he starts falling, once he hits the ground he just lays there and says "so this is how it ends."
Not a party but I saw a guy peeing in the middle of a busy road, flipping off the cars driving by. It was only about 9pm at the time
Handed my drunk friend a pine cone and said, here eat this apple. Two bites later he spits it out and says, THIS IS A PINE CONE!
I went cheering with the police and firemen just after twelve when they were putting out lit fires.
A really drunk guy took the giant bowl of noodle salad and started trying to feed everyone with it. He would walk up to people and put a spoon in their mouth, it was pretty hilarious. He also tried selling his scarf because he owed  some guy money so he would just casually ask everyone if they wanted to buy his scarf. 
My girlfriend told my family how much she likes sucking my dick
Went to give my girlfriend a cuddle while she was peeing in some bramble bushes and face planted into the wee/bush. Impressive cuts on both of them 
My aunt got high and passed out on the living room floor.
Not this year, but a couple years back. Somehow an infomercial got on the TV with one of those "call now before this commercial ends" countdown clocks in the corner. Everyone was so drunk that they counted down with the last ten seconds of the infomercial thinking it was the New Years countdown. We were all the drunkest people at the party that year.
Drunk buddy tried to shoot a firework holding it in his mouth. He tightened it too hard, the firework never flew and exploded right on top of him. He ended up with the face completely black from the powder and some small burns on his face. Two policemen were next to us when this happend, they told him it was the most stupid things that they had seen this year, and yes we were still in 2016.
A guy I'd never met named Tony kept asking all the female party goers if they knew what his name was spelled backwards. Then would slur out " y not" my wife thought it was funny and creepy at the same time. 
The host got belligerently drunk, forgot who he'd shook hands with/talked to, and spent the rest of the night making rounds shaking everyone's hand at least half a dozen times before passing out. 
This one girl dropped a slice of pizza on the floor. She then proceeded to rinse it off in the sink, and then ate it...
Quite a few people Indian leg wrestled in their underwear. Apparently pants make it hard to Indian leg wrestle.
She made SO MANY new bffs. And tried to start an orgy
I vomited so hard that I've burst/damaged a load of blood vessels in my face. Also the punchbag at the back of my mouth is swollen from the vomit so it feels like I have something stuck in my throat. I think I was probably the drunkest person at our party...
Coming home from the party last night, we stopped for pizza. The super drunk guy in front of us told us he paid for our pizza. He made a big deal out of it, but then fumbled the machine and almost forgot his card and dropped his pizza box on the floor. We asked the cashier if he had actually paid for our pizza, and she double checked and said "he... didn't even pay for his own pizza." We paid for his pizza. 
He is 17. He tried to kiss my friends drunk Mom. In front of the buzzed dad.  he did it. 
We were at applebee's, they had hired a DJ for NYE. This girl stumbles over from the bar and slurs to him (he was right next to our table) "I have nothing against Hispanic people but can you not play any more Pitbull?"   And then she tripped over a chair and almost spilled a drink all over someone's food. 
A friend of mine was extremely drunk and saw this guy walking his dog. My friend started petting the dog and when the owner asked him to stop he started petting the man instead. 
One of my buddies came to from a brown out mid choke hold. He slid and fell in the kitchen somehow and got grabbed by another friend so he'd stay off his ass. Then not knowing why he's in a choke hold he proceeds to flail around spilling drinks, chips, and the like.
After osu lost he was throwing stuff around on the front porch (it was his house). He chucked a big cooler into the air and it bounced at a really weird angle to land perfectly to cover up one of our friends heads. Everyone at the party and a bunch of passerby all collectively cheered
Played hotline bling on repeat and kept toasting everyone so she can have an excuse to drink.The most drunk person was me. 
This guy who wasn't invited took all of his clothes off and started smearing his cock on people. When we told him to leave he put on someone elses clothes (like from a cupboard) and tried to walk out wearing it.
I yelled merry christmas instead of happy new year :(
 For some reason, I texted my best friend, "I don't have enough alcohol to love you."I still don't know why. I think I was channeling my mother. Apparently, not all families talk like that, just mine.I'm sorry Katie. I know you're going to see this. I made it public. I do love you btw, you're my best friend and you always make me laugh.Edit- /u/frightened_anonymous 
I broke 3 glasses within an hour of each other. Kind of wasn't my fault but still got forced to drink of a plastic cup for the rest of the night. 
My wife of 7 years around 2am drunkingly told me she loved me. I told her I loved her back and she responded with "you do?" As if I said it for the first time.  It's how she said it that was funny, almost like after all these years she never knew I loved her.  It's one of those you would need to be there for it moments. 
A drunk girl was asking guys if she could grab their package. Her boyfriend was there and didn't seem to care. They've been rumored to swing on occasion. 
I think I was the drunkest person at the party.Aaaaaaaaand I kissed my ex. Like a fucking moron.
This guy found out that no had ever peed out of this dude's bedroom window before and decided he needed to be the first to do so... a second story window. 
My best friend's girlfriend invites me to a threesome with them. It was... interesting.  
My girlfriend threw an entire double deck of Uno cards into the fire :(
Dude asked a girl out for the evening. Kissed her at midnight and told her how happy he was she came out with him. Then extremely drunk him took a different girl -one he had just met- into the hotel bathroom, everyone noticed, and proceeded to do things with her that entirely pissed off first girl. When he came out of the bathroom, his first action was to hit on another girl (me). Everyone was pissed at drunk dude for the amount of drama he brought to the night. And he wasn't hot, at all, just a douche.
That's an officer actually doing public work.
If there are people in a pool, then it's pool party.
YOUR CLAPS ARE OF THE HIGHEST CALIBER, FELLOW HUMAN. PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE IN A COOPERATIVE EXTENSION OF THE ACTIVITY? I AM CAPABLE OF PROVIDING A COMPLETELY NON-SYNTHETIC HAND
The most optimistic woman in the world. 
I'm imagining him running out without pants on with arms flailing behind him as he happily runs all the way back home.
The real MVP
Is your hand okay?
That's my new life motto
Your buddy sounds fun
This is vastly under-upvoted how in the hell did he find space enough to do that
do you live in new orleans bc i'm pretty sure i said that a few times 
I mean, I've heard much worse drunk logic. 
I hope you didn't let him
He had to confirm the kill.
A sad fat dragon with no friends? 
I think we have different definitions of the word tipsy
My friend has a recording of me sulking over a girl years ago and I said, "I'm gonna kill myself in half"
My very drunk friend made me a mixed drink last night. I asked him how strong he made it, and he shrugged and mumbled "three or four". 
Did they reply?
Kinda?
plumber couldn't be assed to use toilet, shits in pot
He wasn't wrong, fuckers aint gonna get his beer.
Why were people trying to steal his beer?
That's awesome. I have a couple of Scottish friends. The accent gets stronger the more they drink. I love it. 
Who the hell would want to hide a Scottish accent? She's got her priorities all wrong.
Someone stole my friends front door, just ripped if off the hinges and ran down the street
That's a motherfucking sorcerer.
This is the best one, honestly. Dude may have been trashed but he knew what he was about. You gotta respect a guy who stands in a campfire to prove he isn't lying.
Wow, I now need those shoes!!!
What about his pants?
No matter how fireproof the shoes are, wouldn't his feet get unbearably hot after ten minutes over a flame?
Happened at my brother-in-laws house as well, champagne EVERYWHERE
>  he starts falling, once he hits the groundThis reads like quite a length of time passed between him losing his balance and actually falling. But I'm sure that's just a case of weed time dilation.
You let drunk people play with your new VR headset? You brave soul.
"Hey have some noodle salad. Good isn't it? So anyway do you wanna buy a scarf?"
Does she work the balls?
Bet that volcano was the life of the party
This is the most wholesome thing in this thread
I once put a bottle rocket between my butt cheeks, someone lit it, things were going well until it made that screech sound and I got scared; I clenched my cheeks and it exploded right there.College.
I wonder if that's ever worked for him.  
What do you even say after you get a response
One night I pretended my name was Tony and it worked for me. My Korean friend Park didn't have much luck that night.
*bathtub fire*
You need to expound on this story a bit more than that.
Yeah you can't just leave it there. At the very least you have to explain how/why a bathtub is so close to the TV, never mind the fire in it.
You call that belligerent?
What is Indian leg wrestling? 
I have a friend who does this every time she gets drunk. She tries to hint that she wants to have an orgy with the subtlety of a freight train. 
While on vacation in another country last year, I made friends with a group of girls my age, drank waaaaaay too much and basically begged them all to skinny dip with me in the ocean. Solid nope all around. 
>10 vodka shotsHot damn. Respect but also I threw up a little.
At least somebody paid for somebody's pizza. Nice act of kindness to start off the new year!
Hahaha this reminds me of my brother on our birthday (same day, three years apart) many years ago. I realized I'd lost track of him and asked his friend where he was. Friend pointed and said "over there, petting that guy's beard."Beard guy looked super uncomfortable. I felt bad, but quickly got him to stop.
Why was he in a chokehold? 
Did you go face?
Really starting to sound like you pissed yourself and are blaming it on the dog
what the fuck is a cooler if it wouldn't kill someone if it landed on them
Did you do the dance? 
You were THAT chick
> smearing his cock on peopleIt can... *smear*?
Sounds like a Portlandia skit.
this one is my favourite. innocent and hilarious. 
Have a similar story. My friend's grandmother passed away and he visited my place shortly after and my mom accidentally said congratulations instead of my condolocences. He gave me a very strange glare. 
Was totally your fault.
This is why I don't drink heavily, until it becomes the reason I drink heavily.
I slept with my ex. in fact she's sleeping next to me right now
that song is extremely sad. i don't get why it was played in the first place.in any case, sorry for your loss. :(
Was he aware they were fake?
I know this feeling exactly. Isn't it like oddly exciting.
You sound fun, but I'm worried about the quantity of stink bugs in your domicile. 
I'm concerned the skull might be too scary for them. Have you considered a treasure chest as an alternative?
"It's not blood, guys! It's not blood!"
If I get you for a Reddit Secret Santa next year, I promise I will make you a lovely cross-stitch sampler- instead of "Home Sweet Home" it will say 'Midnight Is A Whole Minute, And I'm A Slut", maybe with some pretty flowers and vines along the edge :)
I'm invested in this story, how'd it turn out 
Surprisingly enough his phone is fine. 
I like to think that it's one of those "every square is a rectangle" kind of things. If you're wasted, you're also significantly tipsy, and probably have a heavy buzz going on. Every subsequent level of drunkenness also includes the previous level of drunkenness. It's like building a pyramid, except instead of getting closer to the sky, you get closer to the floor. 
Did you do it?
5 more minutes of this, and I'm gonna get mad!
The dolphins will though. Dolphins are notorious drunks.
I'm thinking that's how the accent developed in the first place 
If they can do that with their bare hands it's probably best to just let them keep it
Or maybe just a person who tries hard and believes in himself.
For all those times you need to stand in a camp fire!
A guy with fireproof shoes is definitely rocking cargo shorts
For fucks sake I knew I'd find us on this thread somewhere.
It's a miracle he didn't suceed in selling his scarf with that, honestly.
That's the only way to do it; Uncle knows best.
Intelligence stat:1Luck stat:10
60 percent of the time it works every time.   In reality, I saw most females start talking with him then quickly make their retreat. He seemed to be having a great time though. 
I spent way too much time trying to figure out what "k rap" is...
You know, the traditional New Year's bathtub fire.
He just drops 'bathtub fire' like those are two words that go together all the time...
Well he was belligerently friendly.
It sounds like a euphemism for something much more exciting
Tony backwards 
It was a joint venture. Pretty much everyone in the household screamed, peed and subsequently cried at the stroke of midnight.
It's an insulated box for keeping drinks and food cold. They're typically made of plastic
Every party had one. Sorry in behalf of all of us
i've done that... then tried to correct and the recipient said not to worry. 
"If I delete them they never happened"
It almost sounds like drunk friend actively hates your sober friend in a Jyckle and Hyde way.
To alcohol! The cause of, and solution to, all life's problems.
Yes, he was formerly the banker.
He did in fact kiss every person at that party before 12:01 
What kind of phone?
It's not a pyramid scheme. It's more like a funnel. 
Can't remember 
It's not MY fault this is happening
Turns out, there is no actual Scottish accent. Everyone in Scotland is just drunk all the time.
That's what I figured... like.. Merry Christmas to you bud.. enjoy your door
He's a witch burn him!
I love Frankie Boyle's story of the most Scottish thing he'd ever seen. A drunk guy pishing against the door of a house. He finishes, gives it a shake, puts it away, takes out his keys and opens the door.
It's the car dealership tactic:  First they feed you, then they take your money. 
You sure the volcano had nothing to do with it?
I'm actually quite impressed.

Not just every single girl. Not even every girl. Every *person*. What a champ. 
Seriously, OP, we all need this answer.
He's getting himself a house, one piece at a time.
but how
Ah, the ol' restaurant tactic.
Yeah, who contributed that peice of paper to the stack? 
Even more shocking it was an iPhone. 
and it didn't cost him a dime. You'll know it's him, the shittiest house in town
Its a '16, '17, '18, '19, '20, '21, '22 split level ranch.
A lot of people don't realize this, but during wars and other significant military campaigns countries capture one another's records. Much of this tends to be banal bureaucratic stuff, but in the case of governments that are meticulous record keepers, there are sometimes volumes of damning information about war crimes.The US National Archives has a Rebel Archives, captured from the CSA during the Civil War. It contains descriptions of the treatment of prisoners of war, some of which are gruesome.Union medical officer logs are no better.
Aren't the JFK files suppose to be declassified this October? 
On January 3, 1961, a United States B-52 bomber went into a tailspin and broke up mid-air, accidentally dropping two Mark-39 hydrogen bombs over Goldsboro North Carolina. One of the bombs worked exactly as intended, it's parachute deployed and it's triggers activated, armed and ready to detonate on impact, 3 of the 4 safety switches failed, a single low-voltage switch prevented two 4 megaton nuclear explosions.
You can read the speech that was written for the President, in the event that the Apollo 11 crew were stranded or died on the Moon. It's creepy and horrifying to think about.
I think it was called project Timmy. They wanted to drop 1/2 ton iron rods from space that would have similar efforts to an atom bomb with no fallout.
The remaining JFK assassination documents are going to be released to the public in October 2017 so that will be pretty crazy.
Reading all of these posts, from around the world, I can't help but think about how the internet is going to change the way in which we all live/are governed. Twenty (hell ten) years ago, most of us would have never known the details behind these operations. We may not even know about them. How will our ability to share previously unknown information change the way things happen in the future? Will we see less of these horrible undercover things, because those conducting know there is a good chance the rest of the world will find out?
In the 1960's during the time period where the Canadian government was trying to wipe out aboriginal beliefs, they were abducting children from their homes and giving them up for adoption in the United States and other countries. The Canadian government was also putting these children into Residential schools where they would beat and sexually assault these children to try and "beat the Indian" out of them. The government was very Anti-Aboriginal for a long time.
Also anybody working in factories with phosphorus (look us phossy-jaw).
The Germans were meticulous record keepers, and a lot fell into Allied hands, at the end of WW2.
Andersonville. A prison camp where the treatment of prisoners was so bad that the commandant of the camp was hanged after the war.
It is interesting that all of these evil experiments the US did happened not long after WW2 ended. I wonder if there is a connection?
That reminds me of the fleet captain, also Russian i think, that disobeyed orders and decided not to launch missiles and prevented war. 
Aurora Borealis, at this time of year, causing a nuclear war, localized entirely in Russia?
My family were all miners from the Midlands, and my dad mentioned that during the miners strikes it was common knowledge amongst them that a lot of violence was incited by Metropolitan Police undercover as protestors. 
could that actually work?
"The SLAM as proposed would carry a payload of many nuclear weapons to be dropped on multiple targets, making the cruise missile into an unmanned bomber. After delivering all its warheads, the missile could then spend weeks flying over populated areas at low altitudes, causing tremendous ground damage with its shock wave. When it finally lost enough power to fly, and crash-landed, the engine would have a good chance of spewing deadly radiation for months to come."
Do these people hear themselves when they name their projects after death gods and demons?
In general, biological weapons are the 21st centuries scariest weapons because I think there is a strong potential for custom viruses that make everything else look like child's play.Essentially, playing pathogen. Infect a target population via somewhat clandestine means with a virus that ends up overwhelming the health infrastructure and creating chaos. 
My roommate told me about this a month ago and the very thought of it is creepy as fuck. Just an entire town, all the ruckus and noise and then....nothing. There are pictures too, those are just horrible. 
My understanding is that they taped the sermons over existing cassette tapes, mostly pop music and the like. I heard a bit of the final sermon and there's slow, deep, pop music playing ominously in the background. The actual sermons themselves were free of background music.
Unless they get reclassified for 25 more years
Kudos to the tech who said "Three is good, but four is better"
Holy fucking shit. So North Carolina basically almost had a new lake. 
To put this into perspective, the Little boy and Fat man bombs were 15KT and 20KT of TNT.
So you mean that with one bomb, the safety switches worked as intended and prevented it from going off, whereas with the second one only one of them worked?
That was during the Cold War too. Could you imagine that shitshow that would've resulted? 
Had to be so surreal. "wonder what the weather's like next week. Hmmm light showers on Tuesday and... Oh! Localized apocalypse on Thursday!"  
Woe, that was a chilling read. I cannot imagine looking up the weather and seeing that bulletin. 
I've always said that the kind of people who aspire to positions of power are not the kind of people we really want holding those positions. This is a prime example. 
It is exactly what you would expect of a religion founded by a Sci-Fi author.
Go with what works for you, man. Never be afraid to think outside the box.ed: did I accidentally reference something? Why does everyone keep talking about iceboxes
Something like this really makes me wonder how this kind of 'network' of professional lawbreakers form. Do people go knocking around their colleagues' office asking "Do you know about this new moneymaking scheme that Friar Billy came up with"? I mean, I'm sure there were no small amount of self-justification, religious indoctrination, and hierarchical pressure involved but still for a ploy this big to last 5 decades with so many people's willing involvement... Do people really get out of bed each morning thinking "I should steal some babies today"? 
 "In one case, seven volunteers in Kentucky were given LSD for 77 consecutive days."I've done acid for a couple days in a row and I'm trying to imagine 77 days but I just can't...
whats insane is that one of the larger minds behind MK Ultra, Henry Murray, wound up at Harvard and performed psychological experiments on a then 17 year old Ted Kaczynski, who would eventually become the Unabomber.  
LOTS of fucked up crazy shit is associated with MK-Ultra. 
Wasn't this the basis of *Close Encounter of the Fourth Kind* or something like that?
Well of course they would try all sorts of things to see what worked. If you've got basically infinite money, why not take a run through the phonies to see if any are actually real?
Great, now you've got me thinking that Mars is really a past version of what Earth really is today, I mean we've got our own pyramids, and definitely some strange inhabitants as well (looking at you, Dennis Rodman). Now does this mean we're destined for some sort of strange planetary catastrophe? All out nuclear war because Russia and the US couldn't get along? Mars sure does look like a fallout planet, indeed.Fasten your seatbelts, friends.
The government has tried some really, really weird stuff over the years. It's almost comforting to know that every crazy angle has at least been looked at instead of being shut down. I'm sure there are plenty of things in modern science and technology that once sounded as baffling as using a psychic to find the history of mars.Yes, the CIA tried it, but that doesn't mean much of anything. 
Jesus fucking christ. I read the first part and thought that was sick enough; then I looked at the scrollbar. It's really fucking fucked up that he turned it into this every-day thing that happened so regularly he had to make a video for it. 
Did he actually let people go like he said in the transcript, or did he just murder them?
I read this about 6 months or so ago in a similar thread and still remember it vividly.DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU ARE PREPARED
Not sure which is more surprising - that they had such a plan or that they actually declassified such a plan.
I read somewhere that the German higher-ups didn't trust their low level workers and soldiers to carry out their orders against the jews thoroughly, so they made them fill out paperwork meticulously, thus that is the reason there is so much documentation of the holocaust. 
So did their parents just sign away their rights and leave?
Cropsy really shook me. The footage from the hospital is haunting
Never gave them penicillin for decades after it was discovered and known as the cure.
Largely for the same reason, if the US were to nuke Russia it would probably send more than 1 nuke.
I mean, doesn't everyone know that different police forces do this? There's literally a phrase for it: "agent provocateur".
What keeps them from using this tech to make desert places like California, Nevada etc get more rainfall in times of drought?
At its simplest level, "We won't kill your wives if you don't kill ours" is a very enticing proposition.
I think it's about control and target. You can control who you shoot with a gun, but a flood will kill innocent people and serve no purpose other than damaging the individual. The same logic applies to chemical weapons - they're indiscriminate and hard to control.
So far?  Only if you're a frog.
100mt was its max potential, what they detonated was 50mt
For some reason I love the idea of a nuclear powered rocket whose only attack ability is to fly all over the place at Mach 5 breaking shit with shockwaves.
The scientists who come up with these ideas give them appropriate names. Whether they're ever actually used is usually up to the MoD.
it was a direct cycle reactor. at the very, very, very least it spewed activated Oxygen (which is no fucking joke)
What was crazy to me was the scale. Usually when you hear about these cult communes it's like a handful of people - maybe 100 people if that. This was over 900 people. Over 900 people willingly took their lives for a crazy idea. They also murdered a congressman.
I think they'll reclassify it all.  It won't be declassified until everyone who remembers it is dead and it's of historical interest only.
What is it that's creepy about this? I'm confused. Just that it's fragments from the bullets that killed the president?
Imagine having to autopsy the President of the United States.
Russian pessimist says: "Things cannot possibly get worse." Russian optimist says: "Yes they can."
> "Not great."perhaps the largest understatement ever uttered by a member of the American armed forces. 
There was also a nuke accidentally dropped on Mars Bluff, SC back in 1958.
6,000 barrels of contaminated Spanish dirt were shipped to South Carolina for storage.  Amazing.
I'm starting to think they shouldn't be flying with these. 
Wait, so it could have been 200 times the size of fat man... fiddily fuck that shit RIGHT off.
From what I can gather nuclear bombs don't detonate by themselves. They need to be triggered. So it just disintigrated on ground impact.Meaning they are not impact sensitive. They get triggered.
And in Guatemala, they actually *infected* people, on a larger scale than Tuskegee, and lied to them about what they were doing. It's one of the most sickening atrocious in modern US history, IMO.
I was listening to Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy today and you reminded me of this. "It is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it... anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job". - Douglas Adams.
[Redacted]
Lol:  > ...most machine gunners are trained to spot their fire on target by observation of strike. This will not do in assassination as the subject will not wait.
> They could NOT be seen adopting.So how do they explain not being visibly pregnant for months before their baby is born?
At the time this was written, 1983 if i read the article correctly, who was the potential threat for WW3? The Soviet Union?
You'd pretty much lose all sense of yourself and reality, I can't imagine going through that
"As the experimentation progressed, a point was reached where outsiders were drugged with no explanation whatsoever and surprise acid trips became something of an occupational hazard among CIA operatives."
So the UnaBomber left Harvard in 1969, and that report was published in 1976. I was too lazy to read it all, but did anyone read it and confirm the unabomber was a victim? That would be some next level shit. If anyone was wondering he's 74 and currently serving 8 life sentences if my Max Payne trivia is on par 
Just "The 4th Kind" and it is a very scary movie. 
Wow, just read through this. It's like they crammed quantum physics, cosmology, parapsychology and eastern philosophy into a blender. It reads more like the manifesto from some crazed serial killer than a government report. 
Seriously, what's the worst that could happen. Best case scenario you got a new superweapon of people who can look into the office of USSR secretary, realistic case scenario you wasted a time of a few interns
Some odd million years from now some space squid from Europa will be looking at a barren scorched Earth thinking. I wonder what happened there!
The most fucked up part? His "drug cocktail" to erase memory appeared to have worked. While trying to find victims, only two were found because others asked about it recognized tattoos on the women. When the women were approached they offered to talk to law enforcement but had no recollection of anything even remotely like that. Then the moment they heard the audio from the tape the memories came flooding back and they remembered everything.Last Podcast on the Left has a pretty good episode covering this.
Can you tell me what kind of things to expect? 
"What we're telling them to do is so bad, we don't expect people to do it. So instead of saying 'fuck that, no' we're gonna make them prove that they did it."
Good thing they didn't know about the SUNDIAL. 
It's absolutely not cost-effective
Let's agree not to kill each other's kids.Don't attack clinics or the medics, we both need to help our wounded.Long ago people would trade PoWs back and take breaks at night, in winter, or during holidays.The goal is to keep the battle contained and restrict suffering. Our soldiers fight yours, and if we get a win condition we stop. After all, we all had lives before this that we kind of don't want to be super shitty when we finish the fight.This only works when both sides agree though. 
Jesus fuck.The Sundial probably could've burnt and irradiated nearly everywhere on earth regardless of detonation area.Holy shit. The dude who designed didn't stop to think at all if he should do it.Why would anyone ever need a weapon that absurdly destructive, to the point you could irreperablly damage the earth and kill literally billions of people? That's just... Wrong.
A lot of them didn't do it willingly. There were guards forcing them to with guns.
Cant help but think people would point fingers at the soviets too. Nuclear war avoided.
Nope, but to be fair, I didn't spend a lot of time in the actual town.  There were three occasions when my family would go to Goldsboro:  Birthday dinners, movie nights (which were rare), and the county fair.  Usually for dinner we'd go to Ruby Tuesday or Outback, which were right off the highway, same as the theater and the fairgrounds.  I'm not sure where specifically that sign is, but I would assume it's downtown-ish.
Isn't there any ethics approval for experiments in US? WTActualF 
And Beeblebrox was perfect because he didn't care for governing. He made the people happy. That is until he stole The Heart of Gold. 
Or to quote Frank Herbert, author of Dune:    > All governments suffer a recurring problem: Power attracts pathological personalities. It is not that power corrupts but that it is magnetic to the corruptable.
Levels above OT8 have been "nearly available" for years (like, at least 30 years), but they have never been released.  Lately, instead of additional cash grabs by making new material above OT8, they've simply been releasing new versions of the low-level courses and requiring that people go back and take those again.  The number of people who actually go all the way up to OT8 is actually very very small. Even (most) famous Scientologists that you've heard of never make it that high.
and the less body thetans you have (through thorough and expensive cleansing of course) your Operating Thetan level goes up
My Tia Machi from the DR was born in jail for this exact reason, and was given every name her mother could think of that came from her/her husband's family line to make sure Machi could keep her identity even if her rebel parents didn't survive. Machi is her nickname, since she has around 10-15 names total. Her mom did make it out of jail, but her dad was killed. 
Yup, the Soviets. It was a serious consideration at the time.If you fancy having the shit scared out of you, go and have a watch of the BBC drama Threads (readily available online) which dates from that period and depicts exactly what would happen to one of England's biggest cities in the event of a war. I was born well after it was produced and well after nuclear war was even a possibility but it still scares the fuck out of me.
Thank you. Even though the content is very sad, its a beautiful speech.
but doesnt acid lose half the power of its dose if you use it the next day, for example if you do 100ug one day, and do the same amount the next day it would only feel like taking 50ug?
I've heard 4 life sentences, but yeah, this is what Wikipedia has to say; >As a Harvard undergraduate, Kaczynski was among twenty-two students who were research subjects in ethically questionable experiments conducted by psychology professor Henry Murray from late 1959 to early 1962.
Pretty good for 40 years ago. But I don't know if they really put google to shame.
The flashbacks of being terrified by this movie are coming back. 
> Then the moment they heard the audio from the tape the memories came flooding back and they remembered everything.This is fucking horrifying, I imagine that flood of information could near destroy your mind.
Torture, rape, dog rape, rape and torture with a nice touch of psychological torture
The Sundial blast would've been the size of Texas. The fallout and subsequent nuclear winter would have probably killed almost everyone on the planet.
However, if you wanted to blast something out in space, I could see some use for it.. 
There was a guy on NPR talking about Jones town. He said over half the people were either kids or elderly who would have had no way surviving in the jungle and would die either way. Basically the mos of the people had no real choice in the matter
Saying you'll shoot someone if they don't commit suicide with cyanide doesn't seem like a good threat.If I don't want to die I'd rather get shot and have a chance to survive that.
They killed the children first so that the adults would be more willing to die.
Smart of your grandma. I would assume they'd just give the kid a different name though (once they took her). 
I watched Threads once a couple years ago. Never again. I was on edge for days. It scared me so bad. The raw suffering it simulates it unbelievable and horrifyingly realistic. You can imagine all this happening to you in your own circumstances. I have no desire nor need to ever watch it again, it'll be sticking with me for a long time.
The worst part of that is the implication that the problem would be a technical one with the lander, leaving the astronauts alive and well, and in contact with NASA, but stranded. What would they do in that situation? Keep taking to them until their oxygen ran out? Let them speak to their families?
To further elaborate on the above. We aren't talking like a paragraph of extreme detail here.We are talking like a full on page or two about him and his buddies getting off on watching his dog rape the victim in more detail than you can be prepared for. I think the beastiality portion is what fucked me up and stuck with me all this time more than anything. But there isn't a "that's not so bad" part to any of the transcript  
Sounds silly but this would be the perfect defensive weapon. Don't attack us or we will detonate it and everyone loses. This was part of the plot of Dr. Strangelove. The Russians couldn't keep up with the us economic system so they built a weapon that would wipe out all life if a nuclear explosion went off in their territory. The problem is that once this weapon was built and the design known all it would take is some rogue state to say we all lose and boom. Game over planet earth. 
I had no idea this was in Guyana until you said jungle. I honestly thought this happened in the U.S. 
You should read up on Jim Jones, he was nuts near the end. Apparently he would give people Kool-Aid tell them it was poisoned as a test on a regular basis to see if they would drink it before he actually did this.
I read somewhere that procedure was that NASA would cut communications. Imagine that, being stranded on the moon, just you and one other person until you suffocated to death. Scary stuff.
> AFTER THE PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT, AT THE POINT WHEN NASA ENDS COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE MENRe-read the very last part of the comment you replied to.  Sounds like a lonely way to go.  I guess you have to be cold in situations with no hope.
Holy shit if that's true, I'd imagine they can read our thoughts from Langley by now. 
Not the same as a satellite but when I was in Afghan we would regularly be walked onto target by drones. The operators would say _10 metres left, 5 metres right_ or something and we'd still not see anything. Then they'd tell us to throw a grenade over a wall or whatever and boom, three Taliban fighters dead we had no idea about.
That was the philosophy of most of the arms race at a point. Dr. Strangelove wasn't just some goofy movie, but it was an analysis and criticism of the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction. 
Can't we just bluff? It's not like anyone's gonna say 'I don't believe your bomb is that big, prove it.' 
Is that where they came up with the fact that variations on 'Drinks the Kool-Aid' means being part of a cult?
The idea was to let them die in peace and with privacy, not broadcasting their every panicked word to everyone on Earth.
That's exactly the line that got me thinking. 
Honestly I see being cold as only justified in situations with hope.  If there's no hope and death is inevitable, you switch to comforting people and helping them die well.
if you think there's not at least one division working on that tech, you're out of your mind
Real life wallhacks
There is Mutually Assured Destruction and then there is Mutually Assured Destruction via SUICIDE BOMBING.
I think North Korea uses these sorts of bluffs. 
Which Kool-Aid execs have to be just thrilled about
As someone who works in a control environment I'd imagine it's also taking into account that listening in to them as they died would just break the comms guy and ruin his life...
The thing is, they were actually drinking Flavor Aid. It wasn't even Kool-Aid. So it's probably doubly annoying for Kool-aid execs.

Since movies evolved so much I think it's time to rename them: *movie soundies*
They also called the first non-silent films "talkies".
You've literally just given the etymology of 'movies', it was a lazy way of saying 'moving pictures' or 'motion pictures'

I'm a fan of Doug Stanhope if that puts things into perspective.I went to a Regan show a few years back and he was transitioning over to Godspeed which I hadn't heard at the time. Loved it. He did requests at the end which I've never seen a comedian do. People yelling "the big yellow one is the sun" at him from the audience, still makes me chuckle.

Well, it's not exciting, but I'm an Audiologist and never had to worry about finding work. Also have worked in 3 countries (so far). 
Speech-Language Pathologist. I personally work in an elementary school, but in the field you can work with people from birth through old age with a HUGE variety of disorders: articulation, language, stroke, swallowing, autism, traumatic brain injury, fluency, voice, and lot more! Or you can go into research. It's such a huge field that you'll definitely find a niche you love, and speech pathologists are hard to find these days, so you'll definitely find a job. 
I own an ice cream shop and leave work everyday covered in chocolate and caramel. It's a pretty sweet job.
I'm a CPA working in public practice at a regional firm. I do a little bit of everything on the client service side - audit, tax, process consulting, etc. Would love to chat. 
I am a Registered Nurse.I got into the field quite accidentally, when I started nannying for a family whose daughter had prematurity-related health problems and a feeding tube. I had to learn CPR, and give crushed medications, and it was a natural progression.I have spent 2 years in Cardiac, 3 years in Postpartum(Mom/Baby) and a year in Labor&Delivery. It is beyond fantastic.

I process the backroom of a TJ Maxx. My best piece of advice? Don't work for TJ Maxx.
I am a network engineer for ATT mobility. I chose the mobility field because I saw handheld computing as a solid industry that isn't going anywhere. 
I am a lawyer. AMAA. 
I make gaming-themed YouTube videos (mostly Minecraft) for a living, and do some speedrun livestreaming on the side.I have an abnormal love for Minecraft which makes the job a pleasure most of the time, and I love the freedom of self-employment. However, it's more of a job than a lot of people would assume. Obviously it's not something easy to get into, but I can still answer some questions if people have them.
Unemployed. It's great but the pay sucks
I'm a psychology researcher with plans to study to become a therapist after my social psychology PhD.

I work in the film industry! :)
Active duty Navy here.I have training in a few different specialties, but my primary job is dental assisting. Didn't really choose it, the navy was just more or less trying to fill a quota when they stuck me with the job. Assisting dentists all day isn't half bad. It's the military aspect of it all that can be debilitating sometimes. But I've been a few places, seen some cool things, and met very awesome people. Plus, it's steady income.

> If you don't have a CS degree, don't worry, you probably won't ever be in one of those areas. One of our team leads is a Ph.D in Mathematics, and the other had degrees in Theology and Philosophy.

Yeah upvoting since this seems like a really great idea and I can gain insight on jobs I am considering
I love cooking, always considered myself good at it, and that's exactly why I never ever want to do it for a living.
I worked as a server at a restaurant before I started at USPS. So I went from getting little to no respect, to everyone I walk by smiling and saying hello! It's crazy! People really like their mailman!
It's really not that hard at all, that's the problem.
Funny thing is when people take the link to be both ways. As a locksmith, I lost count of the times I was asked to reattach a heel or something. Sorry ma'am, I'm aware that shoe repairers cut keys, I can't fault your logic, but I can't fix your shoe.
Both involves cutting metal. And back in the way long day copying a key means you had to cut the pattern by hand which means you had to be skilled. Not the key machine they have now.

Exactly this! I'm currently working a fairly complicated page with lots of graphs and charts, and it works perfect in Chrome and Firefox. IE outright crashes before I can hit F12 to open the debugger. I hate Internet Explorer. It is probably the single most annoying part of my job. (I'm a web developer/software developer.)
It's not that bad to be a starving artist. :)I went to school for creative writing. After I graduated I worked as an editorial assistant for a magazine, but found out reaaaally damn fast that I'm not cut out for a 9-5 office job. I finished the first draft of my first novel two weeks ago. I nanny part-time and am definitely poor (though not starving, since I eat all their food!), but it's worth it to have the free time and brain energy for my book!

I had all 3 but the connections are what nabbed me the job. I suspect without experience and education my resume might have been ignored. I know some peers who are more gifted than I am, who are struggling because they are less well-connected.Right now I am working on a celebrity biography show (boring) that pays the company bills and a time travel show (AWESOME) both of which will be airing this summer.

It's a well-known chain, yea. I was hired on as a "production baker" after years of fast food experience with other chains.
Not all jobs need college.  Nobody can answer that question until you know what you're gonna do.College is expensive, but very rewarding and can lead you to a great career that pays well.  You have to decide for yourself -- is it worth it?

Not OP, but pretty much exactly what it sounds like. Someone that welds while diving. It requires licenses that take time and money to earn, but can prove to be profitable if you are willing to put in the time. It is still a manual labor job, so you will need to consider how long you can do it for. Finding the right contracts can be very lucrative with people allegedly earning a six figure salary in USD.
Yep, I have a degree in computer science from one of the top colleges in the United States, and I worked as a software engineer for Microsoft before doing youtube full time.
Actually, ElementAnimation did the animation for those videos, so I'm sorry to say that I don't have any good advice for you. Best of luck, though.
I'd say I work roughly 40 hours a week, though it varies. I'm working a bit more now that I'm live streaming several times per week. I work a lot on the weekends.My friends generally are very interested in my job, its much easier to relate to the minutiae of my job than a normal desk job. I also get a fair number of video ideas from my friends, and they like that sort of limited involvement.
Really more of a marsh, honestly.  
There are three* general fields: prep, production, and post-production. *maybe also marketing and distribution...    I work in production, where the actual shooting gets done. Specifically, I work as a grip: sort of lighting and rigging and support department. and yes, all aspects of the industry are pretty stressful. But usually quite rewarding. 
Luckily for me, I'm not on ship. I'm on a military installation and I do get to go home after the work day.
good god I can't believe that was 2 fucking years ago...I think I need to go outside more. 
The phrase: "If you love what you do, you never have to work a day in your life." is total bull shit in my opinion. Never ever turn your hobby into your job. Just accept that work sucks and that you need to sell some of your life to make other parts better.

I went to school for creative writing, too. I'm currently a bartender at a major chain resturaunt...

I wouldn't last 10 minutes.
Now you say you Reddit all day unless you start a project. What kinds of projects do you work on? I'm currently on my way through school to hopefully do the same type of deal when I get out. 
I know this may sound a little stupid, but how does one get 'connections'? Is it purely luck in knowing the right people or did you actively seek them out?
I can't even see the asterisk. It really feels like part of the original comment. Very well crafted.
Professional timbit maker?
I didn't like welding in the rain. I couldn't imagine welding in the water. Especially in water with salinity.   
Yeah, most underwater welders dont last long though, usually 7-10 years before their body can't keep up with the pressure. That's why the pay is so high
If the views ever stopped coming in would you go back to working as a software engineer, or try to stay in the video game world? Also, I love your videos! Good luck in UHC! 
Doesnt it ruin movies for you if you see how everything gets done?
What kind of jobs are available in the navy and what can i expect in your line of work?
Life is stupid like that because you've made your life work, eat, computer games, sleep. Life is what you make it.
It's Okay,  It's only 18 months.  I had the same freak out..  It's from December 2012, not two years.. ^ this guy and his exaggerations.
I graduated with a creative writing degree. I moved to taiwan. I spend 14 hours a week teaching English and all my insane amount of free time reading and writing. I still make enough money that I literally don't know what to do with it. I save 1k usd every month. Its just sitting in my bank account cause its so cheap to live here. 
If you weren't trained sure.
The way he abbreviates "you would" is extremely forward thinking. OP loves to be efficient, definitely would hire. 
No timbits, just munchkins!
If anything, it makes you appreciate the good movies even more since you understand how much hard work went into them. 
I can barely spit out a drive through order for a coffee I get every morning. That combined with my lack of attention span, and destructive curiosity, I definitely would be fired within 10 minutes. 
Jimmies or sprinkles? Coming from a professional doughnut maker, you should know best of all. 
You should be a mechanic, I am and I have a hard time pronouncing my name some mornings. I ruined a "defective" fuel pump because I wanted to see how much distance and pressure I could shoot water across the shop. Got bored a few days ago and was curious to weather or not anybody fucked with my tool box so I wired roughly 120vs to that bitch and went to lunch.  He doesn't mess with my toolbox and I feel bad because the porter got involved and she's such a sweet girl. She hasn't talked to me in 2 days now and throws my tickets at me
The boxes say "sprinkles" but my family is from New England, where they're called jimmies. I'm so conflicted!
My dad says jimmies. The way I see it, if they're just chocolate, they're jimmies. If it's rainbow or any other kind, they're sprinkles. 
Use a piece of the answer in quotes as your query.
Add "forum" to the search. This will bring up people who are writing about the problem or issue you are searching for of just about any product out there.
Putting a / between first and last name for a person will search for the names together E.g, searching John Smith Podiatrist will give you podiatrists with both the names like John Wilson or Fred Smith, Searching John/Smith will only bring up John Smiths Hope this helps :) 
Use *site: reddit.com* and *filetype:gif*
Use as few words as possible
Three words: GOOGLE. ADVANCED. SEARCH.You can find pages with an exact phrase, omit certain words, look up numbers, file types, and all on the domain it's on. Seriously, you don't even need to be good at phrasing things, just put in what you need and you'll probably end up finding it.
Google stuff the old way. Search for the potential title of the article that would have the information you need, rather than just asking a question.Search for "Cherries bad for dogs" vs "can my dog eat cherries?"Doing this helps you find the answers, not just more people with the same question.
Add "Reddit" to the end of the search and there's most likely a thread about whatever you're looking for
Use incognito mode in your browser for the "scientific" queries.
Key words only. Don't ask full questions, just enter the main words. Good tip is to keep it as concise as possible
#1 Protip of all time* Dont be lazy, just do the search. 
Haven't tried it in awhile but i remember being able to change my user agent to googlebot and browse gated forums that way. There are Chrome add ons to do this. 
Oh wow, I'm a fan of that AROUND() function
google got rid of the + operator, so now you have to put " around single words or use search tools->results->verbatim
How do you stop Google from searching for synonyms? Many times I'm searching for a word relevant to a particular context where the synonym is not relevant
Be aware that there are strict caps on the <number>..<number> syntax that can get you IP-banned from using google for short periods of time pretty quickly
you can also filter by site. for example>google analytics site:reddit.com
To filter out words use -, I think you can filter out whole websites as well using -inurl:.
Aside from quoting and exclusion, I find most of the fancy search features unnecessary if your queries are reasonably specific (ie not things like "problem with ms word") 
When I'm searching about something, I often click the Reddit link as well. Reading the comments often gives me a bunch of useful info or links from other redditors.
-pinterest saves your dang life
Just a warning: it's common for bots to use these, so getting too fancy with filters (allinurl:"URL", etc.) will get you flagged as a bot.
Didn't Google start ignoring literal string / exact match quotes a few years ago?
Or add "Reddit" to the search
What's the difference between using "John Smith" and John/Smith?
That Miley search is oddly specific 
You used to be able to get into directory levels and download mp3's like this. Haven't tried in a while. 
You can tell how much internet experience someone has by the way they phrase their searches. 
I think you mean "Eliminate unnecessary words."
Hmmm...I want to find a place to simulate being at the bottom of an underground condition, where the temperatures will be high, the light will be virtually nonexistent, and the air will have high humidity. "hot, dark, moist"
Maybe I'm lucky but being especially descriptive seems to help me. I'm sure it depends on the topic but searching a complete phrase works well for me. For car problems it will often take you to a forum specific your car and someone who experienced the same problem.
I find the exact opposite is useful. Sometimes I just make a word salad of several words pertaining to what I'm looking for. The Trick to this is using the right words. A proof of this is google's uncanny ability to find movies or songs based on obscure descriptions.
This and never word for word phrases unless your looking for a specific passage
I had success with "what was the name of that satellite with the gold disk launched way back when"

Google advanced search works if you're trying to sift through a tonne of things that are close to your search but not exactly. My problem is that my searches turn up nothing anyway so advanced search narrows 10 useless responses to 0 responses
True, but this can also bring up biased information. Check the inverse search too, if possible
The old way? I don't understand. Are you saying the Ask Jeeves method is now the most common way people are searching? 
"Cherries for dogs" will do also
>you don't really ask the search engine a questionJeeves would be disappointed by how far we've fallen
Except googles algorithm has been modified so that you can literally ask it a question and get the same results
In my experience, if I think it's a super common problem I actually ask google the question as I figure thousands of others probably have as well. Usually the easiest to read/follow instructions are the top results when I do this too
How does boolean fall into this? 
That's how I found Reddit in the first place. After multiple google searches to my questions I would keep ending up here. So then I started always added Reddit to the end. Couple years later made an account.  Now I'm on here every day.
Actually they got rid of the "+" operator.  I really...REALLY miss it.
Right click on the gray screen that gets displayed over the site and select inspect. The when it highlights the code for you go up a level or two and hit delete and that changes your cached copy which will not render what's called a "modo". Because it's cache it will come back when the timer in the files tells google to pull a new copy. The same goes for page blocking ads that won't go away.
This might be too specific of a question but I was trying to figure out something similar to this a few days ago.  Would that work for a website that has overlays to blur things out? For example, if you wanted to see the answer to a question on Chegg thats partially blurred out?
What are gated forums if I may ask?
Huh. Wonder why this thread was axed.
"OP's mom" AROUND(5000) "house"
I loved Around (I don't remember the syntax) from Nexis searches. I have been missing it for decades not knowing it was available in Google 
Thanks, this had bugged me lately, but not enough to Google the solution. Which is totally embarrassing in retrospect. 
For 'actual verbatim' you need the undocumented triple quotes """like this""". I use it so often I made a global hotkey to easily surround my queries with triple quotes.
That is the first I'm hearing of this. When did this happen? I have the olds. 
I would put just that word in quotes. 
Years ago you used to be able to use this syntax to search for valid credit card numbers (e.g. 4000000000000000..4999999999999999), of which there were a jaw dropping number posted online, not even by scammers or whatever, more like small businesses not knowing the difference between intranet and internet site... I think Google censors those results now.
Why?
Why's that? I use this routinely to get up-to-date results for computer issues. The missing expiry date for information is a growing problem. Why should Google be concerned about "issue 2016..2017", but not "issue"?Isn't this just one search with even stricter criteria?
This is the only good way to search redditNow if only it didn't link to shitty fucking mobile versions
I trust Reddit more than many other sites. I can read a bunch of different opinions and be sure that I'm not being misinformed by a biased source.
Seriously, pinterest in image results is fucking cancer.
oh so that's why i enter captcha so ofteni can't leave google now
I do this primarily because every single website I find on a given topic is either loaded with garbage intrusive ads that block my whole screen, is segmented into ten pages, or flat out crashes my mobile browser. Reddit threads on the other hand are almost always buttery smooth.
Google treats the slash (and lots of other punctuation) as basically any word delimiter, so `John/Smith` becomes `John[non-word character]Smith`. Since it has no spaces, then Google will not separate the terms and search them as a unit. The difference between that and `"John Smith"` is that `John/Smith` should return any of:* John-Smith* John/Smith* John.Smith* John Smith* etc.
Dear Google, what's that thing where the guy does the stuff with his hand, and then the girl gets that thing that smells bad? Thank you, from Doris.
I dunno, I consider myself fairly experienced, and I sometimes just literally type a question I have into google. The results tend to be forums where others have posted the same question.
Oh, you need a pressurized cement consistometer
As someone who doesn't get the reference, just searching "dank" would yield proper results if it wasn't for meme culture. 
The more words you use, the more of those words need to be in your ideal search result. Similarly, Google has an easier time mapping synonyms and similar words to those chosen if the string is shorter.*That said*, if your query is very close to what you're actually looking for, this isn't a bad way to go.
This is easier if it's a common problem many people have asked questions to.If say, you're trying to open an obscure or old program and you get a 3DGlobe.wrf error or some shit, then it's important you only google 3DGlobe.wrf and hope for the best
If youjust searched "satellite with gold disk" you get similair results. Depending on what youre looking for too much filler words can make it harder to find things.
I too had great results this way! Google knew the movie I meant when I put 'movie about kid who sells drugs in high school'. 
I just caught myself wondering what the fuck pale, curvy tattoos were and why they're specific to teens.
Absolutely. For instance, searching "vaccines cause autism"... 
Sadly after years of watching people use search engines I would say minimum 75%+ of people ask questions. 
Honestly just 'dog cherries' would be fine
Returned results for:Jeeves disappointed we've fallen

I got 95,300,000 and 95,500,000 respectively.
Teaching people about the + made me feel like a genius when I was in high school sad it's gone
What's the difference between single and triple quotes?
When they started Google Plus. I think they want(ed) to dedicate the + sign to search for user handles. 
Problem is these days it thinks it's smarter than you and sometimes searches synonyms even then.
I tried it a little while ago to search for products with UPC numbers registered to certain companies (within certain GS1 company prefix ranges) and discovered the cap. 
Because you're basically performing hundreds or thousands of searches at once if you extend the number range too much. So this would be an easy way for bots or humans to abuse google and overload their servers.
-site:i.reddit.com will exclude mobile pages.
Even worse is googling something on mobile and the damn google amp page opens instead of the reddit page. 
Honestly, this site can be a gold mine at times but the search function here is garbage. So half the time I need to google something I add "reddit" at the end lol.
Reddit can be very biased. Techical solutions are pretty trust worthy but I wouldn't take anything upvoted on reddit at face value.
Just when you think you found something cool, you have to make an account 
Oooh
I used to do this all the time around 2002 or so, it was the easiest way to get mp3s (way faster than Kazaa etc). Every so often I check it out again for shits and giggles, but all I see are fake sites and DMCA notices.

The Faculty!
that illustrates your point well, though I've often found when I google that it's overwhelmingly about how trustworthy vaccines are.
Interestingly enough, that query will give you:- A bunch of sites stating that vaccines *do not* cause autosm (including the CDC).- An article on Trump's stance that vaccines *do* cause autism.Pretty amazing three-word search: both the truth and the context that fuels the bullshit.
Autisms cause vaccine?
I don't know why you regard that as sad. Depending on what you're looking for, typing a question is frequently a good way to turn up a result of someone asking the exact same question in a forum somewhere, followed immediately by the answer. This is particularly true with common software. You being the first person anywhere to have a particular problem with Excel is like winning the lottery - not fuckin likely.
Asking questions can actually work out great many times. 
Yep, in a presentation a few months ago from a guy at Google, he told us they are trying to make it answer questions that are in natural language... Which obviously is not helped by people who type only keywords (like me) because they don't trust it lol. He was working in a team that makes some back end stuff about understanding natural language better, which helps with all Google products like search, translate, etc.
I'm confused.
Yeah I do but those are no replacement.  The "+" operator forced the results to contain a certain term.  For example "+adidas running shoes" would return results that ALWAYS had the term adidas.  It was great.
So the gold subreddit 
"Tons"
You're right, I don't think that search would work. OP's mom would be on both sides of the house.
Yup, may be that's why it is "undocumented"!
I got 2 and 2 respectively. WTF is going on?
I get 743000 results for the 74 one... 
No wonder I was having so much trouble last week.  Why the hell did they remove it? 
Damn, what will happen when they launch Google Colon in 2018
God damn I hate it when it thinks its smarter than me. The other thing is when it takes the one key term *out* because it found way more results with that term missing... except I was *trying* to narrow down the search to the small subset of manageable results, not wade through 100,000 unhelpfully broad ones!

Google scholar puts this argument to rest. You can literally search "thimerosal" and read the abstracts of the top cited papers.You don't even have to understand the study, abstracts are often written in plain English and are easy to digest.
My wife Googles literal questions.I use keywords.She sucks at Google.

That's the correct way to do it on google; the parentheses are for ebay only (per OP's edit).

You should give yourself a handjob as thanks.
me too.  Since my name is fairly unique, searching for the issue is easier if I knew I had done this before.  I post my answers unbidden on usenet groups
It's no joke! There's a lot of active research into sub-Coulombic inductance coils. Apparently they could have applications in electric cars, Hyperloop projects, and Cranford C-beams. 
A hammock of cake?
Or most things they do. Here's a laptop! But you can't take it out of the house as it needs data to work. No it doesn't have data capability haha
that's too gay dude
Your name is not as unique as you think it is ;)
My buddy did his PhD on Cranford C-beams. Their paradoxical change in structural strength compares to withstanding deep oceanic pressures when the forces are applied perpendicularly, where only the hypercrust plating was applicable in the tangent corners. The sub-Coulombic inductance coils could funnel out the weak energy so only the forces necessary to maintaining integrity of the C-beam and increasing its resistance/kg property remain within the structure.
I think this may be something more serious/different than what most the Redditors up til now have said!The commanders of the special forces don't support those in the coup. Which means not all the military is joining in.  This could get much uglier than a "return to secularism" that many are advocating, especially if the military is split on its support.
I don't know much about Turkish politics but apparently the Turkish military has a standing order to overthrow the government if it becomes too Islamic.
Pro Tip: Don't trust partial video clips claiming one side wiping out another.  This PR tactic was used to great effect during the Libya civil war as well as during the Venezuela coup against Chavez with very little editing needed.  Took a long time to get uncut versions of videos that gave you context.
"There are decades when nothing happens. There are weeks where decades happen"-Vladimir Lenin
I love CNN's live stream"The coup is over""Soldiers entering CNN's studios in Turkey, it may not be that clear cut"
Urges his supporters to go on the streets and fight, while he's safely on a plane and seeking asylum in Germany. Typical Erdogan.
Welp, he's saying he's going to neuter the military.  Welcome to authoritarian goverment, Turkey.
Asylum in Germany for Erdogan?Fuck off you moron and don't come here. I prefer you rotting in a cell. 
While principally not a fan of coup d'etats, it's been increasingly hard to not kinda want one in Turkey. Though that feels awful to say. I hope it'll pass as bloodless as possible and cool heads will soon prevail.
Erdogan calling people to the streets, wow what an absolute mongoloid. There are tanks and helicopters out there. The civilians are fine where they are.
For those wishing Erdogan would be a little less authoritarian, I don't think this will end well. When Turkey gained its independence, Mustafa Ataturk viewed the military as a way to keep the politicians in check, and that seems to be the basis for what happened tonight. Some in the military must have felt that Erdogan was overstepping his bounds, becoming too authoritarian and too sectarian for what was demanded of him, and so in response, I expect Erdogan to come down with an iron fist and be even more authoritarian than ever. 
Has the Coup really been repelled or is it propaganda? 
If this coup fails, any hope for a secular Turkey is completely thrown out the window. Another batshit crazy dictatorship run by laws from the dark ages. Way to respect Ataturk. The man would spit on what Turkey has become
Gulen this, Gulen that, cleanse this and that. Erdogan has become delusional, paranoid, and worst of all, dangerous. Turkey is in a 100x worse position now compared to 24 hours ago.
Why does nearly every "Hey, Turkish guy from Istanbul here, coup failed!" comment come from new accounts?  
So Erdogan is denied re-entry at Istanbul, denied refuge in Germany, asks UK, then turns around and hovers south for a couple of hours, then zooms right into Istanbul in the face of a millitary coup and starts talking trash about the millitary?  Something doesn't add up
So is this like when the Jedi try to arrest Palpatine and fail, and through that event he gains the sympathy of the Senate and consolidates his power to create the glactic empire? 
This whole thing looks more and more like a deadly ruse. Erdogan is flying into the airport, how could he do that if he had any uncertainty on whether he'd be shot down or taken prisoner. He'll land and look like a fearless conquerer. This is too real to be a game, but it's too silly to not be one... 
Idk why people are saying this is over, it does not look that way. I am still seeing new video of gunfire and smoke coming from Ankara.
Sky News have just inadvertently aired civilians being gunned down on the bridge 
Is no one else actually looking at the live thread?  The coup is failing.  Everybody saying this is good, it isn't.  If this fails, Turkey will truly be fucked.
So glad I was not born nor live in Middle Eastern countries.
So ultimately, Erdogan won't mind the results of this night that much, huh? He's still in power, and he can use these events to effectively place himself into a position of full dictatorship, if he wasn't there already. I imagine he'll go full Stalin on his army for a while. I guess ultimately, everybody loses. The army loses, Turkey loses, the world loses. It would almost seem like this will end Turkey's long tradition of the military stepping in to fix when yet another government fucks over the country. 
Reichstag fire.
Askreddit again with the breaking news.  I guess /news is pretty much irrelevant now.
Turkey is part of NATO, will this require other NATO countries to protect the 'current' government by taking actions against the military group?
Turks have betrayed Ata Turk. Turks have backed an Islamic government over what the father of Turks had laid the ground works for. Turks who have the most freedom out of any Muslim nation, have spoken loud and clear. They do not want secular governments anymore. 
It's military v. Military v. Police v. Public support for coup v. Public support for erdogan. Then you've also got the Kurds...many against the coup, some I presume will see this an opportunity for advancing their own political aims, etc etc. What a complete mess.
As is tradition
The government doesn't control the military?
They're the ones throwing the coup, not overthrowing it but yes it's a bit of a tradition over there. 
This is my take. Erdogan ratcheting up control. The opposition all disavowed this coup, likely because they reached the conclusion that it was a setup, and I think they're still liable to be rounded up anyway.Erdogan wanted a huge crowd at the airport so he can land, make a triumphant speech and then declare some marshal law himself. Next it'll be President for Life Erdogan, placing the military firmly under his control followed by a purge, and a rewrite of the Constitution.
Are you saying this is a fake coup?  Not being sarcastic, seriously interested.
Fake coup then? 
Having been to Turkey, seen the jewel of Istanbul and met so many kind and friendly people there, I'm truly sorry for what's happening to your country. Take solace in the fact that tyranny cannot last forever. 
Is the coup still going on, or has it died down?
Thanks for writing that. As an American who doesn't like Erdogan, I'm disappointed that the military is losing/this might have been a fake coup so the bastard can further expand islamist bullshit. 
>All international agreements are still valid. We hope that all of our good relationships with all countries will continue. Knowing the military's purpose in Turkey, it sounds like they've still got their heads straight. Pretty interesting structure of government.
Dang I didn't know you could use a puppy filter while facetiming
Erdogan started creating a way too islamic government. Turkish military has quite a tradition in overthrowing governments to get back to democracy. 
The Turkish military has a long history of removing Islamists from power with coups, this is another go at it
I feel like this summarizes 2016 so far.
RIP Harambe
These past few years have proven why "may you live in interesting times," is a curse and not a blessing.

What a slimy, spineless little shit. 
Urging them to take to the streets and fight *people who have fucking tanks and attack helicopters*. Nothing says "I love my people" like asking them to go aggravate guys piloting 50-ton murdermachines while you desperately flee the country on a private jet.
Yeah, it didn't really last long and now he can put forward more extreme laws and reduce the power of the military who's only job since the foundation of the country was to make sure it stayed secular
Request for asylum was denied by Germany, haha. 
Wow. Theory number 2- Erdogan = literally Darth Sidious
"We are hearing that a coup is occurring in the democratically elected Turkey, the military wants to out democratically elected leader Erdogan, who was democratically elected" -CNN  
Calls people to the streets, flees instead of helping. Lmfao
Last resort definitely. Last I heard he's going to try to get asylum in Germany
This is a coherent and sensible analysis. The clumsiness of the coup suggests gross incompetence or an ulterior motive.
Yeah, I'm on holidays in Turkey right now. This really scared me, because I've never been in a similar situation. I don't know much of politics, but I hope nothing bad will happen.
Germany told Erodogan to fuck off. He's done for. It's well known he's an asshole, so the only countries to give him asylum would be Sunni Muslim countries, and I highly doubt anyone wants to do that.
exactly,now erdocunt is asking to snitch on internet coup supporters so he can hang them all as traitors.yeah thats democracy bitchez.
The is not required by the North Atlantic Treaty
Why are the Kurds against the coup, I thought they didn't like Erdogan?
Relevant username
"The president now urinates on a bucket of fish heads while the army marches in hexameter. It's a glorious day for Turkey and therefore the world."
Correct, Turkey is one of the few nations where the military is a separate entity. They were built and designed by Ataturk to make sure Turkey never turns to Islam.I don't think this is the first time they've done this, too.
That's pretty bizarre, but hey if it's stupid but it works it's not stupid. 
Or some more eager faction of the military got swindled they had more support and to go for it and are now used as scapegoats. 
Well, tyranny lasts for as long as people refuse to stand up to it. Every nation so far has shockingly, subtlety backed ergodan tonight...
As an American who knew nothing about him until an hour ago he sounds like a total douche. 
Many of the old military and police leaders have been replaced throughout the years by the current president with people who are loyal to him. It was really only a matter of time before either the people or military took back control.This coup seems more like a cleanup of all the shit that Erdogan has been putting in place. Hopefully there are no casualties and new leader can be elected.
Turkey's military also is very trusted by the general people which makes things smoother
He backed the democratically elected government, he didn't mention Erdogan by name.
It's a snapchat of a TV of a facetime.
That's the second most important thing a military should be doing. All enemy's both foreign and domestic. 
What I've read is that people really like the military and support them when they overthrow.You would then think that the people would then elect people who would please the military.Yet, obviously not. Why?
2016's Franz Ferdinand.
Shut the fuck up, Donnie
The winners write the memes
Don't worry, Germany told him to fuck off I think.
See, Germany really does screen its incoming refugees for potential terrorists...
Wonder where he's gonna try next. Russia? Greece? France? Of course, none of them are gonna take him. Especially not France, because Erodogan has taken a very weak stance on fighting Daesh, who has done way too much damage to France. 
Believe it or not that's a strong argument here. And considering Erdogan's supporters don't even hesitate to call for our death(infidels) even in peace, the guy is seen as the evil-found-body by the more educated population.Don't mistake, Erdogan's voterbase is unarmed ISIS. 
Just do as you're told for now and come back with great stories for the grandkids one day. 
Are you presently there?
Fuck CNN 
Germany rejected him, now's he's looking to the UK
The Turks there would lynch him, that's a bad idea.
If you're on holiday in the country, I suggest you contact your embassy in the country (if you have one) and ask what they advise you to do.
Military has done worse to Kurds through our history than Erdogan even including recent events. For decades when military coups were happening on the west side of Turkey military was for the lack of better term killing and pillaging east Kurd villages with no oversight or care.
Well not necessarily stopping turning back to Islam but more to stop any straying from secularity.
I don't know anything about Turkish politics or political/governmental structure. This is pretty fascinating. So in theory at least, their military is like a government watchdog? Only with constitutional power to take action?
Ataturk is my hero. I wish someone like him came to power in Iran too instead of a fucking Mulla.
I had a Simpsons level flip-flop.  "Oh a coup, that's bad." "Oh the people leading the Coup aren't doing too good, that's good." "Oh, the leader of Turkey is an Islamist with an agenda, that's bad." "Oh, the people leading the coup support democracy, that's good!". "President Obama just backed the government instead of the military, that's..."  "It's bad."
German government was even more vague: "The democratic order in Turkey must be respected."
What a time to be alive.
Isn't this the man who wanted to imprison a journalist for comparing him to Smeagol on the Internet? 
How did he get elected by a majority? Were his aims unclear prior to his election?
It is, but the dangerous bit comes in deciding who is the enemy and who is not.
Secularists in major cities like the millitary more than edrogen and his Islamist party. In the 1980 coup the millitary ruled for 3 years before democracy was resorted same.will.happen now prob if they succeed. The goal if this coup is to remove edrogen who is trying to seize more and more power 
Is it safe to assume, then, this will help to cut any potential ties Turkey may have with ISIS?
Take me out
You're out of your element. 
> Russia?Lol, my fucking sides XD. Putin is probable laughing his ass off right now.[
This country, man...
I feel like an idiot when I fantasize about being around some drama like this or a tragedy. I want to feel like I've seen REAL shit and have crazy stories. But I always remind myself that peoples lives are obviously more important.
Yes. I'm presently at a Hotel in Side quite far away from Ankara and Istanbul. Everybody, that is Turkish, here pretends like nothing happened. It's odd.
That's because Erdogan took over the Turkish media.
Tell him to fuck off, we dont want himBring him to Glasgow if you must, then we can deal with him efficently
The U.S. embassy in Turkey has said try not to go to the embassy.
Correct, but considering their position geographically it's unlikely that they'll lean to anything except Islam.
More or less, yeah. It's really confusing compared to Western powers, but it's a very interesting setup the more you read about it.
> I saw one thing saying the coup was crushed. Interesting to know it is not.It's in the interest of the defenders against the coup to make people believe it's lost, and vice versa.
Of course the government would be trying to say they're winning, please ignore the fact that they've been getting bombed constantly by the military and a tank column is en route to Istanbul to detain Erdogan.
I don't think he's really backing Erdogan it's just that if the coup fails we still have to work with him so best not to say we support the people trying to kill him. It would make meetings awkward 
I'm not sure if it's a good or bad thing that they are so good at overthrowing the governmnt.
The message from the followers of Khorne were slightly less so: "Blood for the blood god! Skulls for the skull throne!"
The very same.
Take me out inside
>Greece?Yeah, historically speaking Greece and Russia both hate Turkey more than anyone else.
The moment you do, you'll wish you didn't.
They should, better to stay calm and not 'pour out' onto the streets like erdogan says. Maybe they're used to it or expected this stuff anyway.
Even more disgusting is the call to prayer. If I was a practicing religious muslim I'd be offended my beliefs were used towards political gain WHILE RISKING MY LIFE.
What is the reasoning behind that? Is the embassy in Turkey and too dangerous to go there?
Based ataturk. I will read some books about him. Sounds like a great man. Real shame they seek to destroy his legacy. 
"What country ever existed a century and a half without a rebellion? And what country can preserve it's liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants." The exact context for the lazy. 
The government will say Erdogan has won until a helicopter is flying his hanged body through the streets.
Like when the US voiced tacit support for the 2002 coup in Venezuela, during the brief period when it looked like it would stick.
Personally, I think if you're in a region that has a risk of Islam coming to town and taking over, it's probably a good thing to say, "hey, FYI...military can come in and protect the people's democratic rights."
Say what you will about khorne, but we always know where he stands. A real straight shooter.
Under most circumstances, I'm decidedly against a military coup of a democratically elected leader. For this one, I think my feelings are pretty mixed.
Can't take out
Erdogan is a fucking moron. He's going to get his own people killed.
They probably say this because it would mean leaving shelter to go there, and if the embassy is attacked, there is a higher chance of civilian casualties.
That's because if it's a coup and it's in Latin America the United States is almost always the one throwing it.
Yeah that's assuming the Army never undergoes a religious awakening.  I know it's super unlikely as they think it's their job to be secular, but weirder things have happened.
The main problem with democracy, and its greatest internal contradiction:What happens when a leader or government is democratically elected, which seeks to undermine or dissolve the very democracy that brought them to power?
TAAAAAAAKE MEEEEEE
Good way to demonize the military, no?
no way would they attack the embassy - isn't that pretty much declaring war on the us?
Then it's fair game to kick them out.
Knowing how much of a dick he is, he's probably willing to use his own people as pawns.
But how do you kick them out when democracy has been subverted?  In other words, is it ideologically consistent to "save" democracy through undemocratic actions?
97 - sarcastic, grungy, smoking more cigarettes, more clique-y and edgy 07 - petty, attention starved, overwhelmed, but much nicer 17 - under so many layers of irony and memes they dont even know who they are anymore or care. there's no point in being creative or devolving a personality, anything you could think of has already been done.  
Devices and helicopter parenting, which doesn't mean parents who are intensely concerned about their children's futures, but parents who never leave their damn kids alone.
my dad taught middle school from 1968-2004,when he retired i asked him what changes he saw in students from the beginning of his teaching career to the end.he answered;"the kids never changed. a teenager is always a teenager. the parents however, changed dramatically. they used to respect teachers and side with us in disciplinary matters, but now they think their kids are perfect and we are wrong. glad i'm getting out before it gets worse."
1997 - "You won't always have a calculator with you everywhere you go in life!"2017 - "Before beginning the test, every student must disable the multi-function calculator that goes with them everywhere in life."
No phones.Small phones. Big phones. 
Going to sound like an old man here, but when I was in high school in '97 we had a system where various teachers aides would photocopy all of the notes, answer keys, homeworks, etc. and put into an unused locker.  My whole class - even the future valedictorian - used that locker.  I'd imagine cheating efforts have advanced since then.
The 2017 students don't seem so... Alive**EDIT** This was a very shit Daft Punk joke that has now sparked debate about student life and satisfaction
1997: Colorful hair and piercings 2007: no Colorful hair, lots of tattoos2017: Colorful hair and tattoos(I teach in college)Oh the other difference was 1997: No one talked about being gay, 2007: students came out to me privately in my office, 2017: Students talk about being gay in class 
'97 - "Quit passing notes"'07 - "Quit texting"'17 - "Are you seriously watching Netflix right now?"
Senior Pranks in 1997 were outlandish and acceptable. Senior Pranks in 2007 were less common and more basic. In 2017 Senior Pranks are illegal.
TI 83 is still king.
Different consoles used to play Pokemon.
Electronics. Hands down.  They are the most wonderful gift and the biggest handicap at the same time.  Too many students use them as crutches or distractions instead of using it as a tool.  
The whole be cool stay in school thing seemed to work I'm not a teacher but I used to volunteer as a middle school basketball coach. Kids take school more seriously than when I was a kid. Which is a great thing.
I can't say with 100% confidence, but I bet kids weren't dabbing on teachers every day in 1997 & 2007. 
Students from 1997 and 2007 got to enjoy Daft Punk's Alive concerts
It's no longer frowned upon to be fucking your 1997 students.
Am I the only one who's currently a student and not relating to the descriptions the teachers are giving about today's students? Like my classmates are incredibly rude and lazy. Not diligent and polite. 
Ya everyone in school lives on 7 layers of irony and I love it 
But how dare your father not give their *little angel* an a+ on everything.What's frustrating is that the same parents that read your post will likely agree with you.  But then a teacher gives *their* kid a bad grade?  Well, now that changes everything.
Once you hit college: you better have brought your calculator mother fucker, no we don't have one for you to borrow.
But I rocked a rad pager during my senior year in 1997!!!
Next is big *thin* phones
Now it's just "you do that assignment?" "I got it from Johnny you need it?" "Yeah send it" then we just text pictures over
You mentioned gap years so not sure if you're American. But I don't know how most American students can consider a master's with the current cost of education. Some careers it's obviously necessary, but I can't for the life of me figure out what people getting MBAs right after undergrad are thinking...tacking on that kind of extra debt seems insane. I've never once heard someone with an MBA say it was worth it. The wages aren't that different. Unless their employers are paying for it idk why you'd do it. 
Failure in the past was mostly accepted and treated as an indication the student didn't understand the concept. Failure was a teaching tool.Now failure is seen as a character flaw so parents don't teach kids how to come back from it, they're just taught to avoid it at all costs.
Is this a Daft Punk joke?
2017 student hereCan confirm. Am not.
I'm class of 2014. There's nothing to be alive about, you work insanely hard at school for a future you can't care about. No one really has goals or hobbies besides do well
> 2007: students came out to me privately in my officethat's interesting to me. What were their motives to explain themselves to a teacher?
thanks for your post!
My little brother just recently graduated high school. During his junior year, another student streaked at a football game.  He was arrested and they tried to get him booked as a sex offender. He ended up killing himself. It was devastating, many many people were horrifie at the school's reaction. I remember my parents specifically saying that streaking at a big game would've been frowned upon but ultimately not a big deal when they were in school.
Nah, TI-84s are far more prevalent in my HS. Especially the new sim ones.
Its called something "digital migrants". When we were young we didn't have smartphones nor simple mobiles. They just arrived so we slowly learned it, but not correctly ( well i myself is still slow with smartphones however I love my kindle reader) and then there is who born into the smartphone era. They are the "digital natives"? Or some short... They see this stuff while they are young like 0-4-10years old so their brain catches up faster and easyer for them to learn. You can see the technological usage between generations.
The connection between all generations, Pokemon
As a high school teacher, I definitely agree that kids these days have an extreme reliance on their parents. Instead of approaching me about a grade, they have their parent email me. If a student emails me, it is along the lines of "hey fam can u tell me what homework i missed". The majority of kids have no idea how to appropriately email someone. Also, I can say something in class and within 20 minutes get an email from a parent of a kid in that class. Parents are involved to a point that is ultimately detrimental to their child. 
I feel like this account of your teacher conference will be the realest thing I read this week.
I feel like this was what was portrayed in 21 jump street 
When I was a kid in the 90s my school took us on a field trip to the internetWe all loaded up in a bus and went to a high school in the city that had access to the internet, and learned how to use web search tools like webcrawler and askjeeves 
I like how /r/prequelmemes is so big high school teachers are specifically aware of it.  
Born too late to explore the Earth, born too soon to explore the galaxy. Born just in time to post dank memes.
There is actually something called "Google amnesia" that exists where it does just what you say. People aren't remembering the facts but instead are memorizing where the facts can be found, the internet 
Under what law could they have arrested you?
> 2 days in and we see a helicopter, then a coast Guard vessel, then we're boarded by us government guys with guns who say "alright, boys, what is it today, you moving guns or drugs?""Quick fellas, ditch the rum ham!"
I was under the impression dabbing died with 2016. Was hoping anyway.
Where I am, heroin has become the new thing within the last 5 ish years. Weed is normal. 
> some 16-year-old with mutton chops will spring out to open it for meWhat year is it?!
You could fuck someone born in 1997
Dude on my bus in the 8th grade stopped coming to school.  Someone sold him poison ivy and told him it was weed and he smoked it.  Don't think he died, but we never heard from him again.
This happened at my high school in 2014...
97 - racial slurs07 - you retard17 - ~ironic~racism, homophobia, sexism, etc
It's even worse when a professor says "Go ahead and cache the entire internet on your laptop and bring it to the exam. It won't help you. Have fun."
A Google drive or a network for the students to share everything, making cheating streamlined and efficient.
MBA is a networking degree. You should get it after excelling in the private sector. Kids who get them asap miss out.
God damn if this isn't the truth and most of us are still dealing with the repercussions of not knowing how to handle failure. 
So we're inching closer to Japanese culture and are about to start seeing NEETS lock themselves up in their parents house?
That's because failure now has severe consequences.  The path to a successful future is now seen as so incredibly narrow that any failure along the way, even a small one, is likely to knock you off the path.  How is Johnny ever going to get into Harvard Law if he gets a C in high school chemistry?
2017 studentCan confirm. Would rather be dead.Not joking.
Are you human after all?
To be fair, this description sounds pretty much exactly like my life in high school graduating in 2006. It was fucking exhausting. I just kept doing more and more and grinding through the work until I pretty much had a nervous breakdown midway through college. 
Yup class of 2018. I was literally crying last week because I realized all I care about right now is my grades and that I'm so caught up in it that I can't even answer the questions "what are your interests?" Or "what do you do for fun?"
Not OP, but I'd guess they likely are students who consider OP a mentor or friend.
School will never stop blocking sites.
I'm 16 and go to a public high school. Everyone I know uses the open school wifi along with a plethora of different VPN apps.
I just use a VPN to do whatever I want on school wifi.
this happened at my school but the administration got wind of it and had a "random fire drill" during the time when the alarms were going to go offso by the time we got back inside, all the alarms had stopped ringing....
The whole idea of a "Sex offender" has become so warped and diluted. It is no longer just for people who pose an actual sexual threat by means of rape or molestation, it is now a catch all for anyone unfortunate enough to have had somebody see them naked. Drunk and peeing in the bushes when a kid sees you? BOOM, Sex Offender. Harmless streaking prank? BOOM, Sex offender... 
That's absolutely terrible. I remember seeing streakers on America's Funniest Home Videos (albeit censored) and Bob Saget and the audience would laugh. I have no idea what is happening to our society but at the very most the guy should have gotten a misdemeanor for disturbing the public or something. There are far too many laws and regulations for the land of the free
North AL?
They should have gotten extra graduation points for making funny Reformation jokes!
That is really creative!
Three kids got arrested for trespassing and missed the last day in school my senior year. They were going to put face paint and a wig on a statue of a teacher helping a student that was in the courtyard. they did not even have to hop a fence or pick a lock but apparently showing up to school at 5 in the morning was illegal as shit. 
> And how one year couple drunk seniors threw it off a bridge. This makes me think the prank restrictions are probably a good thing.
TI-84 Plus CE is a work of art
I lived literally through the "hey, look, Internet!" and "hey, look, cell phones!" age. Maybe it's because I was tech inclined, but I learned very quickly to use both really well.There are a lot of people from my generation that don't, though.
And Star Wars.
I'm right there with you. I've had that experience twice. The first time it happened, they actually drove two hours and met with me and the student. Very awkward. The moment when I realized that the student had basically been lying to their parents about their performance/effort *and attendance record* in the class... 
This is so alien to me. It used to be everyone wanted to avoid classes that had part of the grade based on attendance because then you could skip and just show up for exams.
Well, AP classes *are* supposed to be specifically preparatory for the AP exam. So I'd blame the nature of the exam over the teaching style of the individuals. 
When I was in 7th grade, circa 2009, my school had a policy where if the student completed 50% or more of the homework, whether or not it was correct, earned a 9/10 grade. The only thing it taught was 12 year old me to do half plus one of the work and get an average grade. I blame that for my half ass work ethic now. 
I laughed when he said she was hot.     (it's probably a plus that she gets along with his daughter)  
That's exactly what I was thinking. I mean I think that movie exaggerated it (the cool kids don't think that "organized sports are so fascist"), but I do think it's true that the nicer, more accepting kids today are the "cool" ones.
I saw a prequel meme in another teacher's PowerPoint, it was a surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one. 
That was why I always hated history in school.  It was a lot of memorizing dates and names, which seemed useless to me.  Id rather we learn about what happened than exactly when it happened.
'I was born far too late to discover the lands,  And the seas, and the skies, and the shores and the sands.  All the steps have been stepped, and the walks have been walked,  And the sights have been seen, and the talks have been talked.'I was born far too soon to discover the stars,  And I'll never set foot on the red dust of Mars.  I shall only encounter the future in dreams -  But at least I have memes.  But at least I have memes.'    
We were 18 at the time and just didn't know better. We do now and that shit wouldn't fly today. We also didn't want to spend our vacation in jail, so we docked in the Florida Keys a few days and went back home instead of the bahamas.
Charged with "Adventure and Living the Good Life".Verdict: Guilty as sin.
No not the rum ham
I'm seeing a few responses similar to this below.  I can't help but wonder if this is a result of these kids knowing they'll be competing for fewer and fewer jobs that pay less and less in the near future. 
The year where Logan just came out.
I was born in 1997 (looks at side camera), ladies
Not sure how you roll poison ivy without noticing what it is.
Start to? That's already in full swing.
Probably, considering our future economy is likely to resemble Japan's more and more in the future. Over-educated and under-employed young people working part-time work to eke out a living and finding satisfaction in personal pursuits rather than career ambitions.
NEETS?
Not just on an academic level. God forbid you make a mistake in front of others then the whole world will know because of social media. 
I graduated 5 years ago, but I think it's that social media showcases the best of peers' lives and most people can't understand that enough to overcome that bias, so everyone feels inadequate compared to everyone else. 
me too thanks
I feel like I'm beyond a nervous breakdown. I've gone past it and now I'm just in this intermediary where no amounts of stress gives me urgency anymore. 
Yep and also I teach/do research on sex/sexuality topics so a lot of students come out to me.  
My school wifi literally blocks google
That's when you get a VPN
I assume the only reason they haven't blocked all those apps is that your IT guys must also use those programs to stream video content all day.
That's awesome. They fucking played you guys.
The really funny thing is due to the internet more younger children are now aware of human anatomy and sexuality than ever. The parent's whole "won't someone think of the children" has now become willful ignorance. Your child has probably seen more porn than you have.
I got the pleasure of watching a drunk guy outside of a frat house pissing on the side of the house when campus police confronted him. They told him they saw him pissing, and the dude's response was "That's impossible. My dick is so tiny you couldn't have seen it!" Campus police left him alone after making such a watertight argument. 
It's not laws and regulations that are the problem.  (Except for zero tolerance policies). There are certainly cases where you'd want a naked guy hanging around school to be brought up on sex offender charges.The problem is everyone, especially school administrators, being unwilling to use common sense.
In my senior class of 09 we all brought one golf ball with us to our graduation. After we each walked and shook the principals' hand, we would give him our golf ball. After quite a few walks the principal was frantically cradling about 20 golf balls as they keep falling and bouncing everywhere. His pockets were absolutely stuffed with them as well. Half way through someone just brought out a bucket for him to throw them in. Innocent yet amusing.
Sophomore year sounded good.
No, they should have been burned at the stake for condoning heresy.
For any who are wondering. No the goat didn't survive. it was a very shallow river and about 20-35 feet above.
If you've ever used a TI-84 Plus C you'll realize how amazing the CE really is
Been in IT for 30 years, beginning on the "big iron". It's the pace of change that is different. Related is, which horse do you want to ride (.net, java, Ruby, etc.)? My kids still roll their eyes at me because, for example, I can't get something to work on it. But when they have computer problem, who do they come to first? Yup, dear old Dad!!
If the student was 18, it's their life. 
It just all flowed together in a way that suggested he was making a genuine comparison at all levels on his radar with no regard to the perception we might have of him. Just a slice of life.
The brilliance of this poem is that it is truly depressing. I'm impressed and depressed at the same time. 
Yea but you didn't do anything wrong I don't understand.
High Seas is 24 miles from shore, I believe. In international waters, you are still operating under the jurisdiction and the laws of the country whose flag you are flying. Also, piracy is illegal--pirates are considered "Enemies of all Mankind" and thus all nations are free to persecute them on the high seas.
That would be my hypothesis as well. Kids in high school now have, in a way, had the veil lifted that was on students 10 years ago. Most of them seem to realize that their future isn't as bright and open as everyone was telling them it would be when they were kids. 
Good for him.
Fuck this guy, pick me! Pick me!
The best advice I ever got from a mentor was before the first interview of my career:  "Never stress about interviews.  They already want you.  The reason they interview you is to make sure you're normal."
\*raises glass\*
Now if only we had a nationwide transit network like they do...
Social Media has truly shown how narcissism and low self esteem is a pandemic. The only people that get joy out of others misfortune are people that are not happy with themselves and have to get that small feeling of being above someone else. Before social media the trend started with watching reality TV. I can't wait to see what the next 'ego boost' machine will be.
This is very important. People don't realize that we don't post our bad shit on social media, only our best. We shouldn't compare other people's highlight reel with our behind the scenes. 
That's a real bummer, I don't know your situation but are there really no teachers that give positive reinforcement, friends, family, coaches, etc?
It would seem from the sentiment in these comments that you've all been thrust into adulthood early. (Correct me if I'm wrong; that's my interpretation.) It's like you have adult rat-race-stress and society hasn't yet let you in the maze.
That's messed up.  Google and Wikipedia, etc are literally an extension of our brains these days.  
They most probably know you're using one. They don't care, but they know.
My wife's a teacher. Teenagers are soooo bad at keeping shit a secret. Like, teachers have ears, ya know?
Nice. Our senior prank (2009) was to go to Michael's, buy a BUNCH of glitter in our school colours that we sneaky poured out while walking down the main hall.Glitter.... THEY WILL REMEMBER US FOREVER IF THEY LIKE IT OR NOT.
Yeah.. I remember when my son was 9, I was checking his computer history, and he had searched for "nekid veginas".  After I excused myself to laugh for 10 minutes, we had another sex talk 
When I tried to have 'the talk' with my then 9 or 10 year old she told me, don't worry mom, I have the internet. I checked to make sure she actually knew facts not bs and she was good to go. 
See, this is a senior prank that is funny and not just kids being assholes. When my husband was in high school (as a junior; I teach at this school now and have heard the story), some seniors snuck in the school and straight up vandalized shit--destroyed the school emblem on the brand new commons floor, shot off all the fire extinguishers, put glue into most of the locks, tipped over the shelves in the library...all shit that was just criminal and not at all funny.
It would have been great! If they had used whipped cream, or almost any other type of sticky food item that didn't have a deadly allergy related to it.
I have a soft spot in my heart for goats this is awful
I have the TI-84 Plus CE and it's my favorite calculator. No ragrets on spending $190 on it
My dad learned to program on Fortran. When we looked at my Sophmore year high school schedule and saw the PASCAL course he called it "new fanlged.". This was 1999.
I had a doctor send my parents out of the room to tell me I had an STI, but then when they came back in went on to discuss how I should tell my partners to get tested, etc. defeats the point, dude.
Her ass was thick as hell.  My wife and I discussed it more than we talked about my kid's grade.
Not doing anything wrong and not having your day/holiday/life fucked over by over-zealous police are not mutually exclusive, sadly. 
Pirates aren't MY enemies, checkmate international law.
I graduated in 2014 and this was exactly the problem. Our history teacher called us the disillusioned generation. We knew the world sucked and we didn't have time to mess around. We all had jobs and did early college or got certificates if we could. I knew a few kids who wore suits every day for their internships after school. Not even a rich area, but we worried.
Yeah we were told we could be whatever we wanted, and that there were plenty of well-paying jobs. With the globalization of social media and communication, it's impossible to lie to children anymore.
Bingo. My son is only 12 but I'm teaching him C++ and emphasising math and science. I barely graduated high school in 2002 and quickly realized that there were no well paying jobs for the undereducated. Not to mention the unhappiness that comes with being undereducated. My son will not go through the same struggles.
I had an interview for an internship, but they also interviewed 40 people for the position....Apparently they didn't want me. I didn't have enough experience to get the internship to get experience.
Yep. Rates are way up. 16-21 seems to be the "danger zone" Fun fact. Female teens are more likely to attempt suicide.Male ones are more likely to succeed in the attempt. 
Of Mountain Dew?
We westernized long before we got rid of our shogunate so it's unlikely we will get the set of circumstances that will lead to that. We haven't even gotten a first shogun.
I took me like a month at my job to have my Internet Access unrestricted.My job:Programmer.
can confirm, my high school blocks almost all VPNs and I got a detention for hosting my own VPN at my house
The IT guy knows, but he's likely too overworked and underpaid to give a damn. The school administration probably thinks that VPN is some kind of illicit drug.
My school's senior ditch day was ruinedBecause a senior asked her dad if she could participate in itHer dad was the principal 
Jesus. I guarantee there are still teachers there who despise you guys because they're still finding glitter everywhere. That's almost satanic.
When my son was the same age I found "girls who are not wearing underpants" in his browser history.  I actually still can't type that without giggling.
This is why I think it's awesome that pornhub now has a sex education channel to talk about the reality about sex.It's kind of fucked that we now need porn sites to properly educate people on sex, since schools aren't doing it.
If only that riverbed would have had a soft spot for goats...R.I.P. goat bro
I'm not sure the pirates would agree.
If he's able to learn C++ well right off that bat that is great. I never had any programming until college and once I did get some taste of programming I loved it.If your child isn't keen to take on C++ (as it might be a little 'dry' for a youngin') you might look to the higher 'framework' languages (like swift, or .net framework with C#) which don't get into the dirty parts that C++ will have, but will increase his interest in programming. I hope your son is enjoying programming. I love the ability to 'make solutions' that programming allows.Good Luck!
Most males use suicide such as hanging or guns which will kill you pretty quick and usually works. Females tend to use something like OD on pills or slitting wrists which is slower and is less reliable? (If that's the right word for it)
Man i want a shogun
Worked for a company that was working for Dell. Part of my job was to remote into other computers to do stuff and fix issues.Took about 2 or so months for them to allow me Internet access. Yet they still couldn't work out why I didn't do work during that time, even though they had been told numerous times.Yeh I worked in a place that didn't want to give me Internet access to do a job that requires the Internet.  
Am surprised you got caught, school administration is normally very tech illiterate. I could have told them straight up that I use a VPN and they would think it was done kind of drug.
Jesus, schools are getting really strict these days. When I installed games or by passed the school security all I got was a: "don't show others students how you did this and how did you do that?".
Our senior ditch day was ruined because our "valedictorian" had her mom ask the school if it was an excused absence. Are you fucking kidding me?? The answer was in the name!
Oh, bless her heart.
You mostly get girls in underpants with those search words. It is important to be able to use google in a good way, so you need to have a talk with him.
My brother was 6 years old when he googled, "naked ladies." I was blamed for it at first until the kid admitted to it. Probably the first time I wasn't the one who got in trouble haha
...since parents aren't doing it.I had the first "talk" with my son at 10. (Basic plumbing, dangers of becoming a young father, and mention of disease and the possibility of his weiner falling off.) Small discussions and questions along the way since. We'll have the final talk this year as he turns 13. (Foreplay, what diseases and why you might wish they actually made your weiner fall off, consent and the danger of being labeled a sex offender, emotional harm, etc.)
I had a few friends that got the shit kicked out of them in a police interrogation that took place on the streets of a quiet suburb.  They were looking for drugs, and they really weren't accepting the fact that there were none.  We were all around age 16 at the time, and some old lady had called in saying that we were doing drugs in the woods.  We were setting up a fort and just talking.
I had someone call my license plate in because they thought I was selling drugs with all the people coming over to my house. They thought deodorant on my car seat was coke and searched my car threatening to bring me down to the station if I don't give them my phone without a passcode. They found nothing but cops will do anything it seems.
As long as he seeds he's alright with me!
Wow. That's... really damn stupid. 
There's some sleeper IT guys in school administration.  It's a steady paying gig with regular hours that you're usually doing by yourself, and with little supervision.  For someone coming out of corporate life it's easy enough to look past the pay cut and take the easy pope gig, and get paid to troll high school students all day.  
expelled for using this new VPN drug in school. 
How was it ruined? Just ditch like normal. Them knowing ahead of time or not doesn't change anything.
The only talk I ever got was when my dad told me "If you get a girl pregnant, you don't have to marry them.  Pay for an abortion, take care of the kid, be a father, whatever, but only marry someone if you actually want to marry that person.  You can be a parent without having to be married to the other parent.  Both sides being happy for themselves is best for the kid."
Unlock your phone so I can illegally search it or I'm going to arrest you! 
So was it actually coke? I'm not a cop I swear.
Aye, that be the code
Right? Here I am, 28 years old, successful in IT, and proud that I have my own VPN at home...and kids are getting detention for it now?! Get off my lawn! 
>  get paid to troll high school students all day.Is this the revised version of The American Dream?
Who is this hacker VPN and do teens ingest it anally with tampons? News at 11.
At my school, when the administration caught wind of a skip day, they would enforce rules very strictly for an unexcused absence, meaning your teachers had to give you zeros for anything missed that day and it also opened you up to getting put into detention.I more than made up for that time my senior year when I'd skip out on pep rallies. Not too upset about not having a skip day.
"Your mother and I have decided it's time to chat with you about Search Engine Optimization"
I hadn't done coke at this time in my life, yet. It was old spice original. I always keep a stick in my car.
They're more like guidelines.
Whenever they sleep, they dream of being at work
A lot of these are just things you'd ask a genie, not a foundation.I'd have them pour water on my enemy's face 15 minutes after he falls asleep. Every time.
Unfiltered empathy for everyone and everything.
Someone asks them a question any time they take a bite or sip of something.
have to work for the make a curse foundation having to inflict all of this and ensure it all works
Their pasta sauce will never cling to their spaghetti. 
As soon as they fall asleep at night they will be startled awake by a loud scream from inside their home and only they will be able to hear it. 
Get the biggest boner in the most awkward and humiliating situations and only get a half boner when they actually want one.
All critical emails, mail and other indirect correspondence simply wouldn't reach their intended recipients. Mundane stuff would go through as usual though so rather than being able to identify the curse, the target would merely feel alone and ignored in the world.
Anytime they try to poop, they just fart. Whenever they try to just let a simple fart out, they poop.
Their internet connection will disconnect at random. Also when they are going to watch a video, their connection will be slowed so the video stops to buffer often.
Cursed to always have sticky toddler hands.
Make everything in their life slightly too _____.For example, maybe they'd go to a restaurant that's slightly too far away from their house, only to be waited by a slightly too chatty (and therefore slightly too slow) waitress. Their meal would be slightly too salty, or perhaps slightly too bland. It would cost slightly too much, and be slightly too cold. I think you get the idea (In fact, I think I explained slightly too much).
Speaking as someone who has been battling a cold for a week, I would inflict the curse of the nose whistle. Once an hour, the noise would spontaneously resolve, only to start again 30 seconds later. 
The TV picture is always slightly delayed.
Random people would come up to them while they are around coworkers/family/people who matter and say things like: "Wasn't that orgy wild?  Hope to see you at the next one!""Hey, what is that herpes medicine that you use called?""Where are your seats for the Nickleback concert?"
An itch down at the bone that moves through their body in varying intensities.It can never be scratched properly and it can't be adjusted for. Just a constant itch ranging from inconvenience to straight up agony 
Replace all of their sugar with salt... I am a simple man  
I'd remove their brain / mouth filter. Everything they think will be spoken aloud. 
Show them what would have happened if they said 'yes' all those years ago...
Every time they introduce themselves people mishear their name and call them a slightly wrong name. If they spell it out people add extra/incorrect vowels for no reason. 'Grant Smith' 'So that's Gareth Smythe, right?' 
I'd send a pack of fleas to everyone that stops in the middle of a corridor when they know there are other people walking through it
every time they google somthing important, it rickrolls them and deletes browser history
Tastebuds in their asshole
Every time they walk through a doorway, glitter falls on them. 
Profuse sweating from every single pore, especially when other people are looking at them.
No matter what the temperature of the area they are sleeping in is, they will always be too hot. The pillow will never have a cold side either
Chronic kidney stones
Every time they find a flake of glitter on them and wipe it off, 2 more appear in its place at random spots on the body.
Every time they take their FIRST drink of a beverage it will be all dust in their mouth and they have to swallow it to be able to drink any liquid. If they keep spitting it out they will not get any liquid to quench the dryness in their mouth. Once they swallow the dust, the drink will work until it is empty. If they refill the drink, it again produces a mouthful of dust that needs to be swallowed first.
For them to lose memory of every time they've ever felt joy, happiness, or fulfillment and to never be able to feel those emotions again. For them to always feel thirsty. 
Nerasin's Complaint - They have an ulcer. Any time they contemplate an evil act, gastric acid floods their stomach.
One papercut per day until I die.
To fall deeply in love with someone that won't love them back. 
To make a death snail follow them
Functioning hair follicles on the inside of their eyelids.
To give them constantly terrible internet.  In brief moments, they get hope that it will work, but then crashes, goes off an on all the time.  Long load times.  This is the true equivalent of hell.  Having an internet connection...  that is useless.  Like a cigar but no way to light it.
They'd have a persistent, rock-hard erection that never goes away... until they try to relieve it. They'd experience immediate flaccidity any time they try to have sex or masturbate, thus depriving them of any sexual pleasure or release.As soon as they give up trying... BOOM! Boner time again.
Stelio contos will appear at random times and beat them up. They will hear the song and can run but they cant hide from the true wonder who works at klinkos
They can't round the tv volume up to multiples of 10 or 5 
B.O that they cannot wash or perfume away. They will stink everywhere they go.
They miss anything they throw or drop, every time. Even if all they do is drop something an inch above a table it flies to the edge and drops to the floor. 
Replace their IV drip with LSD, turn off the lights, play sounds of children crying. 
Every bowel movement should be excruciatingly painful, but should alternate between liquid stools and constipation. 
Opposite co-ordination. Every time they want to make a left turn whilst driving, they turn right. They wanna grab something on a shelf? Their arm moves down instead. They also read signs mirrored too, so if a sign says left to them, it means right.
They are given a pie. They cannot eat anything else or drink anything other than water until the pie is completely eaten. They don't have to eat the pie in one sitting, but it is the only food they are allowed to eat until it is gone.The pie is made from green (IE not ready to eat at all) strawberries and has no sugar added.Also, if they don't finish the pie in one sitting, the people at Make-A-Curse will discreetly replace the pie with a more-complete pie every now and then, so the curse continues on forever.
Spoilers. Just... spoilers. They will never enjoy an new movie ever again
For them to suddenly have a undying fetish that would make normal relationships impossible. Like Paraphilic infantilism or Necrophelia etc
10 thousand octopuses all over their house and car 
Insomnia, it would take them at least 2 hours to fall asleep.
Since everyone else is doing curses instead of single acts I'll follow suit... I'm a robotics guy. So my enemy would be too (if I have one?) whenever they supply voltage to something it's either 10 times more to 10 times less than they think it is. The amount of magic blue smoke they will release... 
To shove a thin glass tube full of rock salt and sand down their penis; then roll their penis with a dough roller thus breaking glass tube.
Anytime they love (person or pet) that subject developes a terminal illness. They have to spend their life either alone or watching their loved ones dying.
Constant vomiting 
Full body herpes
IMO this is the most brutal and demoralizing thing I've read in this thread.  Even if you love your job and this happens it's hell. 
I don't know why but this was the only one that made me laugh out loud. 
I was thinking "for them to become intensely aware of everyone they've ever hurt," but this is even worse. 
How would that work if they were home alone? Would someone just break into their house exclusively to ask them questions?
Every. Server. Ever. 
Yeah, I can't imagine Mr. Salt n' Glass Penis-Tube up there sleeps well at night.
You monster
Found the Golden Girls fan.
You have to let them get some sleep, otherwise they'll die from sleep deprivation.Let's make it random whether the scream goes off or not. Maybe 1 out of 10 times. Enough so that on the outside they appear to be functioning normally but they're being slowly driven insane by Satan jacking their Bluetooth speaker.
Exploding head syndrome. Happens to me, look it up
But wouldn't getting half a boner be an awkward situation, thus giving you a full boner? 
Sounds like my average day already 
So you're giving them a Time Warner subscription?
But any advertisement will load in perfect HD and have no buffering.
I wake up every morning in a bed that's too small, drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little... but on pretzel day... well, I like pretzel day...
Could this randomly work in their favor though? Like maybe his job earns him slightly too much? Or the taxi drive home was slightly too slow, and allowed him to avoid a car accident?
I'd prefer giving them that feeling of having to cough but no matter how much they cough nothing ever comes up. They keep coughing because they figure "This time, something will break loose and I'll have some relief" but no. No relief. They keep coughing because there's something in their lungs but it never comes out.
I'd give them a kinda runny nose whenever they go inside, and make sure that they can never find the tissues they thought they had on them. They would have to wick the snot away every few minutes and they would hope that nobody notices...Source: have had some kind of shitty half-cold for a few weeks which has no symptoms except for this.
So a shitty YouTube video that always happens to be the only video of something you're trying to watch.
I have one of those stereotypical Asian parents. One of my friends would just randomly blurt out "Hey, when was that paper you needed to write due?" or "Are you ready for the math test?" and for the next week, my mom would be all "Pbghin! No playing video games, you have test coming up!" I'd correct her, but the idea of "there might be a test/paper/project due" outweighs the idea of "James is a shit-stirring asshole."
I have no feeling in parts of my right arm. No feeling, that is, except for when it's itchy. I can feel the itch, but *I can't feel it when I scratch*! It's like nothing is happening. And the itch just stays there for hours, maybe even a day or two. It's literally an itch I can't scratch and it drives me nuts!
Just give them the world's itchiest asshole and leave it at that. 
Oh god, this made my skin crawl.
Even worse: an itch on the sole of their foot, where the skin is thick, so you can't quite work out where the itch is, and you can never quite scratch it.
And replace all of their salt with calcium bromide.
Time to castrate myself, because if people knew the sexual thoughts I was having then they'd run away.
Now that.... THAT is evil.
Christ almighty, it's difficult to imagine what that would be feel like. Nice curse
This is already my life. It's not so bad.
Do I have this curse? Did you curse me?
So they become a white kid?
Hold off on this, I'm experimenting with behavioral altering by purposefully stumbling into them. Especially if they have their fucking laptop open walking around.
Bullet ants* FTFY
Sounds like a great idea for a chrome extension
A ring pop would be double the pleasure.
Did you know that you already HAVE taste buds in your ass? They just don't do anything!
Very detailed. Almost as if it's...happened before?
Anything u need to talk about OP?
Just picturing this being implemented is hilarious. In places like the person's home or work, a device of some sort could be placed above the door to dispense glitter. For other places though I can only imagine someone hanging above the door waiting for this person to walk under or someone would have to follow the person with a bottle of glitter and sprinkle it on them every time. I think in order to not be predictable, each doorway would have to have a different person who pours the glitter. 
I know the question said short of murder, but does driving someone to suicide count?
I would feel so special. It is like a party whenever I enter a place!
as someone with hyperhidrosis and social anxiety this is just another day for me 
Joke's on you; they will utilize this for free clean energy generation, making millions!!
Who hurt you
They then become histories greatest explorer since they can sleep outdoors in the arctic or on everest
I like this. Very creative. You have a talent. You're probably on a CIA recruitment list somewhere.
Just make small first sips?
Who hurt you so bad as to be this evil? 
Dementors...
On the bit between your finger and thumb? Or between toes?
Alright, I thought we were doing funny comments here, not ones which hurt.

Thanks to a one-two punch of OCD and synesthesia, I can't round the tv volume to multiples of five, so come at me.
This is fucking horrible, maybe the worse not violent one for me. I have a pretty serious drug problem and usually the only time ill stop and go home is after a few days because I smell, I don't know why but for me being smelly is maybe the. Most embarrassing thing, strangely more than being a drug addict. 
that's clever as fuck, and would be insanely inconvenient.
Would pouring something, like a cup of milk, be included?
My wife and i agreed that if either of us was terminal, instead of stringing it out by "making us comfortable", we bail on the hospital, say goodbye to our loved ones, and go on a bender, that for the terminal one, wont end.
But if they read a left-sign (and understand right) they will try to go right but then go left because they always turn wrong, which makes them right again....?
Pretty sure necropheliacs wouldnt have an undying fetish...
[ ](/absilly)Pft, you can totally have a normal relationship as a necropheliac! Your SO just has to be dead. There are so many choices, too, just head down to your local cemetery and browse to your hearts content. 
Ok, that's a unique one. But it's pretty evil too. The octopi would almost certainly die pretty much immediately so you're gonna have some nasty rotting octopus everywhere for a few weeks, at least until it rains.

It never used to happen then I got a few really bad migraines and now it happens a few times a week. Right as I fall asleep there is a bright flash and a bang. I bet I have a tumor or something.

Thank God I didn't have friends until my parents stopped giving a shit and moved on to shaming my brother for being a disgrace to the dynasty 
They could also just not wear socks? IDK if it's really a problem is you can just not bother.
Have you tried using a mirror and scratching where the itch is on the other arm? You might be able to trick your brain into feeling the scratching. 
Can't,  I'm not giving anyone my asshole.
No, that's the itch moving around.
And replace all of their calcium bromide with sugar
Then it just turns into "Back before I was castrated, I'd totally have tapped that."
Mine too - first name is weird, last name is so long it never fits on forms which holds up getting a new phone/Internet/power connection every time I move house. 
It's *Christineth* you asshole! Get it right! 
I'm confused, isn't the stereotype that black people do that?  As in A-Aron?
Sure thing laqueeshafaenda
Try to look out for the contractors testing signal strength for telecom. They get shit on enough and actually serve a purpose stopping and finding dead spots etc.
Bullet ants are relatively common and chill unless you fuck with then. Fleas will mess your shit up regardless.

Similar to when you're warm after consuming alcohol, you will still die in cold temps no matter how warm you feel. :/  
"Too hot" which means they would start sweating. You probably don't want to start your day in the arctic covered in sweat.
Yes, psychological damage is what I am going for for my last act of revenge if I found out I'm going to die from terminal illness. 
I guess it's a mouthful regardless of how much you drink. So they drink a drop, spit the dust out, rinse and repeat until they make billions from the dust-selling industry.

I'm used to it. Doesn't even hurt anymore.

holy fuck, your username.
Admitting you have a problem is 9/10ths of the law
oh no my plan is flawed. i've been cursed with stupidity on my death bed!! gosh darn that jim!
It was a torture method, think used in WWII, make men get an erection, shove a glass tube in their penis.  Then you thwack it repeatedly to break the glass.  Then you force them to drink a lot of water.  Thus you end up pissing out through a glass shard filled urethra.  
This is the only time ever where Anal Shredding is preferable to anything.
Username checks out
Schrodingers dick.
I remember that. I still blame user error since they made the joke buttons very noticeable and alerted the user of the new button when Gmail was opened 
yuuuup
Yes like YouTube, and the ads will be THREE TIMES AS LOUD
Kind of, but you'd also have to add the feeling of never getting enough air. Which would make the curse even worse. Don't smoke kids! Or work in a coal mine
My Asian friend married a white girl. His parents just started completely ignoring him.He considers it a mixed bag. 
Barbarian....who doesn't wear socks with shoes.  Hell i cant even step outside in my orange crocs without socks on. 
Doesn't work. I think it's because I only have some small patches where I have no feeling, with the areas around those patches able to feel that *something* is happening to my right arm. (Also, it's hard to scratch one arm without using the other arm...but it is amusing to try)
Have you tried treating for pinworms?
Nooooooooo
"man, with an ass like that I wish i never chopped my balls off... i'd have totally >>things>>"

Both. White people have the "add extra x, y, and zs sterotype" whereas black people have the "laquafanidashaida" sterotype. Both of these are jokes of course, and are not mean to offend anyone.
No problem, Gyneffier.

3 days.. Seems a little short. I dont have time to watch the whole video right now, but couldn't the guy try doing some exercises and meditate? Yoga? Stack the bottles in his room? Make a sock puppet? I dunno, its not like his room is totally empty.I like being alone, so to me this doesn't seem that overly horrible.. Maybe if he was strapped down to a board and couldn't move or literally had nothing in his room at all I'd feel differently.
I think you read his username wrong. He wants you to PM tits, kittens, and the letter "N"
I am literally sitting right next to a girl a like that doesn't like me back (yes she does know). It never be painless but it does get easier to deal with.

Can confirm. Source: Am the law
How you doin'?
This is especially effective if you slowly increase the frequency of screams as they lose their grip on their sanity
OK Satan
The problem, IIRC, is that they bound keyboard shortcuts to it, also put it in the same place as the previous button in the UI. Which was very stupid. Not to mention it muted future responses in the conversation, so not only do you look like a minion-loving idiot, you also missed all of the replies asking for clarification.Modern web apps have already conditioned users to ignore small changes over time.
I poop my pants all the time as an adult. I keep an extra set of underwear in my trunk. Good times. Used to be a TV reporter and had to poop on the side or the road in the middle or no where in a snow storm. Another time I was moving and driving a U-Haul and pooped in a litter box, my cat never forgave me for that.
So... Spotify?
So, COPD... 
A man who wears crocs is a man on the edge with nothing to lose. 
Reddit just has the answer for everything 
Just remove your skin bro
Call him by his full name.Hello, Mr. Weird so long it never fits on forms which holds up getting a new phone/Internet/power connection every time I move house.
Yeah. I've had fleas (a stray cat somehow got into my house and slept in my bed with me, I shit you not) and while they suck, it's not the worst thing in the world. I've seen a video of a guy being stung by a bullet ant and I'm not taking my chances with something that has minimal mental capacity and can cause so much pain. Ant's definition of chill and my definition of chill probably vary
Shshhshshshhshshhhh. Not now, son. I'm making*TOAST!*
The only feedback you have is yourself. Imagine you can't talk to anyone. Look into a mirror, for about 2 minutes. Right in the eyes. You'll get bored and want to do something. Maybe you'll talk to yourself, or fix your hair. Now imagine there's no mirror. There is only the four walls and you.Isolation is a horrible curse that I wouldn't put on anyone. God may have mercy on the poor future astronauts who will explore space by themselves.
Maybe you should stop being so close to her so you can get over her before you resume the friendship.

"Never fight a man wearing crocs and a fanny pack, as he has nothing to lose and will fight to the death"- Confucius probably
Very common, often undiagnosed/asymptomatic but quite horrifying, to me at least. Little staple-sized worms that live in your intestinal tract, and the females crawl out your balloon knot at night while you're sleeping, to lay eggs around the rim of your sphincter. Often causes intense itchiness and irritation. 
That really *is* a long last name 
Or, just don't resume the friendship.If you came to *really* like the person before, all the reasons for that to happen are still there.
*suffocates*
"I'm better now, guys. I don't hear it anymore. The screams are gone"Then in a couple months, one night he is awoken by it again, and he has to start pretending like it wasn't there so he doesn't have to go back to the home for crazy people. He's not crazy. It's there, but no one else can know now. He's completely alone.

Scream "FUUUUUUUCK!!" one time - ONE TIME? - and she says, "if you are finished hang up, goodbye". Fucking hung up on me! I canceled my account lol. If I can't swear at your automated system you can go fuck yourself paypal. So anyway i don't have paypal anymore

"FAGGG!" -Mr Garrison 
Oh, another harley owner!
No kidding. My mother was on that shit for years. One night she did deep knee bends for two hours in the dark living room. Another night she asked me "where the black man was that liked your hair", when she hadn't had a black guest in years. Yet another night she tried to make a cake - in the morning there was pancake mix, an uncracked egg and maple syrup in a bowl on the counter. Ambien will fuck you up.
One of my housemates was on Ambien a while back, and I kept odd hours.  I miss watching her climb out her (first floor) window and have arguments with squirrels.  In squirrel.

Ambient is no joke. I have nothing but ambient horror stories and very understanding neighbors
Funny. I'm pretending my 1.8t gti is a dodge viper.

2.8 VR6 here. It'd be rude not to.
/r/firstworldproblems:  I'd like to pretend my Series 3 BMW is a 750, but I can't hear the sound of the engine even when I rev it up.
I also have a theory about people who set their alarm off on purpose every time they are getting into their car because they enjoy hearing it. They bought it, they want to hear it. Every.  Fucking. Time. 
This is the answer.

I had a similar experience.  Met a cop in a social setting one time and asked why they let motorcycles ride around without mufflers without ticketing them for violating noise ordinances. His response was along the lines of, "You can't do that, Harleys sound awesome man!"    I just thought to myself, "Yup, there's one part of the problem."
As a girl.... how is this supposed to impress me?? I don't know any girls who are impressed by guys being douchebags and revving their engines really loud....

"Revving your engine" to kittens is pretty messed up
Ugh I had a neighbor with two ancient trucks that he parked in front of my house.  These trucks shared *one* battery, every time he wanted to switch trucks he'd have to switch the battery.  Hoods banging, engine revving to get things flowing, don't miss that at all.

There needs to be one of those sad PSA commercials shot in black and white about what it's like being a Chad. It's tough people. It's tough.

Innit.
Yes, this. Some little shit at my work thinks his fart can civic needs to be damn near red lined to get it to warm up when we're leaving work. JUST LET IT IDLE YOU RICEY LITTLE BASTARD. 
They teach us in Finnish driving school that warming engine slowly is worse than driving and warming it faster. The cold engine runs a lot longer cold which grinds the metal parts, if you let it just run still with low rpm. And I'm talking about colder than waters freezing point.But why would anyone warm their engine staying still? You can use that RPM and gasoline to get going.
No but it is pretty hard to run in them.

But a Maserati sounds absolutely amazing.  I doubt even the grumpiest old fart  wouldnt mind a Maserati revving.  Their engine is BUILT in a special way for it to sound this good.  They actually engineered a Excelent sounding engines. 
Lol isn't the point in 'warming up' (esp fuel injected cars) to let the engine idle/drive at low rpm to get the oil warm? How can you think revving it high helps here?I know carbureted cars are a different story.

A Polo is a good choice for your first car. Drives nice, relatively cheap to drive and maintain. Look for one with a recently replaced timing belt and you should be safe from any expensive repairs for a while.

'96? Not even close. I got married and my new wife brought a '71 Toyota Corolla with her. Cardboard dash and interior. Black Vinyl upholstery. Manual choke lever on the dash (I am serious). Top speed 67. The cherry red had faded to an uneven light pink - EXCEPT the trunk which had to be repainted (in America) after my she had locked the keys in it with wine at 1ge 17 and got her older sister's pos bf to crowbar it open. Claimed ignorance so insurance fixed it.But to be fair, it stopped running so I sold it to a friend at work for $50 and some weed. So you probably still win.
My dad got you beat on this one - 94 corolla, I don't even know what the original paint was because it's a mess, 3 gears so if you go over 70 it's sounds like it's gonna die, but still his daily driver.And then there's me, the prodigal son, with the 2016 Corolla - oh well

Turned left into my sister's driveway at 3 am. A guy on a Harley was doing 60 mph in a 30, with no headlight. My half ton pickup left 4 feet of skid marks from being pushed back by the force. I still remember seeing him do mid air somersaults this was 1976
A guy attacked me at 3 a.m. while I was walking to work. I tried to choke him long enough to render him unconscious. And I did. He never woke up. He was a firefighter, a husband, and a father. I know it was self-defense. It still bothers me sometimes, nearly ten years later.
I was driving a semi a small car pulled in front of me and slammed their breaks i couldnt stop in time my truck wound up on top of their car i was the only survivor of the vehicles involved 
Loan officer for a local credit union.  I ordered a repo on a guy's car; totally justified.  A week later, he gets off at a bus stop about midnight, and starts walking home.  A car hits him, hit & run.  He's found literally dead in a ditch the next morning.  I didn't kill him, but if I hadn't ordered the repo, he wouldn't have died.  
Not truly my fault, but somehow I can't stop thinking that my decision was what lead to it... When I was 7, I had gone to the park with my grandmother. When we were about to go back home, we went across the street so she could buy me an ice cream. As we were heading back I asked her if we could go across the park instead of around it. She said yes, and we were the victims of a hit and run. She passed away a while later from those injuries.
I was working in a nursing home as a volunteer. He was a painter, he told me to bring him oil paints, canvas and thinner, and he would paint something for me.The next week when I had to return I was excited to see what he'd painted, but he was no longer there. The nurses told me that "they" came to pick him up.I think he drank the thinner at night.
I was driving my girlfriend and I back to town from a day by the water. We were on the highway and she leaned over to kiss me, next thing I knew we were going off the road and then the car was rolling. It just happened.. I had a few scrapes but her seatbelt wasn't on properly and she died there.. in my arms on the the side of the road. Never thought this could happen to me. 
When i was 4 Years old, my mother was roughly 3-4 months pregnant           one day I was supposedly crying and throwing a tantrum over a toy or something,my mother tried to comfort me by cradling me in her arms and take me to to my room which was up the stairs but i cried and kicked so much that she lost her balance and fell down the the stairs, i was unhurt and mother recovered without any lasting injuries  but my sibling died.
Perhaps even grandma was abused herself and that could be what drove her to do it.
Not your fault. J-walking is against the law for a reason. Without any visibility there wasn't anything you could do when someone decides to cross illegally. Add alcohol to the mix and it's just a recipe for disaster. Feeling glad that you weren't being charged for anything is perfectly fine. Ruining your life for something that wasn't your fault wouldn't bring him back, nothing would.
Did the other forecaster ever get punished for what he had done?
That seems like it should have definitely been at least a two person job.
You would have ended up drowning as well, he would have paniced and grabbed you and pulled you under
And don't make illegal u-turns like a dumbass. That would've solved the issue. 
Thats not your fault. You didn't let somebody too drunk drive. Thats what you're *supposed* to do.
The only person to blame here is him.Seriously, how drunk do you have to be to sleep on traintracks?
Jesus, I'm sorry that happened to you but it's not your fault. The father shouldn't have given you the gun without checking if it was unloaded first. I hope you can find closure on this one day. 
Be careful with that lady man. That "I'll kill you someday" line is no joke imo. That's some thriller movie type shit.I'm sorry that this happened to you though. I too have a story resulting in an unexpected death but I am probably not going to tell it, as it will probably give my ID away if any redditors from my area are around.
You may very well have saved your own life.
My baby died of meningitis (not trying to make it about me, just commiserating). The symptoms are so vague and subtle. He would have died in bed if my husband hadn't given him to me because he was "so fussy". It would have been a similar* situation. Anyway, my point is I get that whole never forgive yourself part, we both have it too.  Lots of hugs.  
How did your buddy feel about it?
Crazy to have a pool party for 6-year-olds, especially with an apparent lack of adult supervision. Not your fault, but arguably the fault of any of the adults who allowed that to happen. 
> I see a kid on the bottom of the pool and I think to myself that it "looks like he's dancing." I shrug and head inside.That, unfortunately, is what drowning looks like.  Most people don't know what it looks like, they think it's splashing and saying help glub help glub but it's quick and it's dancing and silent and then you're gone. 
Have you done anything about the alcoholism yet? I quit 3 mths ago. Started at /r/stopdrinking and then started to go to AA meetings in my area. 3+ months sober now. My life feels saved.
This is one of the hardest stories I've read in this thread. Yes, your advice wasn't right for him, but there's no way you could have realized this is what would happen. This is way too big a consequence for your little mistake. I'm so sorry you went through this.
As someone with severe, legally disabling depression, it can get so bad that it will drag others down with us if you let it. Luckily, you didn't. What were you supposed to do? Let him keep stealing from you and bleeding you dry and forcing you into your own depression until he found someone else to do the same thing to? No. You did the right thing. This isn't your fault. 
I don't understand why anyone would remotely have a reason to blame you, nor should you blame yourself ...if he didn't borrow yours he could have got a gun anywhere, or just used any other method. 
The family has no right to hate you. You didn't know and they let him keep a gun or had guns accessible to him 
why did he attack you? was he on drugs or had a mental breakdown?
Sounds like that's 100% the lift operators fault.
This is a dumb question, but would it be fair to convey to him that lying could result in his death? Like, this isn't just a perfunctory question. "Are you taking any medicine? I need to know to avoid a fatal reaction."I once had a dentist who was going to perform surgery on me ask if I did illegal drugs, and when I said no, he reiterated that I needed to be honest because if I did heroin, I'd likely have a fatal reaction to the anesthesia.
As someone not involved in healthcare, I would never think someone would hide a medication... but I guess it happens.I'm sorry man, that's honestly a tricky situation, especially if someone insisted they weren't taking anything because they didn't want to be embarrassed. 
Holy fuck that's dark 
Sometimes people do this as a means of suicide. It's unfortunate you were involved and had to deal with the fallout but it wasn't your fault. 
It may sound cruel, but inevitably he would've continued hurting you and everyone else, so it was for the best. Hope you're OK about it though.
9yo is very young to deal with this type of situation. You didn't killed him, you just didn't saved him. There is a difference.

It may take or have taken you a long time to believe this, or maybe you never will, but you did him a really big favour. 
Your mom ran away? Were you left in the cab?
I had a similar but less serious incident as an adult in Taiwan. A friend dropped me off at the place I was staying. I opened the door on the kerb side and a kid on a bicycle slammed into it. He was ok, a few scratches. What some may not realize is that sidewalks are uncommon in Asia and so the area between buildings and cars is still road. The reaction of my friends suggested this was my fault and I should have looked before opening the door.
Bless you for all your work.
My girlfriend gets pissed when I don't respond to that kind of thing while doing something potentially dangerous. This is exactly the kind of thing I'm afraid of.   I'm sorry for your loss man.
What kind of bullying took place? How did people at your school, especially the bullies, react to his suicide?
Do you remember this or did your parents tell you? 
I had asthma as a kid. If I still do, it hasn't shown any signs for 20 years.My asthma attacks, as I remember them, weren't delayed. They didn't happen a day later from a triggering event. I could be wrong, I haven't had an attack in 20 years, medical knowledge has likely changed. I hate to say this, but not having his meds and refusing the hospital killed your father, not that ride. If that ride was the cause, I think it would have hit immediately.
That wasn't caused by you.  The asthma attack the next day wasn't affected by the ride the day before.
She's not been erased. You remember her.
Hey, you can potentially Google "accident x street x date" and find out what happenedIt's not your fault, and logically you probably know that, but I know survivors guilt, and I know it's not as simple as knowing and understanding that you're not at fault and couldn't have done anything. I'm sorry you're feeling that, and I wish you the best.
It's part of why I *fucking hate* driving with my father in the vehicle, He'll always be giving helpful nuggets while I'm trying to focus on driving, raising complaint when I don't go immediately, etc.
Her mom should have gave her a ride home instead of relying on strangers to do itNot your fault at all
Not your fault. You didn't kill her, in fact you thought that if you drove her she would be in more danger. You had no way of knowing Tiffany was that inexperienced and you wanted to protect Caitlyn.
Hey, it might not have been your kit that was used. Even if it was, you had no way of knowing what would happen.
I feel like it's hard to argue you gave them the means. They had to also obtain explosives right? You can't just make an Arduino explode. They probably could have controlled the payload with any other microcontroller too, and there are tons of them available via other means.I'm also surprised there isn't some kind of strict policy for destruction of materials brought on site.
That's what I was thinking too. Maybe knowing that her beloved grand children were harmed too was enough to drive her over the edge.
Im very sorry to hear about your sister, and thank you for the kind words. I've had to stop trying to associate 'blame' and who made the mistake where--it just goes down a hole that doesn't have a good outcome. 
They replaced the street lights that day, pretty fucked up it took a death to save a few cents. 
I don't know the full details on that, but I do know that the chat logs were saved so the blame was really taken off of us. We demonstrated meteorologically why we wanted hail. His argument was "I have more stripes, get rid of it." I just wound up having a discussion with my commander about it in private and he basically said that no one pulls rank on the weather. Next time this happens, we have to stick to our guns and don't get pushed around by a "senior" forecaster. 
It should have but in most cases the staff to aid ratio is ridiculous. Imagine being left to care for 33 people that's what our third shift does anywhere from 25 to 33 people most of them total care several are bariatric residents. CNA'S are not valued enough for what they do.
Yeah... when you consider that 'pulling the plug' often means starving to death or suffocating it really makes you wonder why we can't be more humane instead of waiting for people to die in horrible ways.
I agree with this. My grandmother died in misery. She was old and fragile with dementia and would just scream "kill me" at all the nurses for months before she died. It was cruel that she was kept alive long after her body and mind were gone. I wouldn't wish that suffering on anyone. 
I understand that that would've probably happened but I still wish I could've helped somehow.
Or suicidal, even drunk me would probably look for a more comfortable place to pass out than train tracks. 
The gun is always loaded.It's not a toy, end of story. A hunter should know better than to give a firearm to a kid outside a safe environment (shooting range).
Quite frankly she needs to go to jail (or an institution, where she can get a better sense of where the responsibility is). He did nothing wrong and shouldn't have to suffer for her loss. Everyone has bad things happen. Doesn't mean we get to go around attacking innocent people.
Good point. I was at a pool party for 6-7 year olds, and I remember diving into the pool and accidentally landing on one of the other kids who was lurking underneath the water. One of the adults saw this and pulled the kid out of the water. I am really thankful to have had that supervision.
We were at the ocean a few days before my sister's wedding. We had been body surfing the waves earlier hut everyone was up on the beach relaxing. We look out and see people yelling and waving and having a good old time out there. After like 5 minutes we realized they were actually in distress and took off into the water and saved them. It was crazy how close we were to just watching them drown.
The thing that makes it feel like my fault is that after his second DUI he asked me to keep his gun so it wasn't an option. He then asked for it back a few months later to go shooting, I reluctantly gave it back to him and said to give it back afterwards. He said he was getting counseling and other things to help with his troubles. I would compare him to Robin Williams, he was typically the life of the party and could cheer anyone up. It just hurts knowing the last thoughts about me were that I hated him. I didn't/don't, I was just frustrated with him because I cared about him.
Its easier to cope with the loss if there is some sort of scapegoat. They probably know on the inside he didnt do anything. And social pressures and not seeing the signs are why he'd blame himself If I were to guess. But the last part is very true. He obviously had the  intent to commit suicide, he would've done it one way or another. 
Yeah it's just that I felt at fault, and people drilled into my mind that it was me. Heck, even the local paper at the place said that the accident happened as a result of poor conduct on our behalf. When you see that in a newspaper it really fucks you up. 
I think this is very important.This reminds me of a post here where a little girl had to have surgery and she was not allowed to eat the day before. Of course her parent gave her food and she almost died.People often think that these questions/advices are "just protocol". It can help to remind them they might die.
If they've got something to hide, then they will hide it.  If you're lucky, you *might* get the truth if you get loved ones away from them, but then you also might not.
This and suicide by cop are just despicable acts leaving monstrous guilt and pain
It always seemed like I killed him in my 9 year old perspective. Like I was sitting there watching as he died thinking he was ok
He was the most lucid of all the people living there. He was the only one that could walk without help, and that only time we talked he was so depressed and told me how the nurses drugged them to sleep and how horrible that place was.And I thought painting something would make him happy.
If I remember correctly, I actually ran after her at some point, but she was so panicked she kept shouting "Go away!" whenever I tried to get close. 
I don't think they are, that guy was probably trying to save time during traffic. 
I Actually learned this from my grandmother when i was 13 
Fuck dude. 
I agree. Couldn't anyone just order an arduino online? I'm sure they're really easy to get anywhere. 
Thank you for the condolences, but my real message was, in instances like this, "blame" can't be directed - understanding the actual causes is almost as complex as understanding the results, and you were unfortunately caught up in a terrible story outside your own. I hope you've "moved on" as best as you can and have come to realize none of this was your fault - you were an unfortunate victim in someone else's story, and I hope it doesn't follow you
RN here CNA's do the most and receive the least
As an adult with training, maybe.As an eight year old? Not a chance. The *best* you could have *maybe* done was stay back and encourage him. But most likely you would have simply witnesses him going under for the last time first hand. Not a memory you need.Sorry you lost him that way.
Yeah as a non-firearm user this is the rule I live by. Can it fire a bullet?  If so, assume it's loaded.
As a former lifeguard, I was really nervous when I clicked that link and proud that I found the drowning kid quickly. You look for lack of sideways motion. For the kid going up and down. Arms out to the side, chin going under and coming up (but less each time). 
That was me when I was a teenager.  Was at the beach and swam out to a buoy -- I wasn't (and still am not) a good swimmer, and by the time I got there, I was completely exhausted.  I was hanging onto the buoy while frantically waving to a passing boat.  The passengers smiled and waved back.  Somehow I managed to swim back to the beach.  My body felt like it was on fire and I could see my entire chest move with my heart beat.
Fuck the media, they always make up shit. You were definitely not at fault here. 
I had a Spanish teacher in high school that was an anesthesiologist in Brazil before he moved to the US and told us about this happening. When they intubate someone they will gag when you're taking it out then if they ate or drank they will puke and immediately aspirate it back to their lungs and basically drown. 
My dad's a cardiologist and he calls this the "door stop". He's been practicing for almost 50 years, and says when someone is leaving his office, if they hesitate for even a fraction of a second at the door as they leave the exam room and don't sneeze, there's something they didn't tell you and you need to calmly figure out what it is. 
As another former paramedic: Many people don't even realize that the pills they take daily are medication. You'll ask them if they are on any medication and they say no, but once you start listing some of the standards for old people, many of them will remember that they actually take 4-5 different pills a day. It's pretty crazy (but then again many older people aren't really mentally healthy).
I'm 30, and I've broken my wrist tripping over a crack in the pavement that I didn't notice. I absolutely understand how elderly people could die from something like that - all it takes is a solid blow to the head and you're done.
trains too
But surely they should have warned you, and told you to turn him on his side if he choked? If you weren't there, it would have happened either way. If they had some kind of baby monitor, shouldnt  they have come in to check on him? They probably blame themselves but took it out on you as a coping mechanism. 
I mean, as a random person on the internet I just feel sorry for you. It's like you were chopping onions as a chef, at your workplace which is a normal thing for people to do where you are at, and someone threw a person on top of you and that person got stabbed. Like, what could you do, you tried with your human reflexes, and it wasn't enough for that time. I don't know how anyone could blame you.
You likely did him a huge favor. If I ever end up in a nursing home I hope someone will be there for me to do the exact same thing. Once all the quality of one's life is gone, remaining on earth is sheer torture.
oh god i am so sorry. how is your relationship nowadays?
That doesn't seem like a great age to learn that. Did it have a negative impact on you and would you rather not know it?
I don't think Amazon Prime covers Afghanistan. The only commercially produced product that is available for purchase in every inhabited place on earth is Coca Cola.
I've thought about every possible thing that could've happened differently and that one has been hard to think about. I wish I saw him one more time since I just turned around and he was gone but seeing him go under would be too much for me. 
As someone raised with guns who owns multiple this is me even to the annoyance of others. I can unload the gun myself and hand it to someone to look at and if they point it near me I will scold them. 
When you are in trouble in the water youre supposed to raise your arm with a closed fist so it doesnt look like you are waving. There needs to be more info about this sort of thing.
my mom was murdered and I was there and a week later when I went back to school everyone was asking me questions and the news made up shit saying she was hit by a baseball bat to the head. We didn't even own a baseball bat he just used his fists and punched her in the temple but yeah media is retarded.
I'm cringing at the thought of this. OWWWW. WOWWW
Me: Do you have any medical problems?78 year old Patient: Nope. None.Me: What do you take the Lipitor,  Coumadin and Metformin for?78 year old Patient: For my High Cholesterol, Afib, I have had a heart attack, PE. Oh and I'm diabetic. 
Train suicide can leave an incredibly gruesome scene as well. 
Everyone wants someone to point the finger at. 
It's true, after all quality of life is gone, every day is Hell. My father dealt with MS and Tinitus for a long long time waiting until my big brother and I were grown enough to understand and living our own lives before he took his.  He was unhappy for atleast a decade.  He went out with some dignity, he knew he wasn't getting any better.  Still, the best man I've ever known.
Uh... so in an unrelated incident 4 years ago right before I graduated high school, my parents kinda, for the lack of a better phrase, kicked me out? I wasn't able to do very well in programming like I had wanted and didn't build the prerequisites to go to UBC, and they basically went ballistic and never want to see me again. I'm living alone right now, and my parents haven't responded to my contact attempts since. I'm not sure if they're even in the country any more. 
It actually better knowing,my mom and I have had a complicated relationship,She said that she loved me(like any mom would) but could tell there was some form of resentment and its better knowing where the resentment came from 
I'm cringing that a Brazilian anesthesiologist found it more cost effective to teach Spanish (don't they speak Portuguese in Brazil?) than to re-qualify to practice medicine in the U.S.  Couldn't even be a nurse anesthetist?  We throw out a lot of immigrant expertise...
You should absolutely mention it always.  Just like people on Adderall should mention theirs.  It's a medicine that effects your body.   Now I wouldn't mention like the occasional Advil though. 
Most suicidal people don't want to leave a mess. But sometimes you just can't think of any other way. And depression changes your mind. When you go into a depressive fugue it's like the whole world is literally gray and grainy. The person in your head isn't you anymore.
that's for sure, I mean who the hell writes a jaywalking ticket after such an accident?
Sorry, your parents sound like assholes. 
are you asian yourself? 
The number of NYC taxi drivers with graduate degrees from their home countries is really rather astounding. 
I would add one should also disclose herbal or nontraditional medicines because some do interact with other  drugs. At one point, I used St John's Wort, and because I had heard of some interactions, I made a point of always disclosing. I also found that even the more skeptical health professionals would still rather know everything a patient is taking.
Yeah....particularly a dick move when it's the boyfriend of a girl who just fucking died. As if that guy doesn't have enough on his plate. Like all the guilt of not moving his girl, or being more careful about crossing the street or any of that.
I can't come with any argument against that, but honestly I don't think there's any possible positive outcome for me to hold a grudge against them. I might as well be dwelling on that asshole bully in grade 4. Note: I don't excuse my parents' behavior, and know that they treated me horribly, I'm just saying I don't think it's healthy for me to really hate them. All I want to do is just move on right now. 
Yeah, Japanese, but first generation Canadian, and that Asian parent stereotype had to come from somewhere. 
"I met someone and she opened my eyes," said my husband three weeks after our son was born. I'm still bleeding from that stab wound.
My best friend in college just stopped talking to me one day. Wouldn't respond to any texts or anything. It hurt, but I let it go. A year or so later I read in the paper that an old friend of ours had died, so I texted her to let her know. She responded with 'you have the wrong number'. Maybe that was the truth, but I couldn't help but think that it wasn't and for some reason this hurt more than her breaking things off with me.Years later she apologized out of the blue on Facebook which is nice I guess. But who the fuck does that?
My roommate tried to convince my girlfriend that I was secretly a rapist and a pedophile, got his girlfriend and some others and held an "intervention" where she couldn't leave until she said she was going to do something about me.Luckily, my girlfriend decided to talk to me, realized it was all bullshit, and is still by my side today. My roommate dropped out of college and still hasn't finished their degree.
I was in a band with some friends in high school.  I wrote all the songs we played.  They kicked me out and said they didn't like my music anymore and wanted to go another direction.  I later found out they had booked a show and played my songs they said they hated.  I felt pretty crummy after hearing that.
I invited all my high school "friends" to my birthday party and none of them showed up. Luckily I had my 2 close friends from outside of school show up and still have a good time. Went back to school that Monday and instead of sitting at their table I took a chance and sat with this girl I had a crush on, we dated throughout highschool and then some so it worked out.
 Best friend of many years tried to break up me and my then- boyfriend by fabricating evidence he was cheating on me.  Never figured out if it was her being possessive of me or if she wanted to date him.    Edit - it has become apparent this wording was misleading and I apparently distressed some people.  Then- boyfriend because we've since gotten engaged,  not because we've since broken up.  Thank you to all the kind people out there congratulating :)
Was friends with a guy since middle school. We were inseparable. I helped him with his depression, got him to move out of his parents house, supported him when he was emotionally wrecked, etc. But the moment I lost my job and became depressed, he wasn't there for me. Stopped talking to me, hanging out with me, answering my messages. Asked him why he was ignoring me and he said I was being too sad. 
My little sister literally stabbed my back with a pencil when we were young, does that count? 
I just found out two of my closest friends have been cat-fishing me with pictures of an Israeli supermodel for the past couple weeks, so that was pretty cool of them. 
My friend of nearly 25 years happily ended our friendship over a few thousand bucks he owed me. Hey Bill, if you are reading this, go sit on an AIDS needle. 
I learned my "friends" weren't actually my friends during an acid trip. I was already having a bad trip and they fucked me up even more by telling me things like how I would never be able to have a real relationship and that I'd fucked my brain up for life. Needless to say, I spent the next 20hrs trying to hold myself together while those thoughts kept racing through my mind. I'm still not me
Reading the first 10 answers made me realise I have good friends...Thanks OP.
I picked up the rocket launcher and my friend thought he should have it more, so he meleed me in the back and took it. Then proceeded to miss all his shots. 
True friends stab you in the front 
I was playing risk and a bit into the game me and my friend kinda teamed up with me to take out someone else. After a While it was my friends again and he redeemed his cards to place twenty something troops on our border (He had Europe and some of Asia, I had Africa and South America) and attacked me. He kicked my ass
Holy shit my bloods boiling from just reading this. I can't imagine what I would've done in your position. 
> Caught her red handed cheating on me. She swore up and down it was a misunderstanding, and since I loved her, I believed every word.Love makes people believe and do crazy stuff. Hope you are better these days.
I hope his prostate falls out
Junkies with kids? Might explain why the kids stayed somewhere else.  
Why didn't you find them and get your stuff back?
Wow, what a piece of shit. If you ever see him again tell him from me that he is a big twat.
This is just painful to read dude. Were you in high school when you past your best friend? Do you know why they did this to you? Why didn't you beat his ass up?
But why did your roommate do it.
They were totally different songs. You see, yours were like "ding ding ding ding da da ding ding". But theirs were like "da ding ding ding da da ding ding". Completely different songs.
Feel good about yourself! They didn't/ couldn't do what you did, sounds like they needed you more than you needed them.
How can they kick you out of what is yours?
Well at least you got megadeth right.
Fuck em, that just means they're incapable of writing their own songs and that you will be more successful than them. And I bet if you looked hard enough you could replace them all with more talented musicians and be much better than you ever were with them.
Wow. That is a man at the mercy of his own dick.
She sounds like a right cunt too.
God, the level of revenge I would invoke on her.  I would literally volunteer pro-bono for the other side on any case that she is involved with, just so I could destroy her in the courtroom.  The last thing anyone should do is fuck with a seasoned lawyer.
... I would have shown up forsure.
There's a reason why her bf kicked her out 
Why not interrupt when it's clear he's flirting to ruin his "game", by saying something like "oh that's a funny story, were you out with your wife when that happened?"
That is the type of guy who going to end up cheating on his wife.
I stayed friends as best I could with an ex of mine. On the surface, things seemed pretty bad as she started dating my roommate. But on the inside, she was conspiring with another friend of mine to keep me single. They told the girl I crushed on that I was just using her to make my ex jealous. Made that girl cry. Eventually made me cry after all was said and done.It's been a year and a half and I have no regrets. The other "friend" was a shitty person anyways. Edit 4/1/17: I have not forgotten these events, though I legitimately wish everyone the best despite this.
How do you know it was fabricated?
Jesus.
If dude had depression issues then this is plausible. It's shitty but plausible. 2 depressed people are much worse than just 1. 
It's possible he just wasn't strong enough to bear your burdens along with his own.  I've definitely had to step back from helping someone because I wasn't able to do it without getting bogged down myself 
That is when you break ties with your sister and stop talking to her/being around her.
Fuck the former friend. But fuck the idiot VP the most. He had no business being a manager. 
Man, some people are sadistic. I don't get why they would get joy out of others' suffering, and to be aware that people who do that ARE sick, and yet do it themselves? Sociopathic...These are people that eventually become the same conniving snakes in the workplace, causing toxic environments and office politics.
> So, being stereotypically Jewish...Made the story for me. Mazel tov.
that last line makes it seem like your mom is in hell. or maybe she's in heaven and reaching down to make Brian's life miserable?
I have no idea how long ago this was, but if you were to sue him in civil court, you don't need "beyond a reasonable doubt," just a preponderance of evidence.  Basically if it's more likely that he did it than that he didn't do it.
You guys still togeather?
Dude! Same thing happened to me in college. I introduced a large group of my friends to a large group of my gf's friends early on in the relationship. After the break up, they all pretty much left me in the dirt. But oh well, life goes on and you find the ones who stuck with ya are the true friends. Or fuck it and you find others.
That sucks man. Really sucks being silently replaced like that. That happened to me in the first band I was in. We hadn't practiced in a while because the drummer was "busy". Turns out thats just code for "we got a new guitarist". 
"Sorry bud, the gig is up" But actually that sounds really shitty, hope you're doing better
Thats tough...like the time Jack Black got kicked out his own band :'( 
WTF I came here to say that same thing!Had a friend message me on AIM saying he's sorry my band broke up.  I told him we didn't, and then he insisted.  Went to the band chat and sure enough the drummer and bassist decided to use a joke 'side project' band as an excuse to quit, and they never played any gigs with any bands ever again.  I think the singer/songwriter still thinks I left his band.
Dylan must be super cool to forgive such a tragedy
That's a pretty cheap way of finding out someone is an asshole. After 30 years friendship it could have been a lot worse. 
My God what a wonderful ending. Completely infuriating, though, that the teacher was able to get away with so much. How long ago was this?
Atleast she got what she deserved, she is everything what is wrong with education :/
I would make a huge deal out of this by saying, " Oh, isn't it fantastic that we'll share the same wedding anniversary?!" My bet is it will drive your friend's fiance crazy, and maybe you'll get lucky and they'll change the date. Kill her with kindness.
I got stabbed in the chest with a pencil by one of my good friends. We both got suspended. 
I got stabbed in the forehead by a mechanical pencil by my classmate in Grade 2. Couple years later I found out that she liked me and did it to get attention.
Do they know you know? Or do you have a chance to mess with them back?
There are two sure ways to lose a friend.  One is to loan money to a friend and the other is to borrow money from a friend.
I don't think giving someone your email and password is something that normally happens over time, especially with something as important as school. 
dumb pieces of shit. your life should not be entertainment for others.
My best friend and I were fishing and he cast his line and hooked his own back. I was confused as to why he was yelling and reaching for his back, then I realized what happened. You brilliant idiot. Hooks are for fishes. 
Ugh, I squirmed in my seat reading your story. What assholes. So sorry, friend. I don't trust people either.
Safe to say you weren't the best man?
My best friend has dated two of my exes. They're my exes for a reason, and if they're happy together then who am I to judge. Having said that I told the first one, "I was here before you, and I'll be here long after you're gone". I was right. 
To be honest I was very angry about it, and very hurt but I had so much to do with just picking up the pieces that I couldn't even focus on them. After the graduation, what I really took from the situation is learning that I never want to make anyone feel the way I felt when they hurt me. I've been more open and more strict about honoring commitments and making sure people I care about can count on me when they are helpless. It would be nice to see where this attitude gets them in a few years, but I think it's best to try and cast them away from my thoughts.
"You know, it's funny; when you look at someone through rose colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags."
That can happen??? Oh god!
Game developers go to the same conferences casino game designers go to so they can learn tactics of how to reel people in.
And don't forget to punch him in the face!
Not OP, but my guess is that his roommate was a rapist pedophile and wanted to get the suspicion off of him.Or maybe he was just an asshole.
Found Vanilla Ice.
But the legend of the rent, was WAY PAST DUE 
There were 3 of them and 1 of me.
I'm just impressed by the commitment. He lost 100 pounds to ask someone out? Wow
Yeah, he always has been. He'd always been very overweight, and immediately friendzoned by any woman he's ever really liked. Don't even get me started on the fuckshop that is his marriage now. oy. 
or plant a nest of nats in her home
I mean, if there was free pizza, shit even I would show up in the weirdo's house.
Can't wait to read the new boyfriend's post in 6 months on the next thread like this...
You're a drug dealer, aren't you?
Giving "business stuff" to friends eh? Just lying around the house you say? How much for a gram 
yes 100%. I dated someone once who was devastatingly handsome and whenever we talked about marriage he said "I don't believe in me wearing a ring, it's different for you, you have to". Thought that was a pretty big red flag.
 Yeah exactly.  When I figured out what she was doing I cut her out of my life like a tumor.  Didn't make it into a big scene filled with drama, just quietly turned and walked away from that friendship.  Don't need that in my life.  
My ex told my new gf that if i could break up with her, I could break up with my new gf too, that we would never be happy; to my new gf's face, in her house, in front of her parents.That was 13 years ago, my then new gf and I have been together ever since and have been married for 6 of those 13 years.
Because he smelled something off early on and A) told me immediately he felt uncomfortable with stuff that was happening, stuff she was doing, ways she was contacting him etc and B) began documenting all communication she had with him,  messenger logs, texts etc and proactively gave them to me *before* she tried to take pieces of them and show them to me to put him in a bad light (which she did).  I didn't ask him to or anything.   He could tell she was behaving oddly about stuff and kept me in the loop.  That good communication probably single handedly saved our relationship.    
My boyfriend and I both have repeated lapses of depression... Most of the time is fine.... But sometimes it gets really ugly.When he is trying to cheer me up, it's usually okay. But if he gets into a funk I can't pull him out of, I get really depressed and sometimes breakdown for multiple days because of the feeling of unrelenting guilt that I can't help him the way he helps me.As much as I love my boyfriend. My depression makes it really hard to be near him sometimes.
[](/cocosad)Hard to judge on a case-by-case basis, but I get what you're saying. Helping someone with depression, especially when they're depressed for extremely long periods of time, can be very draining. 
Not to mention a VP shouldn't be going directly to an employee if there's a manager between them.  Chain of command is important in any business structure and both his former friend and the VP broke it by circumventing the manager.  Shitty deal.
So many people try to deny that this happens, it's refreshing to see people talking about this type of behavior.I've been the above board, blunt, "I'm just here to work" type of person my whole life, but the type that wants to create havoc for no reason has been a burden through most of my professional life. The less you participate, the more they single you out with this shit, it seems.
"Hey God, can I take a trip down to hell real quick? I'll only be a second""Is it about brian?""Yes...'"Take as long as you need"
Growing up I was told that everyone goes to "heaven". But once you get there you have a complete understanding of everything you did in your life. If you did something good but didn't realize the impact it had now you do and it feels good. But if you did something awful that didn't bother you when you did it, now it does and you have to live with that horrible guilt for all of eternity. Your own personal hell.
What's code for "we got a new drummer"? 
The news is out
I feel like maybe I have some insight . . . Musicians, as people, tend to fucking suck, at least when it comes to behaving responsibly. Especially within the world of punk/rock/etc., a vast majority of musicians are more concerned with the cult of themselves than they are with writing music. People and relationships tend not to matter enough to do the right thing. source: been playing in bands for 15+ years 
Or he's plotting his revenge...
Seriously RuneScape is no fucking joke
Nah, I knew them both pretty well and there was also a bit more backstory as to why those two stopped being friends, so I knew it was true.
Yeah it still hurts if I'm being honest. I miss what we had. He's spoken about it to a few mutual friends and is all for moving on apparently, as it's 'ancient history' in his eyes... but once you lose trust in who you thought was your closest friend, there's not really any going back.It's not, and never was, about the money. Cheers.
I was stabbed in the hand with a pen by a girl in my class. She showed me her boobs a couple years later. We were cool after that.
>Stabbed in the chest>good friends[ ](/spikewtf)Why exactly was your good friend stabbing you?Reminds me of some girl I knew in HS who stabbed her best friend with a syringe full of water because she "wanted to see what would happen." 
I made it abundantly clear to them that I'm aware of what they did. Would having a third party send them a fake "local man found dead after harmful prank" news article be too much? 
You clearly haven't played Settlers of Catan with friends
Yeah, I'll happily *give* money to a friend, but I'll never lend it.
You know those emails you get about avoiding obvious phishing links and keeping your password safe? That's the person they're for.
I once stepped barefoot onto a pile of fishhooks that was sitting on one end of the dock. I don't know why the guy thought leaving them there was okay, but it definitely was not. My brother spent the next hour pulling hooks out of my foot. 
I mean, anal prolapses are a thing...
Is it not about as shitty as it gets when, in the middle of your grieving and planning the funeral and all of that, you have to plan for someone to be at your or the deceased's place in order to prevent from being robbed?
List some of the bad ideas they had 
I feel sorry for you. But she obviously mixed up guitar and bass so, in the end, she definitely was a moron 
Selfies with the judge?
And steal his Runescape items!
Couldn't help but chuckle at the "two bottle of mountain dew a day" comment.
Now if only someone was looking
DA-NA-NUNANAAAH-NUNANAAH doo doo doo dumb dumb da na na na nahh WELL YOU THINK YOU'LL BE JUSST FINEEE?? WITHOUT ME BUT YOUR MINEE!
Judging by how she handles things, I'd give it a lot less than 6 months
He deals in "business stuff" and "business stuff" accessories. 
why would he even admit to that?
That's a good man right there. Sorry it didn't work out.
This makes me think of my old roommates. They are absolutely perfect for each other, but both struggle with mental health issues, primarily depression. It's pretty easy for them to spiral. He is upset and She doesn't feel like she can help, which makes Her upset, which then makes Him more upset because he realizes that his depression has made Her upset and so on. Like you said they are mostly okay, but sometimes a minor incident will cause a week of them being down. They basically never get mad each other, but are sad at each other which is almost worse.
Agreed. VP should've immediately contacted their direct superior and been like "why is this dumb fuck bothering *me* with this pointless bullshit? I have *real* work to do." 
"and here, take my nail bat"
This made me laugh. Thank you! 
This is the truth. Workplaces are just "edgier" and more deceitful high schools.. only difference is you get a paycheck for attending. 
They're playing without me.
My friend wanted me to stop being so addicted to runescape and when I went to get food in the kitchen he sat at my computer and dropped all my armor (rune of course) and ever since then, I think back at it, and see it as more of a favor 
But what if he made it all up to trick you and over an elaborate scheme taking place over 20 years he will steal your identity and all your wealth just to buy weed?
I got stabbed in the hand with a pencil a few months before getting stabbed in the chest. 7th grade was not my favorite year. 
> Reminds me of some girl I knew in HS who stabbed her best friend with a syringe full of water because she "wanted to see what would happen."Man, teenagers do stupid shit and I hope she realizes someday how lucky she is, because 9 times out of 10 that will do nothing, but it *could* literally kill someone. Had she accidentally killed her friend she would have been fucked up forever
*rolls a 7*YOU MOTHERFUCKER YOU HAD A SHEEP ALL THIS TIME. I JUST SPENT 4 CLAY ON THAT SHEEP
This is what dogs are for.
Leave him his trimmed armor, at least. Don't be heartless.
One of these things is not like the others.
YOU THINK YOU CAN KICK ME OUT OF THE BAND and then Zach you come in with a facemelter
No,  no.  Then- boyfriend because we're engaged now. I kept a man like him around :)

You got suspended... For being stabbed? Because they assumed you must have deserved it?

Huh. I would have gone with congratu-fucking-lations. 
Nevermore was asked to play.
What if all these posts talking about how concert friend is the bad friend is actually the other "friend" trying his manipulative tactics once more? 
Every account on reddit is this manipulative piece of shit except you.
Getting hacked. I work in IT, and have to convince at least one person every week that some tiny change or inconvenience on their company computer or phone does NOT mean you were hacked. Forgetting your email password because you're too good to write it down does NOT mean you were hacked. Receiving that spam email about penis enlargement does NOT mean you were hacked. Skype cutting in and out during a conference call due to poor connection does NOT mean you were getting hacked.Just be smart, and if you don't know what something is-- don't click on it.
Kids sports. I coached kids soccer for 7 year olds and there would be parents screaming at their kids during the game and you'd have to ask them to quiet down. It's just a game, people 
Gluten-free dietsSome people can't eat gluten. Some people can, but mistakenly believe that avoiding it will help them lose weight. The nice thing about the latter group is that restaurants are now more likely to provide gluten-free options for those who actually need them. 
Nuclear reactors. They don't explode like a nuclear bomb.
I don't know about everyone, but I wish the robin who spends 18 hours out of every day launching himself at my daughter's bedroom window, would calm the fuck down about his reflection and cut that shit out.
Folks who get pissed at long lines at places you know are going to have a long line. Like the DMV, the Post Office, or Doctors office. You knew it was going to take awhile. Bring a fucking book or use that magical mobile device to entertain yourself silly!
I am the most valuable part of my life. If the money is lost, the girl leaves, the house burns down..I am the one who can rebuild and re-accomplish it all. I've done it before when I was scared and new.Also, exercise. Keep all your shit calm and collected.
A lot of people in the film industry are sure getting their panties in a twist about Netflix
What phone other people use.  Seriously, why do you even care?Platform advocacy in general is just stupid.  Nintendo vs. Sega was a fun battle for middle school, but so many people just don't seem to grow out of it.
Currently sitting in an airport waiting to board a flight, and every time there's been an announcement saying that our flight is going to be delayed a little longer, the lady in front of me yells at the flight attendants, from the comfort of her own seat.... Like I understand that you're frustrated about it but your yelling doesn't help the plane get to the gate faster!!!
Getting on a plane. We've all bought tickets. We've all reserved seats. We're all getting on this plane (unless you're flying United - topical) so why queue or push or add to the already stressful experience of making it onto a flight on time by turning an otherwise civilised experience into some kind of aviation-based Hunger Games?! 
Well in Ireland we are having great weather , peaks for 22 degrees a day(very unusual for Ireland)All I see all day on social media is sun this and sun that. Irish people need to calm the fuck down. Or in Irish terms 'calm de feck down wouldya'Edit - to avoid some peoples confusion , I am in fact Irish
Most things.  Not worth it.
When the plane lands. Everybody stands up gets their luggage and stand still for 15 min whilst they deploy the stairs. Whilst I chill and continue watching netflix downloads. Also when "boarding the plane xyz" is called. Everybody crowds to it, and proceeding to wait 40 min or so in a line with hand luggage. Whilst I chill and continue to watch Netflix downloads sitting down, 10ft away from the queue and being the last one. CALM FOCK DOWN
I'm an Android guy, an Android enthusiast if you will.. the whole debate about iPhone vs Android really needs to die. Both are good options and both have pros and cons.
That Elvis person all the young kids are so into now. The way he moves his hips, that just shouldn't be shown on TV. It's obscene!
Millennial's work ethic. I work with quite a few millenials and it seems to me the only reason they work less than baby boomers is because they use technology to their advantage.
What a save!What a save!What a save!
Avocado toast and $4 coffees. Apparently it's killing the American dream.
Millennials.  I keep seeing articles about how they're unbelievably lazy and have a disproportionate sense of entitlement.   I'm sure *some* do, but that's not reason enough to get hysterical about the entire generation.
Fidget spinners. People get so fucking angry over them it's incredible. Some guy the other day said a fidget spinners app was the downfall of society or something.
"OMG, the world is violent compared to how it used to be."Its always been violent. If anything, its less violent. With that said, we should never settle for something we can improve. Let's keep working to make the world a better place, but maintain perspective while doing it.
Every damned thing. I've never seen so many people offended over stupid shit in my life. 
Bandwagon-hating every trend.Let people do their shit smh
Hating stuff because it got popular."Twenty One Pilots is TERRIBLE! Emo trash!""The new Star Wars movie has NO REDEEMING QUALITIES! Sheep!""*insert video game here HAS THE WORST FANBASE! So cringe!"We get it, you like being an isolated hipster who only enjoys fringe shit. Go back to your corner where nobody can hear you scoffing under your breath."Hipsters are the WORST, amiright!? Who do they think they are?"
Call of Duty WWII having female characters in the French Resistance faction. It's not because of SJWs they added them, but because there were in fact women in the French Resistance 
Today is the last day for the Seniors at my high school and everyone is acting like all of these seniors are about to die and they will never be able to talk to them again. I just showed up to school 10 minutes ago and I have already seen more tears than the day after 2 girls committed suicide in the same week.
Making every tragedy an opportunity for showing *just how much you care*.Yes bombings are sad, yes ISIS are assholes, but putting a flag on your profile picture ain't gonna do shit, and doesn't make you a good person. 
The recent health craze going on. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for healthier eating, getting more exercise and seeing a healthier population (especially with kids), but almost everything is okay in moderation. A chocolate brownie doesn't need to be substituted for a dark cocoa powdered, spinach-banana, flax seed "brownie."
it's only game, why you heff to be mad
Reminds me of those parents who took their kids to see Deadpool and lost their shit, demanding their money back and threatening to sue, because there was adult themes in a comic book movie. It's fucking rated R, you idiot. What did you think was gonna happen? That's some lazy, shitty, goddamn parenting. 
Fun fact: Nuclear reactors are designed to not explode. Nuclear bombs are designed to explode.
But what if you put a nuclear bomb in it?Checkmate, atheists.
Put a sticker on the window. It doesn't have to be huge. 
I'm sorry I bought a robin costume and didn't know what else to do with it. 
Get a bat, man
What's even better, once I stopped feeling like having superior taste was important I realized I actually liked a lot of that stuff. Some popular music is terrible and will be forgotten but some of it is great and will be remembered for a long time. Missing out on it because "popular = bad" is just dumb. I like Coldplay all because I forgot about the stigma and gave them an honest chance.
THANK YOUI come from the jazz and classical worlds of music, and 9/10 people in those communities say things like "you have to actually study it to understand this sophisticated music" or "oh, you haven't heard this album/piece? You're not a REAL fan." Then they wonder why more people aren't becoming interested in their music. It's a real problem that I hope goes away in my lifetime.
Nah, I think it's pretty legit to be pissed that you have to wait a long time at the doctor's office. You make *appointments* at those places. If they're not ready for you at your appointment time, they fucked up.
Also, kids know the difference between when they've "won" something and when they've been "given" something, so this idea that it's creating a soft culture is some seriously overblown and stupid bullshit.The generation that created participation trophies cause they couldn't handle their kids being average at something is now shitting on kids for having participation trophies. It's insane.
It's fun to compare the objective pros and cons of technology, but it's pretty rare that *A* is better than *B* at everything rings true.There are things I love/hate about iOS, Android, Windows, Linux, OS X, BSD, etc.
The only reason to care what phone other people use is if you're seeking information to evaluate which one YOU want. "Oh, you have that phone! How do you like X? How does it compare to Y?" But the pissing contest about "Why would you want that phone?" is stupid. It's right up there next to the console VS PC shit. 
Agreed. I've had long delays happen a couple of times. Yelling at the staff doesn't change the situation, neither does sitting around and talking shit loudly in hopes that others will join them. 
Also people lining up in line or "next to" the line before their boarding group. C'mon your ticket is assigned and you'll get on the plane before it takes off I promise. 
And calm down about the refs.  They are usually only a couple of years older than the kids they are refereeing/umpiring.  My son loves baseball.  He qualified as an umpire when he was around 12.  He knew the rules better than the grown ups, but it was also meant to be a learning time.  He did it for one year and quit.  The parents were horrible to him.  I remember a huuuuge father leaning over him and yelling at him about a call.  Fuck that guy.
I coach 12s and 13s and by far the worst part is the parents. I've had parents rip their kid's faces off before the fucking game even started! Like, they're in the stretching lines in tears. How the hell are they supposed to perform with that on their shoulders?And as much as I'd like to I can't really go tell them their parents are wang-rods or anything, fuck it sucks.
Because there is always "limited space in the overhead bins"
Reverse Seasonal Affective Disorder. 
We're going to hit 30 on saturday in Britain. The weather forecast just slapped a huge 30 over the whole island in a "its gonna be s hot the specifics dont even matter" kinda way.
It is because Irish people are really pale and when the sun comes out it burns those soulless creatures.
I stand up even though I know I have a 15 minute wait simply because I need to try to get some feeling back into my long legs before I have to walk off the plane. 
I feel you there. I have a cousin who deployed to Iraq a couple times and it's incredibly sad to see how much the war fucked him up. It was also interesting meeting other guys from his unit at his wedding, the general vibe I got from that group was interesting. 
He makes me want to chew gum and stay out past curfew!
I started my first office job recently, at a subsidiary of a fortune 100 company. I work with 5 other people and they're all older than 40 and have been working there for several years. Most of the job *should* be done through computers, but several aspects are still done with a pen and paper because they can't adapt to the technology. I had to show someone how to download files from an email and attach them in another. They had worked there for YEARS. I did all of the daily tasks in under an hour and they were amazed. I just don't understand how huge companies are able to function. 
Savage!
For real. Chat disabled is the only way to play some days.
You rock!Cancel that!You rock!Cancel that!Ugh I hate chat in team based PVP.
r/outoftheloop, can you explain it to me ?
Apparently its killed the Australian one.
The people selling the expensive toast and coffee *are* the American dream though...
But it killed the housing market*\* - not the record low salaries, massive student costs/debt, physical mobility required for jobs now, etc
The worst is when millennials themselves write these kinds of articles. Way to throw your entire generation under the bus assholes.
I feel some people use the word 'Millennials' as a synonym for 'young people' :/
Moist. Moist. Moist. Moist. Moist.(40 minutes)
As a high school teacher of Freshman, I think I'm allowed a little hate. I have exactly one kid with ADHD that correctly utilizes his fidget cube and spinner. ( No issue with this kid)All the rest?Why the fuck do you need one that lights up and makes noise.(Also bottle flipping smh)
It's been getting less violent but in exchange, we're now able to see every violent thing that happens. 
Man, I wish more people understood this. Yes the world is fully of shitty people and things, but it's a hell of a lot less shitty that it was even a few decades ago.I think part of the problem is that the time period people tend to fantasise about is almost always the era in which they grew up. If you had an ok childhood then that period will always seem better than the one where you're an adult, burdened by responsiblities and aware of all the crap going on.The 1950s seems to be a particular favorite.
Hey, calm down.
It always amused me that shows like Breaking Bad were packed full of violence, gore (the ol dissolving bodies in a bathtub) and drug use, yet using the word "fuck" more than once a season was apparently where AMC drew the line. As if people old enough to tolerate the rest aren't old enough to have heard the word fuck a million times. 
ERMEHGERD FIGDET SPINERS NED 2 DIEEEEE
That sounds like elitism with extra steps 
I don't do the flag on the profile because you have that really awkward moment when you have to take it down...
The number of people probably googling "Manchester Flag" over the past couple of days...
It's called virtue signalling.> Virtue signalling is the conspicuous expression of moral values by an individual done primarily with the intent of enhancing that person's standing within a social group.Companies do it all the time these days.
People need to calm down about food preferences in general. Like, if you want to pour your milk before your cereal or put ice in your milk, then you do you. 
Right? I am all for being a more health conscious population (i.e. maintaining a healthy, balanced diet) but some of the advice I have seen come out of the "movement" is sometimes just hyperbolic. 
>Just calm down. It's something we've been doing forever. Why am I being made aware of this just now? And more importantly why don't I have any recollection of it all?
Just sayin I am a virgin and I deeply care about losing it 
I mean, *I* care about the sex *I'm* having or not having. I think it's fair to say we each care about our own sex.But yeah, other people shouldn't. Generally.As long as, you know, it's consensual. Effective consent, none of that namby-pamby, "well, she technically said yes" consent. And you're not cheating on anybody. 
the universe is so humongous big

EA SPORTS
Reminds me of when some mom brought her 5yr old and 2yr old in a stroller to see Logan. They promptly walked right out when the bachelorette flashed her tits. Like, I don't know what the mom was expecting
And people who could not afford Samurai did not hire Samurai.
Extra effective if the sticker is a life-sized image of a hawk. 
Hang around with an older man who wants some young Dick to mentor. 
I didn't know the stigma existed when I started liking Coldplay. And I was honestly surprised to learn about it. Same with Nickelback. I didn't grow up listening to any type of rock music, so they sounded fairly average when compared to other musicians in the same genre. 
I used to hate any hip-hop that was at all gangster or "ignorant". I got over that stupidity a few years ago and I've found so much more music that I love.The best way to listen to music is to always go in to it wanting to enjoy it. My listening habits are so much better now that I'm open minded about everything.
I personally felt that AvA 23 was when the series hit its peak 
I mean. They do all the time and no one goes to watch it. There are plenty of original top tier films in the past couple years and they did well for their budget but they did abysmal compared to what alien vs avengers would pull. At some point you have to blame the audience. 
But Sega doesn't do what NintenDO
I've got a MacBook and a Windows desktop, they're both great. I use them for different things, they're both great machines that I don't regret investing it at all.
Oh I love the ones that say "I'm never flying this airline again" out loud when it's something like a delay to the gate or a weather diversion that has nothing to do with that specific airline. 
**"ON A GOOD DAY, BACK WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE, I USED TO FUCK AROUND AND GET A TRIPLE DOUBLE."**
Football/Soccer coach here, can confirm.  It's mostly those parents who themselves failed miserably in their youth doing the sport, who now expect their kids to do better.
When I was like 9 there was a kid on my team with 1 arm (no idea if he was in an accident or it was a birth defect or what) and I remember one game he was in the on deck circle taking practice swings and his mom came up to the fence and started scolding him about him not having a hit all season and that he better get one that at bat.  The kid had 1 fuckin arm, the fact that he could even swing the bat 1 handed at that age was good enough in my eyes.
To be fair, if it's 25 or 28 or 30 the result in the UK is the same:Overweight men will still walk around with their shirts off. Every single woman under a certain age will wear one of those long, maxi dresses, regardless of whether they owned one before this week. The Sun will have a picture of some students in bikinis on Brighton beach, together with a 'heat' based pun. The entire population of Scotland will turn bright red and shed their skin. 
Not anymore there's a blanket
I live in American Australia, can confirm. 
I so pale.
Have a couple of friends in different branches, the ones that have never seen combat or been deployed are all mouthy about wanting to blow shit up etcThe two that actually got deployed, don't speak much about it and when they came back, they weren't the same. They have a look about them that just screams 'I've seen shit' but I know they will never talk to me about it.
He makes me want to overdose on bennies and drag race my friends until the loser dies in a fiery crash. #real1950s
Git Gud
Usually it is ok, and if people start saying I am trash I just laugh because that means that they are just as terrible at this game as me.Especially in Bronze, what the hell are players expecting? 
Fuckin Smite man, dude can be feeding and you die once then he starts this bullshit.
What the comment is referring to is the game chat in Rocket League. One of the quick chat commands is "What a save!" which was likely intended to be used to congratulate teammates, but is now used sarcastically when the enemy team scores a goal.
If I hadn't bought that avocado three years back I'd own a home outright and be set up for retirement by forty five...
This expensive toast actually sounds pretty tasty.....going to the store so I can some right now. I guess it's not expensive toast anymore though if I make it myself. 
I have personally cut back on my avocado toast consumption. I am now a millionaire. 
>Old man yells at cloudMystery solved. 
And the funny thing is that so many Gen Xers have forgotten about how we used to be the ones who were stereotyped when we were in our teens/20s. I've got a friend who's a couple of years older than me who's always going on about "entitled millennials". When I remind her that boomers used to whine about us being "slackers" her response is always "um, no, that was different, these kids really are entitled." It's almost like it's a symptom of being young.
My brother was yelling at me for no reason, and his main argument was that I was a millennial.  Bro, you're 2 years older than me. You were born in 1991.You're a millennial, too.
Like the people 17 and under as of now aren't even millennials, they're technically gen z
Pokemon actually has been absurdly popular again, at least where I'm from.  I made about a good 150 splitting up my old cards into little makeshift booster packs, and selling them to my friends and coworkers for their kids.  Fidget spinners, on the other hand, have already taken a huge nosedive.  Like, one week they were all the rage, and now the kids are over them.Its kinda funny since Reddit seems intent on hating anything kids like, but by the time they get around to circlejerking about it, the kids have already moved on to the next thing.  
> If you aren't a middle schooler, odds are your primary exposure to these things comes either from Facebook or from complaints on Reddit.Reddit complaining is the sole source of my knowledge of silly trends, SJW, fat pride, angry feminists, flat-earthers, anti-vaxers and a lot more. It's never something I see in real life, sometimes I doubt that these things actually exists. 
No.. you calm down.
'Say my name''Heisenberg''You're gosh dang right'
As odd of a trend as it is... it is nice seeing my one fifth grader who, according to his IEP, is required to have a small box of fidgets.... well, all of a sudden he is a cool kid, not the weirdo with the box of toys he gets to play with while everyone else sits and learns.  In fact, he has things ten times cooler than the spinner that people all of a sudden want to borrow and tinker with.
I really do hate this brigade against fidget spinners. Wasn't it not so long ago that people were crying out about kids not playing with physical toys and just glued to their screens? And now there's a cheap physical toy that everyone loves, and people are losing their heads again.
Your teacher was an arse. 
<3 My Chemical Romance sticker sales have gone through the roof!
Fun fact: Jesus was against virtue signalling.Matthew 6:1"Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven. So when you give to the needy, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be praised by men. "
Maybe I got whooshed but the humor is supposed to be in the debate itself. One of the many memes where the joke is the gross over exaggeration. I.e harambe, gingers having no soul , mei being the actual devil spawn and the whole   Sugar vs salt on grits Thing.I personally see it as a cheeky ribbing between the two parties.Sorry if I'm being captain obvious.
Scientific research over the years has shown that if people sometimes can't recollect an incident, it's because the incident never happened.
WAT
If only we could get Bryz to replace Mike Milbury on NBC Sports.
is only a game
Probably thought it would just be blood and violence - you know, stuff that's perfectly fine for children to see. They didn't expect there to be anything actually adult, like boobs.
A billion years ago Japan might not have been here.
Extra effective if, instead of a sticker, you use a life-sized hawk
I think I'll keep giving this guy's daughter nightmares, thanks.
Not to mention TV technology has progressed to the point where the quality doesn't even diminish if watched at home.  Maybe the screen won't be as huge, but it makes it even harder to justify a $20 ticket.  
Are you pronouncing it 'do' or 'doe' in that sentence? I'm not sure there's a right answer.
Sir? SIR. WAKE UP SIR. I ASKED IF YOU'D LIKE AN IN-FLIGHT BEVERAGE.
I was on a Southwest flight and some parents were letting their kid run up and down the aisle with their hands out tapping seats. Taptaptaptap laugh.  People were giving dirty looks but the parents were oblivious and no one said anything. This went on and off a couple of times.During the beverage service the kid bumped into the flight attendant who looked back over her shoulder and said, "Hey kid, why don't you go play outside.". It was glorious.
....Dwight?
Should have called child services with him threatening the kid as well.
Damn that's awesome. So what did he like quit his job and just become a full time sports league manager or what?
So how does he deal with parents going "Aw come on Jimmy! You can do better!" Or coaches yelling at players across the field so they can be heard? 
Piece of shit here, can confirm. Always disappointed my kids don't live up to the idea in my head of how good I could have been if I didn't suck so hard. Maybe if I just yell some more they'll get it. 
You can make a religion out of this.
I've seen two types return from deployment: You get the one guy that talks about everything and goes in to great detail about his deployment and you immediately know he didn't see shit, do shit, or accomplish shit; he just sat in the green zone pushing papers. Then you get the guy that is withdrawn, refuses to talk about his deployment and is genuinely trying to move on. You immediately KNOW he's seen some shit and did some shit while over there. 
Savage! 
> Shouldn't they be economising by eating at home?   We don't have a home! How are we supposed to eat somewhere that doesn't exist!  Is this guy listening or what?

You are free to describe things using whatever word you wish.
Jamie, pull that shit up
Oi, calm the f*ck down cunt
Kinda made sense for walts character to not swear as often though. Characters like pinkman shoulda been FAR FAR more vulgar.
wait what's he got? 10x cooler than a spinner you say?
You're missing the point. People are mad that kids are playing with anything the adult is unfamiliar with. Down with fidget spinners!! Make Cup and Ball Great again!
That really depends on what the assignment was. 
I really ought to check out his book. Seems like there's a lot of wisdom in it, if you don't take it literally.
I think there are two camps. The ones who are just being playful about a difference of minor opinion, and the ones who get legit emotional about what strangers eat.I think part of the problem is that some people don't realize the first group is playing, because they behave identically to the second group.TLDR: Poe's Law.
Wait a minute... I can't remember being born. Does that mean it may have never happened?
Stop taking my job ya immigrant jk I have a brown dick too cheers mate
But in the year -40,000 it was here, and you could walk to it.
True life pro tip right there.
if anything the participation trophies are just reminding you that you weren't good enough to get the winning trophy
I just saved the country. Give me a Coors.
If a member of the cabin crew woke me up like that I'd be god damn furious.
Would've 'accidentally' stuck my foot out in the isle a bit.  Oops, sorry kid, maybe YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN RUNNING AROUND LIKE A LITTLE FUCKING SHIT.And fuck your parents, too.  Assholes.
Yeah. He's made a very good living out of running the league (and still coaching full time in it). Quality dude.
It's not volume-based, you can be as loud as you want (I mean, within reason). It's all tone/content. Disappointed "You can do better" might get a look but nobody would say anything. Meanwhile, "You got this, Jimmy, come on!" is totally fine. And the coaches are all employees of the league, no parent volunteers, which helps as both a distancing device socially and for training. 
Guy with no kids here. I sell participation trophies because the parents can't handle their kid not having one.
no don't 
I enjoy the way that she just snaps into professional mode like it didn't even happen.
My friends would talk about their down time and stuff like that but nothing else, just about how they got a really great tan, played games, hit the gym and stuff like that.Not once would they say anything about anything else, they just have a look in their eyes that is kind of distant.
My favorite was when somebody asked the government how young people should afford houses and the answer was literally "get Mum and Dad to buy it".No, wait, my favorite has got to be Joe Hockey saying that it didn't matter if they raised the fuel tax because poor people don't have cars anyway.It's both very sad and very funny how severely out of touch the government is with its citizens.
Soggy cake. Humid cake. Damp cake. Sweaty cake. Drenched cake. Wet cake.

10 spinners.
Kids who get hooked by the spinner realize it is just a toy and that it doesn't help them concentrate, but they LOVE the cube.  It has a switch, some buttons, a rolling ball thing.... his is something they love to play with that doesn't absorb all of the attention like the spinner.  Also various fun pencil toppers

Fuck Cup and Ball, follow the gourd!
Speaking as an atheist (not one of those assholes from /r/atheism), I have found the most wisdom in Matthew.
Some more scientific research over the years showed that 'sometimes' is the key word in the aforementioned scientific research.
I long for the day when man is not judged by the color of his skin but by the color of his dick. Sorry ladies.

I'm sorry, we don't have Coors. Is Miller Ultra okay? 
> You got this, Jimmy, come on!I thought this is what people did already. That's how most parents were when I played little league.Then again, I played in the crappy leagues and nobody thought they were going to play for the pros
Participation trophy here. You are superb just for even trying!
I love that this is a meme now
After a brief moment of 0_0
If you are in the unit with them, and you are training, you hear some shit. You hear those downtime stories, but you also hear stories about the scenarios that you are training for. Part of me wishes I would have deployed so that I feel like I helped, and part of me is extremely thankful that I completed my six years without seeing those things.
Whoa
Now that's got Reddit nice and firm.
Ha! Back in my day, we had a stick. A STICK!
And then it got warmer and the ice melted and there were lots of *trees*
He screams, a cold sweat runs down his back as the flavorless pisswater makes its way down his throat...!He wakes up in his bed made of Coors cans. Oh thank god, it was just one of those double-layered "It was just a dream!" twists.
"What the fuck was that Jimmy!? I'm gonna beat you when we get home until you understand how to catch a ball you fuckin narc!"Is more along the lines of today's parents.
Dusty shelf here. Looking forward to getting cleaned off. 
True that. Only time I heard anything was in boot camp. From my chief. Given my position, I'll never see the things he saw, but he drove the point home. This isnt about the down time or the fun you have or the people you meet. People are out there fighting and dying doing things I probably never could. I'm thankful my position keeps me away from it all, but also envious of his experiences because I want to feel like I'm doing more. Even so, my job is to support and provide a necessity to the guys out there. I'm content with that.
Can someone do the math on this?
If you were rich, you had a hoop to go with your stick.
Pledge can here. Orders are skyrocketing. Can't wait to make that shelf slick as shit.
We need more of your attitude in the armed forces. It is a collective job, and a lot of meatheads don't realize how vital people like you are. I am logistics myself, though I have one of the more dangerous logistics jobs (transportation) right now. I have seen videos of first hand accounts from my buddies, so I am extremely thankful I didn't have to witness these things.
Dust here. Nervous about getting pledged. 
A master chef told me this in culinary school: "you can always stop cooking." Take it off the burner or out of the oven if you need to. Surprisingly helpful tip
Learn cooking techniques instead of recipes.Don't approach recipes like they're magic spells in the Harry Potter universe. If you wiggle your nose wrong or put in a spec to much of some seasoning you're not going to end up with a completely different dish.Alton Brown does an incredible job of teaching a cooking technique and then showing you a recipe that applies that technique. If you learn a process instead of a rote recipe you will know how to cook dozens of dishes, and it's really the only way to develop skills in the kitchen.
Chop with the rear part of the blade, not the tip, in a rolling motion.
Control your heat. Control everything, but mostly your heat.
Keep it simple.  Something with 3-4 ingredients that go really well together is better than something with 12 ingredients that clash with each other.
pastry chef here, not my best tip but the only one I can think of this early on my day off...flouring pans for cakes is a step not to be skipped but when it comes to chocolate cakes, it looks awful so for dark cakes, I use cocoa powder instead.
Learn to brown things. So many people are content with their ability to not burn things that a lot of food that could be GREAT turns out tasting no better than if they had boiled it.
If you have to keep adding salt, try adding some citric acid instead
Don't cook with oil while naked.
Heat will remain in your food after turning off the stove and it will continue to cook, so pay attention to your timing.e.g. when you want to add cheese to your omelette, cheese should melt in a plate with heat of the eggs, otherwise you will have over dried omelette, same as overcooked pasta. 
Not a food tip but a cooking tip.... a falling knife has no handle. If you drop a knife, get the hell out of the way and let it hit the floor. Washing it is easy enough. Try to catch it and you could be visiting the emergency room.
If something burns slightly, throw BBQ sauce on it and call it "Smoked".If something that's supposed to be smooth comes out chunky, call it "Homestyle".
you can clean while you cook
Mise en place, which is French for "cut and measure your shit out ahead of time". Saves so much stress. 
Timers. I always forget I have something going on the stove while I'm cutting something across the kitchen. Timers save lives. 
You can use the stem of broccoli. Just peel, slice and fry it in the pan, it's delicious.
If you're worried about calories, just eat a smaller portion rather than substituting "healthier" ingredients.  Especially when baking.
The only recipe that should have only one clove of garlic in it is a recipe for one clove of garlic. Two MINIMUM people.
Not a chef, just italian. Now ,at last, i can rant on how to cook pasta.For the love of what's holy wait for the water to reach boiling point before dumping the pasta in it, and remember to salt the water. Nobody likes eating starch glue.Furthermore when making spaghetti try to use a proper pot, it shouldn't be necessary to break the spaghetti in half in order to cook them.
Not a chef, but cooking is my hobby. Number one rule in my book is follow a recipe exactly at least once before fucking around with it. I've seen too many people get angry or frustrated because they decided to substitute X for Y, and then the dish turns out badly. Try the recipe first, then decide if there's too much garlic, or if cinnamon would taste better to you than nutmeg.If you hate peeling garlic, take as many cloves as you need, toss them in a bowl, cover with another bowl, and shake the hell out of it. The peels get knocked off. Also, fuck margarine. Just use butter.
Don't be afraid to experiment. Every successful new recipe or derivation was at one point an experiment.
Seasoning is paramount. I didn't realize this until I got to know my GF's family. Most people way underseason their food or only use the basic salt, pepper, garlic powder etc. You think baked chicken is bland? You're not seasoning it enough. Olive oil, salt, pepper, rosemary, thyme, garlic powder, and SMOTHERED in Paprika. Delicioso.
Salt your food. It's amazing how much better things taste with just a little salt. 
Not a chef really by trade, but learned this while I worked as one: take a small hand towel and either loop it through a belt loop or between your waist and your belt so it hangs over your leg.  As you move around, then, you always have something to wipe your hands/your instruments on and you don't need to go out of your way to do it!
A knife is not a wedge. It's a knife.If you're pushing down to split your food in half, you're **doing it wrong**.Who's supposed to be cutting the food here -- you, or the knife? Exactly. You're the brains, the knife is the muscle. So stop leaning into your knife trying to part the bread sea, and start *slicing*.Seriously, if your knife is sharp enough, dragging the blade's length across whatever you want to cut should be plenty to get through it. The weight of the blade is all you need.
> Don't approach recipes like they're magic spells in the Harry Potter universe.NOTE: this advice does not apply to baking. Cooking is art; baking is chemistry.
Measuring spoons are for baking, not for spices.
Alton brown is amazing.
Damn. 49 yrs. The rolling motion. I forgot about the rolling motion. Welp. I probably have 20 yrs left before I'm spoon fed so thanks. 
my mom will only cook with max heat because its faster, but it always ended up tasting better than my dad's careful heat management. then i found out that chinese food is to be made on high heat always basically :/
My wife ruined my copper (copper!!) pots/pans by constantly doing this. She turns on our gas stoves and blasts shit like a Saigon flame throwers. 
Just to piggyback on your excellent point, when a recipe calls for garlic, people need to try adding both raw garlic and roasted garlic. The raw garlic will still have that sharpness and bite(when cooked), but the roasted garlic adds an entirely different dimension, a mellow, earthy flavour and the two compliment each other very well
If you do this, don't eat 3 heads of garlic in one sitting.  Your stomach will hurt and you will smell bad for a few days.  Source: my wife ate too many of these at once.
Recently i have been using black garlic, it is garlic that has been gently heated over several week and looks like little nubs of tar, it smells and tastes awesome, it has a really deep molasses like, umami flavour, you would not even know it was garlic really, great in sauces and gravy.
>not my best tip How dare you keep your best tip from us... 
To piggy back on this, DO NOT use sweetened cocoa powder or semi-sweet, as the sugar will caramelize. 
Why do you flour pans? I'm assuming it's to stop it from sticking, but why wouldn't baking paper or simply buttering work?
Man...every time I want to brown something, and my dad is around, he'll put a lid on the pan because all the 'flavor is being let out', apparently. Sometimes I have to be stern and say I'm following a recipe, but how can I explain this to him? All the meat my parents cook seems to be half-boiled in its own juices from putting lids on every fucking pan...
How does one brown something without burning it?
* Does not apply if it's tomato based, add sugar instead. 
For sauces and gravies, a splash of apple cider gives a lot of complexity to an otherwise simple sauce.
Rather, don't cook naked if you're going to puss out.
Same with bacon.
To piggyback, season even more when using ground turkey. 
I love to bake but it's so hard to follow this principle. I usually try to make small individual things so I can eat one before I serve without the cake missing an obvious chunk.
Tasted raw chicken.  Now I'm dead. Thanks. 
As a professional cook, i have always struggled to find out how to go about this with say...meatballs. i cant taste the mixture before i cook so its always a bit of a crap shoot. Any suggestions?
"Add 5 cloves of garlic to the stew" "Wow, that is a ton of garlic! In you go!"my coworkers roommate, adding 5 bulbs whole not peeled into a stew
I went for the catch one time because my cat was like rubbing itself on my ankles at the time. No regrets because cleaning up the bloody mess from me catching a knife by the blade was easier than cleaning up the mess of a dead cat would've been. Plus I kinda liked my cat and didn't want to accidentally stab it.
Girlfriend always laughs how even if I drop a spatula I will jump back and out.    Reflexes are reflexes and have saved me so far.
Yesterday I showed my husband the hole in the floor where I dropped a knife, got myself out of the way and watch it embed itself half an inch in the wood floor.
Or if something comes out a bit sloppier that you expected, you have created a nice wholesome "Rustic" dish.
Mmm, smoked toast. My favorite. 
A sharp knife is a safe knife.
Also, you don't need these 10 kitchen knives. 3 good knives of different sizes, properly sharpened and cared for should be all you need. Then, only buy other knives if you have a need for them (like one for peeling, etc.)
There's a reason restaurants do not use the Everlasting Eternally Sharp as sold on TV serrated knives. They suck. Don't buy that junk.
On that note, knives need to be replaced over time. Grandmas favorite kitchen knife doesn't need to be handed down like a sword for generations.
This is exactly what I do whenever I cook. I always end up with just a saucepan and plates/cutlery once we're done eating. On the other hand everyone else I know ends up with every single utensil and piece of crockery used when they're done, which makes it hard to relax after an enjoyable meal. It's so easy to keep on top of; that part where you leave to simmer for x minutes- wash up while you wait. Bring to boil- wash up while you wait. Cook until softened/browned- wash up while you wait, etcetera etcetera.  
I don't get how people have trouble with this. When ~~in Viking~~ *I'm cooking* the only thing left at the end are one pan and n plates of hot food.  
I thought that meant that everything is supposed to be keep in its rightful place.  So you can find it when you need it.
Preparation is the key for efficient an fast cooking. Even at home I cut vegetables in advance and store them in the fridge. Not having to cut all this stuff for every meal you prepare can save a lot time.
> You probably need less garlic than you thinkHe is saying that he is a chef, but this gave it away that he is an obvious liar! Think about how much garlic you need and double the amount! Blasphemy!
Can you give some examples of very surprising instances when pro chefs use butter? 
Cut everything before you even touch a cooker. Mise en Place. 
This but also with tops of certain veggies. I've used carrot greens, radish greens, and celery leaves sauteed with butter and salt. They also taste good thrown into salads.Just do a quick google check to see if it's edible beforehand.
Yes, THANK YOU. God, I'm so sick of people bringing diet food to office parties and then having seconds. Two plates of bad food doesn't hold a candle to one plate of good food!
Meh, I think it depends. Granted, you should still watch your portions, but if a healthier alternative still tastes good, I say substitute it. Like the average slice of bread is like 70 calories. Doesn't sound like much, but when you're usually using 2 slices, that adds up. I recently found a 35 calorie bread and it tastes exactly the same. Not "the same" like "OOH DIET COKE TASTES THE SAME AS REGULAR" (it does not), it actually tastes like just regular bread.
Julia Child says you can use dry vermouth in place of white wine in recipes, which is great if you only need a splash and don't want to open a whole new bottle.
I like to buy those little 4-packs of single serving wines.  Good enough to cook with and I don't have to open a large bottle if I dont have any around.
Don't use cooking wine. But do use bad wine or wine that has gone stale because it's been open on the fridge for a few too many days. 
Speaking from limited experience I would recommend avoiding cooking with sweet wines. Following the "cook with what you would drink" adage I tried moscato and it was genuinely terrible.
NEVER ENOUGH GARLIC
And please please toss the spaghetti in the sauce, don't just dump it on top. 
One of my roommates doesn't add salt to the water. My other roommate times her pasta based on what the box says to determine when it's done. Now I appreciate my parents' pasta technique that has been passed down to me.
When you get good enough, you can just look briefly at the recipe and already see why the person that wrote it doesnt have tastebuds.
Didn't know your mum was my wife.
precook your wings by frying them in oil at about 225-250, cool, then fry again at 360-375 to crisp them. this technique renders more fat from under the skin and puffs it a little. can dredge in wheat or rice flour using this method as well (second fry only)
Can confirm.  Winged a baked potato recipe.  Ended up with a functional, yet batteryless, clock.
Hmm. A few days ago, I decided to make "impromptu dough" where I just mixed together a bunch of stuff I thought sounded good and then baked it to see what happened.Keep in mind, I don't really know how to bake and can only barely cook. The resulting lump of hardened (baked, I guess) dough I got was pretty much inedible. I ended up tossing it in the trash. Maybe I should stop doing that,
What is the Dark Arts of cooking?
Weighing scales are for baking, measuring spoons are a dark art
No worries. We use tubes these days. 
Chinese food is 25 minutes prep +3 minutes of applying high heat.
Gotta get that wok hei
Bought lovely new pans. SO (who is major kitchen hazard) used for midnight snack, burnt then scraped clean with a knife. Get a mad facial twitch just thinking about it. 
When I do a roast chicken I always roast some garlic along with the potatoes or whatever delicious veg I am having. And then smush it onto whatever I happen to be eating. Love dat garlic.
You'll get the best tip if you want.
I didn't even know sweetened cocoa powder exists.
It's a dry barrier that will discourage adhesion of the baked good, allowing it to rise as it bakes. Butter is fine if rising isn't a concern, but fats are "sticky" and can actually hold flour-based things down. It's the same reason you would flour a surface when you're rolling out or kneading dough. 
My mother does this with "fried" chicken. Just a little more oil than it takes to cover the bottom of the pan, and covers it the whole time. She can never figure out why it doesn't come out crispy like the fried chicken she has at restaurants, despite me constantly telling her she's making steamed chicken, not fried chicken
> what's missing is acid.LSD?
I dunno, a tiny splash of red wine vinegar is my secret ingredient in chili. No added sugar, just meat, beans, crushed tomatoes, pepper, onion, and spices.
My mom gets pissed if she finds out there is sugar in pretty much anything! Like I was making a cheese cake and she got pissed when I added sugar because "cream cheese has PLENTY of sugar", yet another reason I can't wait to move out...
Apple cider or apple cider vinegar?
Don't cook bacon with oil?
Good advice. Ground turkey needs all the help it can get.
Baking is harder, but some of the best ways to get consistent cakes (or other baked goods) is to:          1.) Get a scale and use recipes that give measurements in grams/ounces 2.) taste the batter! Raw batter will not kill you and in general if the batter tastes good the cake will taste good 3.) learn what a well cooked moist cake feels like. It should be lightly springy, but firm, when you gently pat the middle. After a few times you'll be able to tell with no problem. 
Nice try Gary, we know you're still living on insanity you crazy bastard! 
Take a small amount and toss is in a hot pan to cook it through.
I remember seeing a Jamie Oliver recipe with a typo so it said something like 30 teaspoons of salt instead of the required 3. All the comments were complaining it was way too salty. Imagine having that much faith in Jamie Oliver.
I would eat that.  After removing the skins.
Nice split second decision there 
I'm with the kicking the cat crowd. Only time I have intentionally kicked him was when he jumped toward an open oven door. Poor kitty was a soccer ball for a minute.
There is a "No animals in the kitchen while cooking" rule in our house. Animals know the invisible border in which they can not cross during cooking time. Don't want to trip over one of them while holding boiling water or something. Would be bad for both of us. 
You have the instinct to survive, she does not
An inch?  Wow.  Is your floor made of balsa wood? 
Crucial step: Burn a piece of toast as a offering to the gods.
My former head chef always said:If you mess up a main dish, call it "Rustic"If you mess up a dessert, call it "Artisanal"
Got my dad a good quality kitchen knife for Christmas. Just found out that he's hidden it away in a top cupboard because it's sharp.
I think about 95% of homes badly need to pack their knives up and take them to a professional sharpener. And also learn how to use a honing steel. It makes such a difference!
Pairing, chef's, and bread.  I have never had a need for anything else.
i only use a katana personally used by Jin Kai Moto-san to conquer the 15th century child emperor Taka Hami-san
Professional sharpening is cheaper than people think, and a good pro will tell you when it's time to replace. Also: Learn the difference between sharpening and honing, hone regularly and sharpen as needed. 
The problem a lot of beginner chefs have is that we feel the need to watch the pot on the stove instead of walking away and letting it cook on its own. 
Life.
I've explained to my children that clean dishes = food.You should see those little fuckers go. 
Buddy, I think you're doing it wrong.You're not supposed to be in the viking. He just helps you out. 
Be careful with this. Some ingredients taste better when chopped fresh. Onions, for example, will be noticeable more flavorful if diced just before using them vs. if they were diced a day or so ago.
My tip: when you see a recipe that calls for X cloves of garlic, just cross out cloves and write in bulbs. 
All these gif recipes show them just dumping ramekins full of pre-chopped and pre-measured ingredients into their places, is that the way to go? Should I invest in some more ramekins/similar?
Tell me at the very end to check if its safe. you've got your priorities all wrong!Now I have to go to the er because I made a rhubarb leaf salad.
Saint Julia is right.  Especially because, much of the time, you are reducing the wine for a sauce.  Reducing already fortified wine is quicker for the same flavor punch.
Does this happen? As there people who..... Don't finish their wine?
I wish garlic amounts were by weight - some cloves are half the size of others 
i can and do eat sauteed garlic. so good. never enough. 
Which is fine if you like how your changes turn out. But don't be that guy that posts a reply like "I didn't have flour so I substituted baking soda. Also I am trying to cut back on sugar so instead of 5 cups of sugar I used 1 cup of salt. 0/10 would not recommend."
Man, the # of recipes I see where "saute onions, 5 minutes", and I always wonder if these people have tasted onions that have sauteed for 20+ minutes before. They keep getting better!
Instructions unclear, try to eat clock.  No is potato.Such is life.
It shows curiosity and initiative! Keep it up and you'll have something tasty one day:) 
Molecular Gastronomy. 
Fuck, I really hope there's not a day when I need to be tube fed. I'd honestly rather be euthanized.
There isn't one single "right" way to hold a knife. That's just a popular way a lot of chefs do it since it provides a better pivot point and control with the knife. That said, I've worked with chefs who've preferred what Alton Brown called the "accuser" grip which has your pointer finger running along the spine of the knife. I always thought that was super unsafe but...works for them I guess. 
Reminds me of an ex...
Never thought I'd see the term wok hei on reddit. It's true though, wok hei is everything
My mom did this to all our nice pans, so now she's pissed that my dad and I don't want her using the NEW nice pans... (I spent $80 on a set of nice cake pans and she thought using a steak knife to loosen a cake I was letting cool was a good idea, and ruined the coating on, and she used steal wool to clean a non-stick frying pan)
I had to teach my husband not to use metal in my goddamn pans. He ruined all of his by using a fork or knofe to cook/stir.... they were awful and sad.  
I remember never believing that cocoa powder was unsweetened. It's chocolate, and chocolate's always sweet right? I remember taking a big ol' spoonful because I was hungry.I couldn't breathe straight for half an hour. And the taste...
Oh my god! Is this why homemade cakes tend to have a huge rise in the middle, but are almost flat towards the edges? 
To add to that, when you're browning stuff, leave it alone. Meat often sticks to the pan as it's browning but releases once it's ready to flip over. If you try to flip it too early the nice browned stuff will end up stuck to the pan.
Water! The secret ingredient was water! Yes, ordinary water, laced with nothing more than a few spoonfuls of LSD.
A couple drops and you'll swear you can even see the flavours!
Personally I need some sugar in there to balance it out. Either brown sugar or sweeter ingredients like carrots. That said, I live in a country where rich, sweet, balanced tomatoes are harder to come by.
A cheesecake without sugar would be horrible. Have her try tomato sauce that's too acidic and ask her if it needs anything. When she can't figure it out, sprinkle some sugar on and have her taste it. 
My wife struggles with this. Anything that calls for sugar, and I mean ANYTHING, she'll replace the sugar with either applesauce or honey.About half the time it works. The other half the time her tomato sauces have a weird texture because a scoop of applesauce is not a replacement for a pinch of sugar.
They both can, but he most likely meant cider vinegar. 
Don't cook with oil while bacon.
Taco seasoning. Some of the best homemade tacos I've had were with ground turkey cooked with taco seasoning.
My friend had a Jaime Oliver cookbook I borrowed once and it had a recipe for salt crusted fish that I wanted to try, because apparently you don't actually eat the salt (it was a while fish, the salt was on the skin) but my mom said no since she's very anti-salt.
Have you ever roast garlic, in the skins? Probably my favourite part of a roast meal... 
A falling gun is all triggers!
So I shouldn't clean my gun with butter?
The cat would not have done the same.
No she's just seven foot five 
This happened with my step mom because she cut herself really badly while cutting potatoes. She doesn't practice safe cutting habits.
Freshman year in college my roommates brought home a restaurant grade mandolin. I knew one of them would get hurt so I put it above the cabinets. I was the only one who could reach it ha
I have two chef's knives, actually. One for me and one for anyone else in my kitchen.
I only use my Hatori Hanzo, but to each his own...
That guy strolls down my street now and then, calling for people to bring out their knives and scissors.   I live in a traditional meets modern area. It's not rare to see a road rage incident where a Mercedes and donkey cart full of cabbages are both trying to pass each other on a one-way street.
Grandmama is in them. You weren't told about the curse? 
Ohhhhh!!  You just explained so much to me!!   I never understood why my roommates did that, didn't realize it was born of anxiety about leaving food unattended
I prefer Frosted Flakes.
Just pick up white ceramic bowls when you see them going cheap. I have four large, deep soup bowls, four smaller deep soup bowls that are useful to make sure I don't eat half a packet of cereal for breakfast, four shallow small bowls about the size of a saucer and maybe half a dozen tiny bowls that hold half a cup and are useful for dipping sauces, parmesan etc. It's more than enough to cook with, and all of them cost like a dollar or two. Plain white crockery is  always crazy cheap.
I met her at a dinner party in the mid90s.Very nice woman.She helped herself to a full, unashamed grab of every guys ass as she took a picture with them.Literally a handful, not just placing it there.She also told a story about smuggling meat from overseas claiming it has been smoked when it hadn't.Julia Child gave 0 fucks.
When I was broke, my go-to meal was pasta coated in buttery garlic and steamed broccoli. I never got tired of that meal. 
Oh my god this is my mother. This drives me mad, and she does it constantly. 
I'd hazard a guess that this hypothetical person probably can't make a fully followed recipe taste better than mediocre anyways..
At least dinner was on time.
And never, ever be able to replicate it!
Depends where the tube goes
Yeah, I do the accuser grip with my knives.  It's really not as unsafe as you might think.  'But what if any part of the knife of your hand slips?'  Well....it won't.  In my....ten plus years of cooking I've cut myself maybe ten times on knives.Most of the injuries I've gotten have been from something that you wouldn't expect.  Like the jagged metal part from foil boxes....
Yeah! What is it, anyway? I've tried googling it, but I can't find any chemical explanation. It tastes glorious.
Oh man this made me grimace in pain for you.
Ceramic pans are great until someone does this.  Still don't know if my mom or boyfriend fucked the pan up. 
Sometimes, but not exclusively. Another reason is that the outside of cakes in tins will cook much faster - that is, they'll rise, but set before rising as much (the middle cooks slower, so is able to keep rising longer). To help this issue, you can cook in a bain-marie (water bath) which provides better balance over the temperature, or I have these oven-safe straps that I soak and then wrap around the tin, which provides _some_ balance.
A true iron chef.
You said you wanted the flavors to be more alive. 
Good idea. Another thing would be to just make the cheesecake without sugar like the mother wants and have her taste it. Then make another with sugar and have her taste THAT!
Yup, so much healthier too. 
His bloodline has been pure for thousands of years.
If it's all triggers then there's no bullets.  Catch away. 
And does all her kitchen cutting overhead
Well, the last time I handled a sharp knife I made a nasty gash in my thumb on the first try... happened at work (yeah, it wasn't the first time) so I've now been banned from sharp objects. Happens all the time.
what the hell is a restaurant-grade mandolin, and who the hell needs restaurant-grade when playing their mandolin, be it for themselves or an audience?
Haha. I have three, one smallish one I use all the time, one larger one in case there is watermelon, and a huge one whose name is getouttamykitchen.
Everybody knows Hatori Hanzo now. He's become a sort of celebrity sword-maker. Totally commercial - complete sell-out. I only use swords from Korehira Yoshimoto - you've probably never heard of him.
Where is this? I've never heard of a traveling knife sharpener, living in CA.
best horror movie ever - you throw out grandma's knives causing her to come back haunting you, trapping you in your apartment insisting she won't let you leave until you're fed because you look like you're wasting away.
Grandmama requires blood sacrifice, go stabby stab for grandmama.
I don't trust food not to go to complete shit if not watched. I know what's needed to make the food, but me and my stove have a faulty relationship. One wrong move and shits burned, or cooked on outside and raw inside, I may suck.
I would like to take this time to outsource to the community;Has anyone had the new Cinnamon Frosted Flakes? How are they? Thank you for taking one for the team.
"When you're famous, they let you do it. You can do anything you want to them" - Julia Child probably
If I cook while she isn't there, my food is perfect. If she's watching me cook, I use way too much salt, she doesn't like cumin, you won't be able to taste anything over that much garlic, and I'm just going to burn everything cooking it that high. When it's done it's missing something. 
Or drawing blood on the fucking clingwrap cutter.
From my friends who work in the industry, they say that the accuser grip isn't always recommended because it can lead to early carpal tunnel. Something about doing it every day rigorously for a few hour especially during prep can take a toll on the joints. 
It translates as "breath of the wok". It's a bunch of aromatic stuff produced in the seasoning process as oil is seared into the metal.
I bought a $60 frying pan. Real nice one that I loved. Room-mate boiled water in it and forgot about it. Came back out and the non stick coating was ruined and the pan never worked properly again. I was pissed.
This is when you go out and get an nice heavy cast iron skillet and beat them to death with it.
TIL
He's 30% iron. 
And now you're sobbing in the corner uncontrollably. 
You mean... make another with sugar and don't let her have any.  Let her wallow in her self-made sugar straight jacket while you are immersed in the wonderment of decadent cheesecake and all of its glory.
Taste THAT mother!     
She does the whole granny cutting style where she peels and cubes potatoes against her thumb and because she uses a dull/practically 400 year old knife to do it she'd never cut herself before.
Lmao whoops. Not even gonna edit that. I enjoyed it too much. 
Hehe, I have 6.022 x 10^23 in case I need to cut up some fresh Avagadros
I live in Toronto. Every 2nd week, in the summer, this guy drives slowly around the neighbourhood in his knife-sharpening truck, ringing a bell like he's the ice cream guy. Not only is he NOT the ice cream guy, he won't stop for anyone! You chase him down the street holding your knives and he won't stop to do his job. I think it's a mob front. 
My grandma always tries to feed me while I'm eating.She'll literally shove a plate between my face and the one I'm currently eating from. "Would you like some gingerbread?" Yeah, I probably would, but how'bout you let me finish the stew you just gave me first? You know what? Screw it, just put it next to the smoked fish.Grandmother's cooking... resistance is impolite.
Cinnamon frosted flakes are fantastic
> "When you're famous, they let you do it. You can do anything you want to them" - Julia Child probablyWell there goes any chance of her ever being President.
It's just locker room talk.
Mine just can't follow the fucking recipe to save her life. She doesn't get that different ingredients yield different results, particularly with baking which is more an exacting science than just cooking. It's completely maddening. She subs various oils in for what it says, she thinks wheat flour will do the same as all purpose, etc. NO. IT WONT. Then she gets mad because "that recipe is shit". No, ma, it's you.
Or the under side of the meat slicer. You know, the part that's the farthest away from the goddamn blade.
so like the same concept of why grandma's cornbread in the 30 yr-old never-soap-washed cast iron is way better than mine in the 8" round tin?
Be sure to use salt to clean the blood off.
Which comes with twice the prize money.
Commas are VERY important in this case
If it ain't broke... and old people... Oh and when my grandmothers electrical foot bath thingy broke and she wanted to return it, turns out it was 13 years old. She still had the receipt though
Or he just thinks you're trying to stab him
Can confirm, have frantically chased West end Toronto knife man with dull but large kitchen knife. Luckily I heard him coming up the street behind the house so was able to find money, grab the knjfe and make the sprint. I came out onto the street right behind him, so then I just chased him waving my knife like I was trying to land a plane. He noticed. $5. 
I want to be made at you because you didn't say they're G-R-R-R-R-EAT!But you gave me the answer I wanted so thank you.
"Hey babe. Coconut flour is just flavored flour, right?""No, sweetie. It really isn't. And now you owe me $30."
No you leave it on to season the pan.
That sword cost 5000 doru!!!!
Now that's some quality grandma story right there.
Tell that motherfucker to stop for people when he comes to East York!
FRY DID IT
My grandma's coffee maker broke once. It was at least 30 years old. She was upset. Went down to the basement and came back up with the SAME coffee maker. Turns out it had gone on sale once in the past and she knew she would need a new one some day so she bought it to be prepared for the day that happened. Still being upset, she fiddled around with the old one and got it working again.  Pretty sure she still has the "reserve" one in the basement.
Applied for a Guitar Tech job at guitar center. Went through three levels of interviews. Right during the last one, this fucking dude, goes through all my paperwork and is like "you got the job, we're gonna start you off in sales." And I was like "I didn't apply for sales, I've interviewed the last three weeks for the Guitar Tech position." An he just said, "I know." And had this shitty stupid smile on his dumb face. And that's when I realized, they probably don't care for their employees there. 
One place my wife interviewed asked her if she had any kids or planned on getting pregnant soon.Both questions are illegal to ask during an interview. 
If they dodge the question when you ask about hours. 
If to move forward in the hiring process you have to pay them for anything
I interviewed at a company years ago where the interviewer asked me if I ever thought it was okay to just drop a former employer in favor of working for him the next day.  I said no because I do believe in the courtesy of a notice and not burning bridges whenever possible.  He got irritated with me and ended the interview.  I consider that a dodged bullet because any company that celebrates a lack of courtesy and professionalism is one that will extend that lack of respect to me.
In science:"We work hard"."Professor Y has high expectations"."I don't believe in vacation". - actually heard this one on an interview once. 
If they show you large commission numbers from a few years ago.  Hotels.com did this, but what they didn't say was the large checks were from a year ago and they changed their commission structure since then an those checks are no longer obtainable.
Hostile interviewers.  I had an interview years ago, where they had a good cop, bad cop routine going.  The good cop asked me about my hobbies, and seemed interested.  The bad cop, scuffed and rolled his eyes.
While waiting in the lobby for my interviewer to come out, a man flung the work area door open as he was screaming and literally sobbing about the place being worse than hell. It was like a red flag factory exploded in my face. 
Mine was going for a corporate job that required travel ~40% of the time, which to me didn't sound so bad.  I interviewed separately over a day with like 8 people on the team.  I'd say about 4-5 of them had negative things to say about the travel aspect.  So that was a red flag for me.
Sometimes you just get a vibe in a place that it is way too serious and I don't mean serious in a good way but instead that everyone is walking on eggshells type of serious.  I get skeptical of places where everyone constantly praises the boss/CEO/founder and constantly mentions how ultimately they make the decisions or things like that.  That just sounds like a place run by an iron fist.  
When the person interviewing you is the person whose job you'll be taking, and they're quitting because the job sucks.This comment is oddly specific, but I'm currently interviewing candidates to take over my job. It's a real ethical dilemma, encouraging someone to take the job I'm leaving due to dissatisfaction, but I tell myself that they may enjoy it better than I have.
Posted this before but my roommate once was asked to do a trial run as a waitress since she had no experience. Sure that's cool. It was for Valentine's Day lunch, surely she will be shadowing and letting drinks and what not. Nope. They put her out there solo for a 5 hour shift THEN ASKED HER TO COME BACK THAT NIGHT TO WORK A DOUBLE. She never got paid for it and never returned. 
One that I've experienced- they asked me to start immediately."When can you start"?"Tomorrow!""How about right now, we're way behind."  *Thanks for joining the crew of the Titanic!  Watch your step, she's listing about twenty degrees to starboard, but a finer luxury liner has never sailed the seas.*
When they ask how much I'd like to get paid, I say $11 an hour, they chuckle and counter with minimum wage. Why'd you bother asking in the first place, Sam's Club?
If the interviewer seems stressed or rushed, that's your first sign. 
I had an interview where the guy said "we - we work hard here. I'd like to say we play hard, too, but.. we work hard here".Then, later on when I asked about what happened to the predecessor "he left. Unfortunately, he took on a little too much, became unhappy and left. He's taking some time off before he decides whether he wants to stay in IT or not."So you overworked a guy to the point where he decided he needed a new career?
When they ask you what your five year plan (or similar) is, then mock  you for having goals that they think are too ambitious. I once told an interviewer that I'm interested in being a professor and he responded with "You? A professor? Ha!".I did not take the job.
They mention that you can use the position to get your foot in the door at the company and after that if you don't like it you can use some internal application and hiring process to switch to a different position. The initial job is going to suck and switching to a different position is going to be much, much harder and more time consuming than they let on. There will be no availability in the area you'd really like to work in, despite constantly hiring new people from the outside.
They wanted me to explain my tardiness stats from high school.I'm in my thirties.
I once interviewed for a company that said they'll be holding onto my passport and my university degrees as long as I work there. While I had heard of such instances, I also knew it's against the law.
If they say, "It's like a family here", they mean "the drama is unbelievable and yes, it gets very personal".
"We work hard and play hard" means "we expect you to work unreasonable hours and becoming a functional alcoholic is really the only way to cope with it"
If they say that over time is expected. That just means they are under staffed and you will be putting a lot many hours you are not getting paid for.
Baker here, on my first day I was given a potted tree, I was told to plant it, if I was still baking when it got big enough to hang myself off, I should, because this is not the job you want for the rest of your life. 
"You'll be required to work overtime when appropriate"OK, that's fine. So is it a week on, week off system?"No. You'll need to work overtime when we need you"Right, but you'll give me notice in advance.?"No. If we need you to work overtime you have to stay"I told them there and then to keep their job. I'm desperate but not that desperate.
When the mournful eyed Filipina janitor bumps into you as you walk towards the restroom, slipping into your pocket a hastily scrawled note that says "you leave, is no good for you here".  
When the interviewer's eyes have the cold, lifeless look of someone who's slowly dying on the inside. You look into their eyes and see that all their hope and ambition is lost.  They've come to accept their meaningless existence and know they will die a lonely death, looking back on a life full of regret. If your interviewer gives you a vibe like that, don't take the job. 
This is a GREAT question and I'd just like to say that so many interviewers forget that interviews are a two-way street. Sure, I need a job, but they also need a good worker, which I am. I'm also old enough to recognize a bad fit.
Group interviews. Seriously what a dumb idea. I think Walmart and a few others do this
In all seriousness, check the bathroom for one-ply toilet paper. If they don't care about your ass, they don't care about your ass.I've worked several places when I was younger and all the bad places fit this rule. 
"Must be a self-starter" = We won't train you."Fast-paced environment" = We will overwork you."Must be able to multitask" = We fired three people and want you to do all their jobs.
They mention their employees must wear "many hats". 
They had a bed...Like. In the middle of their cube-farm, they owned, and encouraged employees to use, a bed.Someone was sleeping in the bed as I was getting my tour of the space.
I had an interviewer that was interested in hiring me and when I asked if we could go around the office and meet his team, he didn't want to.  Huge red flag, didn't take the job.
Not subtle at all - I went for an interview for a job that I was already doing with 5 years experience, with excellent reviews and even a recommendation from my current employer. It was a panel interview and as soon as I walked in one of the interviewers walked out to the parking lot. He comes back and goes "how do you plan to work this job with two kids still in car seats?" I told him he was asking an illegal question and was being straight up sexist and inappropriate. I knew right then that I wasn't taking the job. 
When they ask you to stand up and do a slow turn for them, then tell you you're only allowed to wear short shorts.  (Was not for a strip club).
If you can you assess the coffee situation while moving through the office for interview.. Powdered creamer? Run. Liquid creamer in numerous flavors? Work there till death or retirement.
If the interviewer(s) aren't personable.  If they aren't smiling or talking to me on standard conversational level, it's probably a crappy place to work.  
When they interviewers are too informal. I generally try to be professional until I see them get a little less formal. This one interview the two people kept texting each other on their apple watches and giggling. Then after every response would turn my answer into a weakness.  I wasn't offered the job but I wouldn't have taken it abyway
People are way too excited about working there and are totally high on the company Kool Aid. Working there is the best thing EVER according to everyone you talk to. There's nothing they love more than slaving away for company XYZ.They're either full of shit and lying to you and cannot be trusted about anything -OR- they're truly high on the Kool Aid and you're going to be expected to similarly partake if you ever want to fit in.
Do it. 
Out of curiosity, how would you suggest to bring this up? I am at a job I love with a great work life balance, but I still think they would have counted against me if I asked about hours that early on.
Was this Cutco...?
This needs to be higher. I mean, a lot of these red flags are good, but this is a pretty much guaranteed sign right here.
>"I don't believe in vacation"Funny, I do.
Yep. When I was in grad school I got a TA spot. During my meeting with my first professor he mentioned "The world of academia requires certain sacrifices" and I knew immediately he expected me to do the sacrificing for him.
> "I don't believe in vacation"What the fuck is this supposed to mean? Are vacations some kind of religion in the US?
Ugh. That's a shite interviewer. If she's more about her vacation than her job, then claims to not remember you, that's a red flag.
Had a similar experience with a company who got people in the door touting bonuses "up to" a certain percent. What they didn't mention was that that was at one time in the company's history and the numbers were always far lower than what they told their workers during the interview. When it came time for bonuses they would say something like "we didn't hit our aggressive profit projections, sooo... no bonuses!". Meanwhile their workers were putting in 60+ hour weeks and management always seemed to be talking about which of their yachts was their *favorite*
I'm working a job I hate but pays well. When we do the group interview bullshit we do the reverse stepbrothers. The company recently fucked me out of 10k. I tell ever prospective employee.
Had a similar experience. Was waiting in the lobby to interview at Lockheed. 2 employees walk past escorting someone to the door they had just interviewed. Everyone is talking pleasantly, they hold open the door for the girl who just interviewed, she leaves. As soon as the door closes they burst out laughing and start making fun of her. In the lobby, in front of other people waiting.
How has nobody yet replied demanding more info?
I just quit my latest job a few weeks ago and one of the things the girl training me said was, "if, no actually when (manager) pulls you up on something, don't say anything just agree even if he's got it wrong."Lasted 7 months in the place and I honestly don't know how I got that far. The manager was an absolute cunt and everybody was terrified of getting on his wrong side.
Paul Allen? I thought he worked at Pierce and Pierce. 
> soulless, joyless group of peopleVulcans are quite non-emotional.
I had an interview with a company that offered 'software solutions'. Yes thats vague. For a half hour this guy asks me maybe 1 question and just rambles on about acronym after acronym. Software products i had never heard of before and that he clearly did not understand past memorizing their acronym. He then says i would eventually replace him. "Is that something you want to do?". Yea, uh no thanks.
Worked for Sitel once.  I was there for six months.  I was being considered for a management position because so few people had even been there half that before quitting.
It was the office pet fish 
That's illegal!
When I was getting into bartending, I applied at a local place that refused to pay you until you had done unpaid "training", even though I had served before and attended mixology school. I walked after the second day, in which I mostly cleaned.Coincidentally, it burned down 6 months later. 
Yep, I got a job and they told me my start date and then they bumped it up... I was like no I need to work the other job I'm leaving for this one...Then when I finally left that shit hole. I said to the hr manager "hey, sorry about this, but I need to put in my two weeks notice." She goes "what's up with that?" Uh I got a new job. That's what's up 
Go to costco instead- they have great employee benefits and high starting salary
> "we - we work hard here. I'd like to say we play hard, tooI've learned that any job that uses any version of the whole "we work hard but we play hard" is actually saying "we're going to work you like a dog 'round the clock, but twice a year we'll bring in a cake or something and think that makes up for it."
If I hear anything that sounds remotely like "work hard, play hard" I'm out.  I work hard,  but when employers say that,  I've learned it means they have zero respect for work life balance. 
They asked me about my hobbies, and I said develop apps and mobile games in my free time. Both of them laughed and one said "free time? Well, if we hire you you can say goodbye to that." And they didn't believe my previous employer was real because they'd never heard of it.  I got a rejection email that night at 9 PM. Couldn't have been happier.
In my current job, I was asked by a manager what I was interested in doing career-development-wise.I lied (because I don't plan on sticking around) and just named the next job title up (which I thought was a modest answer). He scoffed and said I was only a level 3.5 and the next title up was a 7.Yeah, I always dreamed of being a level 4 instead of a 3.5. Who could hope for more?
> pay you through PaypalI have a feeling they're not paying their payroll taxes. 
how did they get them?
>they'll be holding onto my passport and my university degreesI would probably ask them why they had such a dumb policy.
Companies calling themselves "families" makes me angry. It's an insult to the word.My last company loved to call its employees "the [company] family!" ...I ended up getting laid off via google hangout with no notice. My company email had been disabled before the conversation was even over, and people I talked to daily thought I was just on vacation for a week afterwards. I woke up with a job and discovered I no longer had one just before lunch. Some fucking family.
I hated this shit when I was younger applying for department store jobs anyone could run. The Interviewers acted like he place was the big top of something. The worst was RadioShack. Had to drive 1 1/2 hours for an orientation thing. The district guy gave us a talk and was like, if you work hard, you can be just like *me*! No thanks.. you look miserable as shit.
They dropped that one on me during my last job interview and it turned out differently.In my case, "We work hard and play hard" is accurate *if* by "work hard" you mean *working at a very relaxed pace in a cushy office job* and by "play hard" what you mean is *sometimes we drink one beer together on Friday before everyone gets home to their families*.Don't get me wrong I have no complaints with my work environment, but at this stage this expression is just a cliche that could mean anything and its opposite.
Spot on! Going to guess you've worked in investment banking...
I would have taken the job.  Sounds like there* would have been upward movement since people don't hang around.
Holy fucking shit.
I had a similar experience to this. Showed a company how to fix their mess and then I closed out the file without saving it. The laser beam looks told me I was just there to show them how to fix their issue and not for an actual job. 
I had a hostile interview with Bank of America during internship time during college. They asked really mean questions to everyone (we all talked afterwards) like "I see that you have accomplished this. Why do you think this is good enough for BoA?"Almost no one went on to take the internship even though they offered a position to plenty.
>Been through man job interviewsHELLO YES I AM MAN AND WANT JOB AT BUSINESS FACTORY. 
Yeah fuck that. I'll work overtime when needed, but I have a life. I have commitments. 
Even better one is "if we call you in at any time, you are required to come or be written up/fired". They usually won't come out and tell you this, so asking around is the only way to see it coming.Bitch, am I getting call pay? No? Then I am not on call.
> ask me how to clear a printer queue...Trick question
For number 4, why are agencies bad? Ignorant college kid here
> I also personally call every employee I don't hire, explain why they weren't the perfect fit, and try to give them some positive encouragement going forward. I wish there were more employers like you. Usually the best you get is an email that can be boiled down to "sorry but no lol". Which takes 1-2 weeks to come most of the time.An employer that shows enough respect to actually *call* and explain why I wouldn't be a good fit would actually make me want to apply again in the future if the opportunity presents itself.
Did this actually happen??
This. A lot of people go into interviews like beggars. They're not giving you a handout, you're doing them a favor. They will get way more money out of you than they give you in return. That's how they afford to pay you.
non native here. could you explain what a commissioned insurance sale job is and why you did decline it? Thanks!
I was between jobs once and did a group interview to be a substitute teacher for a school district.  The group interview lasted 4+ hours and involved weird team-building exercises.  On top of that, they didn't respond to any of the candidates for the better part of a year.  In my case they were stunned that I was no longer available...
I prefer half-ply myself
"Looking for highly-motivated people" = We expect you to do a lot of unpaid overtime.
You forgot "must be able to work late"- We don't believe in 8 hour work days. 
'Lots of room for growth/upward mobility' = we're offering you a shitty position that doesn't pay, but if you hang in there for a few years we can give you a very slightly less shitty position. See also 'a good learning experience'
What if you're applying to be a hat model?
It's okay if the company is Valve. 
My boss said this countless times during my interview, and still says it occasionally. I actually don't see it as a negative at all. We're a pretty small business so it's expected for everybody to do a lot of stuff. It gives my days variety and gives me experience in lots of different areas. Some of it sucks and I'd rather not do it, but some things are pretty cool and I wouldn't experience them if I worked at a bigger company and only wore one hat, so to speak.
Kinda related, I got contacted for an interview by a call center and when I came in they took me around, showed me the entire place. Offices, break rooms, like they were ready to hire me off my application alone. Got to the interview, it went well. Never heard from them again. I don't even know why they bothered with a 15 minute tour.
I actually received an offer, was told to call and schedule a time to come in the next day for paperwork (it was a late afternoon interview). Called and was told that she did not realize I had small children when she made the offer, and after talking it over with her spouse (who didn't work there), decided I wouldn't be able to work full time and manage my family. I was already working full time and had applied there just to see where it would go. Bullet dodged, but it still pisses me off. 
Wow. Someone really wanted to get sued!
I misread that first time and thought you left the kids in the car for a job interview. 
how did they turn your answer into a weakness? was like it:you: i believe teamwork is important to company success.them: sounds like you can't do anything yourself lol *texts*and yes they said lol outloud
I second this. It made me lol
"So, what are the hours like?"If they don't appreciate someone who's actively trying to learn and ask questions about the job, chances are it's not somewhere you want to work.
I concur. Some might think - well, it's only a little bit of money and I'm willing to make a small investment. However, if the company does this it means they are absolutely not willing to invest anything in you. In other words, you are completely expendable and replaceable; if you go, they don't care.
I would have stolen a cup of pens.
>  management always seemed to be talking about which of their yachts was their favoriteI always remember reading a story about a  company that was really, really struggling. Everyone was overworked, no one was getting a pay rise but people were pulling together as a team to get through it.Then the owner bought a new Porsche and it destroyed morale. 
Right! WHAT WAS THE JOB PLEASE TELL ME
I did that for about a year. I liked a lot of the stuff you mention, but there's really a limit on how long you can live that way before you start to go nuts. I had colleagues who had been in that kind of position for years and they were all divorced weirdos with drinking problems.
Depends on where you're traveling. A major metro every weekend, with some stints in Bali? Sure.Kankakee, Illinois every week for two years? Less than great.
im terrified that my workers do that to me, like are they agreeing because they think its a good idea or because they might be scared of something?
Didn't he handle the Fisher account? 
Do you like Huey Lewis and the News? 
the tasteful thickness of it...
Logical.  Their emotions are quite strong and are to be kept under control.  Such is the teachings of Surak.
I worked for a tech company that tried to fine people $100,000 if you worked for an competitor in the next ten years. Sure I'll sign, if you promise to pay me those 10 years I'm sitting around doing nothing.
I interface with Sitel senior management on a near-daily basis, and I absolutely believe that. We're one of their largest contracts, and its like pulling teeth to complete any major project deployments because we have to get an entirely new management team up to speed every few months. Least they're cheap? 
Dead for 11 months
Yeah we know.  But it honestly wasn't worth a big legal battle for her, who didn't have enough money or energy to even begin with that for probably $20. 
That job for me likely would have lasted until my lunch break.
Good luck getting in without knowing someone.
To be fair, maybe he stares at everyone's breasts, male or female.The key is to stare at his junk, as a sign of dominance.
What kind of levels are these?
To be fair I'm a freelance contractor so I've been paid through Paypal before by other companies,  but other companies had me send them tax forms and sign contracts first.. 
P E R M A N E N T R E C O R D
"We're like a family" - Quiting for greener pastures is an unconscionable betrayal but it's totally okay if we fire or lay you off as an unnecessary  cost cutting measure. 
"Well I do a lot of drugs, have a lot of sex, and can barely play an instrument.  When do I start?"
They won't let him leave until he finds a replacement.
"We work hard and we play hard" = anything from "we work way too hard but pretend there's play if it helps you feel better" to "we work sometimes but mostly fuck around" to "we do an easy, sensible amount of both working and playing but saying that makes me feel like a cool guy."
Most staff move on but the manager is at 12 years and no intent of leaving for another 3. You see he tried, but being a big guy the trunk snapped. It was a funny day.  
Kinda wondering how big OP's potted tree is now. 
I would have loved to be a fly on the wall when you did that
Man, I want this to be real soooo bad.
I worked for a subsidiary of BoA, in tech, they had some of the most draconian bullshit standards ive ever experienced. Thought all banking was like that. I work for a much smaller entity now, and it's roughly 8 billion times better. Give or take several illions.
YOU ARE OVER QUALIFIED. FIRST DAY STARTS NOW .
I have a buddy who hired in at a place that was supposed to be four 12 hour shifts - 48 hours a week, right?He figured since there's OT in the schedule, there may be some more, but that a four day week is nice. He's got kids.Dude's working 14-16 hours a day six days a week now. And they're trying to get him to take this salaried coordinator position (he's doing it currently because somebody left). But the salary they're offering is less than he made hourly last year
This is what they wanted. It might be the weekend or your day off but you'd be expected to come in.$45,000 for a specialist technical job was shit pay for a standard 37h week. There's no chance I'm going on 24/7 call out.
Man Ive found many employers now days dont even bother to tell if you are hired or not. They only contact you if you are hired but otherwise, its ghosting.
Yeah! When I was interviewing for a job at Netflix.
I had a similar group interview for a retail position. I was turned down for the job but when I happened to go into the store a few weeks later, I saw that they'd hired the people who had just done as they were told and hadn't contributed anything to the group tasks
Back when I applied for Pornhub nearly a decade ago, they said they were looking for 'highly-motivated people'.  They were just looking actresses who would fuck with enthusiasm.
"Opportunity for overtime" = you will need to work 9 hour days and skip your lunch to manage the workload. also, how do you feel about coming in for a few hours on Saturday?
Incredibly illegal.
That's so dumb. Like I like sleep and would love to sleep all day at home but that doesn't mean don't need a job and I'm not a hard worker when I'm at work 
More than that, it's usually a sign that the company is a scam.
Yep, that's been my experience too. Seems like 80% of success is showing up.
worked for a company, two weeks before Christmas: Owner of the company: "we need everybody to buckle down; if everybody works hard we can still meet our numbers for the end of the year, we've just got to finish these last projects etc etc...I'll be calling in daily from vacation in Australia, but just because I won't be here doesn't mean you can slack off"
From what I understand that is the case, yes. 
That was also in the contract, a ban on working for clients or competitors for 2 years. And if you give your three months notice, they will start withholding your paycheck. Glad I checked glassdoor on that one. 
For us non-Americans, what is Sitel and what makes it so bad? 
Dr. Fishy!!! NOOOOOOOO!!!
My last job was like that too. My position had super quick turnover, but everyone else had been there for at least a decade. It didn't take long to find out why. Within the first month, I found myself having to argue my way out of getting written up for something that happened during my day off because no one who was there that day would own up to it. 
It isn't a big legal battle. One phone call to the Department of Labor (or state equivalent) and your lost wages will generally magically appear. They will handle it.The restaurant industry takes serious advantage of their workers and counts on them not knowing the rules or standing up for themselves.
I didn't realize it was like that, though I wouldn't be all that surprised since it is such a good gig 
True advice here, you have to commit to the stare.Now, I know what youre thinking, "but /u/yakkahboo, his junk is below the table"Get under there and stare, dammit.
Meow meow beanz
never take a job without a contract, you're in for a rough time here, probably
We just tell people that we expect that work will get done but have a relaxed atmosphere. Some people don't want to play hard and certainly not at work. I go to work to get paid and get things done but the fact that I can shoot the shit with my co-workers for 20 minutes after standup and have it not be a huge deal keeps me relaxed and coming to work with a positive attitude. Sometimes we  go out to eat or drink too, but that's just good team building.
So that's why only the fat bakers remain. Natural selection at work here.
Hey she didn't want you to think she was lying, so she knew someone had to prove the point
YOU ARE LATE. YOU ARE FIRED. HERE IS YOUR SEVERANCE PACKAGE.
I LIKE TO DO BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS.
Which is exactly why they want him salaried. There was a forman on the last construction job I was on. He wound up working between 80-90 hours a week. Salary. I would have quit. 
Yup, that's why I said "the best you get". Most of the time they don't give a damn.
From evertyhing I've heard Netflix is an awful place to work.It's insanely competitive & you are basically always on the copping block. They burn employees out quick.
Also commission means you're reliant on the quality of their product and the leads they give you.
they want workers not thinkers.
Shit, wish I had known "opportunity for overtime" means you will be shamed by all your coworkers if you don't do "your share" by working 10-11 hour days. At least my company gives double time for extra shifts. 
My whole life has been working for non-profits except for a brief stint at an ad agency. Talk about your bad fits. LOL - 20-something young women walking around in designer clothing charged on credit cards talking about life as though it was Sex and The City (this was a while ago). Meanwhile, none of them have their own medical insurance so they don't know how crappy the plan actually is, they don't get paid enough to afford their own apartments (they live with their ex-sorority sisters) and their work is their life. I had to fire one of them and I felt like I was setting her free.
It is. People act like they can make instant, factual judgements on other people based on little things way too much. Especially with vague and open-ended questions. 
Usually. I just started working for a coffee chain, which will remain unnamed but American runs on them, that gave me one free uniform shirt and wants me to buy the rest. It's definitely legit but still a pain
If you show up early you'll be 98% to the top
Lucky bastard.
Withholding your paycheck? As in, your last 3 months aren't paid? The labor board must love that one.
It's a call center chain.  The one I worked in handled inbound customer retention calls for a large internet provider.
I overfed these men?!!
Obviously it was your fault because you weren't there to stop them from doing it wrong.
Every reddit post I see "oh it was years ago" "oh it wasn't worth the trouble" "oh it was just XX $" makes me sad since getting taken advantage of is so prevalent in society.
I worked at Costco as a summer job 8 years ago. The same people still work there today and they barely have openings outside of seasonal work.
See, my red flag was his junk was on the table.
We one time were getting a good bonus.  They made a big deal and made dinner for everyone.  Grilled steaks.  They later revised the bonus amount,  to  less than half.  Pretty sure I just paid over $100 for a shitty burnt steak. 
THERE ARE NOW 7 MEOW MEOW BEANZ?
St. Lawrence of Rome is the patron saint of cooks, chefs and comedians because when he was being burnt alive over a huge gridiron, he cheerfully proclaimed 'turn me over, I'm well done on this side!'
Wow such integrity!
Employers always complain about the high cost of turnover they just never think they are the cause of it. 
SEVERANCE PACKAGE IS POTATO
I did an interview with Amazon for their AWS IT department. Similar culture. The interview was 6 rounds and the last in-person interview was 8 hours long. More than one of my professors and colleagues warned me not to take the job because everyone they knew who worked there was miserable. Everyone I talked to in the interview process worked there less than 2 years. It paid a lot but I did not end up working there.
I'm a mechanic and worked for a Honda dealership that tried that.  I've been provided uniforms by every shop I've ever worked for so I wasn't about to start paying for them.They ended up changing their minds when they got tired of me wearing everything I deemed suitable for getting dirty at work.
There was a guy that showed up 30 min early for every damn shift.  Wasn't the fastest, smartest, or best worker, but he had a job for life.  Just having him as an example of what was possible in the building was worth having him around.  
awww theyre all tuckered out
You may be joking, but this has actually happened to me on several occasions.
Costco is like the holy grail of retail jobs.  Seriously.  I tried multiple times to get my foot in the door there back when I was trying to make a living in retail.
But his hips were still under the table, making that a **big red flag**.
Are you sure he didn't just say, " AH holy shit! This fucking hurts
"We paid people with degrees and 10+ years experience slightly above minimum wage, demanded they work unreasonable hours, tried to make them question their value, and they all left. Today's workers are so entitled!"
Amazon has a very high turn over. I know a few people who went there and only intended to work the 2 years, get their stock signing bonus, cash out to pay their loans off & find a place to actually be happy.The signing bonus in stock is paid out weirdly. You get 10% after 6 mo. 15 % after 12, 25 % after 18 & the remaining 50% after 24.
I've never looked it up, but I'm pretty sure they just can't make you buy anything only available through the company or only useful in your position. Buying the rest of the uniform usually consists of wearing black below the waist. It's not the same level of job, but it should be similar legal status to requiring people to show up in a shirt and tie.
Man, I'm a pretty mediocre worker. But I am ridiculously reliable and ALWAYS come in if i'm called in from somebody elses callout. Got 49 hours this week part time. I just show up, and show up when somebody else can't. People talk me up like i'm good or something but I just show up. 
Yeah, even as I was posting that, I was thinking that it probably did happen to someone for real. :/
The running gag I was told was that everyone works for Amazon for 2 years before moving onto Google.
For a lot of jobs in the service industry (retail, fast food, etc) just showing up consistently puts you above most of their potential employees.
Born there. Family lives there. Friends live there. Lack the economic means to move elsewhere.
Because we don't have to fight mutant insects here. And generally the COL is cheaper.
Because I only have to read about "Florida Man", and not expirence it live.
I can think of a couple:(MUCH) fewer bugs (exception: mosquitoes)Four seasons
Because Zombies are slower in 4 feet of snow... That, and snowmobiles.
No tornadoes, large earthquakes, devastating hurricanes, poisonous reptiles, alligators, crocodiles, bear attacks, oppressive heat. it's a good trade off for having to wear a scarf occasionally.
Because it reminds me that I'm alive. Being hot just makes me suicidal. 
When you're uncomfortably cold, you can always throw on an extra layer to get warm.When you're uncomfortably hot, there are only so many layers you can remove before you're still uncomfortably hot.And heat makes me much more prone to irritability, depression, and lethargy.  That's why I moved out of Houston and into Pennsylvania.
Easy answer. Less people.
Because I got laid off the same STUPID year that I met the most amazing woman who lives in STUPID Fairbanks, in STUPID Alaska.  When we were living apart we were trying to figure out who would quit their job that they loved and move to the other person's city and my STUPID employer decided to go out of STUPID business.  I moved in with the love of my STUPID life in STUPIDVILLE and the air HURTS MY STUPID FACE.STUPID.
The cold keeps the riff raff out.  I've lived in Wisconsin and Florida, and it's amazing how different the people are.  A lot of Florida residents aren't from florida, they're transplants, so you just don't get the same "down home" feeling that you do with the people in Wisconsin.  Most people in Wisconsin were born and raised here, and it feels like they are just a lot more wholesome (don't hate me florida!)
Vermonter here. 1) How would I know my state cares if it didn't try to kill me with weather? 2) I run naturally hot and dealing with cold is much easier than heat. 3) I live near a college town so I enjoy the effect cold weather has on newly arrived warm place people. 
Because, after global warming your cities will be under water and the air won't hurt my face anymore
The air doesn't really hurt my entire face, just my nose. I don't really know what factory produces the smell, but every morning I'm blasted with the smell of offal. If you've ever butchered an animal, like deer, you'd know what smell I'm talking about.
Because heat is fucking miserable. 
I don't like heat thats more than 25 celcius. its uncomfortable, sweaty, itchy, it makes doing exercise less desirable, it makes going shopping more uncomfortable. it's just pretty shit.
Humidity is just awful.   The air is heavy, you drip sweat, it's terrible being outdoors.   Can't do it.  
Fewer bugs/pests and things that can kill me.  Here in Minnesota we also have great schools and access to healthcare.You just gotta have some good indoor hobbies and winter isn't so bad.
Because I don't like the idea of air conditioning having to be a necessity.
Born n raised in Los Angeles, met "a boy from queens" three weeks before he was moving back to New York. Fell crazy in love and moved a couple months later. Been here seven winters. Have an insanely awesome job (low stress, good pay and benefits). Started a family. His parents are nearby and help out a lot with raising our two little boys. So I'm used to weather that hurts the face now. Having seasons makes you appreciate the good weather days. The same weather every day got monotonous growing up. 
Human rights & freedoms with the convenience of speaking my native language and no spiders 
Because I'm too tough to care.
Free healthcare, lots of space, and usually nice people.**Edit**: Fine, taxpayer-funded healthcare. Still, it's nice knowing that if I break my arm I won't have to sell my body to the night to pay for it.
Because I don't have to worry about alligators killing my children or southerners controlling my politics.
Northern Alberta checking in. Worked a 12 hour day outside in -42 last month. Dirty oil money was had by all. Also it's less peopley and once you spend a small fortune on winter clothes it's right between bearable and kill yourself. Here for the money and the family lives here. Fun fact: on the average cold day I wear no less that 3 shirts, 2 sweaters, coveralls, a parka, 2 balaclavas, mitts, long johns, sweats, and snowpants. Probably like 20lbs of clothes. 
Wisconsin?
Canadian here . Can agree. Except that random first nice day between spring and summer is usually like a tuesday work day . And youre pissed off all fucking day because you wish u were outside
>the COL is cheaper.Sigh, not in Boston. The worst of both worlds!
I live in South Florida.  Every day I leave my house, two contradictory thoughts go into my head:  "wow the weather is amazing, so happy to be here."  *2 minutes later*  "wow the people here are a mix of stupid, trashy and insane, wish I could live somewhere else."Never fails
From someone else's perspective, yeah it's kinda funny. Think of it like this, you'd have never visited Minot if it wasn't for the air force and you'd have missed so much
I was born in North Dakota, molded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a man, by then nonresident tuition was too damn expensive. So, here I am
If it's any consolation the Air Force sent a northerner to Florida and this place hurts my face. I'm too pale for the hot damnin sun! 
Why not Minot?
This person gets it.  When I first moved from Texas to Michigan, I was miserable in the cold.  Then someone just told me to quit complaining and embrace it, and that's what I did.  I gave up (winter) running and took up xc skiing and never looked back.  Winter is now my favorite season and I can't imagine living anywhere that doesn't get snow.  There really is something beautiful about the snow.  Everything is much more quiet, the nights are brighter, and the world is so much more peaceful and manageable when you're in the middle of the woods and it's snowing and there's not a soul in sight.
> Four seasonsJust not of equal length.
Hey we have four seasons in the south as well:Bugs,Air made of hot soup,Air made of soup that was left out,Cold-ish sometimes but not reallyEdited to add commas, since making it look like a list on my phone apparently makes it something else on desktop. 
I live in the Pacific Northwest and we have few bugs and the air doesn't hurt my face. We also have four seasons.
I would never want to live somewhere without four distinct seasons, the change of seasons makes me horny. 
> (MUCH) fewer bugs (exception: mosquitoes)I feel like your exception pretty much defeats your point. Is there any species of bug more obnoxious than mosquitoes? I'd take swarms of cicadas over swarms of mosquitoes any day.
And hockey.  And skiing.  Winter sports are pretty damn fun.  
Zombies are slower in snowmobiles?
Where are you?
I like how the top two comments are talking about opposite climates temperature wise. 
I agree! Heat definitely makes me very lethargic. I have no energy to do anything when its 115F (46C) out. Plus I get heat rash and sunburned very easily... I just think I was never meant to live in a desert. 
See, I have never found a temperature that makes me uncomfortably hot - live near DC, summer can be up to 105 and HUMID.  Fine.  We goto Florida in July, just fine.  St. John (USVI) in June also fine.  Cancun in June or July, fine.  Less than 60 degrees, NOT FINE.
This. There is nothing like the feeling you get in the spring when everything comes back to life. The green seems so much brighter than I remember from the spring before, the sun feels warmer, the birds seem to sing prettier. As much as I don't like winter, I'd miss spring and fall ten times more if I didn't live in a place that experienced all the seasons.
Poisonous: You eat it, you get sickVenomous: It bites you, you get sick
Fewer
Ditto. The love of my life invited me. What was I supposed to do?
Similar. Boyfriend and I worked at the same part time get-me-through-college job in hot, humid Florida. I got a promotion, then he had to quit when we got married because I couldn't be his supervisor any more. He starts putting all his effort into finding a job in his actual career field. Finds a great opportunity - joins the military. First place they sent us both was in glorious Monterey, CA. Should have known it was too good to last. One year later, we were banished to 3 years in Fairbanks.Last week it went to -49F. The air hurts my face.
Obviously didn't watch The Day After Tomorrow.
Global Warming will make the Gulf stream break down and stop transporting warm water to colder climates, making the air hurt your face even more.
He braced his face against the breeze,  And braved the stormy swirl -  A frigid flurry froze the trees,  And turned the leaves to pearl.He stumbled twice, and floundered thrice;  He paced ahead in pain -  And every breath he took was ice,  And every step was strain.And when, at last, he passed a friend,  With toes and fingers numb -  He grimly grinned to reach the end,  And said: *'our time will come.'*
Ditto. I also don't think my husband could handle being that far away from his family. They're a pretty close-knit family. I can't blame him, they're pretty kickass. It's nice having good in-laws.Now if we ever get stupid rich, we'll just pay to move everyone to Hawaii. That seems like a good plan.
It makes people assholes as well. The cold tends to make folks pretty friendly.
I feel like there's definitely middle ground.
idk,NY is getting pretty bland, weather-wise.We haven't had any really good snowstorms this year.
Canada?
Moving costs weren't much for me but I live in a way I can pack my car up tomorrow and leave. But yes the social impact is tough, I move almost every year. Until things settle down in my career I choose to focus on myself and it has really helped me get to know who I am. Don't be afraid to take the plunge!
No, Wisconsin is "never sober enough to drive away"
Hey, it's me your neighbor; where do we live again?
House or van?
This makes sense of why Bostonians are so angry.
Still beats North Florida
Hey, if it's gonna be my first time experiencing a real winter, I may as well go for the coldest state in the lower 48 I guess.
"I was born in the cold, molded by it. I didn't see above freezing temps until I was a man and by then they were nothing more than scalding"
The air force sent me from Missouri to California then Iraq. Like some kind of cruel joke. Then Turkey because I loved the middle East so much apparently. Then back to Iraq because I didn't get enough last time. Then Afghanistan. That place gets cold in the winter though. 
Fun fact it's eerily quiet because the snow absorbs a lot more sound 
My favorite Michigan quirk is that everyone always heads "Up North" for recreation. If you live in the Southern Lower you head to the Northern Lower. If you live in the Northern Lower you head to the UP, and if you live in the UP you go to Canada. Aside from trips out of state, no one vacations to a lower latitude in-state. Its just not proper.I love my Mitten.
Good thing we have plenty of snow in Michigan *looks outside to it raining in January just north of Detroit*
You don't need a snowblower. Snow shovels work just fine
We have those in SE Texas!Sleet Season, Spring, Hell, and Monsoon. 
Length doesn't matter, it's how you use it.
Have you ever been in the forest in the height of summer here? So. Many. Bugs. They are mostly around bodies of water and I still fucking love it here, rain and all.
It also rains like a motherfucker there. I'll pass, thanks. I hate rain.
Upvoted for hockey
Or you could go with face-hurting air, tornadoes, venomous reptiles, and oppressive heat.Illinois: come get the worst part of every season.
Icelander here. We don't get tornadoes, and this winter has been so mild I can't even remember the last time my face hurt. It's disappointing, to be honest. We have a reputation to uphold, and we're failing. We're failing with comfy faces.
The northern states and most of Canada is like this, as long as you aren't on either coast.
I guess I didn't consider OP was talking about heat. Like sun burn? I've never had heat hurt my face other than the sun its self. 
Deserts are pretty inhospitable in general
That first spring night sitting out drinking a beer with friends on a porch is always amazing too.
Crime rates go down during the winter, because who wants to go do anything outside in a blizzard?
Not to mention a decent cost of living, tons of things to do (and we can afford to do them!), beautiful lakes, nice summers, theater, restaurants...and aren't we voted amongst best places to live, raise kids, etc? 
Kindly decline. 
If you really loved them, you'd let them go.
that temp is rare now.  it didnt use to be.
It's just like doing cocaine 
Haha this guy knows what's up. I was in the military there. I've eaten a lot of chili dogs from the guy outside the Marlin. Some good times! 
My brother can (and has) recite both parts of this conversation in flawless Hank and Dale accents. Every day it gets above 110 here, I know my brother is gonna recite that quote. 
Of course he hasn't. How can you watch something that hasn't happened yet. ^^^^^^We ^^^^^^didn't ^^^^^^listen
The Gulf Stream has an effect on Northern Europe. A lot of Nortern Europe faces submersion if the sea level rises. Also with the sea closer, the heights will be warmer anyway. 
Holy shit I got Sprogged
Hawaii checking in. Are you sure about this? We just had a major cold spell come in over the weekend. I had to close my windows at night.
Life isn't fun when you step outside and sweat from every pore on your body instantly.
Interesting to see how this is a personal preference thing and not universal. I moved to South Carolina a couple years ago from further north, and would MUCH prefer blistering heat to blistering cold.
I'm the total opposite, if I had to choose between 100 degree weather and 30 degree weather, I'd choose the heat every single time. I grew up in Texas so I'm just used to the heat and I love it. I can wear pants around when it's over 100 outside and not break a sweat.I'm currently studying abroad in Moscow, and I fucking hate the cold. Having to bundle up in clothes just to walk outside some days... I'm basically how you described when you were in SC. I avoid doing things just because I don't want to go out in the cold. At least now I know to avoid a cold place for graduate school...
I think I live what could be considered "middle ground" but unfortunately the air hurts my face in winter and air conditioning is a necessity in summer. :/
> carUsername does *not* check out.
Lol, like being drunk stops Wisconsinites from driving
...Rural North Dakota
Fuck you
Quit Snooping through my comment history
Outside of maybe the Everglades, our bugs here have nothing on northern summer bugs. The worst mosquitos in the world live on the Minnesota/Ontario border. And the nasty black flies... They're only active for a few months of the year, but god damn do they make up for lost time.
The cold is not what is bad about living in the dakotas, im in shorts and a hoodie at 10 degrees but the wind is what kills you. Fuck the great plains winds.
I know it's just a joke, but in ND the temps get over 100F in the summer. And around this time of year, the temps can change by over 50 degrees in a couple days.
So California was the worst place of them all right? 
The snow absorbs more life too
Nah, if you live in the UP you stay in the UP. You know how hard it is to get to Canada from the UP? You can either drive around Lake Superior or head to Sault Ste. Marie at the easternmost point of the peninsula. I lived there 19 years and never went to Canada. Why would I with the Copper Country, Porcupine Mountains, Canyon Falls, Pictured Rocks, and hundreds of other beautiful scenic areas all relatively close by?That said, I'd love to visit Canada. Seems nice. And Sunnyvale is there.
It would take several hours to shovel my driveway. We have to have someone plow it with a truck. Depends how long your driveway is and how good of shape you are in. Also, if you work/school early you don't want to be shoveling a ton in the dark before you can even leave. (We pay the same person to plow my grandparents driveway even though it's short because it's just not safe for them to do it though they have a shorter driveway).
North Texas reporting in:Sleet (2 weeks) Spring (3 months) Hell (6 months) Brown (2.5 months)
False: Spring, Summer, Hurricane, Rodeo. 
I've heard that girth is much more important than length anyway
The plains are so infinitely worse. PNW really is a remarkably nice place when you consider the pros and cons. They payoff is definitely worth it 1000x over. I know everyone says that about where they're from but we've got it good. 
It's not heavy rain; often more "drizzly" than "rainy".
HELLO FUTURE PEOPLE!
Illinois: We're broke!
Hey now. Summertime Chicago is incredible. Love Fall here as well.
Hey I'm in Michigan and we have the same- it's been raining for a week. RAINING in a month when we normally have bitter cold and snowstorms. It's weird, and I agree- disappointing.
I always find it strange how people say that the northern states are exactly like Canadian provinces. The difference between where I live and southern part of my province is astonishing. It's always hard for me to believe when I hear people say that Montana is just like Alberta. Y'all wildin 
The dry heat of Vegas was surprisingly painful to my lips, nostrils, and eyeballs. Still a nice place to visit though.
Pretty sure the homeless population goes down too... I mean... they leave, right?
"Honey, I love you - but your place makes my face hurt"
It's crazy, 10 years ago it would get -50 and stay there for 3 weeks. Now a single day of -50 is newsworthy. 
Snow vs. snow
> Get herpes from a stranger at the marlin. ...>I've eaten a lot of chili dogs from the guy outside the Marlin.Is... is that a euphemism?
Can he also do Boomhauer?
Because the story of someone buying a house on a hill wouldn't be as interesting as a zombie castle.
Just purchase the tape of it now and fast forward it to see what happens
> A lot of Northern Europe faces submersion if the sea level rises.Ha, Norway laughs at you!
>I had to close my windows at night.Holy shit.
When you step out of a cold shower and insta-sweat.
You can always put more clothes on to get warm.  You can only get so naked to stay cool
Come to Scotland,  the air may hurt your face a few days a year and you might want air conditioning a few days a year but neither situations ever last more than 2 days,  each might happen twice a year 
You can name your car whatever you want.  Mine, for example is "Impounded".
Oh come on. Why, as of this January in Wisconsin your FIFTH DUI is finally a felony. (But, you know, only if within 5 years).... 
Had that happen...that and so many decayed lizards found around the house under shit, behind curtains...Florida is a great place to visit, horrible place to live
Living in South Florida now for college. Had a fairly nice place last year with almost no bugs but it was too expensive without splitting a bedroom so I moved elsewhere. Holy shit the palmetto bugs. If we don't get the place sprayed at least every other month I find dead ones everywhere, several a week. I cannot wait to be back up north after i graduate and never see these things again
I don't think I've ever had a serious bug problem in my whole life of living in Seattle. Fleas maybe since I always had hairy ass pets. Even when bugs get in it's just not that bad. Rats and mice are a bigger problem. Or raccoons maybe. I live in a 117 year old house next to the unfinished attic and I've never seen a bug in my room.
Oh, and I forgot...around 3pm...it rains for about 15 minutes then the sun comes back out and bakes all the water on the ground giving you a nice sauna feel as you watch the steam rise 
Oh come on you act like that only happens in Florida. I know you northern folks have truck jackers too.
Kansan, can confirm.  Fuck the wind.
The snow absorbs my will to live.
"It may only be 5 inches, but I've got 16 stone to push it in with"
Sshhh don't tell people thatTell them you haven't seen the sun in 7 years
It's the "constantly wet" part that turns me off. I don't care how the rain is coming down, just that everything is always wet.
You stole a professional Hockey team from my hometown in 1997
Gotta watch out for those four footed zombies.
28 Jan 2017. Earth is not a wasteland yet.
I think he means the government.
my wife has rattle snake fang scars on her knee where she was bit when she was a teenager.  northwest illinois by galesburg.first case of snake bite at the hospital probably the only case as well.
There are like 3 or 4 species of poisonous snakes that are common in Illinois.
Illinois runs the gamut man. The north is just about as bad as Green Bay or MSP because of the wind stream. The south of Illinois damn near touches Tennessee.
Totally! That one day in fall when the weather is perfect. 
January average high/low temp for Calgary is -1/-13, for Helena, MT it's 1/-10.  I'd say that's in the same neighborhood. 
Yeah, heh heh. They go somewhere warm and cozy, like a friends' house or something, right?
She should sit on it to warm it up
It is almost like the planet is getting warmer or something.  Just a theory though.
You know nothing, Jon Blow.
He can do every character, including John Redcorn and Kahn, except for Boomhauer. He can't even do it at half speed. For some reason that's the only character I actually can imitate (at maybe 75% speed). 
Knowing American TV, we'd get 60 minutes about it easily
"When will Then be Now?"
I think that' a big part of what I hate about cold weather. It always feels like a big event to go outside. Gotta put on a ton of clothes, and then take them back off again when you arrive. Leaving the house in warm/hot weather is a much more casual affair.
Or come to the Midlands of England instead. It's grey all year round and nothing really happens, weather or otherwise.
Canadian here, no idea what a Wolf Spider is. 
Holy shit!
Countryside is the best side
At least the ones you found were dead :/
Wait, there are more Kansans than just me?
You must learn to harvest the life it has absorbed for you.
Non-Brits: That's 224lbs (1 stone = 14lbs)
Secret's out about the PNW, sorry to say. It's too bad you have a huge housing affordability crisis that's making it impossible to live there for  basically everyone except tech bros. 
10 Feb 2017. Getting there slowly. 
Here is Reddit silver 
Hey there.  North is Chicagoland, everything else is south ;-)
Literally touches kentucky.
Hey now!.. I seem to recall at least *three* in September!
/u/novaer is likely from Edmonton (or further north). -6/-15 here. Closeish, but still a big difference (especially since Montana can be at +2, while Edmonton is at -20).
Was about to write "username checks out" and then I realised it's not MuffedCanadian. 
For the win.
All those house hunter shows already exist.  Househunters: Inevitable Climate Change doesn't have quite the same ring to it though.
"SOON"
Trying to use my phone outside in cold weather is so frustrating. The touch screen doesn't recognise my gloves so I have to take them off. But then my fingers are too cold and the touch screen doesn't register them either! What do people do in cold countries while waiting at a bus stop if they can't browse reddit? 
They're dog sized and they hunt in packs. 
What sort of work is available in an area like this? I'm always envious of people living in the countryside, but I don't know what I could do for a living out there. 
I know right? I thought i was the only one but they keep popping up.
There are dozens of us, DOZENS!
Fuck, that is deep.
For people who prefer metric units, that's 0.000101604691 gigagrams.
Because the government took all your gold away
There are two types of people in the world. Those who laugh at the name Kankakee, and those who.. hahahaha, who the hell named a city that?
Actually, we try to keep a river between us and Kentucky for the Holy Spirit.
Or the one we just had like 2 days ago
Grew up in Edmonton Alberta and am now living in Saskatoon Saskatchewan for the past four years and the difference is staggering. Sure, it can hit -40 in Edmonton occasionally but it feels like EVERY winter in Saskatchewan it is -40 or worse every day with the wind chill. Seriously, there are like 3 or 4 trees in this province. I've tried to move back to Alberta but every time I step outside it's a near death experience. 
I am also a Canadian, this guy knows how to keep the air from hurting your face. Facemuffs.
But will you invite them to the divorce?
House Hunters: future waterfront.
HOW SOON!?
There are gloves made for use with touchscreens.
Basically nothing. The trick is to get a job in a city that lets you work remotely so you have that city salary and that country COL.
I KNEW I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE
Snow shoes help.
Saturday was glorious. 
Hi there.
Now
So... A computer programmer
And now there are 5.
We just missed it sir
My husband found a pantry moth that had died stuck to the inside of his straw. After he'd already been drinking from it for a while.
My final straw was a white straw, with those red stripes on the side.
I was trying to be sexy at the bar and as I went for the straw I poked my eye. Not very sexy 
I had jaw surgery so I was (am still) numb from my bottom lip to my chin. This made it somewhat difficult to drink from a glass so I used straws for a while. Then I ran out of my box of straws so I decided that was the last straw and learned to drink like a normal person again. 
One of the Senior VP's of my company told me: "A gentleman never drinks through a straw," so I haven't used one since
One of those plastic swirly loopdyloop straws
Serious answer: That video of that turtle with a straw stuck in his bleeding nose.Funny answer: I dunno. 
The realization that it is impossible to look like a badass when drinking with a straw.
I sucked so hard, I inhaled it... Fuck you straw!
When it broke the camels back.  That was my only camel.
The first time I ever went to bar I was drinking from a straw. This drunk guy walked up to me, took my straw out, threw it on the ground and said: "straws are for bitches!"Haven't used a straw since 
I use glass straws.  Makes me feel all classy and shit.
Fear of repeated straw usage giving me a bad case of "old lady mouth." 
It was after watching Stupid, Crazy, Love. That scene has always stuck with me. That and Shopping at Gap.
I had one go up my nose on a date once. Sprite turned into cherry sprite and the date ended in shame and blood.
ITT: The video of a straw being pulled out of a turtle's nose. It was certainly compelling and made me decide there and then not to use straws. I still accidentally use them when drink stall owners just chuck a straw into my drink on reflex before I can stop them :(
I guess the turtle video I saw just now because of this thread?
Realizing I don't suck.
My SO cut the straw to my water cup for our make-up sex coke and then pulled the straw back up so I wouldn't notice. 
I once ate from a bag of mixed nuts for about ten minutes before noticing a live cockroach crawling around in there. It was all covered in salt and looked like a little almond with legs. Wasn't using a straw though.
I just gagged while taking a sip of my beer.  Christ.
Quick question: What the fuck is a pantry moth
Reminds me of that time I poured myself some iced tea from a pitcher in the fridge, took a big gulp, and slid a perfectly intact and whole blob of grey fuzzy mold about the size of a pomegranate directly into my mouthhole
Just extra protein. No big thing.
Those are my favorite kind
It's a red straw with white stripes
Less sexy, more cutesy
Dang must've been a big miss
I feel you. I had jaw surgery as well and my bottom lip and chin were numb, I got into the habit of wiping my mouth a lot when I ate because stuff would get on my chin and NO ONE would tell me. It took about 4-6 years for the full feeling to return to my chin.
It's been over 19 years since I had my jaw surgery.  I currently rock a pretty awesome beard (if I do say so myself) and it has only added to the lack of sensation.I sat with barbecue sauce on my beard for 10 minutes at a restaurant the other day.  Nobody told me.  A table of friends and my wife sat there, silently judging me, while I engaged in a passionate discussion about red beans and rice, with my beard slathered in barbecue sauce.

>a horse whispering something in Frenchlol brilliant
I feel like that was on the waitress, if she had burst out laughing, that could have easily been a how I met your mother story.Unless of course you forgot to follow Rule 1: Be Attractive. Then it's on you.
I don't think it counts "being a teetotaler" when you're 18.
I'm focusing on wrong part of your anecdote but does drinking root beer have similar effect as alcohol, or do they come in alcoholic variation?I've only tried it handful of times as they are some what hard to come by in the UK and I've only tried the bon-alcoholic root beer.
When you can't stand being deprived of dick no more
I think you mean a crazy straw
how did the straw get lodged that deep into the nostril?? That seems really hard to do. 
It's definitely possible to be cutesy with a girl when drinking with straws though. Get two and sip from either side of the milkshake. Works best if you're a tough biker with slick black hair and a leather jacket but you're sweet when you're around your girl and she's the only one who can melt your stony exterior.
If you are a badass, everything you do looks badass. Except drinking with a straw.
But after all, why sipp when you can succ?
Hmm, well if it's camels you're looking for, then there are four places. There's the Camel Hut, that's on third. There's camels are us, that's on third too. You got Put Your Butt On That Camel, that's on third. Swing Low, Sweet Camel... That ma... Matter of fact they're all on the same complex. It's the camel complex down on third.
Came to see if this joke was posted. Done. 
Wood? I feel like a wolf with a strong enough blow would be able to get through wood. Just saying, you may be setting yourself up for disaster. Brick is a solid choice though.
You let a man tell you how to live your life. Sounds like *you're* the bitch.
I threw it on the ground!
Those exist?
:( People are just awful for the environment. I hope we find a biodegradable alternative to plastic soon.
now I kind of want to go into marine biology to help these animals ~~but I hate water and swimming so probably not a good choice~~
I have reusable plastic straws that I just wash. They also come in stainless steel and silicon and aren't really that much of a pain to wash. Some things just need a straw, like smoothies or milkshakes.
Serious question: was really necessary to remove the straw from the turtle? I mean, it looks like the straw was inside the turtle for many years and when they remove it, it's nose started to bleed. Poor turtle perhaps needed antibiotics and pain killers. 
Is that similar to cat's bum mouth?
The real struggle here, though, is old lady mouth or yellow teeth? Bc coworkers drink their coffee with a straw and I just can't get behind that because old lady mouth and also wtf. But they swear it keeps their teeth white and they don't have old lady mouth yet either so I'm conflicted....
How did you come down on the straw so hard as to cause a nose bleed? Also, JUST LOOK AT THE STRAW PEOPLE!
Mmmmmmmmmmmmeta
Holy shit paragraph divisions man 
At that point I'd just kill myself
Nice dude. That reminds me about the time I ordered some fried chicken salad from this new delivery place at my college. After picking at the salad for a couple minutes I noticed a live cockroach crawling around in there. It was all covered in ranch dressing and looked like a little piece of chicken with legs. Wasn't using a straw though.
I once left tomato juice opened and a cockroach drowned there. I gag everytime I think it could easily be unnoticed, covered in a thick layer of tomato
Did you eat it?
From a straw?
It's just a tiny little moth that can infiltrate pantries/kitchens and live off of dry food. They're a pain in the ass and a little bit gross because they can lay eggs in your food stuffs, but they're not all that bad as far as bugs go.
Either you meant a pomegranate seed or you have a mouth the size of...well, a pomegranate.
I'm pretty sure its a straw with red and white stripes 
Kinda cornea, but funny all the same.
I would like to hope that I would tell you that you have made a mess of your food all over your beard. But like a bro. Not some douche canoe trying to get a laugh at your expense. Maybe we come up with a sign? 1 beard stroke means I'm thinking. 2 means there's something in your beard. 3 means there's an evil ninja creeping up behind the person to your left. Etc. 
I don't know how you can read that line and not start moving your mouth like Mr. Ed the Horse trying to get peanut butter from under his lip.    Edit for respect. 
That line made me laugh out loud. My guy asked what was so funny but when I read the post to him he just frowned and said "I don't get Reddit." *sigh*

Rule 2 is equally as important: Don't Be Unattractive.  
> Unless of course you forgot to follow Rule 1: Be Attractive. Then it's on ~~you.~~ your parents.FTFY
You got a source for that wondrous gif?
They do make alcoholic root beers, but 99% of the time when you see root beer on the shelf in a store or on a restaurant menu, it's a non-alcoholic drink.
/u/minicipalchark comfirmed as OP's mum? /u/lordtuts finally brought justice? More on this at 10.
In the video description they say he probably ate it and regurgitated the straw, which then got lodged in his nose. They share a pretty close passageway and it likely just went out the wrong one. Personally, I'm guessing over some period of time trying to force it out is how he got it wedged so far up.  
I'm going to buy some of those metal ones on Amazon soon. 
Holy shit
Why?
I did this once.  Worst nosebleed ever! 
Even so, the straw works in this scenario by cracking the badass mystique for effect. Such is the power of the straw.
And for those of us who don't live in a musical?

I'm not a part of your system!
They do exist - I've seen them at music festivals where vendors are required to provide compostable utensils and straws. I don't know how available they are to the public, though.
We need an alternative to humans
"As I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was devine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment I was a marine biologist!"
Turtles lives for decades, maybe even centuries, so 8 minutes of pain and a bit of blood is a small price to pay. It likely obstructed its breathing and ability to expel water and stuff out from its nostrils and its ability to do coke. 
I WASN'T looking, and i was trying to get to the lip of the cup so I could get some ice, but instead wound up with the straw WAAAY up my nose. it was super bad.
At that point I'd be in to deep, I'd just have to eat the cockroach to commit.
Cool man. Reminds me of the time I was delivering my baby with my wife. After cradling my newborn child for a couple minutes I noticed it was actually a giant live cockroach crawling around in my arms. It was all covered in blood and looked like a little baby with legs. Wasn't using a straw though. 
were you using a straw though?
I'd say that tomato juice is repulsive enough even without cockroaches
He doesn't want to smear his lipstick
i've been fighting them for 2 years now, destroyed every 'dried good' we could find, keep everything in the fridge now or in sealed containers, sprayed every nook and cranny, put those traps in every god damned room - basically salted the earth but they're still coming. they fill up the traps in a few weeks but doesn't seem to put a dent in the population.I've resorted to interrogating fresh catches, they're tough little bastards, though, haven't given up any nesting locations yet.
> pantry mothWe have an infestation of those fuckers. They're not bad at all but they are gross little fuckers.
Like, a clear straw? 
Man, iris we could just go one day without a chain of puns.

Rule 3: if you can't not be unattractive, be charismatic as hell. 
I have met lots of attractive people with hideous parents. I have lots of people who were hideous and then did themselves up and had me all like *diggity dizam*I really think it is up the individual
/u/lordtuts? I haven't heard that name in years...
I will NEVER use a plastic drinking straw ever again after watching that video.
Glass is the way to go- you can see if it needs extra cleaning with a pipe cleaner on the inside. With the metal ones it's anyone's guess what the inside looks like
We were 16 or 17 at the time, and I don't remember if we ever got any. 
He said 16 or 17, just look down.  If you are a girl...Welcome to trying to figure out why teenagers are morons.  Science and religion has failed us on how they survive.

Sweet bro. Reminds me of the time I was saving a family from a fire. It wasn't until a couple of minutes of saving that I realized I saved a giant cockroach instead of any human. It was covered with smoke and looked like little father legs. Wasn't using a straw though. 
Your handwriting is Masterful.

Who uses a straw to drink hot drinks?
After reading these suggestions, I think I will just revert to using a sippy-cup.
>I don't remember if we ever got anyYeah fucking right
I mean specifically the girls who asked for straws. Only thing I can think of is some connection with blowjobs, but I'm not making it.
You have to have the gear right.  A backpack with a machete and hatchet strapped to the sides looks badass.  A hiking pack properly weighted and strapped doesn't move and you can miles and miles a day with it.Sadly laptop bags never look cool(unlike bowties or Stetsons) you have to hold them down and run for the subway in your geeky outfit.  WHY CANT WE BRING BACK BRIEFCASES!?
Wouldn't that be 3 humps?
ok wolfguy im reporting you
I fucked a mermaid!
Rad homie. Reminds me of the time I was in middle school taking a math test. It wasn't until a couple minutes of test taking that I realized my teacher, classmates, parents, siblings, and myself were all cockroaches and that I wasn't taking a test and that I didn't know what a test was. I was covered in urine and so was everyone else and we were in a bathroom in Soho. Wasn't using a straw though.
Thank you :) all done with an ink well and straight pen. Hand cramps for days.
And my axe!
I mean, they got a kick out of it. But they did shit all to help. Took me a year and a half but finally got rid of the moths.I moved.
You pupil disgust me. 
You're five thousand candles in the wind
Well. Too bad, fucker. 
*shyly raises hand*
Yeah but unless you stay on top of maintenance of said sippy cup it accumulates all sorts of bacteria and mold. And just dishwashing it doesn't work. You have to full on scrub that sucker (pun?) out. 
You can't be serious.
This isn't a song lyric but damn you're use of your you're
I can only last for 2 :(
On the internet no one knows you are an anthropomorphic wolf
Sick, friendo. Reminds me of the time I was elected President. It wasn't until election night that I realized my opponent and her entire team were just giant cockroaches and that my entire campaign was a joke. It was all dressed up and talking and just looked like a Secretary of State with legs. Wasn't using a straw though.
Probably more effort than the actual eradication of the moths?
And my vuvuzela!
Where's /u/unexpectedgimli when you need him. 
You have an eye for clever puns. 
What the fuck, there's a reddit court. 
I tried using a straw for hot tea.  Seared pomegranate with honey strip from my tongue and the roof of my mouth.  And then I did it again, after the healing, but before the remembering. You, sir or madam, are a badass. 
Yea, make sure to take the seal ring off the top and clean underneath it. loves to grow mold there if you dont.
You want to get ahead?

Righty hoe. Reminds me of that one time i was praying at my shul. It wasn't until a couple minutes of scheming that i realized my rabbi, parents, myself, and the rest of my congregation were cockroaches and we werent praying but feasting on the feces of some liberal arts major who had relieved xirself into and all over the coffee machine at starbucks. I was covered in some liquid the humans called "iced frappuccino" and so was everyone else but we didnt really much care because we were cockroaches. Wasnt using a straw though.
Well, this was more time/effort than the Battle of the Baking Cupboard (the first one), but much less than the overall war. Eggs can remain viable for up to 300 days. Months after I thought it was all over they'd be back.

It wasn't until I was taking the first bite of a snag sanga that I cottoned onto the fact that Steve turned into a fucken New South Welshman, and the woolies snags were actually just minced up blues fans. Wasn't using a straw though.

Chicago is going to have a baby boom in 9 months 
I've gotta tell you, I still hear screaming, fireworks, and car horns blaring outside. I'm north of the stadium by quite a bit. Everyone here in Chicago is going crazy. The rain finally stopped too so everyone and their dogs is outside. Go Cubs!
R.I.P. Ottoman Empire references.
2016 is hands down the weirdest year of all time....
This is something I'm gonna tell the grandkids about."Grandpa, where were you when the Cubs broke the curse?""Shitposting on reddit."
I live in Logan Swuare and I swear I stepped onto my stoop and it sounds like the purge out there, please send help.
Back to the Future predicted it one year too late
Anyone see Kris Bryant's face when he was fielding the ball for the final out? That was hilarious. 
Naturally, it just took some rain to end a 108 year drought. 
And I thought Leo winning his Oscar took too long. Maybe 2016 truly *is* marking the end of the world. 
On a scale 1-completely burned down what's the status of Chicago right now?
Ok everybody, fess up and start doing all the things you've ever said you would do,  "once the Cubs win the World Series"
Here's to another 108 years
I found myself jumping out of my chair shouting in celebration, then realized I'd never cared about baseball or any baseball team ever and not sure why I was so excited about a team I'd never even watched play a game.Still a great finish though.
Bill Murray must be dying with happiness right now.
Living in downtown Chicago, I got my windows open and the city is exploding in cheers and car horns.It's electric. This seriously feels like a dream.
DAMMIT CUBS YOU HAD THE BEST STREAK
As a Chicago Cubs fan as of about 1am GMT, I have never been happier.
Lifetime Red Sox fan here. I remember the feeling back in 2004. The feeling of the curse vanishing. It gets weird there. The tragedy had become part of our identity for so long and for a while we didn't know, as fans, who we were any more. But guess what Cubs fans, you're fucking winners now. Get used to it.
#IT WAS 3-1
As a natural born Chicagoan in the Cleveland area, I got a resounding "Go fuck yourself!" when I cheered out the window. Honestly, it made it even better.
This is where you suddenly find out that 75% of your facebook friends have been life long Cubs fans. 
Well its the perfect time to release a 4k Bluray re-release of Back to the Future 2 2016 edition, wherein every single reference of the movie to 2015 is changed to 2016.
So many people posting no one will see that I like Shirley Temples from Applebee's.
Man, Leonardo DiCaprio won an Oscar, The Cubs won the world series. What is this world coming to?
My grandmother is 93 years old, she has been rooting for the cubs since she was old enough to speak, she's told us about how growing up in the dust bowl the best days of her life were those spent listening to the game on the radio, I cannot express how happy I am she got to witness this victory in her life time
My Greys Sports Almanac was out by a year.
#CLEVELAND BLEW A 3-1 LEAD#
What if they won because on Tuesday the world is going to end and god wanted them to win one before everything ends
World series champs 2124. Calling it now.
I'm confused why this is in 'Ask Reddit'? 
First Leo wins an Oscar, now the Cubs win the world series...2 memes that have died this year. RIP in peace. 
Literally the last batter, best and closest game I've watched in forever.
First Brexit, now this. Pretty sure that spells out a Trump presidency if we're going by the laws of 3 for huge unexpected results.
Why is this on AskReddit?
You'll be able to tell which kid because they'll be named either Kris, Addison or Javy.
I don't know about that.  It's late, and everyone's exhausted.
That and its senile population who have been diehard fans for their 90+ years on Earth can finally *let go*.
LmaoIn all seriousness, what a seat.
What was that?
My dad got so fucking drunk, he wouldn't stop screaming "THE CUBS WON THE WORLD SERIES" for 2 hours and then he passed out
I'm in the loop and there has been uninterrupted car horns for fifteen minutes. IT'S SO FUN!
Tornado sirens went off in the northern suburbs on the Last out.
I was in Boston when they reversed he curse.  I literally saw a car flipped over and on fire
Next thing you know wikileaks is going to drop a file revealing that Steve Buscemi wasn't a firefighter on 9/11 after all
Last time the Cubs won the world series the United States was a single nation. They even called it "indivisible"
This is the second and final fall of the empire. 
TIL the last time the Cubs won the World Series, the U.K. was still part of the EU.
One of my favorite running sports jokes.
It could be even weirder on Wednesday morning. 
Son of a bitch, the Sports Almanac was wrong by just ONE year...
To be fair, that answer will apply to all major events they may ask you about 
I'm on the red line and we're about to hit Addison. Send help.Everyone is singing. I fucking love it.
RIP.
I live next to a bar in North Center. It's nothing but car horns, screams of death, glass breaking. Who knew celebrating could sound so violent?
Hahahahah same I'm in California and Milwaukee. The purge has commenced 
That one high school senior predicted it for this year as his quote, though. He has some explaining to do. 
Parks and Recreation predicted it just right.
Imagine the people that blew tens of thousands of dollars betting on the Cubbies last year because of Back to the Future. Didn't pay off that year, so those people didn't bet a dime this year, thinking the curse was too strong. And then the Cubs win this year, just to rub salt in the wound.
That was adorable. He knew what was happening.
Like a little kid playing ball. Loved it. 
Theo Epstein could run for governor of California by basing his campaign around two words: drought buster.
It's god tying up loose story ends before he fucks us all up. That's right. I called it. Trump victory. 
My grandpa was a lifelong cubs fan and he passed away a few months ago. What a great time to win. 
Not only did it happen, it happened: Game 7, Extra Innings, 1 Run Lead. Real life isn't supposed to be this dramatic.
My grandpa didn't get off his ship in the Navy until 1946, so this was his first Cubs World Series even though he was alive for the last one. He's been in kidney failure and in-home hospice care for a while now and I'm glad he got to see this.
This girl named Becky Schwartz said she'd fuck me "when the Cubs win the world series". I don't know how to explain to my SO that I have to do this...
See you in 3024!
^this is how lifelong fans are made. 
Go outside get the fuck off the computer
He probably died of a heart attack when the 2 run HR tied it up.
It only paid 3-1 so he'd win 600,000
I like having the shortest championship drought in all of professional sports tbh
As a Chicago Cubs since 1907, I am okay
As a mariners fan, I'm still waiting lol
This is why I really wanted the Cubs to win. I remember watching that game in 2004 on a tiny tv when I wasn't supposed to be awake because of school. They broke the curse and I got to see it as a sox fan. I'm so happy for the Cubs and their fans, it's a great feeling
So has this ever worked in favor of the person who got the tattoo?
The Warriors send their regards.
I'm nearly 50 years old.  I'm not a sports fan by any means, but I watched this game tonight (the first ball game I've watched in years) with a pic of my parents, who both passed away 13 years ago, propped up next to me so they could watch too.  My grandmother, who died in 1992, always had the Cubs game on when we would visit her as kids.  Like so many, this isn't just history for us; it's history for the one, two, or maybe three generations of loved ones that have lived and died without seeing the Cubs win a World Series, while always staying fans. 
I'm totally biased since I'm a Cubs fan but I mean if you have to lose to someone, might as well be the team that hasn't won a championship in over a 100 years.
Oh fuck off with that shit. They have not won in 108 years, everyone is a cubs fan today
The end
Whats next? Half-Life 3?
Trump vs Clinton. Let that sink in. We're in a crazy ass world.
Jesus Christ. That coupled with how it actually happened (game 7, extra innings) makes that sound like a screen play. That's so cool
I'm so happy you get to have this moment with your dad! My brother committed suicide in May after years battling depression and he was a huge Cubs fan...I just wish I could call him right now and scream in joy over the phone with him. 
One meme dies, another begins. 
Two teams blow a 3-1 lead in the finals, what a year.
Thanks, Obama. 
Isn't a baseball game always down to the last batter...?
Kyle, Jon, Ben, but please not Arolodis.
What's another 5 minutes to the celebration! 
Poor guy saw every angle of the loss. 
If I recall correctly, he sets off the fireworks for Cleveland, and set one off for a Kansas City home run by accident.
And then it'll turn out that the cut on Leo DiCaprio's hand in *Django Unchained* was fake all along.
Last time the Cubs won the World Series, Barack Obama was President.
Is this the part where the empire strikes back?
Stop.

I know those are streets in Chicago but I still read that as you being in some kind of quantum state
He's got the almanac 
Does anyone know when that quote was published?
I'm glad someone else saw that. I'm genuinely concerned.
I'd say Back to the Future's prediction was still better considering they predicted it decades ago
It's what every baseball player dreams of their entire life!
He's the biggest winner of all, imo. Red Sox then Cubs? Dude is amazing. Which team is next? How much money is he getting?
Cubs win the series and fucking Biff the presidency 
This one's for gramps.  Congrats from KC.
My dad passed 13 years ago. I'm wearing his Cubs hat.
With a fucking rain delay. 
Yeah i live in the suburbs and it is just, crazy, people are running in the street and honking aswell
When's the date?
I am sure she will understand. But plot twist, Becky also said that to 65 other guys so you may have a line to wait in...
Not quite. You tried though :)
I've been a football fan for a long time (go broncos!!). My Columbian friends made me a soccer fan after a very sad loss to Brazil in the world cup (with a happy ending). Tonight I have become a baseball fan. Living in Colorado makes it hard because our team is not the best, but if the Cubs can do it we can too. Here's to next year and watching more baseball. Thank you Cubs, for making me a fan. 
I had no money riding on it and I almost had a heart attack.
Only

"only $600,000"
Fellow Mariners fan here. *sadface*
Even as a lifelong Cubs fan, I was rooting for the Sox so hard in 2004. I was in seventh grade. I remember staying up way too late too, those extra innings games where you guys rallied against the Yankees. Ortiz with those clutch home runs. Curt Schilling and his bloody ankle. All of it was beautiful. 
it's the end of the world as we know it
The election.Fuck.
Seriously if I were OP I would start shopping that shit. 
Also retired.
Mr. Stamina over here....
That video is actually from a couple years ago. IIRC that guy controlled the fireworks for the Indians and accidentally fired them off when the opposing team hit a home run.
And that jet fuel *can* melt steel beams afterall
Why? My country left the EU. David Bowie died. Donald Trump has a serious chance of being POTUS.At least Tottenham didn't win the league. 
Will they be able to draft a QB by then?
HEY CHICAGO WHATTYA SAY
The almanac doesn't go to 2016 though.
1993
It was 1993. Rumor has it he may have chosen 2016 because it's 23 years later. Jordan's number. Chicago. 
Yeah, I'm pretty sure this means Trump is going to win the presidency and North Korea is going to discover internet porn. 
That little giggle as he throws the ball had me laughing so hard
I just realised, with this almost definitely becoming a classic, Joe Buck now has two of the most iconic announcer moments in sports history:"Stays on his feet, airs it out, down the field... it is... caught, by Tyree!"and now"...gonna be a tough play; Bryant; the Cubs... WIN THE WORLD SERIES! Bryant makes the play, it's over!"
I have a feeling Bryzzo snagged that ball for memorabilia...
Breaking a 108 year curse? No, it was something nobody ever could dream of.

I mean when you're talking about putting your life savings on the Cubs winning the World Series... 
At least we got the Sounders and Seahawks, and the Huskies and Cougs, I guess
The election happens, and then days after (calling it - 11/14), Gabe announces Half Life 3 to soothe us. 
Sounds like a book and movie adaptation waiting to happen.Hey OP, include this comment in the movie please.
And that 7/11 is indeed a part time job!
Death, taxes, Arsenal finishing above Tottenham... some things never change 
AND THEY STILL COULDNT FINISH ABOVE ARSENAL.AHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHSHHAHAHAHSHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHA
Robo-Goodell walks up to the podium "and with the 1st overall pick of the 2080 season, the Cleveland Browns select... Robert Griffin the Sixth"
1993 + 23 = 201623 -\> Michael Jordan -\> Chicago Bulls -\> CubsHonestly doubt that's a coincidence
He was so fucking happy
"I want all the illegal Mexicans to make like a tree, and get outta here."
Great Scott!
Lmao
Always involving a team from Cleveland, one way or the other.
Those huskies look pretty good this year too.
And that the Moon Landing was baked at 375!
Last year was fucking precious.Tottenham for most of the end of the season ahead of Arsenal, and Arsenal gets....second
Third in a two horse race, etc. 
Breaking news! RG VI has torn his ACL while climbing the stairs to greet his new comrades.
1908+108=2016108, the height of the Sears Tower, also the street Cubs HQ is on.
This is heavy...
And that Unidan did nothing wrong!
Also the number of stitches on an MLB baseball. 
was this the guy that was using multiple accounts to up vote himself? am I remembering correctly?
Wrong or not, I still miss the guy.
Not only to upvote himself, but to downvote people he disagreed with. Was once a beloved Reddit celebrity who always chimed in with cheerful and enthusiastic biology facts. I always read his comments in Claptrap's voice.
The first time my SO and I slept together I woke up during the night to use the bathroom. I came back in the room and she farted one of the loudest farts I've ever heard. I started laughing like crazy and she almost woke up. Almost. We've been together for seven years. 
I know her secret Twitter handle.  But she might know my secret reddit account (this one) so perhaps it's a wash.
He claims he doesn't love the new cat his parents adopted. Claims she always just sleeps in his room for some reason. Motherfucker loves that cat so much.
I *know* she ate those cookies. 
My ex, and the cheating. She thinks I found out when I looked at her phone, but I new about two months earlier when she sent me a pic of herself watching Netflix in bed. I don't think she realized that the dude's face was 100% visible reflected in the laptop. After that it was a matter of me being in denial and trying to fix things.
I knew for a year and a half about my engagement ring and never told him until after he proposed. He was not so good at hiding.
My wife dropped my iPhone in a Port-A-Potty toilet.  Luckily it has been so used there was a large pile of shit which gently held the phone above the liquid.  She cleaned it off and gave it back to me.  A year later I upgraded and gave her my old phone.  She insisted on purchasing a new cover even though I had a high-end OtterBox.  I never understood why until one of the kids told on her.
My ex made up a person and spoke to me as them. We met when we were quite young and were both pretty weird... I put it down to insecurity and wanting to look like she had cool friends (I was a little older). I never let on that I knew because it would have been super embarrassing for her and this was literally the start of the relationship.She made up quite a few stories about this guy and I got a few emails from "him". She didn't realise that changing the name of the account didn't actually change the address, which was fully visible.
She smokes when I'm not home, I know this because I always move the router to the window where the signals best, when I come home the router is in a different position away from the window, I put it back without her knowing and call her out for smoking, she has no idea how I keep finding out!
I'm his first girlfriend. He's 42. ETA: this isn't "the worst" bc it's something to be ashamed of, it's just something he doesn't know I know. I wish he'd been up front about it in the beginning, but it doesn't change how much I adore him in the least. Edited AGAIN, because I had to tell him why I was on Reddit so much tonight. Now he knows I know, thanks a lot y'all! - He got a good laugh at this whole thing, I knew he was a keeper! 
I know she looks at my reddit
She waits until I sleep to steal my pillows 
She is breaking up with me tomorow, said she wants to talk, and it's not something we can talk about in texts.We are on the verge of a breakup for like two months now, feels bad.
I've always been her second option
He spent a ton of money on bruins tickets this year. Whenever he got tickets to a match he claimed he got them for free through work but I know he paid for them. I don't really mind since he can spend his money how he wants, but it's funny to me that he thinks I wouldn't realize he's spending a few hundred bucks every time he goes to a game 
They don't love me anymore. But... ya know... finances and such.
She had sex with my boss before we knew each other, before I had been hired into the company. I'm not mad about it or anything, everyone has a past but she carefully dances around ever coming into my work now and I'm careful not to bring him up.
She flushes her tampons down the toilet, which clogs it every so often. Blames it on big turds
Can't we just have an anon mode so I can stop making throwaways? YEAH I KNOW YOU LOOK AT MY REDDIT FITE ME WHEN YOU COME HOME.
My ex - his drinking. I could smell the alcohol on him. Excuses included:- it's the coffee I had- it's the gum I chewed- it's my aftershave - the guys were drinking, not me- I had to use a solvent today, I must have gotten some on me- etcI gave up. I knew. Then he started coming home fall-down drunk. Gave him an ultimatum. Went through with it. Typo fixed
when i was 23 the girl i was dating left with a friend to "get some food" and instead they had sex.  he told me the next morning, but she didn't say shit and actually slept in my bed that night.  i didn't end it right away, and that hung over our relationship FOR NINE FUCKING YEARS.  if you are young and prone to co-dependency please take this to heart...if some dumb shit happens in your relationship GTFO.  don't wait for someone else's dumb shit to soak into your soul.  don't lose yourself in a relationship with a fuckface.  
This is in the past, but still a good one. Ended up finding out that my (now ex) girlfriend was cheating on me after hearing one of my parrots pick up, "Oh, God, yes, Jim!" In a rather scratchy sensual voice. Turns out they've been having sex where I keep him while I went to work. Dumped her ass the next time I saw her and told her. 
When  he's about to fall asleep he's completely honest.  it was about 7 months in when he grabbed me and whispered into my ear "You're gonna be the mother of my children." I told him and he was thoroughly embarrassed and he apologized.  however I neglected to tell him that pretty much every night he would tell me that he loved me starting a month in.  I don't mind and I'm not trying to rush things and neither of us have any plans to jump into that sort of stuff right away but it's nice to know
"reddit what is the worst secret your so is hiding from you""she has sports tickets for my birthday"what
At night, once I go to bed, he binge watches Gossip girl. 
She is hiding baseball tickets for when my favorite team comes into town. She is waiting to give them to me on my birthday.
She has no idea that I know about her multiple imaginary friends.  Also she has this crazy notion that the computer programs she writes have become sentient - I am considering contacting a therapist. 
Combination of her drinking and her cheating. I can tell by her behavior and the look in her eyes the second she drinks. Saw texts from another guy while she was passed out... Not really sure what to do.
This is a past-tense secret, but my GF at the time decided to surprise me by buying a holiday to Brussels for us over my 30th Birthday. I accidentally intercepted the hotel conformation email, so decided it was a good time to propose, as I'd been considering it for about 6 months. Act all surprised when she tells me, then when we're having dinner in the restaurant on the 1st night, I get down on one knee and propose.Celebrating our 3 year wedding anniversary at the end of next month 
I woke up in the middle of the night to my gf giving me a handy while i had been asleep.  I pretended to stay asleep through it and she never said anything to me about it since.  Was that some crazy Cosmo test to see if I'd say someone's name in my sleep or something? 
While me and my ex were dating she said that she had a driver's license, but I knew she didn't the whole time
She's been studying abroad for a year and is planning on coming home 5 days earlier to surprise meEdit : Wow didn't imagine that many ideas coming out of posting this! Now I'm definitely gonna do a surprise party, just have to look in to the details! Edit2 : the plan so far :Day 1 : romantic night and evening at my place, I feign surprise Day 2 : Surprise party at her place with her closest friends 
She purposefully looses Overwatch games from time to time so that we can keep playing competitive together
She says she doesn't want children.I know that she actually does want children, and that she's not capable of having them, due to stumbling upon some medical records.
Found a pack of cigarettes in her purse
She really disliked my friends (or maybe thought they disliked her), which led to awkward hangouts with groups and eventually led me to uncontrollable anxiety when they were in the same room... Yeah, it was a bad feeling that was never addressed.  
She quit taking birth control. "Somehow we beat the odds" and ended up with a daughter. Probably did it to keep me from leaving. That or the time she cut herself and said she was attacked. She did this to hide the fact she was seeing an ex. 
When I'm asleep, he grabs my boobs. I sleep top less and if he gets the opportunity, he takes a feel. I allow it because I enjoy it. I think it's funny.
Nice try, SO
That's she's been cheating on me with the same person I've been cheating on her with. 
He caught Snorlax without me:/ 
Gay relationship. My graphics card is dying and it makes it difficult to play ffxiv or overwatch without something catastrophic going on.He bought me a GTX1080 and is waiting for our 9th anniversary in a few weeks to give it to me. He thinks I don't know, but he talks in his sleep. And when he talks in his sleep, it's almost like he's trying to rehearse the situation in his dream. It's absolutely adorable.He's ratted himself out various times in the past the same way. I always act surprised. :)
"What's the worse secret" top 9/10 top comments are adorable or sweet.
He cheated on me with a 59 year old while i was giving birth to our daughter. Lol
Blew my mechanic.
Every single secret he has ever tried to keep from me I already knew/know about. Kind of frustrating, actually, because I would like to be surprised but he's terrible at keeping secrets.
That she started dating me because my parents had a lot of money and I was following down the path to also have a lot of money. I saw her group chat with her mom, sisters and aunt about what a good situation she's in and how she'll never have to work, and that even if things go south she just has to stick around until my parents aren't around anymore. I'm only with her until I finish school because I don't want to be alone in this time of my life. 
She doesn't know I like watching her sleep. She is beautiful and looks so relaxed while sleeping but she is also shy and would probably feel self-conscious if she knew.Her job is very stressing so she suffers from "bitchy face syndrome" lol but if you get past that, you realize she is a very sweet girl. I'm gathering courage to introduce myself to her later this month.
He had always said he hates to cuddle at night because it gets hot/ it's uncomfortable/I hog the blankets/ect. However,  when he thinks I'm asleep he'll scoot over and wrap his body around me. If I even make a move like I'm awake, he'll run back to his side and pretend it never happened. I think its freaking adorable.
Throwaway because he is a redditor. He is becoming complacent and a bit lazy I guess, so (without even having to go behind his back) know about the several other girls he messages on almost a daily basis, and he is not always asking about the weather or their opinion on the Cuban missile crisis. We live together, and the secret I am keeping from him is a painting I am getting made of his family for his birthday.
He has stolen my dog. He is now our dog. 
If your name is Doug, I have to say you hid this one poorly. 
Make it for her some time and tell her you wanted to take a whack at making your own salad dressing. Then play it off like you came up with it all on your own and see if she figures it out.
Wow what a fucking idiot. Like, why send a pic with him in the room goddamn 
I'm glad you're ok. :)
Leaving was the right move! 
He planned to propose for a year and a half before he did it?  Why?  Did he just get a good deal on a ring and buy it just in case?
Damn, a year and a half of knowing it was coming but not knowing when? 
I just read this to my husband. He immediately got up and put a bag of croutons in the freezer. We're trying it tomorrow. Update: Sorry it took so long but it makes them crunchier, which we like. Not bad, not bad at all. Much better than the cat food Tina Belcher told us to try.
That's fucked up 
Oh this broke my heart. You alright op?
Damnit.  I lost the gal I was going to spend my life with to leukemia.  I'm so very sorry.
Why does she move the router?
>me in 21 years.
Wouldn't work with me; I throw my pillow off the bed in my sleep, I'm instantly awake grabbing for it. 
Run, she's crazy
Story time!How? Why? When? *Why?*
Indulge her fetish and become old!
Are you an old man?
That girl's never gonna stop fucking you. 
Whether it counts or not, I felt the cathartic waves from here, man. I'm sorry for the shitty ex, but the internet's listening to ya. 
Same thing happened to me, more or less. Even talking to him on the phone *right fucking next to me*. We had set up auto-transaction payments for most of our bills, so I shut that down really fast, but it wasn't easy. Her stuff slowly started to disappear and I was like well she's not keeping it all in her car duh. She didn't lie about having nowhere to go, she actually bragged about it. Nice new town-house, new mercedes for her, etc etc. He spends all this money on her so that means he loves her more than I did. Oh ok you're a dumb bitch, bye. 
Yeah that's what my ex did. She cheated and I gave her the option to work it out or she can leave. She asked for a week to clear her head at her sisters. Fine, except she forgot to delete the copy of her plane ticket where the guy lives. Yeah, nah, I'm not an option.
He's having sex with the Bruins.
As the opposite half of that equation. I fell back in love with my wife. Fairly recently actually. We have been together 15 years now. Rough spot about 5 years ago. Separated for a year. Got back together. Honestly, in the last year, it's really going well. I am back in love again. Just letting you know, there is hope. Couples therapy helped. But we both had to do slot on our own. And the biggest piece for me was that I needed to see she was truly making an effort. 
Been there. Done that. Single 2 years now. Was definitely for the best in the long run. We only have one life, no point wasting it on the wrong person
Dump her ass,jesus
She had sex with Lumbergh? 
This happened with my wife and a friend - before I knew her. Actually, it is only because I am friends with him that I met her.  He encouraged our dating.  I don't know if she knows that I know that they had a little thing, no reason it ever needed to come up really.  I don't feel any resentment toward her but to be completely honest I have a small amount of (unreasonable) resentment toward him.  He is a super nice, genuine guy so I am chalking this up to a biological, human condition. 
Five of us in a skype call playing LOL together. One of my buddies just starts reading off some recent comments from my reddit account all nonchalantly. Will never forget that immense feeling of panic. Now when i post things i have to make sure id be ok with my buddies ragging on me for it haha. 
What happened to the fork?
Nine years? Wow. Better late than never, bud.
I came home from 3 months abroad having left my boyfriend to care for my pets. According to my African Grey parrot there was someone by the name Linda that did "something" very good. She also kept calling people "Fucking Shmuck " and demanding that they get her a beer. She had also master the sound of a gurgling bong and followed it with loud coughing sounds and the occasional "BOOYAH!" Sounded like he had a lot of fun.
Hey I do that too! And I did the exact same thing, telling a girlfriend I loved her while almost asleep. I didn't realize it until the next day when she brought it up in front of her friends. I said I was drunk and didn't mean it. That relationship ended two weeks later. 
I've walked in on my husband watching Gilmore Girls more times than I can count.
It sounds like you might be dating a... basic bitch.
I love this story! So cute! Good for U guys and good that u seem to have a good mother in law lol
You think his mom didn't mediate the whole thing? What if you both think you're keeping secrets but you're not?
Aw that's adorable :) I'm happy for you dawg.     
He's just extra smart... plots within plots within plots.   He knew you'd find out but knew if he kept it anonymous he'd look even better.   Brilliant guy, and a nice one too. 
I highly doubt that he tripped up. Let's dispel with this fiction that SO didn't know know what he's doing. He knew exactly what he was doing
I'd start with breaking up with her. Then go buy yourself a steak. 
That's very sad. :( My aunt and uncle got divorced because my uncle couldn't handle being married. (They were still dating, just no longer in the same house). When talking with the marriage counselor, they realized my uncle actually had severe aspergers the whole time. Once he started getting treated for it, they remarried and are pretty happy together, because now they know what's going on. Hopefully there's hope for you and him, if my aunt and uncle got things to work
Counter-espionage. Nice
> my girlfriend at the time   oh so this is an ex. >Celebrating our 3 year wedding anniversary at the end of next monthoh shit it's not past girlfriend but future wife!
My gf hates when I oversleep on a regular basis, so she plays with my cock when I'm supposed to wake up.Jokes on her, I still oversleep every time.
Sounds like my mother.Not the blowjobs and Philly cheesesteaks but the whole if you don't respond within five minutes you've died in a car crash thing.
Just plan a suprise welcome home party.
How'd you figure that one out?
She likely smiles when you come visit, because you're a good man who brightens her day. Keep it up. 
God I hope that when I die my wife doesn't sell my guns for what I told her I paid for them. 
CatholicNotCatholic
This is amazing. I wonder how long he had been waiting for you to ask just so he could use that line.
I had a crazy ex accuse me of hitting her, which is absolutely untrue. One thing I said that immediately made her stop was that when she says that she minimizes the experience of women who have actually been abused. For some reason that really worked and she never said that again
She might still be telling the truth. I don't want kids and I can't have them anyway.
She's holding for a friend 
hey scott
This sounds like a Scott I know. Is this also a man-child that doesn't pay rent and is always going out to bars to pick up chicks?Also, he shit in your panties?
> shit in my pantiesI hope it's just two commas missing in the sentence, rather than it meaning what it says.
I would have clapped super loud right as he started cumming.No one will ever love me
Scott, how could you unload your load on your sleeping gf? That's fucked up.
Maybe it's just me, but the ejaculating on you while he thought you were asleep sounds creepy as fuck
Going through this right now and I can't find it in me to forgive his friends for the way they treated me. I see you're speaking in past tense, may I ask what happened?
Do you know for a fact the kid is yours?
hey its me ur so
I hope you don't share bank accounts.
Does that mean that as a unit, you're quad?
If you don't break it off now, you'll get complacent and end up marrying her. You'll be married for the most miserable 10 years and she'll get alimony and child support.
Live stream the Breakup Day for us, We'll help you celebrate.
I love how fitting your username is with that comment.
I apparently did something like this. I don't really like cuddling when I'm awake. It's hot and breathing through her hair / my face right next to her neck is uncomfortable. But apprently I used to really cling to her when I was asleep. Weird.
Out of curiosity, why are you getting him something so thoughtful when it seems he's looking for the first opportunity for greener pasture?Obviously a relationship is much more complex than a few words, but yeah.
How dare he
I will be with her, no matter what happens :) Thanks!
The old pretend you never saw it deal. It's a lot better than dealing with people's emotions. 
It's been three years. You can't be married to somebody more than half your life and not be profoundly impacted when they're gone.
The window opens in-wards not out-wards, the router on the shelf blocks the window from opening so she has to move it to the side to open the window.
You're talking to an oak tree rn. I don't move an inch until I'm up for the bathroom 
That won't help, she put a gps tracker on him. No matter where he goes, she'll find him.
he's an international superspy dating his handler. 
Now we play the waiting game
"I've been waiting 40 years to show you this"
He will be.
THE FACELESS MASSES OF REDDIT NOD THEIR SUPPORT
I find this extremely funny.
Clear her head huh wow 
Seriously just run man! 
Not *that* Lumbergh.
This whole inconvenience is why I hunted down and slayed all my girlfriends evil exes. 
she says she threw it in the dumpster, but I just use spoons now just in case
The best is when you *only* buy a plunger. Everyone knows whats waiting for you at home. 
we broke up and i was married to my amazing, genius, beautiful wife within like 18 months.  she pretty much waited for me to get this other bullshit out of my system and then moved in to set things on the right course.  now we have two kids and my life could not be any better.  
wait what? picturing your husband randomly asleep going "OH YEAH" has me dying of laughter
As a guy that hates whatever my GF watches, Gilmore Girls is amazing.
Let's not jump to conclusions, maybe he just likes Blake Lively's legs.
She's amazing. 
Here is a pair of pants on us dawg.
Yup, definitely. Giving is fun, but it's even better if you can see the result of the appreciation. 
Then go get tested...for STD's. Sorry this happened to you.
Omg that's such a good idea! But.... After a year apart, I really want to spend the first day just with her haha 
Her best friend : I bet you can't wait until the 21rst!! Me : why the 21st? Her : Uh..... Shit oh right! Yeah sorry the 26th haha So.... I got suspicious, because she loves surprising me. I decided to invent that after my finals I wanted to maybe go to Amsterdam or some other place  (from the 21st to 25th) with some friends to see her reactions, it was hilarious to see her trying to find excuses and reasons for me not to go. And her parents seem to be avoiding talking about the day she comes back. There's a bunch of other little clues but that's just because I know her do well haha 
great man*
100% should be a bumper sticker if it isn't already
He picked and chose what Catholic rules to follow. He wasn't going to masturbate but beating his SO was cool.
Scotty, my man, wassup?
> Is this also a man-child that doesn't pay rent Yes. lololHe hated going to bars when we were together, but I've broken contact since we broke up, so maybe that's his new thing. 
I know what you did that one time in particular that you don't want me to know but I totally do so.... just come clean.
I wish he were as certain as I am
That's pretty much what he said, too. He gets anxiety attacks and breathing my air (like when someone is face to face and super close) or having my hair in his face made him feel like he couldn't breathe. 
Found out too late. Painting takes time, and I can't back out now. I might just keep it and turn it into a dartboard. I am many things, but wasteful isn't one of them.
My dog gets twice the pets, he's ecstatic. 
Now I'm in love with both of you 
I mean I would climb out the window and damn near fall a floor so I could smoke.... she can't move a router. That's lazy
Sneaking out at 4:30 am to smoke a cigarette before going to school as a 14y/o and getting asked by police why the fuck you're out already was my highlight.
It's sorta cute...then again, imagine your mom going to the strip club and getting dongers slammed in her face.
The one from intertrode
If you can fit your penis into her urethra, you have bigger problems than an ex.
This is why you need to keep a tighter cutlery inventory.
That's why a plunger is my go-to house warming gift.
LA face and Oakland booty 
Don't even trip.
Like a squirting orgasm while she's sitting on your face
Mail her the bill for the test. 
I'm a sleep groper. I've woken up more than once having sex. When I ask, my wife tells me that I was all kinds of making moves on her.
Her friend: She's totally coming home on the 21st! You: It was right about then I began to suspect... 
This is also true of guitars.
Funny to sad in 6.5 seconds:(
Scotty doesn't know
I'm certain I have a nice username too. 
Sounds familiar :) Being the little spoon was better, but by far my favourite was our backs against each other. Easy breathing, feeling her warmth without being sweaty, and feeling really safe, with no-one able to sneak onto us from my behind. Expect for the fact that we were asleep, of course.
I caught my brother once, and was closing the door saying sorry and he was just like "no, it's over now, i can't finish like this." So I awkwardly still came into OUR room, and played counterstrike 1.5 probablyPS we too have never talked about this. Though now that I remembered it, I may have to bring it up someday
And the deodorant cans... so much deodorant 
I'd rather not.
It's why you have a guest cutlery set, and a secret personal set.
Thank god I'm not the only one. It's my wedding gift for young couples as well.Although I do get odd looks when I ask the hardware store to gift wrap it.
Why is she so closely associated with this phrase?
**And so I decided to investigate**
If it helps, I'm doing just fine now. :)
So don't tell scotty
I found him!
He does that, too. He'll scoot over when I go to bed so we are touching butts. He'll face the door and I face the window. But I've woken up with his head resting on top of mine and his legs around me more than once. Edited for autocorrect fail. 
Wait, other people actually do this? Am I being had?
Oh Scotty doesn't know-oh 
Y'all dating each other 
Every fork you've had in your mouth has been a poo scoop
I was beginning to wonder if my ex hand come to Reddit... :D
Whelp. Fuck me, then.
I was diagnosed with aspergers at the age of 11.I feel like I'm part of a play where everyone has the script except me.
You know that time you said something stupid and everyone looked at you like you grew a second head? Imagine feeling like that everytime you talk to someone.  Iama high functioning autist ama
As an autistic person, what's being not autistic like?
While I live a pretty normal life I have a lot of issues with sensory sensitivity. Like loud noises, bright lights, certain food tastes, smells and standing in crowds of people. These things make me feel a bit stressed out resulting in various issues like headaches and digestive problems. While we're on the subject. Certain non-autistic people have the misconception that those of us on the spectrum would "lack empathy". That is simply *not* true. We often have a hard time to "read" people, but we certainly do not lack human empathy. That needed to be said. 
It's really, really lonely. To be desperate to go out and be with people but at the same time have no idea how to interact with them. Left out of every conversation. Completely ignored.The benefits are basically being able to concentrate on anything and really excel at it. Also not falling apart in an emergency, because the emotions of the situation don't really come into play.
My brother is autistic. I can't tell you what it's like from his perspective, but it doesn't take long to figure out that a lot of people have zero sympathy for someone that isn't neurotypical.
I'm with you bacon, I too was diagnosed with aspergers syndrome, well, at age 10. I know exactly where you're coming from. What I've sorta picked up on is that you have to have your own "script" to conquer social encounters. Like somebody asks what's up and I say, Man I'm rockin n rollin! Get brave, accept the fact that you'll fuck up. It's okay to get teased a little as long as you draw a line somewhere. I didn't accomplish my social awkwardness till late in highschool, but it doesn't end. Thing is, you end up being so proud of yourself that you forget your problem being a "problem". 
Now everyone on Reddit thinks they have aspergers.   
A friend of mine explained it to me like "Imagine you're meeting someone new and right out of the gate they dump "I got molested as a child so that's kind of like a duck in cold weather."You'd have a fearful mix of "holy shit wtf do I say now?" but also "wait, what do they actually *mean* by that?". And you get that feeling for almost every conversation, with everyone, forever.I'm not jealous.
Reading through all of the replies, you all express yourself so well & get your idea across very clearly. To me, you all sound very cool, fun & Nice people to have around.But I guess this  goes for everyone, it is so much easier to express ourselves on a keyboard in our comfort zone.
> For lack of a better analogy, I have mental checklists for every social event under the sun.I'm stealing this explanation I've always tried to explain it like computer scripts.
What happens if you are somehow prevented from watching the Simpsons?
When were you diagnosed and what support have you access too. There are therapies which may help with some of the problems you have stated that have helped me.
The therapist who diagnosed me once told me this story about how one of her patients basically thought "Why is everyone so fucking weird?" for about 17 years before he got diagnosed, because he genuinely didn't realize that _he_ might be the odd one. That's me, as well.
I actually think that we have too much empathy. I often times get visibly upset when I feel I hurt someone. 
I'm autistic and was intimidated by the thought of putting it all into words, so I'm thankful that you did. I've grown to fear and hate contact with people because of the stares/bullying. But I'm not afraid of children or small animals. My dog is my only friend.
I am a cubscout leader for 8 year olds here in Utah(and in Utah we have a very high rate of Autism, 1-58 kids are on the spectrum) so I'm trained in dealing with autistic children so that they can be better included into the scouting community, I've had several scouts with Autism including my close friends son. You're description was so in depth, beautiful and warming. Don't be afraid to be who you are as long as that outcome results in happiness. And always continue to educate and make others aware. 
I am much more high functioning than you appear to be (especially in the sensory department, don't have much of those) but the arms flapping, man. Every god damn time. I do it unconsciously even when I'm trying to think about something : just walking in circles and flapping. 
I'm sorry that you feel so lonely in this society. I know about feeling different and struggling to be in crowds or loud places and with sensory overload. We need to make more spaces and have more patience and understanding of people who process the world in a different way. My little cousin has autism and is my favorite person in the world, so reading this made me a little sad because he has so much inside of him that he can't quite articulate/explain. Thank you for sharing so beautifully your story and experience. All the best to you, friend! 
Hey dude, sorry to hear you're lonely. If I met you on the street I'd happily sit down for a chat, you seem like a genuine person, which is rare these days.
I really like you. Sometimes I am busy and can't be on Reddit, but I like to talk about lots of different things. You seem kind-hearted, inquisitive, and observant. If you would ever like to have a conversation about something, or ask questions, or just be a goof, feel free to send me a message.
Thanks for the perspective. How old are you?
You're a freakin' warrior. 
This... wow, this perspective is really interesting. Like... just the way you described it is like having to fill out forms in triplicate to get a body part to do something... I.. holy shit.
My son is 8 with high functioning autism and a lot of what you've described sounds so much like him. I never realized how lonely he might be feeling and now I'm sitting here in tears because of how lonely you are. Feel free to msg me if you ever need to talk to someone or just to just talk about Doctor Who.
You said this very well. It caused a trainwreck of mental issues for me like depression and social anxiety. My biggest problem with autism is communication with other people. I just don't know how to respond and sometimes I stay quiet, forgetting to talk.
How would you say your emotional levels are? Is it true that autistic people can be very emotionally under-developed?Thanks for writing about it. It is really interesting to read and you also sound very intelliegent. You enlightened me, actually. I too thought autistic people who waved their hands around were wierd and "stupid" but thanks to you I now understand there can be a sharp and reasonable mind stuck inside that "half loaded" body.
People who bully someone for being autistic or for anything they have no control over are not only jerks but also very stupid.Keep up the fight :)
>The majority of the time people do not notice my autism. I'm pretty good at faking it.I've read that this is a common trait in women with autism. I'm the same way-- it's pretty easy for me to figure out how to act in a specific scenario. A lot of the autistic men I've met don't believe that I'm autistic for this reason. 
I can tell you that you are not alone.My own main struggles with high functioning spectrum disorder is specifically about the executive functions. I spend hours inside my own head planning out future encounters, answers to emails or planning tasks before I can do them. I'm also lousy at math, but love writing - when I actually get around to it.Not forgetting things are insanely difficult, as is actually initiating activities while they are usually not a problem once I've actually initiated them.
I wish you many smiles and happy thinking :) I am glad I could make you smile. It is hard sometimes and it is scary but there are ways to make life better. Never just go "they have autism they can't do ____" Because sometimes they can and other times they may not be able to say put their socks on, but they can get the socks and ask for help to put them on. Its not the same but its better than just assuming they have no understanding of the socks. Thank you kindly for your response.
I must agree on that :/It's very sad actually to see that despite what science and medecine have discovered & Accomplished, people are still being jerks to others over things they cannot control.
It seems to me that autism diagnosis is really hard to either rule in or out, right? I mean in mild cases how can a psychologist be absolutely sure it's autism?I can understand many of your points or even associate with some of them but to me, the line seems really thin between just personality quirks and a genuine mental condition.
When ever ppl ask me how i am i still want to say somewhere in the middle between great and terrible. They want you to say great
I too am with bacon
I have high functioning aspergers. I hate it when people say "what's up?" I just say "nothing" that sounds depressing but I can't think of something that's happening to say to people on the spot like that. Sucks
I don't know why, but I thought 'bacon' might have been an aspergers tick or something until I realised it was the other guy's username.
b...but it's just a harmless case of social anxiety, r-right?
> And you get that feeling for almost every conversation, with everyone, forever.Thankfully it does get easier by sheer rote learning. Luckily its possible to blag past a lot of this by memorising how common situations work even if one doesn't know why.
The Internet has been one of the best things ever for autistic people. It is so much easier to communicate through text devoid of all the body language and vocal tones... 
There's also a lot of us that have no idea how to explain what it's like so we just read through everybody else's explanations and upvote the ones that make sense.
You also have to consider that people that are severely impacted are unlikely to be answering this. So you're probably getting a skewed perception because most of the people answering here are very high functioning and therefore somewhat eloquent and capable of giving detailed answers.But there are many low functioning people with autism who wouldn't be able to reply to you because their communication skills are almost entirely non-existent.
I think computer scripts is a much better analogy. Actually both of them together, but it's a lot of reminding yourself "if this then that"
I was diagnosed about 15 years ago I think as a young child. I did get some help in primary school so up to 11 but after that  virtually nothing. I have been getting help for Anxiety and at the moment I want to get that well and truly sorted as I know how dangerous that can getThanks for the advice, you're too kind!
I should probably see a therapist, then. I recognise myself in more than a few of the answers given in this thread. This one in particular triggered a few slighlty uncomfortable emotions.
Me too. I dont have the social problems that most autistic people have as mine is extremely mild, but I never understood social conventions and why people behave a certain way until i was diagnosed. 
>,I feel like in conversations, especially as I get older, I can intuit what will make the other person feel the most comfortable and/or interested. This isn't taxing, and it is honestly fun.Speaking as an autist...What.This sentence is absolutely _alien_ to me. It's like saying "Imagine you could eat a house for breakfast and then wear it to work."
I personally go through: be a dumbass -> laugh it off -> remembers how much of a dumbass I was while taking a shower/jogging/lying on my bad -> get super embarrassed -> fuck it
I have huge trouble telling someone they've made a mistake. I've let people go calling me by the wrong name, or I change the subject in conversation, because the idea of making someone feel bad for making an error is intolerable. That one's a bugger to get around. It was worse as a teenager, I was once frozen to the spot for 3 minutes outside a teacher's door because knocking would interrupt them. Never mind that I had to see them and that they were expecting it, it might slightly inconvenience them and it would be my fault. I'm glad that stage is mostly over with.
Yeah, autistic hyperempathy's a common thing statistically. I've heard from a lot of people with it, & it's the one disability thing I am honestly really, really glad to not have to deal with. Not anymore, anyway. People with it have my respect.
I have a cat, she is my friend too. She is very friendly. I was afraid of contact too but I was able to gain a volunteer to take me to library and through that I have become a bit more able with contact. If there is an organisation with you nearby, they may have a volunteer program it may help. Things are much better now I am older than when I was younger. Maybe you can try once again one day soon? :) Happy thinking to you. Best smiles.
Thank you kindly for your nice words :) I like to help people and if this can help then I help. Its very different from my usual lego reddit postings :)
Hello, I am glad you feel lucky sometimes. That is a nice feeling. I was also very distressed by crying and screaming babies. However I have changed how I am now. Sometimes it is hard.But other times I feel okay if I can ask the parents questions. "Why is the baby crying" "will it be okay" I love babies but it can be hard to understand some sounds they make and express.I am sorry your best friend is misleading, that is sad. I am glad my friends are not misleading.
I walk in circles a lot too. My flapping is only when I am really happy and excited. Hehe when I got gilded in this I got excited and my arms went everywhere and I giggles. I guess happy feelings make that happen. And excited.
:) I am very bad at messaging people first, they often have to message me. I love messages. Thank you kindly for your kind words.
28.
Sorry I do not understand this comment :) Can you explain.
I hope this is a good thing. I am unsure by your post.
Usually I just kind of find something else and drift away from that. I'll revisit it from time to time but I generally don't regain the interest on the same level. 
Come to Europe, where I had better days is an acceptable answer
You just described that perfectly. My current girlfriend didn't realise that I have high functioning autism - partly because it's not severe, but also because basically all of the interactions with her have been ones that I've been through many, many times and I roughly know how I'm meant to react, even if sometimes I don't know *why* I need to react that way. it's a huge help but also a hindrance because some people just refuse to believe me until they spend more than a few minutes at at time with me.
That and you have time to think through what you want to say. Or at least that's the case with me as an aspie. It's not weird on the internet if it takes 2-3 minutes to respond to a tweet or comment, but it's definitely weird if you do that in real life.
It's more accurate sure but most people don't understand computer scripts either...
Reading this thread, I'm starting to wonder if I'm autistic.
A lot has changed in 15 years with therapy, I am 28. Therapy now is much different to when I was younger. Even just 10 years ago. Much has changed. I wish you many smiles and happy thinking. Just if you want to change, there maybe a way you can get help and not have to do it alone.
Just remember that no matter what the doctor tells you, you're the same person you've always been - you just may have a name to some of your behaviors. 
Maybe it's time for me to go see someone...
hahaha, brilliant. As someone who's not autistic, but is an introvert, that sentence reads this way to me..."Imagine you could eat a burrito for breakfast and then wear it to work."
> remembers how much of a dumbass I was while taking a shower/jogging/lying on my bad Brain: "So yeah, remember that thing that you did years ago that nobody cared about? That was fucking embarassing, eh? Let us think about it for much longer than is necessary now!"
I've always thought I might be on the Asperger's spectrum but this thread feels like it's confirming it for me. I have so many of these idiosyncrasies and I feel like they  really have held me back from being as successful as I could have been.This topic is a bit of a mind blown moment for me.
TIL I might be on the spectrum. 
Wow, I had never heard of hyperempathy before. My son is autistic and can't watch movies because he gets too stressed and upset whenever something bad happens. We can't watch Peppa Pig because her brother George cries a lot and it drives him crazy. 
Can you be hypertensive but not be autistic?
That's interesting. My dad's Italian and I remember as a kid when I first saw footage of Iraqis in street markets haggling by arguing and yelling really loudly at each other in ways I can only imagine most Westerners would have perceived as really aggressive, all I could think about was how much they reminded me of my Italian family.
This is exactly it. Former employee was on the spectrum. As soon as he was aware that everyone else lacked the context that existed in his head, workplace interactions smoothed over dramatically. 
My son's like that.  He assumes everyone has the same knowledge about video games\memes and will start talking to people about these topics and often will lead to people being baffled.  
Oh man change could be so hard. When I was younger I hated it when my parents would redecorate the living room. Took me weeks to get used to and accept it as the new normal.I  have become more flexible with my planning. I still like using checklists for days and making precise plans with friends but if a change needs to be made I can handle it usually. It all depends  on how "full" my head is at that time and how immediate it switches. A calm mind and some time is what I need to process it and change the schedule as the new normal.
Not autistic as far as I know, but damn if I don't touch *everything* that looks like it has a cool texture, would join you if I could. You do you and fuck everyone else.I wish you all the best.
My thing is complicated by CSA and three rapes and the resulting ptsd. I'm getting treatment and hopefully will become desensitised enough to finally take my dog out for walks. That's my only goal so far. I'm still too scared to think about interacting with humans face to face. Even this reddit thing is giving me heart palpitations so I'm probably going to stop fairly soon. Thank you for the happy thinking :)
I wish we could nominate you to mod an autism related subreddit.I wish I could pay you to help me better understand my kids and be a better mom.
Babies can be hard to understand, even for their parents.  When my daughter was younger, it helped me to remember that crying was her trying to communicate something.  Usually that she was hungry, or needed her diaper changed, or was having gas pains. Sometimes she just wanted someone to hold her.
Glad I could make you happy :)
I haven't been diagnosed with autism but I absolutely understand the hand flapping. I do it when I'm really happy or excited; it's like the happiness is electricity and I have to channel it through my hands to process it properly. 
>I got excited my arms went everywhere and I giggles.You should put this on a T-Shirt. You'd make millions. 
Thank you for that, I'm going to remember this and use it for the future! :)
You seem like an incredibly nice and genuine person. It's amazing to me that you are so positive. I am going to be more positive today and try to pass along the happy smiles and happy thinking!
All of your responses are so well thought out and insightful. Thank you for sharing your stories; you make me want to be a better person. <3
Just like me, heh.
I think he's trying to say that you're a strong fighter & You should be proud of yourself.I agree with him :)
Your description of autism gave me clearer understanding of what it's like. It sounds like your day-to-day life can be a battle sometimes. 
I think he found your post enlightening to the point where he is having a hard time processing the difficulty/challenges you experience.  I always think learning is a good thing.
It's a good thing. Your perspective on your condition is very helpful to those who don't know much about autism. Many think that you aren't aware of your surroundings when it turns out you are *too* aware sometimes. It sounds like you have some good outlets to pursue which is very important. Best of luck to you.
It's an acceptable answer everywhere.  Lots of folks just don't want to dive any deeper.
TIL Europe is autistic. 
I worked in a Northeast USA town for five years and every single day when I asked this old guy "how are you today" he would always say "I was better 40 years ago" in such a distinctly sad droll tone and I get kind of awkward because I had no idea how to respond to that 
I'm coming up on 40 years old in a few months.  I feel like I have learned enough of those things, that I can now pass for completely normal.  I've got a wife, I got a place, I keep my bills paid, I haven't had to move in over 4 years which is a new record for me.  At worst, people think of me as an under achiever.  Nobody has any ideas.  It can be done, but it does take time.  A lot of time. 
For me, i just want to be treated with dignity, patience, and respect. Be aware that I'm probably agonizing over your social cues that i may or may not be interpreting correctly or even noticing.
For most people it's social cues that are the most difficult to notice. Making everything just a bit more explicit in terms of meaning goes a long ways 
I don't know if this is common for aspies, but I definitely am someone who can be incredibly articulate and intelligent if given time to form a statement. In public social situations I usually just say what comes to mind, because in the time it would take to formulate an articulate statement the conversation has already moved on. On the internet or through text I have time to think about these things 
I mean I think they get the basic if this then this. If they don't you could say "logic trees"
I think most people understand basic Boolean logic, even if they don't know what it is necessarily. 
Thank you so much, I wish you many good times as well 
Somehow this is really comforting. Thank you so much :)
Where it gets real fun is that Introversion/extroversion aren't binary. I'm a natural introvert with an extroverted personality so hanging out with friends is a lot like hiking up a mountain; it's fun but when it's over I am *spent.*
Being an introvert doesn't make you socially inept, you know. I'm tired of seeing this implication. I'm certainly an introvert but yet I serve tables which involves talking to strangers all day, which I dislike. Go figure. 
You described it rather perfect. I'm definitely not an extreme introvert or extrovert, but I'm introverted enough to realize midway through a conversation that I have no idea what I'm doing and am trying to figure out a way to leave now. It happen constantly an I kinda wish I was better at talking to people so maybe I'd have more friends.
You might try to soften your criticism with "I don't mean to be critical but I noticed..." and end it with "... I just thought you'd like to know."Even give a compliment after like "And I really appreciate that you..." 
I share the majority of these symptoms (hyperempathy, fear of doing something wrong, "outlandish" social behavior, etc.) and have been diagnosed with a personality and stress disorder. I would definitely seek help if it's something that really affects your daily life.
Sure, when you eat too much salt.
I have to say I'm so glad I don't have to shop for my groceries like that. I hate going to the supermarket enough without having it full of people shouting and arguing over every price. I'd pay double (probably do!) to avoid all that hecticness.
Asymmetrical perspective is the corner stone of the human condition.
How did he become aware?
Just wanted add a little something to this. My kids are like this but are not autistic. They assume because all their friends know all the memes, then everyone must know the meme and the meaning behind that meme. Reddit is like that too.
Non-autistic teenagers can be like that too
I did not like change when younger! It would have been impossible so many things I do now. Small steps!
Sometimes people just like to touch everything really cool. You know when I was younger I was told, never swear. Swearing is bad. So I have only said two curse words in my life. So seeing someone able to curse like you just did, in my head your like a super rough good guy in a movie, like John Mcclain from Die Hard :) ! Keep being awesome!
I am unsure what CSA means but I am sorry for these things happening to you. But it sounds like things maybe not related to just having autism but by things that autism has made worse that have happened to you.I think you are brave and strong. If reddit is making you uneasy it is okay to not use reddit. :)
:) I ma a moderator of /r/lego I like that. I gave some communications in real life before on autism. I hope you can be the best mom you wish to be and that you feel you are doing a good job. Trying to understand your children is the first step to being a kind parent!
Hmmmm based on your username I'd think you'd be gilding everyone, not just a few individuals...
I don't really understand :)
:) Thank you kindly for putting value in my words, they would just be words if you didn't like them. Now they are liked words :) Its an upgrade like in a video game.
:) I am a girl but thank you kindly.
:) Thank you kindly. I am not sure if a strong fighter. But I try to be brave.
Yes, difficult. But! Also joy.     I was sick recently. My 8 year old friend and her mother took me to the doctor. Afterwards when back at my home, she put a blanket on me and kissed my cheek to help me get better faster. I think that was a joy, even though being sick was hard. It is like that, there are some bad things and then good things and so not all of it is hard, just some. Like dressing I need help to do, but patting my cat I can do myself. Typing on the computer I can do, but tidying my house is hard because I am unsure what is useful and what goes where. A mix.
Reddit is austistic is the correct answer. Place where you can take all the time in the world to reply or simply not.
Congratulations. I am nearly the same age and in a similar position. Everything is so much easier now that I've learned how to cope with my limitations. To the outsider it looks like underachieving, but every day of peace and happiness is an achievement for me.
I want to think I treat everyone with dignity, patience, and respect. But apparently I don't sometimes. What do people do that make you feel that way?
And now we've literally got a bunch of autists sitting around breaking down the options of how to address this specific hypothetical social situation.Been there many times myself, friends.
You assume too much. 
The ol' shit sandwich! Compliment-Critique-Compliment 
I don't mean to be critical but I noticed this would take quite some time and I couldn't help noticing it's also a bit dishonest to say you don't mean to be critical when you do. Not attacking you, just thought you'd like to know. And I realy appreciate you sharing your views.Something like this?
Never change, Reddit.
I feel like because of this, the average Westerner is TERRIBLE at negotiation. Like, if you were from Asia, Africa, the Middle East or Latin America, difficult negotiations are just a part of life. My friend from Kenya managed to get a Sony store employee to sell him the DISPLAY TELEVISION THEY USED IN THE STORE for 50% the asking price. It was dope.
Reddit is definitely on the spectrum.
Thats awesome that you get to have some of the things you like cross over like that. Thats also awesome that you can juggle several different things you like at once! Good luck with your adventures! 
I hope we get to someday read your stories. You write beautifully. Thank you for your words
You sound like you really got the hang of managing your autism man.
When you say "Write" do you mean fiction or a diary or what exactly?
it got a lot better already luckily :) And I also learned to recognize when I am opposed to something just because it's different and my autism has difficulty handling it, I manage to take a step back and re evaluate.
Touching cool stuff is cool be it a wall, a leaf, a strangers awesome hair (ok maybe not this last one) totally with you on that.Only two?! That's commendable, no idea how you managed.I'm a tiny mid-20's woman with the mouth of a sailor, it's fun and apparently makes me sound like John Mcclain, which is fantastic.  Yes I will and you keep being your damn awesome self too, you brave, unusual soup.
child sexual assault. Autism is definitely complicating the PTSD and its treatment, and as I'm a female with autism that means there's less knowledge/awareness of how it manifests vs how it typically does with males. 
> I don't really understand :)It is adorable.There should be a subreddit just with quotes like that. 
Oh my god, I've been reading your messages now, and this one made me laugh and cry at the same time. I never made that connection before! 
I really enjoy reading your posts, you have a very unique way of putting words together to convey your thoughts. It puts a smile on my face. It's really great that the Internet makes it possible for you to give a person a smile from a million miles away. Pat your cat from me, will you?
This comment made me smile. It's an interesting and fun way to look at words. I have really enjoyed reading your comments and conversations in this thread. You are a great communicator on here and your personality shines through what you type in a nice and thoughtful way which is awesome. I think you are a very fun and kind person. Thank you for sharing your experiences and insights with us. They have been informative and enlightening while also being very entertaining to read. I hope you have many happy adventures that make you smile like reading your comments made me smile today! :) 
Grill can be warrior too
........................................That is correct
Hahahaha. I wish I could meet you all IRL so we could have hours of these pointless arguments. I love it but no one else will entertain it
100% sounds like social anxiety not autism. I think you're good. Minus the crippling social anxiety of course :/One thing I found helpful in dealing with mine is to actually force myself into situations where I have to speak to people. Socialisation needs to be practised.  
> I feel like because of this, the average Westerner is TERRIBLE at negotiation. Like, if you were from Asia, Africa, the Middle East or Latin America, difficult negotiations are just a part of life. Yeah, it's true. In my business, I save myself the difficult part by simply naming a rate and making it clear that there's no room to move. If they ask for 10-20% less, I can agree, otherwise get fucked.It's not because I don't want to negotiate, it's simply because I can't. People seem to like being told "this is the price, or fuck off" anyway, so it works.
I always buy my electronics off the display shelf. Usually around the super bowl. Has nothing to do with him being from Kenya, just a smart life hack. The store doesn't want to pay an invoice tax for that model anyway so they could theoretically give it to you and save money. Ps: typically you won't get a warranty but who cares, my 55 inch Samsung for $799 cost me $349. Best Buy is the best place to do this. 
Hey. At least we are high functioning, unlike 4chan.
I have a published children's book :) I love to write.
I am a girl :) I do not know if I manage it, but more, others help me manage. When the support is in place lots can happen. I hope this makes sense. Like before I could talk people had to guess my needs. With therapy and support and care I became able to talk. With talking I was able to express my needs, then they were able to take that further and help me better myself more. Independence as much as possible is the goal for anyone with any disability.
I write poetry, stories, mostly for Children, sometimes just what I am feeling or finding hard. I have one published childrens book available on Amazon.
:) Thank you for kind words, You keep being awesome action hero too!
Maybe you can make one, I am not sure what quotes you mean but it is good you are happy.
I patted her for you. She likes rubbing her head on things. So I also let her rub her head on my hand for you too!
I've seen comments, know i had a good reply, and still waited ~30 min To think it over.....
This. I get social anxiety and I look like a weirdo(when talking, been told I'm physically attractive). What I started to do was forcing myself to be more talkative in class, whether if it's around my classmates or I started asking more questions to the professor so the spotlight is on me-forcing myself to continue being coherent with the professor and to learn to be confident in my own voice.That and I'm 27 at a community college. So maybe I'm giving less fucks?
4chan is very high functioning when they want to be. 4chan needs to be challenged though, else it sits there in the dark jerking itself off. At least when we jerk off the lights are on and we have some decent materiel to fap to. 
That's wonderful! Please keep it up :)
I've always been curious when I see someone able to type so well but had/has difficulties with speaking - would you mind elaborating on your experience with the two? Were you fine with writing/typing even at the time when you could not speak? Or did both abilities kind of evolve together? 
You are so inspiring to me right now.
You're awesome! It's really made my day reading your comments, you seem lovely. I've really liked learning about you! Good luck with your adventures and your writing! Feel free to message me if you ever want another friend!! :) 
When you wrote that your arms went everywhere and you giggled, it was a perfect description of experiencing joy.  I think almost everyone who read that ended up smiling, because for a moment they could feel a little how you felt.
Thanks, I'm glad! Sometimes I watch my grandmothers cat for her, his name is Mio. He also likes rubbing his head on things. He is very skittish and afraid of new people, but if you're gentle and give him time he really warms up to you. We also have a cat in our house whose name is Panter, the Norwegian word for panther. He is more feral and only allows you to pet him if he comes to you - if you reach out to him, he will avoid your hand. He's a bit of a jerk, but when he feels like it he's very cuddly as well :)
Do you have a PayPal account? I would like to contribute to your TV fund. If you or your parents or someone who helps you has a post office box I could send it to you that way. 
You sound awesome! Baby smiles are an excellent way to lift your mood!
27 at a community college....thank you for your service. I'm 22 and the thought of being around 18 year olds scares the fuck out of me 
I sent a message with the place to see my book :)
I am fascinated by something similar. /u/UnusualSoup, you can elaborate your thoughts eloquently on complex subjects (and better than most) but when you saw a small cut on your leg, you weren't able to determine that it was fine--you needed to ask a neighbor. Where is the disconnect happening?
You have wonderful adventures too! And you find lots of smiles ! :)!
I understand, but I meant it depends on who you are dealing with. My GP has no experience with girls with autism but she is kind and tries. Since working with me she now has more awareness, BUT my support worker has experience with females with autism. So her knowledge is very high. Although under diagnosed, it just means more people need the training. But it doesn't mean everyone. I am sorry I am thinking very literal.
Yes! And they let you stare at them and never get angry about it!
Tea time would have a whole new meaning 
Women would ride down the street on their bikes and give off that Doppler effect. weeeeeEEEEEE-OOOOOOOOooooooo. 
Panties would be heavily padded I imagine. 
There would be no discernible recordings of Elvis or The Beatles performing live.
Men would probably be way less embarrassed by random visible boners
Divorce rates skyrocket
girls would be whistling at guys instead.
This library would not be nearly as quiet as I want it to be
if this happened..Would a teapot sound like a vagina?
I'm imagining cute little earmuffs that girls could wear on our vaginas to keep our whistles discreet when out in public. The muff muffs.
Mulan probably would have been found out *way* quicker than previously.
Teen magazines (and also women's magazines in general, but especially teen magazines) would feature countless articles about the ideal tone of the whistle that your genitals should emit, about how yours is inferior and gross, and about how you should try <insert outlandish, expensive, and almost certainly harmful "cure" here> in order to remedy to this flaw. 
It would certainly have taken a lot more work for me to stay closeted as a lesbian...
I'd be known as "the silencer".
WHAT WAS THE QUESTION?  SORRY, I CAN'T HEAR YOU FOR ALL THE DAMNED WHISTLING OVER HERE!
I'd annoy the hell out of everyone by being noisy for more than half of the day. 
One Direction concerts would sound even more shrill and high-pitched than usual.
We'd hear a lot of women fake coughing. 
I'd open a strip club called the steam whistle
This is relevant to my interests. 
No longer would awkward boners be the worst thing. Now vaginas would have that, because at least you can try to hide an awkward boner, but hearing a whistle would signal EVERYONE around you about what's going on. Also seeing if someone is into you would be a lot easier.
Life would be hard. I'm easily aroused. 
Well if you put a saxophone down there you can turn your masturbation session into a jazz ensemble. 
There's an awful rape whistle joke somewhere in this...
A lot of men would believe they are deaf
Channing Tatum would be out of a job.
Archer would have to seriously question whether he had tinnitus or just dropping more panties
A theater showing 50 Shades of Gray would sound like a giant flock of rabid owls.
All girls schools would suddenly become very popularAnd bars would suddenly become much much quieter venues
I dunno but I'm paging /u/pussywhistle for comment
My wife would continue to be silent in the bedroom
Noise. Noise everywhere.
First, this concept is hilarious. Second, there would probably be far stricter dress codes for the boys in schools. Can you imagine how distracting that would be in class. Not to mention embarrassing. Every guy in the room simultaneously looks back at you with desperate hope that it's them turning you on. Also, imagine the attractive substitute teacher walking in and all the girls going off at once. baha. I love this idea. 
If we're going there, then that means in this same world anytime a man gets an erection the "BOOOOINNNNNGGGGG" sound effect plays.
The vaginas I have met must be dog whistles
Everywhere except England. There it's still tea time. 
Except it would be raspberried by the bike seat.  "ppppppppffffffffFFFFFFFFTTTTTTtttttttrr"
My first thought. Let's muffle that shit. 
It's already really weird to watch a live recording of the beatles. Why go to a fucking concert if all you're gonna do is shriek? 
It sounds like her 3rd overtone is ringing at a tritone above the fundamental.  I bet she has herpes! 
Goddam hussy sounds like a clarinet!
Here's the catch, in this world when a man gets aroused his dick begins singing, "Hello my baby, hello my honey, hello my ragtime gal."
"Mom, for the love of God, can you take the tea off"
But porn would be more honest: "You gotta make me whistle, William!"
Yup."I'm just on the phone with a friend."turns into "I'm just on the phone with a friend...[whom I'm clearing fucking or wish to fuck]"
"You used to whistle when I took off my shirt.  Now I can literally stop you from whistling by taking it off.   Getting old sucks."
What on earth are you doing at your local library?
Sound proof area for romance novels. 
Yes as the tea pot was invented after?
Poor guy.. I want to laugh, but this is honestly too sad..
It is like women who have never heard a penis make the "boing" sound. Sad! 
I mean, it's even in our rap music, cemented for listening by the future generations, quote B.O.B.:>"I shine bright, I'll give your girl a slight tanI make that pussy whistle like the Old Spice man."Clearly a reference to the obvious sexuality of Isaiah Mustafah. Classic. 
There's an alternative universe where this happens. There's a Reddit thread in that universe asking how life would change if vaginas bled every month. It's heavily downvoted and everyone thinks the guy who posted it is really weird. 
... kitten mittons?
Would give a whole new meaning to the song, "Give a little whistle" from Pinnochio
So something like:* 10 things that your whistle says about you. * Are you a C sharp or B flat? Find out what your whistle means!* Whistle while you work, how to be productive and seductive. * G Spot to G major, everything you want to know but too shy to ask. 
Now I am imagining someone's vagina sounding like a foghorn.
It would suck to be the guy who women make a descending slide whistle sound around. 
Sorry about that.Your mother is a foghorn.
Is safe for work

Now he has the lobes for it! 
Oh joy. Thousands of screaming 13 year old girls with whistling pussies. 
Trust me, there would be zero whistling at strip clubs.
4 years... seems legit
/r/beetlejuicing 
HOWHOW DO THINGS LIKE THIS HAPPEN
*carless whisper plays*
#JUST BECAUSE IT'S TEA TIME DOESN'T MEAN IT'S D TIME. 
"Phthpthpthhhh"...
Am I the only one who thinks he kind of looks like a tater tot?I don't see the appeal...
The lesbians wouldn't like it
I think I owe you a beer or two dude, haha. 
That's just Western culture, though. I want to believe there'd be places where whistling vaginas are celebrated or manage to advance technology. Maybe that culture would be the one that imposes colonialism.oh god what am i doing i'm getting way too into this
Excellent work at theorizing alternate timelines, however I think you started the divergence from the main line too late. Go back much further to the earliest days of civilization, and see what societies would do.I suspect the answer would be a dramatically different, or completely reduced, form of puritism. Possibly the exact opposite of the extant power dynamics. A look at species which exhibit female-based mating competitiveness might show a glimpse of the social structures that would form.
This was well though out and I enjoyed reading it. Thank you. 
Or, alternate interpretation.  Far more men become obsessed with the sound of whistling steam because it's the sound of good times.  Instead of just a curiosity, when the Aeolipile is discovered, a great deal of effort is put into refining it.  Eventually they develop new uses for steam our civilization never thought of, finding steam powered ways to accomplish things we use electricity for...leading to a world that could be best described as steampunk.
 > All the girls going off at once I just had an image of a harmony of whistles interjected with frantic leg-crossing
English women would have it made.  Just like men blame farts on the dog women could blame their audible arousals on the kettle.
Word of the day: Raspberried
Muffle the muff! 
Even the Beatles was pissed off in the end because they could not even hear themselves play.
This is why I'm baffled by people who prefer the live recordings of songs.
I love watching the videos of the ~~fan's~~ fans' faces. The ones who just stare wistfully at The Beatles with tears streaming down their face make me laugh every time. Do wish the rest of 'em had shut up though 
I have no idea what this means but it sounds fancy
"oh no it's just my TOTTALY CONVENIENT TEAPOD THAT I CARRY AROUND AT ALL TIMES, SORRY GUYS"
>If a chick's vag is singing, there's no covering that up.r/nocontext
"It's actually an optical illusion, it's the pattern on the pant's that it's not flattering in the crotchal region."
I called my buddy's bluff on this once (for some reason) and ended up grabbing his boner.
Send me a kiss by wire, baby my dick's on fire.
Man: Doctor, my dick sings when I get a boner!Doc: Prove it.Dick: ribbit
"The kettle isn't on, dear""Then wha- *oh my fucking god mom*"
No one has invented a clever solution for hiding boners, I bet girls would have this whistling sorted out in a couple days so that no one could detect it. 
Not really, you could just add the sound in post.
"WHY DO YOU WHISTLE EVERYTIME YOU SEE THE MAILMAN??"
also its a law school library so everyone here is too busy for sex anyway so I really don't think it takes too much to set these people off
Used to work in a college library, the CCTV footage we got..... People think it's quiet in the study rooms or round the back of the periodicals.
Every time someone opens the door you just hear *whistling*
I've been doing it wrong this whole time. 
Isn't it more like a "sproing"?...right?
Or Drake:> She call me the referee cause I be so official> My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle> Like the Andy Griffith theme song
That would require a lot of talent. In fact maybe people would put on sex shows and perform symphonies like this, it'd be a whole new art form.
Are the tubas the sexfarts?
What kind of Sex are you having?
I'm sure they are used to hearing your wife laugh when you're bpth in the bedroom.I'm sorry that was needlessly rude and I feel really bad and I love you
Somebody should hire you
Too clever to not give gold for.  Enjoy
The infamous and gross "like a hotdog down a hallway" would change to "like a barge in the fog."
I would just carry a whistle around at all times, hiding in the shadows next to a busy street, blowing it at random times during the day
Imagine the sound of 600 slide-whistle orchestras all competing to play *Flight of the Bumblebee* at 350BPM.
It'd sound like some South American rainforest. I just wonder what sound a father that got dragged to that concert would make as he contemplates suicide.
r/NoContext
> 13 year old girls with whistling pussiesYep.  You're on the government watch list now, buddo 
/r/betelgeusing
I have to assume that someone makes an account, and then frequently uses Reddit over the course of four years. Eventually, out of the millions of threads posted, one of them is relevant to their username.
u dont like tater tots?
Agreed that I just focused on Western culture, and very specifically American history (which is my specialty). I can't really state what would happen elsewhere.However I'd be curious to hear what culture you think whistling vaginas would lead to advanced technology?((we're all in way too deep but if we pretend it's normal maybe no one will judge us))
But most English people have electric kettles that don't whistle when boiled.
It's actually not that common in the UK to use whistling kettles, that's much more common in the US. Source, am English, live in the US
Imagine feminism in the 60's.WE MUST LET OUR VAGINA'S BE HEARD!SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
They basically didn't do live shows for the second half of their career.
Not sure if it'll help, but an overtone is a musical note that is part of a harmonic series above the fundamental note (the note that is being played) and can be heard with the fundamental note simultaneously. A tritone is another name for an augmented 4th interval. Generally, this tone is dissonant (unpleasant) and sounds wrong/bad to the ear
I KEEP IT IN MY CROTCH SO THE TEA STAYS WARM
Bluff or not that was never going to end well.
Yeah, I'd see a doctor about that if I were you.
*walks off in disgust**slips**breaks arms*"Shit."
Flex the muscles in your legs continuously for about a minute. Your blood flow will be redirected from your penis to your legs.
Tuck it into your waistband, idiot
Oh, that would be a new job after the automation sets through; pussywhistling post production manager!
Because it's hotmail
HA!  Several years ago before the bar exam some students decided to, er, blow off some steam one evening in the law library where I work.  They left the used condom in the trash can.  These are grown folks with apartments.  Go home to do that or ask for a Clorox wipe to clean off the table when you're done.
You have to blow in it first.
What about the Bernstein bears.
Oh I can guarantee people would make something out of it. Not sure it would necessarily be art, though...
Queef is the word you are looking for.
Yeah, and someone shit around 0:40
It's ok, sometimes she does laugh because we fall out of bed or the cat is meowing at the door like his tail is on fire, or I steal her underwear and try to make off with them. It's a great thing when you don't have to be so serious all the time. Someday, the kids will finally decode all the stealth grown-up stuff that goes on in this house and they're going to be sooooo mortified.
Someone probably already did, hence being able to pay for internet access and a computer.
"So horny right nHHHWWAAAAAAAAAMP!"
Just hold on for you life! Hold on to your... Gonads and strife!
You could really confuse some people by blowing that whistle in a room full of dudes
I already was on all of them.
MY BRAIN... TREMBLES!!!
I like tater tots but I don't want to fuck a tater tot.
Not in the whistleverse they don't. 
Hilarity aside, the flaw in this logic is that these women must be aroused to do so.  So either feminism, or rebellion, gets them off - or they're basically a rolling orgy to keep it whistlin'.
Yeah, and they mentioned that the reason was the screaming women.
Damn, I should have paid more attention in sex ed. 
I'd like to add that this interval is often called the devil's interval, because of it's dissonant sound and therefore has been a key influence in the development of heavy metal music. For example, listen to the intro of Black Sabbath by Black Sabbath. The interval between the first two notes/chords is a tritone.
Some countries with the crazy religious beliefs still cut the whistle valve from the vaginas.
I AM SHOUTING TO COVER UP THE SOUND OF MY TEAPOD
This tea tastes yeasty.
I've heard that gonorrhea can set a dick on fire.

This changed my life the first time I heard about it, straight up kills your boner in 30-60 seconds flat. If someone is asking you to stand up you can almost always stall for 30 seconds.
I tuck mine into my sock. Really awkward on hot summer days when I am not wearing socks. Or pants.
Or just lump it in with the guy editing the videos
There's the door, get the fuck out
Maybe. If you are lucky
So what you're saying is mayonnaise **is** an instrument 
But not *too* hard.  You don't want to give "said female" an air embolism.
Public service announcement: never blow air into a vagina. It can cause serious injury. 
They were written by Nelson Mandela between shoots of Shazam.
You mean the Berenstain bears? Yeah, everybody I know remembers it as Bernstein bears as well. 
What if they're 13? Or on library wifi on a library computer?
Inception is now arousing.
Gonads and strife,  Gonads and strife,  Gonads and strife.
You can't just assume none of them have vaginas.

So slothful 
I'm imagining a "whistleverse" movie franchise, like the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
I think a rolling orgy protest sounds good for all involved 
Hooooooooooooly shit. I just laughed so hard I woke my daughter up. 
Screaming and, their later music was too hard to recreate live- a big point.
That's an evil chuckle.
WHY ARE WE CALLING IT A TEAPOD NOW?????
You mean... Yeastea.. 
[autistic whistling]
So I guess you could say your penis is...    Jacked
"SIR, I SAID STEP OUT OF THE VEHICLE RIGHT NOW"Almost there..... Hold on just a few more seconds, officer!
Alternatively you could just hoist it around your neck. Like a cute scarf
*Male enhancement companies HATE HIM*
I've only ever been able to make it sound like I'm masturbating.
Additionally if you blow to hard into a vagina you risk that the airflow goes around the bend to the anus and blows out fecal matter.
People need to learn it's only a penis you blow air into. It's called a *blow* job for a reason
Bounced on my boy's vuvuzela to that show for years and years before I looked down and realized it was Nelson Mandela, fresh out of prison and ready to die in 1991
He's not. I creeped his profile. Lives in Vancouver,does marketing or computers. Rooms with a doctor who doesn't understand fish.
Actually you can assume whatever the fuck you want. That's the great thing about assumptions. *Assertions* on the other hand are a different story. And so are *insertions* but we won't get into that.
r/notathing, for both of those.
Can confirm. He's on ALL of them. 
"Rolling Orgy Protest" makes for a great band name though.
Now for some reason my teapot's going off?
If they'd tried it just 25 years later it would've been super easy. Just have George Martin behind them with a set of turntables and a mixer, and have the Fab Four wear Adidas and big gold dookie ropes.
No no no, the chuckle is the part between the anus and the testes.
That's just Nestea.

I want to sit in the corner drinking tea and listen to you talk about music.
It's a good and bad thing. If the girls would've shut up to the point where the Beatles could've tolerated it, they might have progressed in the studio at a slower speed, but still would've gone down some wild avenues.If they kept touring, they might have lasted longer as a band too. But it's all conjecture. 
They tried it, but two of them died because they used George RR Martin
I feel like I'm gonna have an epileptic fit from so many different memes flashing by so quickly.

It's like the Porygon episode with memes!

I question your authority on the matter.
There was a post about a guy wanting to try heroin "just once." If you go through his post history, you can see him go down the spirals of addiction. 
I think it was /r/offmychest, but it might have been /r/confession. A mom posted about how she'd fantasized for years about spit-roasting her son and eating him- and how she eventually planned to tell him all about this when he was of age. Because apparently, being 18 makes the idea a whole lot more reasonable?
There was an askreddit post about what is your deepest darkest secret that would ruin you if it ever got out. Someones response was coordinates. What was at those coordinates? A corpse. 
Not too long ago a guy posted on r/relationships that he was born without an arm, the problem was that he then found pictures of him when he was a baby and had both arms at his parents house, I don't remember how did that end up 
Someone posted a confession about how they pee in their sink because they're tall and it's easier. Given a few days half of Reddit was pissing in their own sinks and posting about it.
No one talks (or knows?) about how the /r/AMA and  /r/iama subreddits was stolen from the person who created them - including people calling and harassing this person at work.          I don't know if this was ever made public, but it happened when people realized that certain subreddits had power and value. (Reddit did not always have subreddits, it was all just one big hole that people dumped content into).
The /u/darylprat incident was a fucking tragedy for everyone involved. Check out his post history for the full story but TL;DR this guy was clearly very mentally ill and stalking a girl who makes videos for IGN. He made a lot of posts on /r/legaladvice and /r/relationships asking for help on how best to get in contact with her even though she had banned him on all social media platforms. He was absolutely obsessed with this girl and judging by his post history, he may have committed suicide after this whole thing.
/u/CarlHProgramming (dead link)Helped a lot of people learn programming, got caught making child pornography using his own son, committed suicide in prison.
The Boston bombing debacle. Side note: that is now used as a case study for computing ethics. 
There was this thread about a girl who ended up going to Europe with two men she never met. Seemed like they lured her into a trap basically, and she never posted on reddit since that last post. I forgot the details...if anyone has the link please post.
Remember that time we found that hitman and the subreddit they made for assignments?
Morgan Freeman's disastrous AMA
That time Reddit investigated the Boston bombing and got 99.7% of the information wrong. 
The guy that disappeared forever after posting a pic of a landmine and saying he was going to smash it open
As someone who joined Reddit 4-ish months ago, it is appallingly interesting to learn about these horrific incidents in Reddit's past.
I don't remember the exact details, but on some tinfoil hat sub, someone posted a picture of a daycare near their house that they thought was a secret operation. People called, drove by, somewhere in Utah.It might not apply as its smaller scale, but a bunch of people harassed a daycare.
No one seems to remember the last little kid reddit "treated", the one that made videos with his toy dinosaurs. He got super excited at his hundreds of thousands of views and subscribers, made videos celebrating. Then reddit got bored, quit watching, unsubbed and the kid got sad, started making videos apologizing even when he didn't do anything wrong.
Well I remember something about a safe that seemed to drag on forever with a quite unsatisfying ending.

How that weasel, Alexis Ohanian, forced Victoria Jackson out of her job as coordinator for the high profile AMAs because he wanted to hob-nob with the celebrities.  How Hoffman and Ohanian are considered the saviors of Reddit for coming back after the Ellen Pao fiasco is beyond me.  Reddit only took off after those 2 clowns sold their stake in Reddit and left.  How did their new post-Reddit ventures fair?  Yeah, that's what I thought.
Damn. Anyone got a link? 
So do you mean spitroasting as in over a fire or like strapping on a dildo and going for the peg because it could honestly go either way

That's less of a dark piece of reddit history and more of a hilarious one. I mean, its an ISIS dude, he's an acceptable target.
This sounds very similar to something that happened a few weeks ago. A girl posted in /r/TwoXChromosomes claiming that she may be her fiance's sister and that he knew for like a year. Obviously blew up. The next day, the girl (or guy) posted that it was all fake and it was done to call out news sources that quote these stories without fact finding.
Wow.
Fucking Christ. Reminds me of another story where some guy on a forum supposedly posted a way to make some crystals - that turned out to be highly toxic and hospitalised a few people, with a couple of deaths.Could just be a myth for all I know, but it's scary.
I remember last time this was brought up in a similar thread! and he showed up and kept on trying to explain that he was massively misunderstood and that he loved her...it was like he just couldn't listen to anyone saying that was he was doing was scary and that he was obviously sick...it was really disturbing.
>Thanks for the advice but I think I'm going to keep sending letters for now. If she tells me to stop I'll stop of course. The guy on the movie the notebook send like 365 letters to that girl. >I feel like if I send them for long enough she will realize how much I care about her. And maybe she will be friends with me then This guy Grade A Crazy,  or was...
That escalated quickly
I remember that post so well too because I read a line that was like "The police don't have the thousands of minds working on this like we do." and just thought "I'm not sure that is how things work." then sure enough a day or so later they caught a guy and was harassing his family before any actual proof.
Relatively new Redditor here. I hear the Boston Bomber debacle brought up constantly. Could someone please explain what happened thoroughly?
Let's not talk about Morgan Freeman's AMA. Let's keep discussion to Rampart.
Link? I didn't know he had one
Why was it disastrous 
I believe the only information they got right was that there was in fact a bombing. 
Similar to this: the guy on 4chan who messed with a handgrenade and flushed it down the toilet. The next day there were news articles about an explosion in someones apartment that originated from the pipework and im pretty sure someone died. Either it was him or the grenade made his way through the pipes and killed his neighbor or something
Oh, that was solved. It was a stund. He'd done similar things in the past
You know why gaming developers like to stay silent and unseen? This is why. The gaming community is full of nutters.
Reddit is actually trash.  Every post related to a woman being raped gets two kinds of replies: Doubt and "Men can be raped too!!".  Redditors are trash.
How did the police not investigate any further when he threatened to rape and murder her!?!?! Jesus
I remember this. It was in a semi bad area, looked shady from the outside, and the staff refused to talk with the guy investigating. So he decided it was a drug front or something. IIRC it turned out to be a legit day care.
Was that the dog thing?
That sounds like the saddest short story ever written.
Heard that mentioned a couple times, what is it?
For insurance? Maybe he took two pictures to make sure at least one of them was good? Doesn't seem anything special to me.

I came here to say the Ask a Rapist thread, that was the most disgusting and deplorable thing I have ever seen here. 
Explanation for others: dude posts a long series of stories about how he discovers his wife cheating on him, turns out it was all fake.
Id seen that sub before and felt bad for some of them  (Im sure theres some nice ones) but felt like it was just a woe is me, pity party circlejerk.  Visited it after your link and holy fuck.  Some dude whos a frequent poster also openly advocates for raping women and says it isn't a bad thing.  WTF. 
If you read that sub, your eyeballs will get herpes.
wtf is this shit, im browsing there now and they are talking about how even if an incel cured cancer nobody would care because they were incels.....like wtf? this is the first time ive ever heard this word and I doubt anyone within a 100 mile radius of me has heard of it.Your not incels, your boring as fuck people who loathe everyone else for your own problems, go visit an escort you fucks.
tldr please?
Power users are a plague on websites like Reddit and it's a good thing that he's gone. When a guy comments on a subreddit and is getting upvoted to the top no matter what he says, it's not healthy for Reddit. 
My day isn't a day until I talk about a cumbox, or vaginal bacon
Roger Simon needs to make a comeback 
Still hurts 
tldr?
I'm actually rather new to Reddit (does a year count as new?), what happened with the Boston Bomber? I've heard it referenced but I can never figure out what actually happened.
Not only reddit. The media as well, they copied every comment as breaking news. 
We don't like to forget it though, its mentioned and upvoted all the time. 
You guys did that? That's awful!
And to add the cherry on top, he's a mod on /r/incest now
The story of /u/SpontaneousH
I naturally assume incest whenever it can go either way,but I think it's about canabalism
That's pretty cool..
Damn, that's almost as bad as /u/lordtuts
Shit. I read and believed that one. It did seem a bit crazy, but I wouldn't put anything past 2016 at this point.               I don't know why anyone would do that. All it does is piss people off and degrade our trust in others.
That was on 4chan, it wad real
Yeah and his last post says "Fuck this world" and the one before that pretty much says he's going to kill himself. I wonder if he's okay.
That shit always annoyed me in movies. Keep stalking them until they love you is basically a less rapey version of John Wayne's "kiss'em till they stop fighting you" approach.
> sexual torture of a childShit, even google refused to give me that answer up front. 
Sounds like the type of person that thinks 9 women working together can deliver a baby in one month. 
This is what happens when unqualified people try to do things they are unqualified for.
After the Boston Bombing Reddit decided it could help by having thousands of people look through whatever videos/pictures it could in hope of helping the FBI figure out who was responsible. It turns out thousands of people who don't really know what they are doing are not as good as professionals with years of training in a certain area.  Innocent people ended up on the front page of newspapers.What's worse is the FBI knew who did it very quickly and because of the reddit interference they had to release the names sooner than they would have liked.
That's just sick
Because there was a very clear lack of Morgan Freeman. Every answer the account gave read like a PR guy with canned responses. 
And that it occurred in boston
I thought it was a microwaved grenade? That might have been a different one though, I don't know.
I don't have anything to prove it but I'm pretty sure they figured out that the news article was an unrelated incident. 
One time the lead dev for COD bo2 I think changed it so that it was harder to get trick shots. Then had to get a body guard as people were telling him what his 5 year old son was wearing during the day and harassing him.
it's also a perfect example of why any publisher with an at least moderately sized user base pretty much ignores people on forums completely, grabbing pitchforks and getting angry about things like this is part of daily routine. 
I feel like I only ever see "men get raped / are victims of DV too" when it's in the context of derailing a conversation about women. It makes me sad because I feel like the people who keep bringing that stuff up aren't doing it because they really care about the issues men face, they just want to exploit that suffering to shut down women.
*That is part of rape culture* It's infuriating and unfortunately not exclusive to Reddit. 
It did. It was ridiculous. They didn't want to talk to him because he was harassing a daycare.
Yes, father catches son fucking dog, father tells wife, wife sides with son & dog fucking continues.
This scares me. It scares me because while it's completely absurd, it's still a coherent story until the last sentence with that Ultimate Cheeseburger shit. This isn't the nonsensical rambling of someone having a bad trip or psychotic episode, or random phrases thrown together to be lel such troll. It's thought out, and written to be read. Then you get to the last bit, and a bit of the crazy slips out. Just enough to drive home that this is not a normal read. And it's one of many. 
It's a story of a OR nurse operating on this 314 pound woman who had an infection and  tons of dead flesh and feces shot into the operating room.
Exactly, how would someone assume that someone taking photos of their tv, purse or watch have foul intentions. You are SUPPOSED to hide photos for insurance reason, because if someone comes in and robs you and steals the camera, you now have no photos.Clearly a robber isn't going to look under a kitchen sink for anything of value.People try to read too deep into things.She never posted again, because she probably said;"Honey, why is there a camera under the sink?""For insurance""O, ok"
Everythings a thing. Apparently the pedo sub was a this. 
I believe it's been quarantined and not banned yet
How did reddit fall for that? He wrote, "she came over for some kisses" and even better " touch his penis, but only a little" lol
Yeah, a lot of people there are actually fucking crazy.
A lot more than one dude advocate for raping women. Almost every one of them thinks women are "less evolved" than men somehow, inherently less intelligent, less compassionate, dishonest and disloyal. A lot of them believe women are not truly people. They constantly refer to women in general as "sociopathic cunts" and then wonder why they can't get laid lol.
ELI5?
Or broken arms
Not when your butt is on the toilet and your head in the garbage can. Purge all systems!
/u/lordtuts posts an image in /r/me_irl saying if it gets over 10000 upvoted, he will tattoo the next day's top /r/me_irl post in his ass. He didn't and instead posts an image saying something like: "You think I would tattoo my ass for fake Internet points? You are easily bamboozled." 
"If this post gets 10k upvotes I'll tattoo tomorrow's top submission on my butt." Got 70k upvotes. Did not deliver.
That guy promised to tattoo his ass, then bamboozled Reddit. His comment karma is going down the drain because of that.E: two Reddit users say his karma is going up. WTF is happening?
So did OJ Simpson
Site wide witch hunt, threats being sent to the wrong families, kid reddit thought was the bomber later found dead in a river.
"Yes John, our trusted source over at Reddit, /u/BLOODY_ANAL_QUEEF confirmed those early reports. Now back to you Jim, with sports."
You belong to us too
You should naturally assume incest whenever it's on Reddit. 
4chan and reddit both do some pretty cool things, but the bad stories like kidnappers posting pictures of their victims on /b/ or people witch hunting random people accusing them of being terrorists really just kind of outshines all the good stuff unfortunately. 
I don't understand, that doesn't say he had it stolen from him, just that he shut it down and then people were mad and then he gave it away to /u/karmanaut.
This is like the umpteenth time I've seen this user mentioned with no explanation. Did he actually do something awful or is it just a Reddit inside joke?
She just had to prove how stupid and gullible everyone on the Internet is for her "social experiment" and then gloat about it on other subreddits.  She posted in r/TwoXChromosomes for crying out loud, not someplace like r/TIFU. I mean there people are going to give you the benefit of the doubt and try to help you out, instead of trying to prove you wrong; it's meant to be a haven. 
Yup, the old "mix bleach and ammonia" info graphic
To be fair, in the movie it's her mother hiding the letters from her, when she actually would have wanted them.
I don't even have to click the link. The face tells all.
I remember Denko! Poor Denko.
Holy moly I thought 4 texts was annoying, but 600 emails o_O
My dad had a social worker in the 70s who raped him, he was in the Brighton area when it happened. Then over 20 years later the same social worker showed up at my parents flat just after I was born. Needless to say my parents didn't allow the social services anywhere near me.
oh these are the ones that break my heart. The ones that suffer all of their lives. My mom is/was like this too. Raped/abused/mistreated/spit on/and finally mistreats herself to death. At least, she finally found peace when she died. When she passed, it was very dark but I like to think now, she has everything she ever needed
What a great analogy, shit I'm stealing this
I think this story actually fits the topic of this thread the most. As in, we like to forget that it ever happened. In this case, the commenters like to forget (which is understandable).
No one is opposed to a Craigslist for hitmen?
I thought it was fake?  The verification picture was proven to be fake 
Are we *sure* it wasn't a "pizza parlor"?
Sadly, I think there may have been two grenade incidents. 
Ah yes, the ultimate proof for conspiracy-minded folks. 
I was one of the ones who subbed to that kid. This breaks my heart. What kind of asshole steals videos from a little kid?
Was there an ending?
From her anus, in case anyone was wondering.
Seriously, what do people think happened? This isn't a bad Lifetime movie.
120V wall socket would badly damage/burn the penis.  A copper-zinc lemon cell has ~0.9V potential. This would not be enough to conduct through the human body, and would feel nothing like a shock. This guy is fake.
Yup. /r/jailbait was around until some in the media heard about it and started talking about how reddit has pedos on it. I think it was one of the first times that Reddit was on the national news
So, uh, what exactly was it? Just pictures of dead girls?
The PI that had a live feed, etc. overall a pretty fun weekend. 
But like, why would they go there and post there? Everyone knows it as that rapey place, so why would anyone think "oh cool, I'll hang out there and post"?
Ha, I love it fuck reddit for caring so much about karma
Wasn't that recently?
Who cares about comment karma when you get so much gold!
Oof, suicide or murder? That's pretty brutal :-/
What you say
You have changed my life. 
It wasn't over.
You can have 600 emails. If you want. 
Why was he at the flat?? Did your dad flip?
I think they meant it in the sense that it wont make people and the internet froth at the mouth for justice or revenge like the harm of our idea of innocence, ie abuse of children, defenseless animals, etc...
Can you explain why this video is funny? I remember watching it and not understanding the hooplah about it.
It was confirmed by his Twitter account, so it was very likely his agent running the whole thing.
There was a follow up proving that the "verification picture is fake" picture was actually fake.
I think there's been more than 2 grenade incidents.
With the right attitude and a thick pipe you can accomplish many tasks and feats of strength. 
They refused to speak to me, and when I tried to have a look around the property, they called the **police**. Yeah, you read that right. The police of this town are in on it too. I guess this goes higher up than I thought.
The lack of evidence only strengthens their conviction. 
I  feel like I'm one of the few people it still watch his videos regularly. I showed it to my younger brother and me and him watch them together all the time.
Opened it, nothing but a weird looking spider. It was white or something
Her taint. She was injecting heroin into her taint and it got infected and made a fistula, which is to say, her vagina and anus were linked by a tube that opened from the infection punching through both walls.
Was that before the cringy "Narwhal bacons . . . "?
yup
Because they're really fucked up and are okay with rape.
He gained 70000 karma from all the process /r/karmacourt ruled him innocent, but I bet it's one of its most controversial / disputed results
Yup. This month I think.
Suicide.
Beyond that, it's easier to stand up against child abuse than it is against the potential for one to arrange your murder at any time. It seems like protesting a hitman website is exactly how you would end up on a hitlist.
I wonder if they even told him what a Reddit AMA was, or if he just didn't give a fuck and gave the go-ahead for a PR guy to do it.
How far does this rabbit hole go man??
Now I need to know what ended up happening with everything 
no one wants to mention his name?
Long dead too, which is probably why it was white
Now where did I put that Brain Bleach?
We have summoned him!All power to you. Do what you want, man  .
I think it was around the same time...?
Rip
When you make it good for business for hitmen to kill you, you're gonna have a bad time.
I don't think he even knew it was happening 
Last comment he made about it, 203 days ago."It was directly related to my wife thinking I was the one who sodomized the dog. We are on decent terms but I feel that she still thinks I did it. She still thinks our son is the golden child. Of Course I love him too, but I know the truth about what he did to Colby. We only speak now when it concerns our son, otherwise we dont talk, which I'm fine with. She also harbors resentment toward the dog, which is beyond me. "I hope somebody else opens their eyes for that messed up kid and reports him. Needs to be institutionalised.
It was nothing but bones.
The jailbait and violentacrez controversy came well after the narwhal. "The narwhal bacons at midnight" was already a thing before I joined reddit. 
Killing is their business, and business is good.
Also victim blaming a dog is fucked up.
Is this why the apps are BaconReader and Narwhal, respectively?
Stupid sexy Colby.
Nonchalance about their own personal health or safety. If you see someone start drinking more or smoking out of the blue, it might be an escape from psychological pain. If they aren't showering as much, ignoring people, staying in bed a lot, eating less. These are all signs that they don't have the energy or aren't happy. Many symptoms you'd see on someone with the flu are things you'd see on someone whose depressed. 
Switches in behaviour.A friend was so tired, lackluster one moment and flipping out over something trivial the next. Later on, she said she couldn't talk about what really mattered, so she focused on little stupid things (e.g. The bus being late) and got super angry about it. It was always something out of her control, something she could get angry at without blaming herself for it.
If someone overreacts to something small and blows it way out of proportion, it's usually a sign that they are very unhappy about something else but either don't know it or are incapable of fixing it. 
Getting upset or unable to handle a fairly simple task, particularly if you know them and know they're not just incompetent. Big problems people keep to themselves often show in the small stuff. 
They use Reddit for hours a day as a temporary reprieve from the bottomless pit of despair that is their life. 
Superficial dialog about off-topic things. Avoiding talking about how they feel or sharing personal details of their life.
This was mentioned on the show Sherlock but I've found it to be largely true in real life. There is a good chance that they are depressed if the person is smiling when they know people can see them, but look sad when they think they are alone.
I'm unhappy because I'm becoming increasingly aware of the enormous flaws in my personality, work ethic, and character that are preventing me from making the most out of this life. There's nothing worse than realizing you've been given so many opportunities and advantages, and squandered them all.
Constant, "jokey" self-deprecation.
Everything in here is so relateble its almost terrifying
They're reading this thread.
Sleeping a lot is a very good indicator of someone who's very lonely and unhappy with life.
Reading this thread has taught me I am extremely miserable.
They look away - staring out the window or at an object in the room.Their attention is elsewhere - internal, sullen and withdrawn.
Speaking as an unhappy person: if they laugh at everything. Anything that can make me happy, even for a second, I will reach for it and try to hold onto it as hard and as long as I can. This isn't always a direct indicator; some people are just easily amused. But, I've seen it and done it enough times to keep it in mind. 
They don't come out as much 
This whole thread is me haha am I unhappy 
they seems that they do not care about things that they used to care about
*Reads comments from top to bottom*Check, check, check, check, yep that as well, check. 
Nothing. Like, doing nothing, spending your time with nothing, being up late because "nothing."I stay up late often. What do I do when I stay up late? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. And for some reason, I can't not do nothing.
Dead Eyes man. DEAD EYES
I've spent a lot of time 'looking for happiness' and I did a lot of stuff that made me feel better for a bit but eventually I always ended up right back at the start. It's just the natural cycle of life for some of us. So many highs yet so many lows. It's OK to be unhappy and lost, many of my accomplishments in life were a direct result from me feeling like crap. Just own it, keep going. Time will pass one way or another.
Instant smile when someone talks to them, its just a show 
Complaining all the time, about just about everything. They can't be happy on the *outside* because they're not happy on the *inside*. 
Always acting upbeat. Seriously, that upbeat person that never gets in a bad mood is secretly miserable. I promise. 
We joke about everything 
Constant "jokes" about how miserable they are. If you make more than three jokes about your relationship being shitty during one evening, you need to do something about it.
See how they carry themselves alone..
The eyes.even as they smile or laugh, eyes say it all, the despair stays.
Whenever I'm feeling depressed I always joke more about depression. I'd rather people think I'm a dick who doesn't understand depression than think I actually have it.
# tl;drYou are secretly unhappy if:* You do not smile enough, or smile too much* You don't go out, or go out too often* You sleep too much, or not enough* You are self-deprecating, or deprecating towards others* You drive a Chevy CobaltGuys...
TIL I'm probably a more unhappy person than I originally thought I was. 
"I'm fine" 
Happy people hear the music. Sad people listen to the words. 
Really wish someone would have noticed earlier I was on a 14 month drinking binge. I've stopped now though. Just gotta shed the pounds the booze added. 
Or under reacting to everything, big or small. Almost having no reaction to any problem no matter how much it involves them and just fixes it in silence practically on auto pilot, or just walks away not caring.
One of the big problems with depression is that people use use the word as a catch-all term for everything from grief to teenage sulkiness.  This is why so many idiots tell depression sufferers they need to smile more, when true depression has nothing to do with this.
Goddamnit. I just had a near mental breakdown trying to cook salmon. This hits home.
Yep, I've almost had my power and water shut off simply because I couldn't bring myself to log in and pay the bills online. I had more than enough money to pay the bills (I was making six figures), I just couldn't bring myself to care about anything enough to take care of daily living type tasks. Luckily my mortgage and car payments were on autopay at the time.
> Also using sleep to "treat" problems like boredom, stress, headaches, or any number of minor physical symptoms that pop up.When I'm in a depressive period, I do this. I tend to try and sleep off everything. Headaches, anxiety, stress, hunger. Doesn't go well.
This could also mean they're a waiter or shop attendant on a 14- hour shift.
you can sometimes see them put the smile on when they realise they have to react to something.. goes from no emotion to -sudden, practiced smile- "yeah.. that sounds great. i agree"
Bojack Horseman is more relatable for me.
The best you can do is chalk it up to experience and realise you are a better individual for understanding how not to go about things. If you feel guilt and regret then the present you is not the same person who fucked up.
I once went on a date with a guy who did this constant, jokey self-deprecation. I'm a fan of that type of humor and use it myself, but during the dinner we had together, he made so many jokes about how he had graduated college and not found a "real" job yet. The first couple times, I laughed sympathetically. After that, I started to suspect that something was seriously wrong that he could not stop making fun of himself for working at a fast food restaurant. It got awkward. There was not a second date. 
As a nation, we British are constantly depressed
I would say that sarcasm and tearing down *other people* is a more reliable sign.  Humorous self-deprecation, up to a certain point, is usually more a sign of confidence and positive attitude.Of course, if you're taking it to a Louis C.K. level, then that's another matter.
Whooops. I do *all* these things.
> * Faking their mood to appear happy *What the shit, you can tell!
Low energy? Sad!  
Ugh how do I make it stop? :-(
Yeahhhhhhh......
Undersleeping and oversleeping can both by signs of depression. So can changes in sleep patterns or changes in diet/food consumption.
Can say that this is true. I struggle with depression, and have a very high tendency to tell people I'm busy/occupied when I very clearly planned on sleeping 12-15 hours that day instead.Used to be a fairly frequent thing. I'd wake up after 10 hours of sleep for an hour or two, then take a nap again around 11am until about 4pm, and then immediately go back to sleep before midnight. If someone's sleeping a LOT, then they either have a deficiency/disorder or depression.
oh shit thats me...
I teeter on the edge of extreme joy and crippling loneliness most of the time. This thread is half of who I am.
its a "why the fuck am I here" kinda look. 
I've noticed that I tend to laugh with other people even when I didn't hear the joke or understand it correctly. After I do anyways I ask myself, "why am I like this." Nothing other than what I've already known I suppose.
Avoid meaningful conversation like the plague 
Or, by how quickly a smile can vanish when it is believed others are no longer looking. 
"I'm fine, just tired"
Top tip: Telling people that they look tired does not help.
Can confirm, look tired, secretly (and not so secretly) unhappy.
How many times can they reveal that they're gay?
haha.
Or can't focus like they used to. Sometimes even reading a book can be a struggle.
Like spending countless hours watching youtube videos and playing video games. Yup. 
And are you unhappy? 
Their own lives, specifically. They'll experience the other people's life, though!
Found Chandler Bing
There's a reason why nearly all of the funniest comedians turn out to be suffering from horrible depression or struggling with the scars of a personal trauma or tragedy
Oh no... That's.. me
I DON'T RELATE TO THIS AT ALL! HAHA AIRLINE FOOD!
I do this all the time... so people *can* see through the act, huh? haha
i know people like thisthey're unbearableprimarily because i'm exactly like that, too... ive just been making an effort to shut the fuck up if i've got nothing positive to say lmao
This needs to be higher. The happy person, especially socially happy person, can be secretly very depressed. Double points if they're trying to make other people happy, or pretty funny.Robin Williams is actually a very good example of this. Comedians in general, really.
Also known as night shift workers.
Sometimes I'm happier not socialising though. 
You just described an introvert that works the graveyard shift, not an unhappy person.
This was my brother, right before he killed himself. Happiest person you ever met. Lived to make other people laugh. But couldn't handle the secret sorrow within himself. And the one time he sort of reached out to my family, we didn't take him seriously. He killed himself on his 24th birthday. 
You nailed it. I didn't even realize this was a thing, but it's exactly who I was just before reaching out for help. The person never messaged me back. So then, I was really hard on myself for tainting the carefree, positive personality I had depicted for everyone. Maybe he just didn't see the message, but my imagination still ran amuck. 
>Overly generous. Will help you move - twice. Never asks for anything in return. Gives thoughtful gifts for seemingly no reason - saw this handmade do-da and thought you'd love it. Constantly planning road trips and never asks for gas or hotel money. oh god this is me
I have crippling depression LMAO
:)
That could also be a sign that they're fine.
Last time I called I was on hold for an hour. Felt bad man.
I think one of the biggest signs is being devoid of emotion. Like you can't 'feel' anything. There's basically this transition phase where you go from being uncontrollably sad to where you don't feel anything. Which is incredible for a few days, and then it's soul-crushingly awful. All you want to do is 'feel' something, anything, and you can't.
Very true. One of my best friends was a recovering addict. Every time I would go visit, we'd spend the first hour or so just picking up the apartment. Years later after recovery he told me that was one of the smallest things that helped him the most.
Wow ive suffered with depression for years and i never realised this, sometimes even when id put actual effort into cleaning, id just find it so hard to do easy tasks, one room could take hours so most times id give up, making me worse because id failed again
I think this only applies if it is a downward trend. I've always had a messy place, personally it never was a priority for me. It isn't unclean, but certainly could be described as a shit show (only dress clothes are folded, projects left out, etc.). It helps I live alone, and I do organize for guests/events. 
Shit. This is me
this can also be a symptom of anxiety. I have GAD and often ignore texts or paying bills without any reason. it's so stupid 
He already said depressed, though.
Practicing smiling... yup.
The fake smile with a thumbs up he musters versus his usual glum face can hit people hard when first watching BH. It's one of those shows that can't really be watched with friends, yet you wish you hadn't put yourself through it alone.
that show has gutted me
God I love that show. Simultaneously cathartic and depressing.
I believe it was Louis CK who said something along the lines of "As long as you think your past is bad, you must be improving".
As a fellow Brit it is deeply unsettling to find somebody who seems happy. I just assume the happiness is a mask for their severe depression and continue with my depressing life. 
It's the "up to a certain point" that's key there. Obviously to an extent, it's fine. And there's nothing wrong with being modest in most situations. But I've known people who talk like that all the time. All their humour revolves around it. It starts to feel like they're really attempting to reach out or be honest, but are hiding it behind "it's a joke".
That's not good! Some of these are symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (low energy, tiredness, changes in appetite, not smiling much, etc.)
If someone knows you pretty well, they can. 
I keep asking myself the same question.... Discipline? Throw the phone into a river? Get out more? 
I'm actually happiest when I sleep 12 hours...
Likewise, not sleeping a lot at all. Think only about a couple of hours at night and a nap during the day._edit_ Ok, this seems to have some people riled up. I'm not at all saying that if you don't sleep a lot that means you're depressed. However, depression can come with a severly dysfunctional sleeping rhythm. 
In the darkest and saddest way, I genuinely prefer to be unconscious.
Makes me feel better to hear that it's not just me.Sometimes the smallest thing will set me off. Ice cream! Everything is great! I love the whole world! So much energy I can't control myself! Oh wait, they're out of the flavor I wanted. Everything is terrible, mind immediately focusing on every bad memory it can come up with. There's nothing worthwhile left anywhere. Zero energy.Even I know I'm being ridiculous when it happens, but I don't know how to stop it.
Wanna have a pity party together? Ill BBQ and set up the entertainment room
This thread just makes me sad. It's not a good read on a Monday morning
Double oh
"Why haven't you gotten out of bed in 30 hours.""really tired."
I'm completely happy, just tired a lot. I guess people think I'm sad :(
Wow, I just realized I do this too when I'm upset. I typically just shut down and if anyone asks, I'll give them that response.
-Hey, you look tired! Are you sick or something? -I'm just not wearing make-up... 
My go to answer if people ask if everything is alright is just to say "I'm just tired".
ha..
I suffer from depression and I haven't read a book in years.  I used to read all the time but now I can barely finish a magazine article.  Hell, I even skim longer reddit posts.  It's just impossible to be interested or care.
Feeds nicely into the cycle too. I play videogames because I'm unhappy > I'm unhappy because I'm a failure > I'm a failure because I spend so much time playing videogames... etc.
That also makes people like you more! If you're funny and always steer the conversation so people talk about themselves they won't notice the gaping chasm of darkness that you live on the edge of! 
STFU, I am out of this thread :(Too close
Haha that's funny. It's even funnier when you actually do feel like you miss them and that you lost something very precious but even if you wanted to reconnect you realise they've accomplished so much by now and you're still the exact same as you've left highschool. Haha maybe not exactly the same, maybe a little bit more broken and dead inside. Haha.
I thought it was Mrs. Chanandler Bong
There's a podcast called the Hilarious World of Depression that hosts comedians to talk about their depression & mental illnesses... I had no idea how common it was until I scrolled through and saw most of my favorite comedians on there
Comedy comes from pain. The funniest people in your life have probably been treated the worst at one point or another. 
This whole thread makes me feel so exposed
*WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH IT HAHA*
Only depressed people.  
Robin Williams had Lewy Body Dementia. It was destroying his mind and judgement. He didn't kill himself out of depression.
I'm really sorry for your loss.
Similar thing happened to me - reached out for help and got ignored. Later told that they "didn't know how to react" so they did nothing.
It's weird, this is me too. I've never really thought about the fact that I do it hoping the other person will be there for me when the inevitable emotional breakdowns happen. More often than not, they aren't. Which is even more heartbreaking. Just goes with me needing to learn to look out for myself first and stop prioritizing others. 
Thanks Dr Professor
The initial being so beyond not giving a fuck is kind of amazing. It's basically "I have *become* the Void. Whoa." And then eventually you realize literally nothing has any meaning to you anymore and nothing is worth doing. 
I see this with my girlfriend. She goes through periods of depression and lately she has been kinda numb. It's crushing for me because there's nothing I can do, I do try pushing her towards self loving types of activity like the gym, pampering oneself, etc. I know it can help. I can only imagine how she feels.If you're at all curious she does seem like she's on the up.
I'll tell you what worked for me - crying. It sounds stupid, but I got the idea from Fight Club. I'm a 30 year old guy and I'd been holding everything inside, not letting anyone know how deeply depressed I was, until finally one day when I was on the phone with my mom I just broke down and started bawling like a child. It was freaking cathartic, like a weight was lifted for a few hours. And so I started my own version of "meditating" each day where I'd just let out everything I was holding inside. Might not be for everyone, but it's been quite effective for me.
Got to be able to pull it out the bag like it were natural. Never know when you'll need to cover
Watched it with my also depressed SO. Fuuuuck, that last season finale. 
That hits home. My past wasn't amazing but I do look back on it very fondly. 
How does one act or seem happy in Britain?
That's my secret, they always knew me while I was unhappy, so they can't tell the difference!
Digitally disconnect and get out into nature. Take a walk in the woods.  Go hiking. Go camping.  I recently started this and it has done wonders for my anxiety/depression. :)
I have the whole not sleeping thing as well. I don't nap during the day, I just don't sleep very much.
Thread's top post has spoken, you are unhappy.
-Hey you look like shit today! Are you sick or something?-I just put ON my makeup...
This happened to me at work. I have really bad dark circles no matter how much sleep I get and I usually don't wear makeup everyday except a little concealer, but I actually wore eye makeup to work the one day because I was going to see my boyfriend that night and go out to the bar. My boss walks in and says:Boss: Wow! Looks like you got some sleep?Me: Huh?Boss: *makes hand motion to his eyes*Me: Oh. I put on makeup today...Then he tried to get out of the fact he just accidentally said I look like shit all of the time by saying I looked good even though I "always looked good"
"You have dark spots under your eyes""Bitch I'm a panda"

Reddit is making me wish I could teleport all over the place, so many people here need good friends.
I'm just glad to hear there are others out there in this world just like me.
MISS Chanadler Bong
I really dislike people sometimes. I've gained massive trust issues because the day I reached out for help, I got cheated on and later dumped. "Too needy, I can't handle it." I just joke around now as a clown and try helping out whoever I can, but no one reaches out if you dont say anything memorable/significant, and I think I prefer it that way now. Sorry, I think I should have just posted this in r/offmychest
the thing is, that it makes me happy to make others a gift, or pay their meal, even tho not for long, every bit of happyness is a gift of god for me
Agreed, this is horrible. Even that soul crushing sadness is better than feeling nothing at all.
fuck that. I just blend it up frozen and shove it up my ass. skips the liver completely. sheesh it's like you guys don't even know how to food
If you don't mind me asking, how did your mom react?
I can pull out the most genuine full-face smile you've ever seen and have it mean absolutely nothing. Heck, sometimes I fool myself.
It was TOO MUCH, MAN
"...Sarah?"Saw it recently and wasn't expecting it to get so dark. Even though it had gotten progressively darker since the first season. It's a miracle reddit hadn't spoiled it for me yet.
When someone nods at you and says 'Alright', you simply nod back and say 'alright'.You then pull your collar up to shield against the 30mph winds and horizontal rain and continue your pilgrimage to Bargain Booze and hope they havent sold out of the 'good' special brew or youre drinking paint thinner again tonight.
We are quite reserved in some respects, and publicly acknowledging that something isn't right even to friends and family is hard to do, I know that can be said the world over depending on your friends and family but in the UK it's kind of the unspoken truth. For example, it took me the better part of a decade to get help for depression and another 6 months to tell my family I was getting help for it, and I come from a really close-knit and supportive family when I told my family that's when I really started to feel better it was just hard getting to that point. 
Same 
Very true! At first you'll think, "Great, now I'm just depressed but in the woods" and then you start moving. There are few things that can make you better and stay feeling better than going for a hike and just listening to some calm, cool music. Shoutout to sleepmakeswaves for being my official hiking soundtrack. 
Bought a fitness tracker thing that showed every night even when I'm 'asleep' for 8 hours I only actually get 3 hours of sleep a night, being exhausted doesn't help with anything especially emotions 
At least your boss is nice. He worries about his employees. Worth more than an MBa from Harvard. 
I'm gay
...
You don't have to teleport, there are many just like them near you. Finding them is the problem. Also, you have a relevant username.
You have no idea.
Agreed. I *refuse* to talk about myself. There's like two or three things I actually enjoy and every time I try to talk about them I always get cut off/ignored. It's to the point where I just assume no one cares and don't even bother trying. It really goes a long way to making my ideas and goals feel utterly worthless.and what's worse, I realize this, and still have a difficult time changing my attitude about it. ugh.
I want to die
I think you'll find it's Ms
If I can't make myself happy, I try to make others happy. That helps somewhat.
You see that's what I have always told myself also. But I'm realizing that I may have more selfish motives. 
Feeling some kind of sadness that isnt sadness because you cant feel sad when you should is something that i dont think any people that didnt went throught it will ever understand. 
Like the angel she is, she stayed on the phone with me while I cried about basically every aspect of my life for over an hour. She knew I'd been having a hard time (going through a divorce I hadn't wanted), but up till that point I'd been putting up a pretty good front and my family thought I was handling it far better than I was. I made an offhand comment about not engaging in self-harm only because I was a coward, and she packed up and drove four hours to come stay with me for the next few days. To be honest, I couldn't ask for better parents. 
Cut my life into pieces. 
Opens door for you - "cheers"Open next door for them - "cheers""cheers"
On the other hand, we're happy to tell a taxi driver our life story within seconds of meeting them.
How much of it do you need to drink?
I'm gay
..
I feel like my refusal to talk about myself, but my willingness to talk about them, creates this one-sided relationship. A relationship where they get what they need and want from me, but I never really get what I need... because I never let them in. I can become people's best friend, but no one's ever really my best friend.... its easier to just avoid I guess.
Thanks for the PM. I try to be kind to myself.  The problem is that I find myself bragging about my accomplishments, and then the people who are supposed to be my support group end up mocking me for my proud, little accomplishments.  Oh well, I guess we do this for ourselves, right?I dunno.  I had a very hard weekend, and I'm feeling really down.  So I really appreciated the PM.  Thank you.
When I called my mom and had that similar breakdown her voice got notably annoyed.  And when I said through a haze of tears "I'm just so unhappy..." her response was 'so what?  nobody is happy.'
My real last name is Bort. 
*nods downwards* Alright. 
Enough to stop the tears. 
I'm gay
. 
h..hey all you people!Hey all you people!Hey all you people won't you listen to meeeeee!I just had a sandwich - no ordinary sandwich..A sandwich filled with Jellyfish jellyyyyy!
I'm gay
So thats how you get a gold.
I'm gay
Gotta admit it's one of the strangest instances I've gotten one for. No idea
I was listening to the 9/11 episode of Last Podcast on the Left, and they played a bunch of really heartwrenching audio clips, but by far the creepiest was just a bunch of high pitched siren/alarm-like noises. It was explained that all firefighters wear these alarms that go off if said firefighter is motionless for like 30 seconds or more aka. They are dead/unconscious. So yeah, it was basically listening to dozens of dead firefighters. It is super haunting to listen to and still sticks with me.
Any black box recording where a plane is crashing and the pilots slowly realise they are going to die with all the passagers on board. www.planecrashinfo.com/lastwords.htmIt's very chilling. 
It was audio tape, not film: When I first started working with nuclear submarine programs in the 90s, we had to go to "training" (really just a presentation) about the Sub Safe program, which is an extraordinary QA program enforced for nuclear subs. They played audio of the USS SCORPION sinking and breaking up as a result of an equipment failure.I don't remember the exact number, but the entire crew perished.
PSA: If you are ever in a situation where someone is threatening to harm you unless you come with them, don't go with them. No matter what they do to you in that moment, there is no way it will be worse than what they will do if they get you alone where they want you. You're a lot more likely to survive getting stabbed during the kidnapping itself than you are to survive once they've taken you.
Police found thousands photos in Rodney Alcala's (serial killer/rapist) home following his arrest. Some were of his confirmed victims. Eventually, they released about 200 of the photos to the public, hoping the women and children in the photos would be recognized. I find some of those photos quite haunting. Also, Alcala once won the dating show and that's not found footage at all but totally creepy when you watch and know he's a serial killer. 
I'm going to go with the man they found alive in a sunken tugboat 3 days after it capsized.
There were those photos of the guy that went out in the bush and ended up dying (they made that movie about it) he was living in a bus? Chris McCandless - those photos always creeped me the fuck out. (Its late so i'm not going to look at them before I sleep) 
I love reading the comments but I don't have the balls to go to any of the links...
The feet that washed up in Vancouver for years.  Definitely disturbing found footage.
Gotta shake your butt or the device every few seconds if you're standing and talking (depending where it's mounted). One starts beeping everyone does a wiggle. They turn on when you turn on your SCBA tank.I'd never seen or thought of them in relation to 9/11. That's pretty chilling.
All the other last words, and then the Polish Airforce with just "fuck"
'Actually these conditions don't look very good at all, do they?' This one got me
"Amy, I love you."
I remember there was this sort of "secret track" on a Rammstein album. When you played he CD, the first song actually started several seconds in and you had to press "back" as soon as it starts. That would take you to 0:00 where you heard the sound of the black box of a Japanese plane crashing into mountains. It was really creepy just hearing them get louder and louder and yelling and all of a sudden.......nothing.Edit.: I think I should add that I now know that it's from Reise Reise as I keep getting that sent to me. So thank you.
Man, this thread is doing a great job of reminding me to never touch anything anywhere with anybody. 
Seems like neither of them is a very good swimmer and due to panic they kept pushing the other one down to keep themselves up.
I regret watching that.
damn imagine being the guy that randomly comes across the camera and looks at the footage
That was very fucking surreal watching someone put a bullet through their skull.
That was disturbing as fuck! The audio of him groaning after the shot and then the sound of blood gushing on to the floor was sickening.
Holy fuck. There's just... no remorse. It's no big deal to them. "Sorry Cassie's family but... she's gotta be the one".
This is absolutely horrifying, they are acting like regular teenage boys apart from what they're talking about and then they do, the way they were acting with each other they could have been talking about anything 
What is it with my state and serial killers? Seems we get all the fucked up ones.
As a nuke, can confirm they still play it.
Don't tell my boss but I haven't done ANYTHING because of this thread 
Shit I have that type of blinds and I am fucking terrified in the evenings. 
And THAT is why I sleep with my bedroom door closed. People can break into my house and steal what they want, just don't open the door... I'll ignore it and deal with the aftermath in the morning.
He explicitly says he isn't going to kill them, did he ever let them go? 
Man what the fuck. Two victims escaped and reported the crimes and the police didn't follow up. In one case the husband divorced the victim. Jesus. 
Do not fucking read this shit. I read it like 3 months ago and still can get it out of my head. This shit is so fucked. 
Many of them knew but had guns pointed at them, actually. There was no way out. :(
Yeah the silence at the end fucks with you more than anything. I really recommend keeping away from this one.
Jones didn't even drink it himself and was shot by a follower...dignity my ass
> involuntarily committing suicideI think that's just called murder.
Reads "Unsolved Mysteries", theme song automatically plays in my head for the duration of the post.
When I was in a high school, a girl a little older than me was kidnapped from a mall near our house. She was walking to her car and these guys pulled up next to her in their car. One pointed a gun at her and told her to get in the car. She did, and what they did to her afterwards was horrific (she did not survive). My mom told me if that ever happened to me, to just refuse to go because it would be better to be hurt or killed right there in a parking lot than go through what that girl did.
*Captain Lee also instructed passengers to stay put and did not change the order even as he was leaving the ship.*BUT WHY
I still remember reading that some of the kids bodies were found without nails. They were scraping at the walls and anything to try and escape from drowning. That still haunts me. 
Guy wasn't homeless, he had a wife and IIRC it was his brother that went looking for him and found his body when he saw his motorcycle by the side of the road.
When you said "Delphi, Indiana" I was like wtf I heard that somewhere yesterday. I thought it may have been on one of the many crime shows I watch but it was actually on my local news station. I live in North Carolina and they played that clip. Knowing that man is still on the loose is so haunting. I feel so bad for everyone in that town right now :(
I really hope they catch that guy before there are more victims.What was with the "spooky music" on that New York Post video? 
Well, he wasn't a corpse so I'd say that the ending was a happy one. 
Being the scuba diver investigating a 3 day old wreck when a hand reaches out grabs you has got to be pretty terrifying too. Not nearly as terrifying as being stuck in the damn wreck for 3 days, but still. That's how horror movies start  
Imagine the sounds of the ocean from down there. 
They were believed to be pirates.
My day is definitely ruined after listening to that
Had a read and it's not really solved, more just confirmed they are dead. They have no idea how or why they died. They found a boot with a foot in and some bleached bones, and that was it apart from some of their belongings. The photos are very creepy though. Could have been by them. But around the same time the photos were taken, there were incorrect pin attempts on one of their phones - which never received the correct pin again. 
Total nightmare. Being lost in the woods, injured, and without any cellphone reception. 
....that is fucking creepy....Do you have a link to any particular articles on this murder???
That guy was kind of an idiot. I hate that his dumb choices were romanticized the way that they were.
That was from the video for "Down In It", which released back in 1989. In it, Trent Reznore appears to throw himself off a building and fall to his death. Trent had to prove IN COURT that he was still alive.
That link is staying blue.
God, I thought I'd read "live cam of kitten being crushed" or something. Actual link is a lot nicer. Thank you.
i dont understand how you dont hear the horn....or the fact that a train literally shakes the ground beneath you when its within a half mile radius. 
You've got it the wrong way around. They saved her life by chance yes, but it was only after the ordeal, when they examined the photos,  that they noticed she was in them. 
A common problem with people who are drowning, they panic and pull their would be savior under the water, drowning them too.
Bud Dwyer if you haven't seen it yet. Much more upsetting as he was an innocent man saving his family from the burden of his guilty sentence.
Sociopaths yo
I THINK these kids are featured in Lost for Life on Netflix. 
Boss here, you're fired. 
Closed and locked. Also super creaky floors, and dogs. Don't come down my hall.. just take the TV and go. 
Yep. He created a drug cocktail to mess with there memories and released them. He only killed them if he felt it necessary.
And she had a slit throat... That's pretty dedicated for someone who was just "cheating"... What was the husband thinking?
IF YOU WANT TO THINK OF THE WORLD AS A CALM SAFE PLACE - DO NOT READJURY MEMBERS LEFT THE COURTROOM CRYING AND VOMITTING UPON HEARING THIS RECORDING.THIS CONTENDS FOR THE SICKEST SHIT ON THE INTERNET.DO NOT READ.
They would also poison the children first. They knew that if the parents saw their kids dying that they would be more willing to kill themselves. 
Couldn't they pretend and then hope those gunmen didn't check if they were dead
If someone ever pulls up to you in a car, run in the opposite direction. If they bother to flip the car around, you'll already be gone.
The government had the balls to say those messages and videos were staged.
A bunch of panicked stampeding school children would have ruined *his* chances of getting off safely.   
Your teacher was Liam fucking Neeson. 
I wonder what it's like to be a fish caught in a tsunami.
that really didn't look like what I expected a tsunami to look like, wow. kinda looked underwhelming, to be honest. but then the water just kinda keeps coming and you realize how fast it's coming in and all those cars just get pushed around like toys.
I hate when people say he was homeless. It's like they are trying to make it less terrible. They killed a good man. They lured him and tortured him while his family wondered where he was. 
Saw it when I was 12. Ugh...
I always tell my daughter the same thing. That she should risk getting shot rather than go quietly. Because whatever they want you alone for will be worse than the bullet. 
That's my biggest fear.  I would rather die in the street or my own home.  At least I know my home better than any outsider.
If you were the guy who found them you'd definitely shit yourself. 
I feel like if I saw a scuba diver show up after 3 days I would think I was hallucinating.
No 
Imagine the reoccurring multiple layers of anxiety; sharks, complete darkness, will I get rescued, is there enough oxygen in this pocket of air I found, ...it must've been so mentally fucked for that guy.
I'm pretty sure he said he could hear sharks eating the corpses. 3 days, pitch black and that. I can't even imagine.
yeah could be but the article also says that people will use pirates as a cover for fucked up shit. 
Shit I had never heard about the failed pin attempts
Could be why folk tales warn people about leaving paths. might be a way to scare travellers who might be more scared of monsters than 'you might get lost' 
Sick cunt means he was cool in australian
What makes it even creepier is that the outfit she has on is what he made her put on just before he murdered her. She was kidnapped whilst hitchhiking with a friend IIRC, and nobody hitchhikes in a dress and high heels. 
Not memorised, no. But just google her name and you should find plenty of information.Murderer is in jail for life without parole (he murdered multiple people, not just her).
I would think that if you want to live in the wilderness somewhere you would pick a more temperate climate so the weather is one less thing likely to kill you. Not that it happened in this case but it is fucking Alaska. 
yeah, if you ever go to alaska don't bring him up.  They hate him, and that his brazen stupidity was glamorized.  There's been a few copycats since he died.
Wait they used video effects so well he had to prove he was alive? That's a professional job gg editors.  But iirc "dying" then coming back to life is very expensive and hard
Yep, I messed up twice already, thinking I am all tough and shit.
Seriously. Want to connect with nature? Great. Turn your cellphone off and take it with you. Plus side is if you need it, you'll have a full charge.
Don't forget to mention your username and the date
We were taught to just calm down, take a deep breath and dive or "sink" if a person panics during a rescue, they are not going to follow you down. It's possible this is a "pool only" solution to the problem.
This! Swimming sideways out of the riptide saved myself and my fiancee's life.
The video of Dwyer is still with me today, after seeing it back in high school about 15 years ago. It will always be with me. What a gruesome thing it was. It haunted me for months after. 
"Shes gotta die hahahahaha". Wow. Those are some messed up individuals. 
They are, the one seems genuinely remorseful, the other one, even though he talked about how much he enjoyed doing the murder on the tape before and after, still maintains his innocence.
It's surprising how well his "oh shit I'm fucked" reaction also works as a "oh no I'm devastated" reaction without context.
Can I have the TV instead? No need to let a criminal take it. 
They still have no idea how many he killed though. The whole thing is a horrific mystery.
Many protested - asking Jim Jones why couldn't they just pack up and head to Russia as was discussed as a possibility numerous times.
I recently watched a documentary on the Jonestown massacre which said that the "kool-aid" was a mixture of cyanide and I believe Valium. The Valium would put them to sleep and numb the pain, thus the death would be painless as they would just die in their sleep. Well apparently cyanide affects the small lungs of children significantly faster than adults, so the Valium never had time to kick in, and the children all ended up dying rather painful deaths, which the parents did indeed get to listen to. 
Smart!
That's how one guy survived 
A ferry in S.Korea carrying 476 people, mostly high school students, capsized and sank. 304 of those people died. While it was happening, everyone on board seemed to believe they would all definitely be saved and there was even a student singing the Titanic song (recorded in a video). The captain survived and the country wanted his head on a pike.
Isn't that the very same government who got caught doing some weird cultish shit and demanding bribes from Samsung?
\>The school's vice principal, Kang Min-Kyu, who had been rescued from the ferry, committed suicide a few days after the disaster.\>He wrote that it was his idea for the field trip and that the deaths of the students were his fault. He said he could not live not knowing where his students are.He also wrote that he wonders whether he could still be their teacher on the other side, in deathYou will always be their teacher Kang Min-Kyu ;_;
Well I hope that year or so of living he got before being sentenced to life in prison was worth it. 
If you're in deep water, no big deal. Boats at sea can have a tsunami pass right under them and it just seems like a large swell. It's when it reaches land that all that water and force has to go somewhere.
Like a really windy day
Isn't that what makes tsunamis so dangerous?  Unless you know the warning signs by the time you realize you're in danger it's too late.
I think I was 16 or 17 when I saw it. It was being shared around in my social circle as an entertaining 'look how dumb/stupid/fake this is'. I didn't learn that it wasn't fake until this past year... 
My mom always says that if someone gets in your car and tells you to drive somewhere, try to crash the car on their side. Kill or be killed 
plus they are a lot more likely to get caught if they kill you in the middle of the street.
As I recall, the diver that found him did get pretty startled. He said something to the effect of thinking he found another body in the water and when he reached out they guy grabbed back at him. Probably a pretty surreal moment.
That guy's mental state was probably  close to that. Three days in total darkness, nearly silent, and no real way to orient yourself. I dont think i could ever imagine how long thkse three days must have felt.
Funny enough, there was NOT enough oxygen in that pocket for him to survive as long as he did, because had he simply stayed in place the co2 he breathed out would have eventually killed him.However, he kept periodically going in to the water and trying to look for another pocket or a way out, and him disturbing the water surface like that allowed it to absorb and disperse some of that co2.
They were barracudas, not sharks. Still horrifying though. 
That rescue diver is amazing.Super calm, and imparts it onto the guy he's rescuing.  Asking what his name is, giving him clear instructions, addressing him by name every time he has to tell him something.I know is probably part of procedure they're trained with. Rescuing a calm person is going to be way easier, but imagine being down there for 3 days in the dark, then having some guy come in say, "Alright Harrison, are you comfortable? Okay, lets get you out of here"
That was epic!  Pitch black alone with no food for 3 days, jesus!
Sounds to me like something that happens when it's dark and you're panicked
Not only did he force her to put the outfit on he had also just cut off her hair as a souvenir. 
> (he murdered multiple people, not just her)did he take pictures of all of his victims or was it literally just her?
His major problem was that he didn't bring a fucking map. If he did he would have realized there was a bridge to get over the river fairly close to him. That dude is basically a prime example of why you should never let romanticism override common sense. Good movie though...
I've met people that knew him and begged him to take supplies. They offered him flashlights, a sleeping bag rated for subzero temperatures, bear spray, OTC medicine for if he gets sick, all for free. They tried to give him advice on how best to survive out there. They said he was rude (might have just been tired of people trying to get him to stop) and didn't listen to any of them. Granted, this is all hearsay from almost ten years ago but still. Guy was arrogant and didn't respect nature, while thinking he was respecting nature. So nature fucked him up.     
"Oh fuck! /u/friedhamwallet, March 3, 2017...I'm out!"
Yep, and also kick the shit out of them if they're endangering you. Worst case scenario you knock them unconscious, and then they're easier to rescue anyway.
As someone who saved my sister from drowning as a kid, I was very glad I was better at underwater swimming than above water swimming. I gave* her a foot to hold onto, kept it above water, and swam her in that way. 
The way the blood just *pours* out of his nose once he falls to the floor is something that I would have thought was overdone if I had seen it in a movie.
Can I take the creaky floors? No need to listen for thieves with no TV.
I couldn't read all of it but in the first parts he discussed how easy it was to constantly do it, and details about previous kidnappings. If truthful, terrifying. 
That's one of the most interesting parts of this audio. There is the lady who is like "hey guys, maybe we could not do this..." and the rest shut her down and then they do it. Bizarre. 
>  "kool-aid"It was flavoraid. The Kool-aid Man had nothing to do with this.
I can't find the source for this. Rolling Stone says Odell escaped by faking to go back for medical equipment, that Stanley escaped by faking checking for poison survivors until he saw an escape, two runners are too old for me to find their stories, and then some escaped via Leo's truck or by Jones' order
And the crabs look up and think "whew the fish are really flying today."
Often even then, depending on your surrounding geography.
That's so depressingShe fought so hard and was so closeGood for her tho to go down swinging 
And if you're struggling it'll likely be a lot more sloppy, hopefully leaving some sort of trail. If they're able to take their time they'll be super careful.
Can you imagine being the guy on the boat for three days?! He could only assume he was going to die.
That's really good information in case I'm ever trapped in a pocket of air in the ocean. 
Holy shit, this needs to be up higher! You see the diver gasp and shout something in surprise and the guy up top sees the hand and he's like "What's that?! Oh okay. Alright, you found one, yeah?" (a body). Then the hand moves and the diver shouts "There's someone alive!!" and you can hear the shock/tension in the guy up top's voice. You can hear him quietly mutter "Fucking hell, I don't know what to do." and then he goes back to being perfectly calm and collected.  Incredible
The guy talking is on the surface watching a monitor, but the diver is surprisingly calm as well. I remember reading that Harrison had seen the light of the diver pass by in the hallway outside the room he was in, and he then proceeded to grab the arm of the diver. Imagine diving inside a wreck you are sure is filled with dead people only to be grabbed  by someone from behind. I would have shit and pissed myself to death. 
During an interview with the guy he says he could hear sharks below swimming around and rummaging/eating. I'd probably try to drown myself just to escape the terror of being in the dark with apex predators
All he had was like a Diet Coke or something 
He actually had a habit. He would pick them up, tie them up, cut their hair, make them wear the same outfit (or similar I forget), then take pictures of them before killing them.
Worst case they start consciously fighting you
I was planning on shooting myself one day and was watching videos of it to see what my family would find. After Dwyer I couldn't do it. I couldn't let my parents find me in that much blood. It put me off long enough to eventually get a little help and now I'm healthy and hopefully never to be in that position 
I don't think this is true.  He had made postings on forums online about "hypothetical" stalker-murder situations and how he would play dumb and be in a daze if apprehended.  His full interrogation is on youtube and it's just him giving yes/no/i dont know monotone answers and staring straight forward like a creep.  Also the detective is obese and leans back in his chair super far at one point and you have to marvel at the integrity of the chair.
To me it sounds like he was just trying to cover his ass. Who would think that the killer would be among the group of people searching for her body? He probably thought it would throw off suspicion
It gets way, way worse than that.
Aren't we all just trapped in a pocket of air in an ocean, really?
Did he know they were sharks because of the music?
Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse.......
> "No sir, you tell her that you love her, because I'm getting you out of here." Incredible. 
Amid all the morbid stuff, your comment made me chuckle 
that is literally one of the first places the police look for the killer. they ask for volunteers to help find the victim/body and take a list of everyone who helps and use that as a "suspect list" 
I had a girlfriend that had two toddlers from previous relationships.  I broke up with her and a couple years later her new boyfriend murdered her then four year old girl.  I know people wouldn't call it my fault but I know that girl would be alive today if I hadnt left her mother.
True story. When I was about 10 and my sister was 6 we were at the beach. I said something about being afraid of sharks and my sister says "Don't worry. There aren't any. The duh duh... duh duh... duh duhhhh music isn't playing." One of the funniest things I've heard that came totally random. 
Huh, this is the most likely theory I've ever read on it. 
I thought that about the flashes tooFucking terrifying when a puma is interested in you.
It's like a cheesy single player cutscene
You really can't blame yourself for crazy events like that. The twin towers would have never been knocked down on 9/11 if the architect never designed them but no one makes that connection because it's completely absurd. Existence is chaos, you can't control what happens to something or someone down the road just because you interacted with it on your own journey.
Did you not read the Daily Beast article?Looking at those imgur pics, if that gully flooded they'd be toast. One of them survived for 10 days at least. This is in no way foul play. It was a major storm the day they went out. A flash flood is also not out of the question.And, they were in tank tops and jean shorts, nothing else. Even in the tropical jungle you can die of exposure/hypothermia.
Not Tetris. It's Tetris, with physics 
Close Your Eyes. Disturbing as fuck. It's a horror game, but not in the cheesy jump scare way. It's unsettling. It makes you uncomfortable. 
Pinball Space Cadet
Dwarf Fortress. Just know that the leading curve is 90 degrees.
Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind HeistIt's a free game on Steam that takes ~20 minutes to play. One of my first recommendations to any of my friends who download Steam. 
Moonbase Alpha
Command and Conquer: Red Alert.Shit holds up.
AM2R.  It's basically to Metroid II (the Game Boy one) what Zero Mission was to Metroid I, except that it's an unofficial fan game.  And it is the best fan game of any franchise that I have ever played.  Unfortunately, Nintendo C&D'd it, but fortunately, they waited until the final release was out, so you can still get it from torrent sites and the like.
Path of Exile.
SkiFree
Town Of Salem.An online party game of lies, deception and strategy.
Space Engine.
Warframe. They're currently working on the 'grindiness'.
If you like competitive pokemon, pokemon showdown is a free battle simulator that let's you create teams and just battle other players. Pokemon TCG Online is also a free online version of the trading card game. 
Planetside 2. It's a crime how far the playerbase has fallen.
A few years ago I would have said Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory but it is now mostly dead. Game I played the most. Thank god it doesn't have an hour counter or I would be embarrassed.
Warframe and World of Warships are pretty damn fun. Warframe has a **major** content patch coming later this week and Warships is just generally fun.Spiral knights is a lot of fun too if you want a good dungeon crawler. SEGA sold the game back to the old devs and they're in the process of unfucking the grind parts of the game.
Team Fortress 2. Even though the game is kinda in a bad state right now because Valve doesn't care much about it, it's still a really good game going strong after 9 years of existence.
Endless Sky, a surprisingly deep indie game in space.
- Fractured Space- War Thunder- World of Warships
Just as a by the way for my PC brethren, **Far Cry: Blood Dragon** will be free on uPlay (I know, I know) from tomorrow until the end of this month. It's a great game, and it's free, so why the fuck not?
Leag.. nvm enjoy your life salt-free. 
a year ago i would have said robocraft but the devs have made a series of bad decisions and the game just fucking sucks right now 
Dota 2. Unless you're Peruvian. I need some more English speakers.
Unturned.Pretty damn fun survival zombie game, something about scavenging and building a place to survive is so cool to me.
Smites a lot of fun. Think LoL but in third person view, and you can't just click where you want to go and push buttons, so you actually have to aim.Makes the MOBA play type feel a bit more like an action game.
Runescape!
The first chapter of Life is Strange is free on steam. Though of you want the other 4 chapters it's $20 I think.I'd highly recommend giving the first chapter a try thou. It's a really interesting plot and game mechanic, with an active component that significantly changes how your story will progress based on choices.
Unturned, but you need to find a good server to play on.
No man's Sky. Totally free ( of any content)
/r/threadkillers
I am at work so I only browsed the site for a brief second. Am I right in thinking that this is free to play battlefield 2 and battlefield 2142?!! 
Is this even legal? That's what worries me about games like this and Halo Online.
It's worth noting that the guy did EVERYTHING. Art, music, game design, story, everything. He wrote all the music for the game and he's not a musician at all. As a musician myself he did an incredible job and definitely has a good ear.*edit, Yes. Considering he has written a game soundtrack that is highly praised, these days I'd call the guy at minimum a songwriter, but he wasn't when he started the project. That's my point.
Wow, that game was ported to graphing calculators, yet no love for Windows Phone :(
We could use more players.
Oh I'm about to hop on this shit 
>Close Your EyesI try to play this every night.
Instructions unclear. Tried to play it with my eyes closed. 0/10
The learning curve menaces with spikes of iron.
I loved when one of my younger dwarves got a strange mood, and made an artifact depicting the failed kidnapping by goblins in year X.The artist himself was the child that was nearly kidnapped, but saved by his father.
I've tried multiple times and just never grasped how to do anything. I finally built a camp, but how do you dig? Build? Train?
And for those who didn't know, you have to play it through a second time, because once you've beaten the game once it lets you go through and listen to various hilarious tapes scattered throughout the game
I loved it after the grappling hook update.

Somebody really needs to write a summary & beginners intro to Space Station 13 that fits that sweet spot between too short and too long. The game is incredible if you can work past some of its hurdles but its really hard to explain WHY its amazing without getting wordy. 
Have an upvote.   I remember being a part of BYOND back when this was being developed.   Good times.   I miss mutating hostages into monkies. 
Guess I'll give it a go once more.... Tried it years ago, felt like Captain America staring at the circuit board on the floating base. 
I would but Eve sounds more like a job than a game.
Isn't it only becoming free to try? You're limited to the first size of ships and you learn slower than a subbed player? More like wow's level 20 trial than an actual f2p game?
I agree with the recommendation but the combat is easy as fuck and the puzzles are very basic.
SpaceEngine is the most AMAZING thing in the goddamn world, and free. I fucking *adore* SpaceEngine. Oh my God, how is this game not famous?
I can never find any games for this anymore. I used to play the shit out of it many years ago.
This game is so good it blows my mind. And the community is by far one of the best. I played Assassin's Creed and Prototype and multiple combat flight simulators and I can say 100% confidently that *none* of them have given me the same feeling of speed, freedom, and poise that the Warframe controls do. You wanna be a goddamn ninja? Play this game. 
Yep. Played it exclusively for years. A real shame.  I've left it behind now as getting a good scrap on Miller is nigh-on impossible. The second it hits a Bio-Lab, game over. Join in the stale-mate grind or leave. 
I played the shit out of it when it first came out. Not sure if anything had changed but I felt that it wasn't much fun unless you were part of a big group of people. Even playing with 3/4 friends in your own squad wan't much fun because you just couldn't have any impact.
Evolve is free now.... Do you get shit if you bought it?
That game used to be a lot of fun but a lot of the servers I frequented no longer exist. The best was following payload carts. Then they started to make worse and worse payload maps and eliminated a lot of the maps I enjoyed. Then I started to get bored. But when they had the good payload maps I loved that game. Just go as a heavy pushing the cart with your teammates. Either that or medic. LET'S GO UBER. Boom all their sentries and healing down :D
Game is NSFW btw. Unless you disable the scenes.
>TFW you'll never have a crispy bacon gf
This game made me fucking sob like a child. ^Emi^is^best^girl
I've had loads of fun playing this with friends. I wish I had played it before l4d though. 
World of Warships is amazing, especially considering it came from the same company that made world of tanks.
Fractured Space is surprisingly good. And War Thunder's aircraft battles are amazing. I don't like the tanks as much though: used to be good but they fucked arcade mode up really bad.
Just play bard and mute all. Impossible to be mad
It isn't that bad...if you mute everyone and do your own thing. Or have friends to play with. Been running a 5 man this past week in normals/ranked/poro king and having a great time. 
I heard cookiezi is back. Is this true? I stopped playing a few months before he announced he was quitting 
Dota 2 is also authentically free to play, instead of the freemium pay4advantage model.
jajajjaa es mierda ratas^^Please ^^send ^^help
If you want a nice game, don't play this. Source: 4,000 hours 
Just watch out that multiplayer isn't always the most enjoyable experience. Singleplayer is amazing though.
This game got recommended to me a week ago and I fibally gave in and played it. I played through chapter 2 this weekend and HOLY CRAP that ending. It has been quite a while since a game made me spam a button because of the emotional situation. And immediately after I have to stop and think for quite some time about a decision. Last game that managed to get me to do these things was Mass Effect.So far I like it a lot and I would even currently be playing if I wouldn't need to work sometimes...
Everything. BF2, 2142 and all DLC.Best bit, there are a lot (relative) of populated servers world wide. 
I think EA turn a blind eye. In fact, i think some of the guys behind it were in the Sir community, a mod maker for BF2 and community partner. 
I also heard that he programed the software to make the music, because no other software had the sound he wanted. Thats why some of the music has off time signatures mixed with 4/4. The music is definitely up there in the top 5 best soundtacks of all time.
I think ti-86 outnumbers even Android sales by at least 2:1, so don't feel bad.
We could use more players.
How the fuck did I not know this existed 
> Open Your Eyes> I try to play this every morning.-My grandmother.
The player is on the ground, surrounded by dwarves. The player is crying. The dwarves are laughing.

My legendary engraver has an obsession with the disappearance of the old expedition leader.  He draws things like Dwarves surrounding him and him laboring.  Must be very emotional about it, because all of his masterpieces are about the subject.  I like to think it's because my Dwarves are making up theories as to why he disappeared, and the engraver just wants to celebrate his life.  In reality, the expedition leader was just dumb enough to stand under a drawbridge I was testing, which really sucks because he was useful.
This game is way too precise, it's weird. It has that sort of detail you'd expect in supercomputer models.
Where can I find this? And does it install, or can I play it through a browser? I'm really, really bored at work today... 
That isn't a function of x. At certain points you know a lot while simultaneously knowing very little. Sounds like Dwarf Fortresses
I believe that graphic originated with Eve Online (unless it predates it, that's when I first encountered it), which is also mentioned in this thread.
Yeah, but player character is too OP after they get the tranquiler. And it needed more vehicle segments. Overall: game is the best.

What got me was my friend explaining:"It's a futuristic space station where every job is a player, including you. The players just try to keep it running, which goes downhill really fast."I'm paraphrasing, but then that got me interested in his stories.
Haha, I'm a few months in and I'm loving it
What happened that caused the power to go for a whole week?!
Good concept, bad design. Even when it was populated; getting into an actually contested fight was a miracle. 95% of the time it's either Zerging or being Zerged.

Emi is best, but it was the Lilly route (specifically the good end) that made me cry ugly.
Yeah. That company is apparently trying to copyright the term "spooky house" which is utter bullshit
They outsourced its development, and by the time they realized what was happening, too many people fucking loved it.Soon as Warships came along, I abruptly abandoned the Tanks account I'd sunk four years and thousands of dollars into. Warships is just so crazily better in every single aspect.
Don't forget Ivern and Braum! Just listen to their voice lines all day :)
Is it really free to play, if you pay with your soul?
It only gets worse from there, believe me.
Well, my teenage years are back! Bf2 special forces and 2142s titan mode are the most fun I've ever had with online multiplayer. 
I guess it all depends on if EA is still selling battlefield 2 and 2142.
Never had a game where literally every single song I listen to is my new favorite song in a videogame. The art, music, and story are so spot on I can't believe the guys name hasn't been on any more games the Cave Story. Though I don't follow Pixel, I just haven't heard *anything* about him since Cave Story.
That sounds really sexual.
Ohhhh I remember Mari0. That's an oldie
I've come to bargain.
Wondering the same thing myself 
It's not a proper engraving unless an inanimate object/animal is screaming. 
lolYou can sink so much time into this game once you get over the learning curve. Enjoy!
Yeah, I was reading about that. Every time the cats licked themselves to clean themselves they drank alcohol, but the game counted each lick as a full drink so the cats were getting hammered.
Pls no I dont want to be turned into a baby farm
What the fuck.. this game sounds really weird/great. I'm downloading now. I'm going to be pissed if cool shit like this doesn't happen. 
but doesn't multithread (unless it changed recently)
You are going to need more than today to learn it. You need to come in probably 3 weeks worth of time and even then still probably had significantly more investment to go.
"I finally figured out how to build stuff, how the crafting works, what my dwarves need, how to build a hallway full of cage traps, etc.  I've got enough beds for everyone, everybody's happy because I have plenty of diverse food and booze and statues and shit.

I've tried to download this but it was extremely overwhelming to just jump in... Is there some kind of guide or video lets play or something that you would suggest on learning the basics? 
I won't downvote you. Scumbags like you are what make EVE the amazing place that it is ;) 
Yeah I have absolutely no idea what I'm "supposed" to do in that game but I've just been running through single player missions and love it! Hell you can even clear one area then just sit there admiring the view if you want because that game is fucking gorgeous. 
Oh yeah, when you had a fight that was small, like ~16 v ~16 it was really amazing.
The problem was I was tired of the stock maps and there were some community designed ones I liked which started to fade out. Can't really recall the names. Plus I don't have the game on my laptop anymore and I barely see my gaming PC. But I might try it again when I have time. 
Yep. Nobody should be able to copyright something so vague.
I just started playing it about a week ago. I can't get enough already in tier 5 ships for every country except Russia. My friend says it's not a huge accomplishment because now getting new ships is so much of a grind.  
Mother always said: Don't lose!

The player's framerate is screaming in terror.
Wait, so your telling me that this game simulates the cats licking themselves and actually checks the floor they are on to see if they ingest anything? After that the game also checks how much  alcohol the cats have accidently licked to see if it gets alcohol poisoning? How do the devs think of this?!?!
Also, the syndrome that alcohol causes gets worse with each additional exposure if I remember correctly.
>their baby is a million piecesevery one of which is labelled and treated by the game as seperate objects with different stats depending on what body part they are
Is that something that produces a lot of babies, or a very small farm created when two farms expand to have a common border?(I don't play Dwarf Fortress, but judging by the things I've read here and other places about it, either of these seem about as likely.)
It'll happen, but it'll take you a while to understand it and make it happen.  There's a quickstart guide on the wiki, you'll need it.
It didn't. Still, if you reduce the amount of dwarves and regularly clean up behind those ungrateful, drunk, stinking, vomitting, brawling, singing, tantruming,... bastards, it's not much of a problem.
To be fair 3 weeks is a bit much. IMO you can learn how to get a simple fortress running in a couple of days. Then theres the bazillion things you can do on top of that but as you know you'll never be able to try them all.I can recommend captnducks and 51ppycups tutorials on youtube

I swear it was weird seeing him cracking jokes in an American accent. But great movie nonetheless. 
Just built a new computer , spent just a staggering amount of money on parts and peripherals, still playing dwarf fortress. Computer still gets single digit FPS eventually.
By the way, there are only 2 devs.
> How do the devs think of this?!?!They set out to make a game that would simulate *everything* that happened in a world and have been working on it for over a decade.Honestly, you can see just how much they care about the fidelity of the simulation because it came at the cost of interface design...

There is nothing worse than watching a necromancer resurrect every singly bit of that goblin you cut to bits earlier.   I once had a Dwarf get strangled to death by a disembodied hand.
I think he was talking about mermaid farms, I haven't played much but mermaid bones are very expensive so people started making mermaid farms and killing baby mermaids to sell bones. It was patched out obviously.
I've been playing for years and theres still industries I have no idea how they work
999 999 999 999
Trouble is DF is still single threaded. It can't make use of a fancy new CPU. 
and only one programs
It would be amazing if they could make an interface for it.
People have had dwarves strangled by *their own* disembodied hands.
Toady was actually so disturbed by the mermaid farms he changed the value of mermaid bones unfortunately.
Yeah, no way someone would be insane if they grew up living in a water-filled hole in the ground surviving solely on beer and constantly battling a dog.
What the fuck is this game
What does the other do, design the game's cutting edge graphics?
They would go insane. That's why you have mist dance from the ceiling. It's the best way to grow up as a well balanced adult.

Super late response but hopefully someone will see this: you know when someone is standing nearby you can sense their presence bc of a change in pressure? Well imagine you're living in a super high pressure environment where anything is hardly around and a submarine is coming in the distance. Doesn't it make sense that anything with a lateral line that notices a change in pressure would swim away? Imagine the stuff that's out there that we haven't seen bc they noticed we were coming from a mile away and escaped!

Scientists found a shark off the coast of Greenland that they believe is over 400 years old. Think about that. That thing is damn near as old as European colonies in North America!

Golfball sized chunks of hail punctured it's wings and sent it towards the Arctic Ocean. It'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''s disappearance caused widespread controversy, with many people questioning how we could lose such a massive bird in this day and age. Some feathers, measuring 45 feet in length, were reported to have been found at the North Pole, though experts say that there is no way to identify which giant bird it belonged to.
Do you really hope a monster shark has just been chillin in secret all this time?

What about enormous creatures that have incredibly slow and/or efficient metabolisms and rarely emerge for food...?
Im not sure why but I read that with a Sean Connory voice.
Funny thing about never dying of old age and just getting bigger, is that you start being unable to find enough food to sustain yourself and eventually starve to death.
Actually, the biggest lobster is probably under human care. If they get old enough, they get too big for their own good and have a list of issues. 
Though one could theoretically hook a lobster up to a feeding apparatus that pumps the necessary nutrients right into its mouth. It gets bigger and bigger and bigger over the years, and we harvest its flesh which then grows back over time.It'd be a relatively cheap source of lobster meat, all things considered. And it'd seriously cut down on overfishing if we found a way to do that to other animals.

There was this fishing game way back on PS1, you can catch lots of variety of fishes. Near the end of the campaign, you can catch insane fishes like Pharaoh Perch in a pyramid. For the last boss, it's a T-rex. Yup, big old T-rex swimming in murky water, trying to nibble your tiny bait. E: found it : Fisherman's Bait 2: Big Ol' Bass
Ktulu Awaken!!
*Why*?
A thing like that would be infesting the oceans. What modern day predator could compete with it?
WE ARE OUTGUNNED. OUTMANNED OUTNUMBERED OUTPLANNED
I have no idea why this movie isnt Anchorman-famous for its references
That shark has seen some shit.
Of course it's Karl. 
I need something to scale it to to truly understand it's size
Even the lady newscasters "Aaah" had an Australian accent. 
Not entirely sure why, but this video made me pull my dangling leg back onto my bed and safely under the blanket. 
Good old ronon dex

or he just sucks are finding life because his lights were on the whole time!
I'm dissapointed in myself... Took me 3 minutes to realize why there were no pictures of the supposed bird...
*swims to bottom of ocean*Giant fucking shark: ayy finally! What took so long? Want a beer?
Holy fuck me too. Why would anyone do that?! How did they get back up? Did they die? 
THATS JUST WELSHCTHULHU FTAGHN!
It's looking more and more like Cthulu is the correct answer.  
There is a lot of poisonous shit by the shore. Freaking pointy water plants that make your balls shrivel up and fall off. I'd say anything past a small puddle on the sidewalk and you're out of your element.
well that explains the hazy film that keeps washing up on my jetski
I would pay a hefty $17 to see a 45m fish demon in an aquarium some day.
I thought it was "taste like crab, talk like people."
You gotta deal with the school bullies somehow. 
why cant they just eat less and stay a certain size? are they always eating one step ahead of their size?
Well if your claws are big enough, you can start eating sharks, whales, dolphins, londquints, and walruses.
Finally, someone with an actual link and not that meme, even if it is a clickbait article.
God damnit 
Shhh. I prefer to believe there's a monstrously huge lobster down there somewhere, preying on giant squid and horrifying eldritch abominations in the depths of the ocean.
Madness is knowing Cthulhu is a lobster, and we've been eating it's spawn.
sounds like a nice subplot for some atlantis movie/series
Oh shit
They just aren't meant to be that big. It'd be a hell of a test for modern science as the bigger they get, the more issues would pop up.

I doubt they're great a detecting light but I wouldn't be surprised if they detected him and swam away anyway
Because it's missing duh
i genuinely think thats one of the only lines that references the abyss in relation to the sea. a lot of people would say its metaphorical. i'm indifferent. but i guess it makes sensevaati pls
The water is not that dark/black in real life, the camera just didn't adjust to the light. To the person diving, they can see 20+ feet in front of them, this is just like diving to the bottom of a 50 foot pool.
Detach weights, and dive again
Shit. We can't beat cthulhu.  
What? Why? How? I'm scared ._.
Bruh where do you live?
Do you take any opportunity to talk about the fact that you have a jet ski??
It's more a matter of a certain animals' genetics that dictate whether they grow endlessly or stop at a certain point. Besides, most animals don't have a concept of dieting. Their instinct is to eat and reproduce. But once they can't find enough to eat, and they're not a migratory animal, they just starve.

What a fucking horrid way to go blind. 
Jaws was about 23 feet long (7 meters), and that cage is probably 7-8 feet (2.1-2.4 meters) tall, so...this motherfucker right here could easily be 23 feet (7 meters) long.We have met Jaws, and even the Australians are terrified of it.
One of my fav SGA episodes is Midway, the dynamic of Ronon and Teal'c is just perfect. To think I hated the idea of Ronon when he was introduced 
Or they detect non visible light and saw what looked like the fucking sun moving towards them and bolted.
If you believe that Bloodborne takes place in the Souls universe, there's a few references via runes that talk about "great bodies of water" having eldritch connections.
No weights, at -10m you have negative buoyancy so body sinks.
Not with that atitude. 
There there lil rairai. Don't fret. You had no need for those testicles anyway.

This isn't upvoted enough.Australians are afraid of real life Jaws.Because Jaws is the worst kind of demon.
Not with that altitude.
Accurate in the NT. In 30 odd years, I can count on one hand the amount of times I've seen people swim in the ocean up here. Aside from the occasional netted swim comp with lifeguards and everyone wearing 'stinger suits', so they don't die an agonising death from Box Jellies.Not that that'll help with the crocs.. 
I don't know what's more horrifying, a lopster eating me, or a lopster reproducing with me.

For just a millisecond?
You have ocean crocs?
What's a lopster?
Not in those doses but it's thought to be carcinogenic and can cause blood clotting issues in some people so precautions need to be taken if those people are on medication. 
The book and the film mind fucked me in different but equally fucky ways. God, the jellyfish....
One of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time imho. Movies like Sphere, Event Hoirzon, Sunshine, Moon ect fuck me up way more than any of the traditional "horror" movies
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Yup. Salties can lurk in freshwater rivers, on the beach or even catch ocean currents and travel hundreds of kilometres. Surprisingly active beasties. Most people stay out of the ocean, so we don't get too many attacks there. (Though a kite surfer got attacked a few years back). We usually lose a few people a year, fishing in the rivers/creeks. Usually get ya while leaning over the side, retrieving lures on the banks or they'll just overturn the boat. 
Event Horizon is such a good damn movie.
Now I'm the model of a modern major general

As an amateur alcoholic, I cringe when I see someone walk into a party with an $80 bottle of whiskey only to mix it with Coke.
This is going to sound stupid but colored handcuffs. They are not insanely expensive but we have had a HUGE fad of officers buying colored handcuffs and shit (I do security) and wearing like 3 or 4 or 8 pairs of handcuffs on one belt. It drives me fucking crazy. 
Graphic designer here.Almost any holistic or natural health shop uses Papyrus as their logo's font. What a terrible font.
Professional pilot here, and while not a hobby it makes me cringe to see student pilots wearing 4-bar epaulets. I think you get the right to wear 4 bars as captain with thousands of hours of experience flying hundreds of people around, not flying yourself around in a Cessna 172 there Maverick
Teavana teas. They're not awful, but they're really overpriced, and their sales strategies are a pain in the ass ("Oops, I poured too much in the bag, is that alright?").
I've gotten in fights before over Leon Paul fencing equipment. Outrageously expensive equipment that I have never found to be any better than much cheaper domestic vendors like Absolute Fencing. I mean, I've known plenty of incredible fencers with Leon Paul gear that suits them just fine, but if you go to a tournament and see some low-skill maximum-aggression jackass walking around like he owns the place, I can guarantee you he'll be decked out in Leon Paul.
Free Pornhub is just as good as your fancy premium Pornhub.
Firefighter here. Any of those "I fight what you fear" type hero-worship shirts are super cringeworthy in our field. 
Addi interchangeable knitting needles. I'm a knitter, and I hear about these knitting needles constantly. I've seen them go anywhere from $130 to $200, and everyone is always insisting that they are far superior to other needle brands. I've been legitimately looked down on for using a cheaper brand of interchangeable knitting needles. I'm all for having preferences. Please, if you want or love your Addis, have a heyday. But my work isn't inferior to yours just because I knitted them on Clovers or Boyes. =\

Kink: Fifty Shades of Grey brand anything. Its all garbage from the 20 dollar ruler to their shitty pleather floggers. One can get any amount of great gear with the slightest google for a fraction of the price. They are simply riding off the name of a horrid franchise that has public recognition.
Reddit is diverse as fuck
i have just learned that i don't have a hobby
Fashion watches, or, watches from brands that aren't known for their watches.
Monster audio cables, you don't always get what you pay for.
Reebok mma shirts
Anything marketed with the "gaming" label. Seriously, you give something LED lights, a cheap aggressive design, write "GAMING" on the box, and you have an army of ignorant gamers ready to pay whatever price you slap on there.
Cabelas tents are seen the same as Walmart tents in the eyes of avid outdoor enthusiasts. 
Wayne Goss brushes.First he tried making a big deal about make-up brushes being to expensive and wanting to do a quality line but at affordable rates. My ass $215 brush set is affordable. Better quality lines for less, and far superior for slightly more, like Hakuhodo.
I feel this is a good thread to advertise /r/buyitforlife
Rubik's brand speedcubes.  A regular Rubik's brand is pretty much the worst cube out there.  Their "speedcubes" are a bit better but they don't even hold a candle to a decent knock-off speedcube.  Plus I don't even think you can tension a Rubik's brand.  Tensioning lets you adjust how tightly the cubelets are held in.  Too loose and you might pop, too tight and it'll be tough to turn quickly. Everyone has a different tension they like.
When people use the term "big data" for a database they have with a few million records.  It's a pretty sure sign that they don't know what they're talking about.  Unless the amount of data coming in every second is enough to give you a panic attack it's just a database.
Im into archery, and when people new to the sport walk in with 120# $5000 compound bows they can't even shoot correctly. Learn how to ride a bike before you ride backwards on a unicycle, if you know what I mean.**EDIT**: I'm getting some replies about people interested in archery, I highly recommend checking out /r/archery it's a pretty helpful community for beginners and they can answer most of your questions.

Modern Harley motorcycles. Not into the hobby myself, but I've been raised and around enough of them to know that many motorcycleists have the same general acceptance that after the 80's, Harley generally became trash and became more focused on becoming a brand than a product.
Moleskine notebooks. They are extremely overpriced notebooks when you can find much better made, cheaper notebooks to feel like a famous lyricist/poet/Ernest Hemingway.
Providing an average without a standard deviation
Kylie Cosmetics. Too expensive for the quality...
"Boutique" instrument effects pedals. You're paying extra for hand wired equipment with unique paint jobs. A $500 Tubescreamer knockoff is going to sound just like a $100 Tubescreamer, but you get to brag to your friends that your 20th pedal on your board is a different shade of green.
But it could be Ovi...

I couldn't take a cop or security guard seriously if he or she whipped out a pair of pink or blue handcuffs. "Is this Disneyland?!"
Wait... people actually do that? I wouldn't dream of doing that shit. Except maybe five stripes as a joke. Have these students never heard the phrase "earning your stripes"? 
I'm really not a tea person but when I was a Starbucks employee and teavana was introduced in store to replace tazo, a lot of people were really unhappy. Most of their teas are really gimmicky and have a added flavour. I guess that's fine and if people like it, that's ok, but it's definitely different from tea as I grew up understanding it.
I know not everyone that is into fencing is rich, but i'm totally picturing you sitting at a giant mahagony desk in golf clothing with a greyhound sitting next to you while you type this. "Isn't that right miffy, leon paul is for douchebags".
Please tell me it was a fencing fight you had rather than a fistfight?!
Pornhub is entry level anyways. Do xvideos if you want to find some specific videos and don't mind seeing thumbnails of gross shit.
Not quite the same, but I'm in the Air Force, currently doing training on a Navy base. There's a dude that regularly wears a shirt to the mess that says:"Stay low, go fast. Kill first, die last. One shot, one kill. No luck, all skill."And every time I see him all I can think is like, dude you're an electronics technician in the fuckin' Navy. You ain't killing shit.
You mean like those "My sport is your sport's punishment" shirts the cross-country team always wears?

I've tried duolingo and have enjoyed it, but I feel that their website gives an intro to reach lesson that the app doesn't, it's kind of frustrating when it asks you to spell a word you've literally never seen, but it has helped me remember some of them. I've just got to get back on the wagon. 
Thoughts on Pimsleur?
Also, don't get me started on the yarn and yarn snobs. I'll take James C Brett and Stylecraft over 'luxury' brands any day :D

Wait, they make glass cutting boards? Fuck no, plus won't that end up in the food? Also, a lot of people don't realize that restaurant supply stores are open to the public, they're missing out on some seriously good shit. A few good cambro pans will last you forever, and not melt or retain a nice sheen of orange grease and old food stank also.
As a good friend of mine said: I get all my sex gear from Bunnings (Australian hardware store).
Are they even worth talking about?  Seemed like the brand never really took off.  I'd say a better comparison would be no-name shit off Amazon.  Not that it's all terrible, but you get what you pay for in most cases, and with the lack of pictures, info, and reviews most of the stuff has it's hard to tell what you're even paying for in the first place.
I have been asked "Why is my computer so slow?" As they maintain a spreadsheet with ~1,000,000 rows and auto-calculate turned on. Excel is not a database.
And people are passionate as fuck about stuff I'd never give a second thought about, like knitting needles.
Nurse here.  They sell that shit for us, too.  They're awful.  
I'm by no means an air softer. But back in high school my friends and I would play in the the woods at each others houses. I got a gillie on sale. It's been a lot of stupid fun. Now it's the greatest hide and go seek prop ever. But back when it was used in air soft you just needed to hide and eventually they'd get close enough for you to shoot them, it could take a hour. But you'd giggle to your self as they looked right at you.  
Do you mean watches from Gucci, Dior, etc. ?
Fake subdials are what I can't stand most about fashion watches. 
I feel the same way about Citadel/Games Workshop paints.  It's less a case of direct quality and more the case that you're paying twice as much money for half as much paint compared to Vallejo or P3, in a deliberately wasteful capped format designed to ruin as much of the paint as possible.
I thought the mouthpiece was the thing to invest in.
That's part of the Derelicte line
Holy crap! $600 for that?!

I actually went with an ASUS gaming motherboard because I liked its specs. It does have lots of stupid bullshit like pulsating LEDs but otherwise has been a solid board. At least you can turn off that crap.

Well Black Diamond always struck me as being the loudest, marketing-wise, but yeah it's definitely a sport where no one can churn out cheap gear without facing liability problems in the near future.  If they print 22kn on their biner, then by damn it'll hold 22kn (shut).
> Fireclean lubeWasn't sure where this hobbie was going.
Nothing beats the smell of Hoppes and Rem Oil. Not even deep fried brass. 
I'm not a huge brush snob. Most of my brushes are IT Cosmetics, Real Techniques, and the Hakuhodo J line, but damn if I don't love the Wayne Goss Airbrush.
From the people I've seen that use them they are VERY nice brushes. But unless you're a well paid make up artist (if those exist) It's just not worth it. It's really funny that his brushes are so expensive because I follow his YouTube and he's always seems laid back and tries to save you money by telling you when shit is a scam/not worth the money. 
It is pretty well known that Hakuhodo actually produces Wayne Goss brushes. Just like Chikuhodo also crafting Suqqu brushes. 
They sell Skullcandy all over the United States. I don't think anyone thinks they are premium, but kids like the designs and they are cheap.
They're still around, still rebranding chinese OEM whitelabel designs with a 500% markup.
American here. I bought a pair of skullcandy headphones nearly ten years ago and they still work. Not the best headphones ever, and they've probably only lasted so long since I don't use them often.
While I agree that Rubik's brand cubes don't come close to real speed cubes, I'd call the real Beats of the speed cubing industry V-Cube. Their cubes are low quality, and ridiculously overpriced. Beyond that, they use their vague patents to take advantage of other cube companies that actually have much better cubes with designs that are not vert similar.
TIL speedcubes are a thing
what is the point of them though.
What the fuck does anyone need a 120# bow for?! I can hardly get past the break point on a 75# bow and the guy who owns it shoots elk with it.

Hey now, no other biwheeled product is as efficient at turning gasoline into noise without the byproduct of horsepower.
I don't like the names Kyshadow and Kyliner
What about my $3000 Klon :(
Similarly, when Gibson tried to change up their whole style in 2015, too. The non-tapered necks, unnecessary robo-tuners, and extreme price raising. They definitely care more about having the "best guitar brand" title that they've had for so long, more than they care about the quality of their instruments
Hahaha no sorry. 
A lot of officers get differently colored cuffs so theirs don't get mixed up with other officer's cuffs. 
Here in Spain we have a chain called The tea shop, if they put more than you asked for they only charge the quantity you asked for, because if you try that bullshit as a sales strategy, you always lose the sale. Always.
I'm guessing they sell by weight.
You ask for 50g, they pour it in and weight it up and it's 59g. Oops? Is that ok? 
Read in the voice of Patrick Stewart. It was fantastic.

In my hometown (Small town, Indiana), every firefighter is obese, and every volunteer firefighter is morbidly obese.  You'd have to be a complete nutcase to not even make volunteer status.  We've had at least one case of a volunteer doubling as an arsonist.When they all get amped up for a big fire, and the whole structure inevitably burns down, the police always congratulate them on "another foundation saved."
Volly FF here, those guys are called "wackers" and every firehouse seems to have one. Can't pass any written test because they are legitimately low IQ, can't drag hose or do anything physical, hopeless at EMS, but they already bought all the t-shirts and already told mommy they're a fireman.
That's actually kind of funny.  Seems like more of a joke at their own expense.
Dollar store headphones....
I choose herradura.
Is that what I was doing wrong? I was using their app to brush up on my high school and college German, and I was disturbed by how it didn't explain the conjugations; it just throws them at you in sentences. I never looked at the website.

You see, now I feel bad for the snakes that people buy without knowledge of snakes. Their lives must suck.
I think glass boards were more of a thing in the 80s because they fit the decor better
Id say thats pretty damn close!
Can attest. I get as many bites on my homemade lures I half assed as my couple of fancy realistic lures. Only reason I own them is I thought they looked neat and were worth a shot.Only exception here is fly fishing. Fish that eat bugs have sharper eyes to spot bugs so a little extra effort when tying your fly helps.
And burberry and daniel wellington yes. Very very marked up, for quite poor build quality. 
Or chronograph buttons that don't do anything. Even worse is the submariner esque dial that doesn't rotate
I know what you mean,. I have a big collection of Vallejo, army painter and scale 75.  However gw paints are very good quality, some of them anyway. Mephiston red, agrax earthshade, they have the best collection of beiges also imo. So kind of agree but wouldn't see it as a wasted money.  Their carry cases, limited edition codexs, however would also be something I would see as similar to beats. 
It definitely is. I got one of them fancy, expensive wooden clarinets (for concerts; used a plastic student one for marching band) and I still bought a separate mouthpiece to go with it. I definitely don't see the benefit in buying a fancy *bell*. In my experience the bell seems to mostly be decorative. I mean, there's a sound difference when the clarinet doesn't have a bell, but it's not super noticeable. So I don't see what possible benefit an expensive, custom-made, handcrafted bell would have other than aesthetics. (Mine has a fancy carving design on it! :D Nobody has ever noticed.)
It's kinda amazing that Zoolander predicted what fashion would be like 15 years later.

> he's always seems laid back and tries to save you money by telling you when shit is a scam/not worth the money.That's what I was thinking. He has a couple videos just about affordable products. In one he tests out a bunch of e.l.f. products and says they're all pretty good. In one video he outright says not to spend a lot of money on kohl eyeliners because one company makes all the pencils or something like that. Weird to me that his brushes don't reflect that mindset.
I used to live about an hour from Sturgis. Literally saw a truck and trailer pull into the gravel parking lot across the street, unload 3 bikes, and then proceed to roll around in the dirt for a few seconds to make themselves look dirty. Fucking hated bike week...
I still use Skullcandy for earbuds. They're not terrible quality, not terribly expensive, and they fit in my ear comfortably.Granted, the skullcrushers I ditched within a year of getting them. Way too heavy.
I haven't seen anything vcube in years, I assumed they phased out of popularity after shengshou improved all their mechs
/r/cubers
Oh yeah man!  They're great.  If you can solve a Rubik's cube at all I'd recommend one.  They're almost always actually cheaper than name brand "Rubik's" cubes!
- They keep your arms warm- People may like how they feel- They look cool
If we're talking about those brands that are far better for cheaper, I'd say the best ones are Pilot and Pelikan (my personal opinion).There are also plenty of other brands, which are also definitely better bang for your buck than Montblanc, just not as good as Pilot and Pelikan imo.(Lamy, Platinum, to name a couple)
>What the fuck does anyone need a 120# bow for?!Killing Frenchmen in plate armour.
What I would guess, from reading a lot of historical military fiction lately: killing a man wearing plate armor.Come to think of it, now I'm curious whether you could drive an arrow through a bulletproof vest...ETA: okay, I get it, you totally can. TIL that bulletproof vests are not arrow-proof vests.
Not so fast... how many tennis balls?

I love this joke as much as the next rider, but I made it to a co-worker who was a long time Harley rider before he started riding sport touring bikes. He laughed and explained it's largely that once you own a Harley, everyone starts buying you Harley shirts as gifts. As in, nearly every gift he received while he owned the bike was a Harley shirt. I guess it's easier than trying to come up with something novel that reflects your understanding of the gift receiver's personality.
I have a 1980 Fat Bob, and was flat out told by my local Harley dealer that I shouldn't even bother to come in as they have nothing for my bike and aren't interested in ordering anything. And I don't own a single t-shirt. 
And do it as expensively as H-D. Man their bikes are pricey compared to similar sized bikes from other brands. I briefly considered Harleys (I admit I liked the Fat Bob) and the salesman told me flat out, "we are selling a lifestyle, we're a lifestyle brand." Uhhh, no thanks, I'm actually looking for a motorcycle...
This reminds me of the South Park episode where all the bikers ride through town making engine noises with their mouths

I speak fluent German and decided to play with Duolingo a while back. I found the complete lack of grammar training to be unbearable. As much as people hate learning grammar (unless you're a nerd like me and love it!), you absolutely need to learn it. A language like German is impossible to speak properly without understanding grammar. 
WHAT!?I can't fucking comprehend this... I need time to process sleeping with a snake....
The boots thing sounds awesome, but you do that with a beloved dog and people think you're weird.
People are afraid of meat juice contamination, so they use glass or plastic instead of wood.  A friend of mine posted the other day that wood cutting boards are unsafe and part of the reason people get sick.I haven't had a glass cutting board since my dog turned on the stove while I was out of the room and the fucking thing exploded. (you know because I'm a moron and left it sitting on top of the stove after I was finished - didn't want to toss it in the sink because I thought it would break.) 
I've had an ~~Encore~~ Epiphone Les Paul and cheap chipboard type Encore beginner guitar. While the sound wasn't as sweet on the Encore it played well and kept tuning just as good too.

Things like this made a lot more sense when I realized that for some people, the fun of a hobby is the gear. They'll spend a ton of time trying to figure out what the "best"/coolest gear is, save up for it, display it in their house, etc.They use it only as a justification for their real hobby of researching and buying gear.
Fossil makes most of those brands' watches. Burberry, Michael Kors, Adidas, Marc Jacobs, Emporio Armani, Diesel, etc
I have a buddy who owns an Invicta diver-style watch...and the bezel has, instead of numbers, the text "I N V I C T A" printed around it.

There was your chance to resell Monster Cables using your employee discount!
It was actually a parody of a real Galliano show themed after homeless people in France. 
Pretty sure I first saw it in the Goblet of fire when they go to watch the the world cup

Yeah same, I actually like the earbuds they're quite cheap and alright quality 
This entire time I've just assumed people that used those had problems with their joints or something.... and now I've just found out that 9/10 people are just wearing these as fashion symbols. Holy shit what is life.
I wear one at my office job so that people know I'm the real deal.
I'll second Pilot, and so will most of the folks over at /r/fountainpens.Pilot has fantastic pens across the budget spectrum, and the Metropolitan is one of *the* go-to starter fountain pens.

Flashbacks to that archer in the Brotherhood who says "Never hold" when he's teaching Arya to shoot better. And then other people show up and he holds the draw on his bow for 10+ seconds.
Just turn around I guess. 
Okay, so what the hell is this subreddit? Is this like subreddit simulator? 
Please elaborate.
Slept with a red tailed boa (Scorsby) about 8 feet long.One night I had a nightmare someone was putting a cold hand and sliding it across my face.It was Scorsby, so I put her back in the cage after that.I'm proud to say that even after a couple dates that wouldn't even come into my apartment because of her, I kept her and she lived to be over 20 years old.
I'm definitely doing something when my doggy goes. I'm not sure exactly what, but he is sticking around with me. I joke and say i am going to get him stuffed so he can still sit with me by my computer, but that would probably just depress the shit out of me. 
I used to play on an Ibanez GIO bass. I almost never tuned that sucker. Typically, I'd start tuning it, notice it was already in tune and start just absolutely playing the hell out of it. Because I sucked. And I was 16. And never got laid. Because the bass player never gets laid. Unless your name is Flea.
I'm not saying they have to be pretty, just that you need to be slightly more aware of the visual aspect since they're so visual. I probably phrased it bad.
Whatre you trying to show us? I dont see anything
Do you mean Jacob for Marc Jacobs, for Marc by Marc Jacobs?
I remember reading about an ex Best Buy employee that made a shit ton of money doing this! 
It's kinda amazing that Zoolander predicted what fashion would be like in the past.
Bullshit, a real mountaineer tames two moose to stand 12' apart all night while they sleep in the hammock, accompanied by two wild wolves for warmth.
I wear one not because basketball but because I pack boxes all day and it keeps the cardboard from irritating my skin. It's my PPE.
Serious question.  Do you just like them, are they for calligraphy, is it just a neat hobby?Personally I draw and illustrate, but I've never met anyone doing ink illustrations who wouldn't take a $30 set of dip pen nibs and some high quality ink and paper over a $100+ fountain pen, but it could just be I've never encountered them.  I always see them and I wonder who buys them, just curious.
Usually it's a nightmare of a snake sliding over your face and it turns out to be a cold hand 
One time I unknowingly bought illegal drugs thinking it was fishing bait, and even that worked just fine, I'll tell you what.
But for serious, what the fuck is going on with that. I used to work right next to the Copenhagen offices (same building) and besides Marc Jacob inception they were also really fucking loud at their meetings. As in they yelled at each other it seemed and we could almost follow the basics through the wall....
The story I heard was that a employee would buy the cables. Then turn around and give them to a friend who would return them with "no receipt" and get full price store credit. Then uses that store credit to but whatever he wanted 
Not all mountaineers are Canada bred
Shit I should start doing this. I pack air plane parts for 8 hours a day and my arms are always shredded up by the end of my shift.
Can confirm. Have climbed in Panama, Ecuador, and Peru. Use jaguars for warmth.
What about... Long sleeve shirts?
Still dont have a clue...
Do paramedics count? I responded to a call from a father who needed help applying medicinal cream to his 13 year old daughters vagina to heal her STD. He said he tried to do it himself but it was "swollen shut".... I just brought her to the hospital.
My cousin is a cop and he responded to a call on Valentine's Day night. A 12 year old girl called in to say her mother had blown her brains out in the living room. I guess her and her brother were getting ready for dinner and the mom just shot herself. He said the creepy thing about it was dinner all set up, drinks on the table and suddenly she shot herself. Kids were sitting outside when he arrived, to this day I can't imagine Valentine's Day for them. But I know that is something that stuck with him seeing that. 
It was a stormy night on the Oregon Coast.  A lady was driving drunk and ran into the back of a parked school bus.  When she did, her car caught on fire, but she was able to escape.  When I found her slowly walking down a side street, I was telling her to stop and turn around.  When she turned around, her lower jaw was gone, and she was totally dazed.  Her tongue was sticking straight out the top of her neck, and she was trying to talk.  She ended up surviving but needed tons of plastic surgery.  
My dad was on the freeway, and saw a guy in a big truck (it may have been a mail carrier?) that was swerving and driving crazy. He pulled him over, and the driver's hands were shaky and covered in blood. It turns out he had a prostitute in the back of his truck that he had killed not long before. 
I once went to a two fatality car crash. The cars had collided head on in a 55mph zone. One of the drivers had left the house suicidal, and it was surmised that he picked a car out at random and went straight into it. I had spoken with that man several weeks prior and seeing his skeleton in the burned up car was a little creepy. I won't describe the rest of the scene, but the worst part of it is...This was Christmas Day. Not a merry Christmas at all. 
Are we accepting "Not me but a cop I know" stories?  My cousin is on in a major city, apparently 911 got a call from a 6 year old claiming **VEHEMENTLY** that there was a zombie outside of his house on the street.  So a patrol car swings around to see what's up.Turns out a tweaker on meth gouged out his own eyes, had blood dripping down from the empty sockets, and was stumbling around blindly with his hands stretched out in front of him.  Goddamn, turns out the kid was telling the truth!
Not sure if other define it as creepy, but my father responded to a call (on call firefight/paramedic) to an attempted suicide. When they arrived they found the dude, who had attempted to hang himself using barbed wire from the nearby fencing thinking it would be more effective, it instead degloved his face from the chin up. 
Not a cop, but this is a story my drivers Ed teacher(retired state patrol in Maine) told us. Its more of a sad, horrible story than creepy... He got a domestic dispute call from the neighbors of the people. When he got there he could smell something like meat burning. It was a man and a woman. The woman had no arms and the man had pushed her onto their wood burning stove or something and she couldn't get herself up so she just rolled off of it and cause more burns. She didn't die, but had terrible burns. He said he could still smell it vividly. Edit : women -> woman
Not me, but my grandfather was a detective for 30 yrs. A guy committed suicide by taking a hatchet turning the blade to his face, and swinging down on a tree branch so the hatchet came back and sliced half his face off. Bled to death. 
Not a cop, but worked with an animal control officer who had to go with the cops into a house of an old lady that no one had heard from in a while. She had passed away quite a few days before, and left behind two large dogs. The dogs were hungry, so by the time they got there, the dogs had eaten most of her.
Not a cop, but work within a school district and have heard some pretty unfortunate stories about reported abuse. Any time a child says their dad/coach/aunt/cousin/sibling/pastor touched their peepee/whoha/cookie/flower/weewee/dingdong it's creepy. Worst are the ones that mention it to a grown-up but don't know the real word so teacher thinks the "flower" the kid mentions is an actual flower. Moral of the story - penis, vagina, testicles, labia, clitoris, breasts... Get comfortable with the real words and teach them to your kids. 
Woman was driving in the passing lane of a major highway. On the other side of the road, headed the opposite direction, the tire of an eighteen wheeler pops off. It jumps the median and finds its final resting place in the chest cavity of our patient.  I find this one creepy because there is absolutely no I rhyme or reason to it. This could happen to anyone at any time. This could happen to you or your mother tomorrow and there is nothing you can do about it. Dead before you know what happened. 
A guy was at a park masturbating at around 10pm at night, and I was the first to respond...Called another unit to help me, saying he was resisting arrest, (which he was...)... and I made the other unit arrest him... we wore gloves.  Thankgod.
Not a cop,But my college friend told me he walked in on an od'd crack head that had microwaved her own newborn daughter.
Some sort of inter-dimensional being must have put that cocaine in the center console.  Or maybe the dude's truck roamed around at night trying to get high off human drugs.  Who knows?  Certainly not the man driving, who the truck was registered to, and who had a history of controlled substance arrests.

I'm just wondering how a neighbor is close enough to notice he hasn't seen him in a few days but not close enough to see a giant fire. 
Way to stop a secret agent you dick. Mr. Hoover is going to be pissed when he finds out you foiled his plans   
How does one "do it right"? I'm genuinely curious. 
As someone who's worked at a cemetery, burying a baby was my cracking point. I didn't last long after that. I only worked there as a landscaper (very small town, iy was me and the funeral home owner who worked a 1000+ plot cemetery). When my boss hopped down into the grave and very casually asked me to hand him the casket, which was barely bigger than a microwave, I did so with the image of it being my 2 year old son. A week later I quit. He understood and we are still friends today. I feel ya. And thank you for the job you do that most will never see.
Supervisor be like "It says here he's a donor... We really need brains"
Did he ever say why he did it? 
The fact that you spoke to these people at or near the time this happened, puts you there. That is a heavy burden and thank you for doing what you do. 
Those poor kids. 
Get rid of the gold chain........... somethins off 
Wow.  To think that this could have been how I ended up. Except I survived my time in the dumpster and was rescued weighing 2 lb.  Thank you guys for what you do.
Ok this one is worst ever. Beats the guy cataloging someone else's shit in ziplock bags
One of my work colleagues was on jury duty for a case where a lady of the evening died on the freeway after falling out of a pickup truck. The driver's defense was that "out of nowhere, for no reason, she just opened the door and jumped out while we were in the middle of the freeway."
How can u try to run from a k-9 unit
Why on earth would they get him to help with the body removal? Surely he would be excused on compassionate grounds? I'm sorry he had to go through that :(

It's one thing to want to take your own life, but how dare you take someone else with you.
"Mostly dead is slightly alive"
That's the kind of thing my immigrant Christian parents attribute to demons, I've heard similar stories. Honestly not sure what to make of it.
This one may win as "creepy"
Ok, that ending, what the fuck.
Strangely common. My senior year of HS a lower classman slept on the train tracks adjacent the school because his girlfriend broke up with him.
That reminds me of the story of the woman who stabbed and ate part of her newborn child. Her sister found her in the middle of it and freaked. Mum just sat down on the couch and waited calmly for the police. They showed up and she pulled a knife out of her shirt and just calmly slammed it into her stomach. I'm pretty sure she survived
The rider survived? How the fuck? What was the lasting damage to him like do you know?
god damn...that sounds weird as fuck. i didn't know blood did that either.
THIS is why I don't do drugs
Oh man, I bet they hung themselves in the attic so their kids didn't walk in on that sight.
WELL HOW DID ALL OF THIS HAPPEN?!
Did someone break into their home, beat the husband and rape the wife?
What was the "official" reason for two kids dying at the same time in such little water?  
Burglar/necrophiliac was pretending to be a corpse and ran out when you weren't looking.Or the start of the next Mummy movie.
>Went out to do whatever I could expecting to see some poor old bugger who'd keeled over and carked it on the oval because of a dodgy ticker or whatnotCan you explain what this means in a way that a simple American may understand?
> The worst part for me was having to call it in on the radio, knowing the mother might hear it inside from one of the other officers radio.I was in search and rescue and we had the same sort of issue - there is often family around the search site.  We had a policy that you say you "found a red shoe" which meant that we were to switch to an alternative channel (which we were not licensed for so that the news could not listen in) and the CO's were supposed to move away from any family members.May be worth setting up something similar in your area.
See, I do my best not to be an overprotective parent, then I read shit like this.
I mean someone could have easily been creeping up on you, and she saved your life by scaring them off
You were about to get ganked and she pinged you to safety. Gotta ward and watch out for those mid lane roams 
What was the outcome? If you could still smell the alcohol the person must have still been around.
I grew up on a family farm in rural Indiana with a patch of untilled & still-forested land in the middle of the field behind the house. Exactly twice have my friends and I encountered wandering strangers while messing around down there after dark. Both times resulted in them quickly disappearing after realizing they weren't alone. Can confirm - always hair-raisingly creepy.
Probably those lemon stealing whores
Oh god. Speaking of rigor mortis gas... my friend worked at a retirement home for years. A resident died and the undertaker came but didnt have anyone to help him. My friend agreed to help him out to be nice. They went to the dead ladys room and she was laying on the couch with her legs resting on the back of the couch. She was in rigor mortis so my friend tried to bend her legs to get her to lie flat. When he did that gas came right out of her butthole into his face. He said he will never forget the smell.
> Just talked about this, but the worst was a dad dropped a giant floor tv on his toddler. Flattened the kids head like a pancake (ok not that flat but it was definitely badly mis-shapen). Eyes were bulged out. The child lived for about 4 or 5 hours with a flat head.Wait, it was an accident, or was the dad trying? I'm not even sure why I'm asking, because both are really sad.
Its amazing when people that have literally molested children act like outraged victims when theyre being questioned.
Good lord that's terrifying. It's one thing when it's just you but entirely another when you see something and it's verified by another person in real time.
Goodness that's dark.As a cat owner, I do appreciate you adding that last detail that the cat went to a good home.
How the fuck did he get out of the room...
Thanks for giving me a new irrational fear.
When you say he was resisting. Do you mean he was trying to assert his dominance?
Is there not any kind of protocol to where you should call EMT regardless in that situation? I'm surprised pulse wasn't the first thing to check before concluding he was dead. 
A guy on my old squad responded to his first suicide while on FTO and the dude used TWO Desert Eagles. One on each side of his head.
> Don't mind my English, I'm from Europe.It's alright; we speak English here too!
Maybe the whispering was also caused by some wind? Or did it sound vocal/human?
that's enough internet for today. How fucking sickening and tragic. 
I really hope this isn't real, because I vaguely remember this being a scene in some movie or TV show (where the character decided to quit law enforcement afterwards). I really, really want this comment to be fiction.
This happened in my hometown except the mom was having a post-partum psychotic break. You cannot fuck around with post-partum psychosis. 
On a similar note, isn't it funny how every drunk driver has only had "a couple of beers"? They must have really upped the ABV of Busch Lite.
That was one of my questions as well. Rural areas are wired like that
When the S.W.A.T. team has to destroy a wall because they can't get through your barricade, you've done it correctly.
The bathroom cabinet was right next to the door. So she opened all 3 drawers on the door knob side of the door (it opened inward). Then she wedged a metal handle broom against the middle hinge and a metal handle mop against the middle of the door. Every time a SWAT guy tried to go through the door it just dented the door. One guy put his leg through the door up to his knee and she started trying to stab him with one of the knives. They went through the wall shortly after that (just cut through the sheetrock). 
Yep. His parents were drunks and lived an alternative lifestyle. On the night he he killed them he said his dad tore into him pretty good - calling him a loser this and a loser that; he was a mistake; shouldn't have been born. But he said what threw him over the edge was his dad calling him a half a man. He flew in to a rage and choked him out. Mom watched and did nothing. She realizes dad is dead and says something to the effect that dad was right about him and son gave it to her too. Girlfriend helped clean up the bodies and dispose of them. She flipped and testified.  
Straw that broke the camel's back.
No one believes you when you tell this to people in real life. All of the oldest brothers on my dad's side have had the same ring with a ruby and a diamond and all of them have died under the age of 55. We tried to get rid of it after my dad died at 45 (we were going to throw it in the hudson), but for some reason everyone wants to tempt fate and my uncle has it.
Link, please? It's simultaneously too late and just late enough for this shit.
Isn't that adequate for "beyond a reasonable doubt"? People *do* jump out of vehicles at highway speeds occasionally.
You don't. My German shepherd has a hell of a sprint. She's a part of the family unit though and just asks for her ball once she catches me. If she gives me a head start, I can make it a few yards before she's on me. I always make her give me a really good head start or else it's no fun.
Pretty much. Rail thin, soft spoken, and I will never get over his fingernails that were too long and tobacco stained.  
None of us were sure what to make of it. I was firmly of the opinion that she was just severely mentally ill but one of the paramedics was looking round the house for some of this magic powder...
Hi pay me thousands of dollars and I too will happily pee somewhere in your house!
A kid in my home town laid his head on the tracks bc he tweeted he was gonna kill himself and someone responded saying he didn't have the balls or some shit. Ppl are fucked up.
Post-partum psychosis. 
First big car wreck I worked as an EMT, the senior medic gave me the duty of mopping out the ambulance. Blood coagulation is a strange thing. It reminded me of hair like jello. Very strange
When I hacked up the brown clot from my tonsillectomy, the nurse walked in and said "oh Good" and holy fuck did it freak me out. I "went to sleep" in the OR and wake up in this white sheet room, hacking up this brown thing all over my chest and I'm greeted with "oh good"? I thought for at least ten seconds that I was in a weird murder hospital and that I wouldn't be making it out alive. Then they brought out Popsicles and I calmed down. 
Yeah... apparently he was pretty confused upon waking from the high in the hospital, and asking why he was blind....
Yeah OP. I need to know how the hell that happened. It sounds terrifying for those children.
Imma take a wild guess and say drowning? 
It's not odd. Bodies don't decompose for 2-3 days at room temp. They can be stored in the fridge for about a month, freezer long term. In cold climates, the ground freezes and they hold them until it thaws for the actual burial if there's not a religious issue.I'm not a funeral director, but I work at a funeral home.
Nah, we just secured the building and left.  We get a lot of calls like this.  This particular one was just weird because of the setting and the perfume.
Ah sorry mate. I expected to find some old gent who had been jogging die from a heart attack.
Our policy was to switch to mobile phones.
The best form of protection is education. Make sure that your kids know how to spot a potentially dangerous situation and what to do in one rather than attempting to keep them away from anything dangerous.
My friends son died when playing in the basement on some boxes and things.  He climbed on top of something and slipped or jumped off and his hood caught on something on the way down and he hung himself.  Just a little kid.  Playing pretend...... There's nothing you can do to eliminate accidents in this world all together, but there's something to be said for being over protective when paying attention was all it would've taken to save a child from dying in such a needless way. 
Sure, its possible.
I like to turn off the mini-map for the immersion and full-experience
We towed the truck, ran the plates, got his home address, and found him there. Did the usual "I have no idea why my truck was out there" routine. Not much we could do. But I saw his truck in impound for months after that. Guess he couldn't afford to get it out.
10 year old me used to wander into the fields surrounding town just to explore those untilled forest patches.   Every farm near town appeared to have one.    You'd find ruins of old buildings,  and ponds filled with frogs.  Abandoned tents, and collections of shopping carts with random objects like blankets and tv's in them.      10 year old me was adventurous,  but none to bright...  
Has it been sixteen seconds since we looked at our lemon tree?
Yeah that's nasty. I've seen milk squirt from a dead lady's boob about 6 feet across the room too.
He tripped over the kid and stepped on the chord and it pulled it out of his hands on to the kid. I think the worse part was telling the mother who wasnt home at the time. She let out the most horrific shriek and grabbed me with all her weight clinging to me screaming and crying.
What the fuck. Some people should live underground and wither away in their own filth.
Everyone is a little shocked that I told my (at the time) almost 3 year old about boys' and girls' anatomy using the proper terms. But here's the thing, to him there are no bad connotations to those words. They are just words like any other words, they describe things. He had questions and he was calling some parts in words that he had invented, so it was important to explain. Anatomy is not shameful.
Infrared body cams need to be standard so we don't have to wonder like this. 
Well, now I look like a liar. But while nobody will believe me now, I'll still say it: I actually didn't make that story up. I haven't seen that video up until now either. 
R/enoughinternet      NSFW 
Is it possible to learn this power?
I am wondering how she knew how to do that..like, had she had a lot practice
Interesting that the mom watched her husband get killed for doing something, then immediately did the same thing.
Well fuck, you can only push someone so many times I guess.
Holy shit. That is one hell of a blindside. :(I was suicidal last year and I tried to tell my gf most of what I was going through, even though I knew it hurt her a lot. I didn't want to make up my mind one day and have it hit her out of the blue. On a positive note: I've never been happier in my life than I am right now and we have a vacation planned early next month. 
I believe you.  Ive watched a demonstration of a helicopter and K9 unit.  "Perp" starts off running across a field, helicopter comes down hovering a few feet off the ground, door opens and this GS just explodes out of the copter at a frightening speed after the guy.  "A missile with teeth" is the best way I could describe it
I'm really curious as to how widespread child pornography is. Someone once told me something about one website having 12,000 pictures posted in a day. I feel naive saying this but it seemed so shocking. It felt like a brick wall to the face of realization just how many images there may be in existence. I know it's global but how many people are trading images and how many images are there? What percentage of the global population has this issue touched, either as a consumer or a victim?
Well, if the powder had worked in the past, then it's possible that it had a placebo effect and that it might have worked this time as well.
This is a thing?! My God, that's a terrifying thought. 
dude wait what? a dog ate your face? AMA
The first time a chunk of coagulated blood fell off a patient it reminded me of canned cranberries at thanksgiving. Couldn't eat at thanksgiving a few months later because it just all came back 
Social media can be more of a poison than anything else. It is amazing how little worry I have since I have stopped checking Facebook excessively. Something about seeing only all the happy stuff just fucks with your head...
"what do you do?" "oh, I work at a funeral home." "cool! So what do you do there?" "oh, I'm just the serial killer. You know how it is, just trying to *make* *ends* *meet*." 
Why do you use flashlights in this situation as opposed to just using the lights of the building?  Seems like it would just make your current position super obvious while enabling someone to hide from you and avoid you.
Is an oval like a cul-de-sac? 
Life is suffering. And the antidote to suffering is the acceptance of mortality as a precondition for existence. 
I'm throwing out anything with a hood in my little ones room.Your poor friend :(There is never a recovery from this
I always stick my fingers in my ears and hum loudly to drown out warnings yelled from upstairs windows.  Keep it real, you know?
At least he didn't end up over the cliff. This happened to an aquaintence of mine. Guy got sloshed and on his way home up a very rural winding road stopped to take a piss and went over the edge. The cops had his truck towed and 6 days later, after his girlfriend sobered up enough to realize he was missing, he was found dead there. 
When I was younger me and my friends would build little forts in the woods. Every time we'd go back there would be Tim cans and blankets inside. Bums would take over our forts!
I imagined corn smut to be different. Like cobs dressed all slutty. 
"What are you gonna do? Stab me?!" - words of man stabbed. 
Quick, kick him while he's down!
It's rampant. Honestly, in my experience, we only arrested the 'low hanging fruit.' There are some complicated, sophisticated CP-rings where you can only get into their circle/network by bringing in new manufactured CP content. Those were some of the most intense, labor-filled investigations that spider webbed the fuck out. Never ending cases. 
> dude wait what? a dog ate your face? AMAYou'll have to ask Dewey, he knows more than I do. 
This surprised me when I turned 12. I don't know about other girls and may be tmi, but it's something I see almost monthly if you know what I mean. 
My siblings and I once heaved rocks at each other while waist-deep in Lake Michigan.  These were large stones, 10-15 pounds apiece, like a bowling ball basically.  We're hoisting them up to our shoulders and basically doing shotput throws at each other.  Dad got fucking *pissed* at us for that.
Job security. That guy's got upper management written all over him. 
I've always wondered the same thing as well. I always yell at the tv during crime dramas when they don't turn the lights on when they could and the serial killer gets the upper hand, kidnaps a team member, then holds them hostage for five minutes until they get sniped in the head.
Oh man, hardest laugh of the day right there and I feel terrible for the timing and situation surrounding it.
If not a hood, then it could just as easily be falling wrong and hitting your head on the curb, or the corner of a table, or even just the floor.Human beings can be remarkably resilient creatures. We can survive some insane things, but we are also remarkably fragile. Sometimes all it takes is a forceful bump in the wrong spot.
It took her SIX DAYS to sober up?? I can't even imagine being that drunk for that long...
Suddenly the image in my head became less gruesome. Thought it was something entirely different happening. 
Yup. All the ladies in my EMT and Paramedic classes had no issues with the blood clots. The dudes came back from their first trauma calls all wide eyed like "DID YOU KNOW BLOOD DOES THIS???"Um. Yeah. We're aware.
Woah
Jesus H Christ. Most kid stuff I can understand but that is legitimately stupid, lmao
Absolutely. I had a high speed motorcycle accident (triple digits) and survived with severe road rash, broken metacarpals and concussion. While I was undergoing PT, my therapist had a friend fall off the back of a bike traveling less than 30mph, hit her head on the curb and died. The major difference is I was wearing a full-face helmet and she wasn't wearing anything on her head. I've been a hardcore advocate for safety equipment since.
Wow I thought the clumps were just chunks of uterine lining. I'm not sure what's worse to be honest.

I can't believe I've never seen the Streetlamp Le Moose story. I practically have a minor in Reddit history, but I never remember anyone posting it in a "best of all time" thread. 
Can someone please explain the giraffe one? I don't get it 
The r/gaming one is one of my favourites> science-basedOh cool!> 100% dragonWait, what?
dude the jolly rancher one was vile
Oh man I forgot about the dragon MMO, that was amazing. 
How this isn't upvoted more is beyond me. The word safe is like a trigger word sometimes on this site it's so infamous. 
I for one had forgotten it. I think it's one of the greatest things ever to appear on the internet.
Oh man, that reminds me. The first of April is coming soon! Hoping for something awesome this time.
Wow, I can't believe I forgot about that... Crazy how time flies and we forget things that felt really 'important' at the time, even if it were just a silly meme. Everyone was talking about it back then and I haven't heard it mentioned since it ended, really.
Yeah, it's crazy that after it was over reddit just forgot about it, no mentions, no memes, nothing. It was truly magical.
Warring factions? You mean orangered vs periwinkle?
One of those was me. I still get messages saying "every account on reddit is a bot except you"
Stupid long horses! Still the greatest thing I have ever seen. Every time I read it I am in tears.
Gjallarhorn Day should probably be a national holiday 
Just read through Kevin, and turns out Kevin lived near Flint.Wonder if that had anything to do with the lead in the water.
Omg Kevin 
Glad you included Jenny in there, didn't see it anywhere else. Can't believe that was two years ago. 
>The r/bottomless vaults of porn subredditsFTFY
TIL that there are porn subreddits. Another thing that makes Reddit not Quora. 
The swamps of dagobah is a rough read.
What was the great blackout of 2015? 
What about my broken arms?
The spanish reddit is really gold. Especially if you understand spanish and read the replies.
Make 7 Streetlamp Le Moose.
Kevin has to be on here.
You left out the "whores before Descartes".

Don't forget /u/pepsi_next
I think individual redditors should enter the "Mount Rushmore" category. The Seven Wonders category should be reserved to posts.
I still don't get what's so special about Warlizard.
You call yourself a true le'redditor? You completely left off the OG karma whore, /u/apostolate and the OG mod nazi, /u/karmanaut.I bet you don't even know when the narwhal bacons.
What? No /u/andromeda321?
That's not 7
Scrolling down and seeing "AND MY AXE!" pop up randomly through the chaos is fucking priceless.
Doesn't look like anything to me.
Likewise. Goddamn that was a journey. This world does not deserve a man like Streetlamp Le Moose, but goddamn we need one.
I always found it to be incredibly cringy
people started downvoting him for mispelling geraffeHe retorts, apologizing, and spelling geraffe incorrectly againpeople downvote him more, probably for the laughs at this pointThe rest of the edits are his descent into madness.
I saw that one at the time and it still highly amazes me. This is like the fantasies I had when I was 14 about making a Pokemon or Harry Potter MMO (obsessed with Pokemon, Harry Potter, and MMO's, so it was the logical followup). But I had an excuse, I was 14. This woman claimed to be an adult, and should have realised there would be more going into a project than just a good idea. Especially an MMO project. 
Did it become a thing or did all her efforts go into the website... I never got to see the website. :\
It's so old-school it always warms my heart to see fresh Redditors stumble upon it for the first time. It's like the first time your kid learns Darth Vader is Luke's dad, or the first time he rides his bike without training wheels, or the first time he chomps down on a nodule of gonorrhea. 
It's also a little sad. People still reply to her posts like "dragons", "science based" etc. and sometimes they are rude and insult her. Just let it go guys.
never pushed it, feels good.
The reddit chat (robin or something similar) was great, and I wish they kept it around.
Periwinkle vs orangered, round 2
>I haven't heard it mentioned since it ended, really.The experiment is over

Quick warning to anyone who goes to that link, don't try to click on the giraffe picture, the link's dead and it's been taken over with a site that hides your mouse and tries to get you to download shit.Also for anyone who ignores me and still tries it, remember that the shortcut to get to the chrome task manager and kill the tab is Shift+Esc.
r/destinythegame is leaking again lol
The club penguin theme definitely made that day the greatest. The shitposting that day was truly top notch. 
I thought for sure this was gonna be girls without asses, because of course that would be *someone's* fetish. 
NSFW GOD DAMMIT. MY GIRLFRIEND JUST LOOKED AT MY LAPTOP AT THAT EXACT MOMENT :(
I love it here. I hate it here
Over 2 years on Reddit and you've never been to a porn sub? You have a lot of catching up to do.
That one is up there with the jolly rancher story, both absolutely repulsive 
I'm not sure if they mean the internet wide blackout in protest of SOPA, or if they mean the reddit only blackout in protest of Victoria the then head of AMA being fired without warning or notice. 
Every, fucking, thread.
There was also one where some guy said his wife's Fitbit was broken but it turns out it was fine and she was just pregnant.
I'd not seen that before - it should be everywhere. That is a beautiful story :-)obligatory i'm not crying you're crying.
157 gold! Holy cow!!
Ah yes, how have I forgotten about the potato guy!?

Those threads where absolutely everyone is in on the joke amaze me.
But then where does double dick dude go?
I can't believe i forgot Streetlamp Le Moose. Great choice for number 7 - Ta
And the cumbox

THANK YOU FOR RECOGNISING MY HUMAN CHARACTERISTICS ~~BEEP~~.
Jolly Rancher vagina
They would be in my top 10, but they've been inactive so long that I feel like there is an increasing number of people who don't know who they are.
Polite all caps guy, Andrew, etc.
To be fair I feel like a pokemon MMO could work. PoGo may even be a (flawed) example of one.I get it there are bootleg pokemon mmos
Wasn't the criticism more like "You say you're working on this game, but all you have is some 3D modeled concept art"?
Congratulations! You are one of the 7,403,968,467 people who never pushed the button and never will be able to.
Robin was AMAZING! I ended up in a chat with someone my same age who lived less than a mile from me. Super freaky. 
Better dead than orangered.

Don't worry, she probably already knew what a vagina looks like.
Don't forget, you're here forever.
Its Schrodinger's website.
I quit reddit forever once a month because I was horrified by something or downvoted into oblivion for an opinion I considered reasonable. I'm always back within 48 hours.
I'm commenting on this for reasons. Scientific reasons. Let's go with that. In any case, you have changed my.....research methods. Have an up vote
People say it used to be funny back in the day, but to be honest I think we all just grew up.
The reddit only blackout im sure.
It's started dying out though. It used to be in a majority of threads but it's pretty rare to see it these days. 
I wonder what happened to him
I thought you were going to say "it wasn't broken his wife was just lazy".
That story moved me. Half crying in the middle of work and I'm a grown ass man.
What's a potato guy?  Never heard of it.
Things like that really make me think that there's only me here and 1 other person on this site is running all other accountsE: Fuck.
In 2 holes.
But where's Kevin?
what's a cumbox?
Or the earthquake dude.  Or Peter Mayhew.
Turing test fail
Omg you're right. His last post was a year ago. Smh kids of the next generation will never know of the tragedy of Rogersimon10 the wise
Yeah but what's special about that?
Harry Potter universe MMO would be great too
Yeah but if you go through her history people give her shit every time she makes a comment anywhere on Reddit.
Godamn right...(secretly pushed it on an alt account)
Write a bot that continuously edits this comment to update the world population from a dynamic source on the Internet. 
Yeah idk why people are so proud of not pressing a button.That shit was free AND limited edition. I pulled up with a 60s tag because fuck man I like buttons and that was a pretty button. 
Robin was fantastic. 
Happy birthday!!!
I'm not clicking on that but my gut tells me it's real
na i dont think she does. she lost it in WW1
You can check-out any time you like,But you can never leave!
Am i even alive
The core idea was pretty good, relatable situations in a format that anyone could make. Then it got overdone to shit and everyone just used it as their personal diary and the quality went waaaaay down. But the period in between was pretty enjoyable.

The usefulness of the Turing test is less comforting when you realize that any AI smart enough to pass would know it needs to fail
Explain it to me then, great reddit sage.
Wizard 101 is heavily influenced by harry potter
I think at some point I'd just make a new account. 
To be fair, she was very combative with people who offered her real, constructive criticism and support. We all know that "I'm going my own way" creative type and they're such tiresome people. 
Filthy half presser.
No, it was a hot single.  [](/echosexy2)
I should have expected this.
Livin it up at the Hotel Reddit..er..ornia
RIP Patrice
JAJAJA MI PLOTO ESTA TRABAJANDO 
Not like Kevin would know the difference.
Everytime this story is plugged, I have to read it. It is truly a work of art
Look at his username, and report back with your findings.
Rogersimon10 is famous for his comments about his dad beating him with jumper cables.Every single comment of his somehow includes a reference of his dad beating him with specifically jumper cables but yet still make sense to the thread he is responding to. His last comment was a year ago and everybody joked that he finally succumbed to jumper cable injuries. /u/Rogersimon10 to read his comments. 
but it's also full of annoying 12 year olds with bad mom jokes
She is not a quitter

Were they LOOKIN' TO FUUUUUCK!?
Such a lonely place
Patrice O'Neal?
Dumb is a gross understatement here
It is. Everytime I read I book I wonder if Streetlamp could make it better and the answer is YES HE CAN 90% of the time
I've been BAMBOOZLED!
Is it possible to learn this power?
oh? you mean like every other MMO in existence.
Such a lovley face
That was the inception of the new expression "he's a Kevin" because after that we all felt the need of a worse definition of dumb.
Not any more he can't :-(
Such a horny place...
Not wearing pant while browsing Hotel Redditornia
RIP /u/6point8. Suicide is a bitch.
Not me but a friend was in AP Chem and they were working with some Sodium-something and his classmate snorted it as a cocaine joke. He was rushed to the ER and now his risk for Nasal and Lung cancer is through the roof. His predicted lifespan is like mid 30s maybe early 40s now and it was all for a shitty drug reference.
My cousin's husband got into a drunken fight outside a bar and punched the other guy pretty hard.  Other guy fell, hit his head on the curb and died.  Cousin's husband is now in jail, she took their kids and got re-married.  What makes it even worse is that the new husband is a total jackass so not only did those kids lose their dad,  they're now stuck with a dick for a step-dad.  E: Yes, I get it, this is similar to Con Air. 
This kid I know, his cousin gave him a gun over the holidays as a present. So this dumbass ordered pizza with his friends and instead of paying they robbed the delivery guy. Again this is after they gave the address and name for the order. So now because he just turned 18 he's being tried as an adult and faces like 10 yrs or more for being stupid.
When I was in college, I had a job at a local supermarket. One of my colleagues left at the beginning of summer as she was headed to uni in the autumn. Next thing I know, she's in the papers because she was driving a car whilst someone was "car surfing" on it and the guy died. Saw her in the shop a couple weeks after it happened and she looked a mess. I believe she went to prison, but not sure how long for.
We were about 17 and me and my friends went to a beach house for summer. Well, there was a cliff, not so big one, should be around 5 meters high, and one of my friends decided to run and jump without check how deep the sea was. Long story short, i had a lot of rocks and he broke his back, he didn't fuck his life, but lost both his legs. 
Not me but my dad, when he was at college one of his friends snapped after an argument with his mother and slit her throat, as well as killing his two little cousins who his mum was babysitting.This was 38 years ago, and he's still in prison. EDIT - Sorry there has been a few comments confused about the wording, my dad's friend, killed HIS OWN mother + two cousins. He did not kill anyone in my family. 
A few months ago I had a friend of mine ask me if I wanted to try crack with him.  I was busy so I politely declined.  He now has three different dealers calling up at the job looking for money, he's totaled two cars, only one of which was his, everyone hates him now because he's always begging for money and lying to everyone, and his mother had him locked up for stealing from her house. We've been watching this dude ruin his life for the past few months and he won't listen to anyone when we tell him it's obvious his addiction is causing it.  
The stepdad of a freshman at my high school didnt want to be late for work, so instead of dropping the kid off at the bus stop, he pulled into the left turn lane of a very busy road at 7am (still pitch black outside) and told the kid to run across the road to the bus stop(from the left turn lane). Kid got fucking plowed by an audi, his shoes flew 60 feet, the kid died pretty fast. The bus stop was 3 houses down and on the same side of the road as the kids house. Bet that fucking stepdad ended up late to work after all.
Watched a drunk college guy (this is back when I was in high school) say "hey kid, wanna see something cool?", grabbed a pipe and smashed the back of a police officers head in. We helped the officers partner tackle the guy, dude got prison for assault with a deadly weapon and attempted murder (as well as assaulting an officer).Shit went from "lets go home" to "life is fucked" real quick 
Last year a guy that my dad worked with decided to download child porn on a *US postal service* computer. This guy was in his 60's, had a wife and was generally living the old person life with financial freedom. He got arrested and his wife had no access to anything because he had everything in his name, lawyer wouldn't cooperate with her. I've never seen two peoples lifes destroyed so quickly. Actually, make it 3+ cause he had videos of him and a kid. 
There was this kid in my high school jrotc program who was at the top of his class, super smart and one of those people you know would succeed in anything they wanted. Well when it came to time to choose the "leadership" for the following year, the teachers overlooked him and didn't choose him for a high position in the program. After that he started doing drugs, skipping class, and his grades went down quick. He ended up not graduating high school, going to jail a couple of times and it's sad because he was someone that I looked up to, since he was older than me.
A former colleague of mine in grad school admitted she had slept with a professor at her undergrad institution to get second author on several of his papers. During grad school she then tried to proposition a faculty member with the same arrangement. He went directly to the department chair and Dean. She was fired as his mentee and other faculty members would not work with her. She now has a job in an ethics office at a different university. She also convinced her boyfriend who was in the same program to drop out of grad school to follow her.
I had a friend that sold weed in high school just to look cool, ended up getting into it a little too far. When he was a senior (18) he got busted with a few pounds of weed, went to jail for a little bit for that. Once he was out though he was on probation and just could never keep his shit together after that. He kept getting petty charge after petty charged and was in and out of jail for the silliest things for years after. 
This may not be as bad as some of the other answers, but a friend of mine took out a loan for $250,000 (I promise, I am not exaggerating this number) to pay for her "dream wedding" to a guy she had known for 3 months. They got divorced after less than a year and she is still in debt from it.
There was that guy on here who decided to try heroin thinking he wouldn't get addicted off 1 try. He ended up getting addicted and looking through his comments basically chronicles his addiction and dependancy on the drug. Pretty scary shit. 
"Friend" of mine decided it was a great idea to just drop out of high school 2-3 months prior to graduation. She was already barely attending school and doing some stupid shit, such as sucking her dad's friend off for drugs. Her parents encouraged her to drop out, and believed their daughter to be God's little angel who could do no wrong. Rumor has it she is now into cocaine. 
Reading these makes me want to stop smoking and drinking. 
Friend from high school bought a really nice camera at a suspiciously low price. A few weeks later, the police pick him up and ask him to answer a few questions at the station. The cop makes a stop on the way, leaving the squad car running while he runs inside on his stop. My friend panics, hops in the driver seat and drives the squad car to North Dakota. That was summer after senior year of high school and he was headed to a great school on full scholarship. That was 21 years ago and no one knows where he is now. 
Back a few years ago, this dipshit I know gave up a good home, a steady job, and some of his closest friendships all to go move to another state with a girl he had known for all of 2 months. She left him a month and a half later or so, and after he went crying home to his parents he had trouble getting a good job and was hospitalized for a bit for trying to kill himself. Man was I a dumbass back then. Luckily it all worked out in the end and I'm quite happy now! 
My friends dropped out of MED SCHOOL for a fucking army guy ( I was in the army for 9 years, I know what I'm talking about). I still can't wrap my head around her decision. 
Post videos abusing their children for all to see, and resisting the impending internet shitstorm. You know exactly who I'm talking about
I worked in medical in our county jail. There was a 27 yr old pharmacist who had just been sentenced to prison for killing someone on his third DUI. The guy was handsome and soft spoken. He knew he wasn't going to make it in prison.He got 2 yrs, which is the minimum for a 3rd DUI in TX. IDK how long he served because this was 10 yrs ago. But yes I agree it is about connections he should have received a longer sentence. The family of the man he killed does not get their loved back when he is released from prison.
Why dont you take a seat over here.
Ardian Syaf just completely destroyed his career in drawing comic books by slipping anti-semetic references in X-Men, a book primarily about fighting oppression, *created* by a Jew, in an issue *written* by a Jew, on a page *featuring a Jewish mutant.*Career suicide at its best. 
dropped out of hs and never left their house. 
Getting their boyfriend-of-two-week's name tattooed on their back...
Squirting semen inside a girl they weren't really serious about. Welcome to fatherhood genius! 
Damn, people should definitely be forced to take annual driving exams after a certain age
That old lady was a terrible person for getting in a machine she wasn't comfortable in that weighs easily over 1 tonne, when there were innocent people around that she could slay...People need to be responsible; there's a reason I don't let anyone drive my car. 
> *At his funeral*, the pastor had the gall to say he went to hell since he committed a sin by killing himself. What the actual fuck. Who says that kinda shit at a fucking funeral holy shit.
That article had some interesting photos choices."She drunkenly beat up an Uber driver. Do we have security cam footage?""Yup""Good, put three small pictures in there. Now check her facebook. Any Bikini shots?""Yup""Now we're talking! I want a full page spread!"
That was an amazing chain of incredibly bad decisions one right after the other.Wow.
That was really rational right up until he tries his own crack. Entrepreneurial as fuck. Discovers a new business, networks, takes over business, renegotiates labour contract to reduce costs and then vertically integrates to source his main supply cost internally after getting a lower cost supply of raw materials.
This happened at a local street fair a couple years back. Crazy how a little fall can do that much damage
I've had bariatric surgery. Sadly she traded her food addiction for a drug addiction. It happens to a lot of folks who have these procedures. :( 
FOR. A. PIZZA.
As someone who's worked in pizza places and has had delivery driver friends, good. Fuck that guy. He shouldn't have been so fucking eager to point a gun at some underpaid kid doing his job.
That article was extremely interesting.
There's an amazing book about this story and others called "So You've Been Publicly Shamed" by Jon Ronson
Last I heard she got a new job and is now laying low. He life wasn't ruined permanently
Had a friend who was clean and sober for 4 years. He had an apartment and a job, and saved up for the motorcycle he had always wanted.   He bought the bike, drove it straight to a dealer, copped, went home, and fired up.The neighbors found his body 2 weeks later because of the smell.RIP.  Miss you my man.
That is incredibly fucked up.
It's actually really disappointing to me that someone could do something this terrible and only get 5 years in Prison. 
You declined crack cocaine because you were busy? That's extremely fortunate!
I once worked with a guy from the Caribbean at a big organization and this guy was beyond perfect. He was the most driven, entrepreneurial, determined and suave guy I've ever encountered. Everyone was constantly like, wow. At the Christmas party you saw him hanging around the CEO, making the group laugh. Everyone talked about him constantly. He was basically on the way to the top, and fast. And one day he jumped off the roof of the building while we all worked.  
Why? Someone with such promise, it seems such a waste.
I feel like when I'm a parent, I'd rather have a call and no questions asked over a call from the police. 
Stories like this are exactly why I installed Uber on my son's phone (rides paid for with my credit card) when he went to college.  I'd rather pay for an Uber ride for him and his friends than a funeral.  
So she was forced to do something as is now being bullied? The fuck?E: ~~as~~ and
Where do you live that has random pipes laying around to smash with, the game of clue?
Jesus. Didn't just fuck his own life up. Destroyed a couple families in the process.
> download child porn on a US postal service computerIt takes a new kind of inept to do stuff like that.
Did he download a video or make one? If he made one, maybe the part where he downloads cp is not the exact moment where he fucked up his life.
>Actually, make it 3+ cause he had videos of him and a kid. I think child molestation trumps downloading CP
While I understand that crime is heinous, why would his assets be frozen?
Perhaps it was his first taste of "failure" (even though being overlooked is not truly failure) and he collapsed as a result. Perhaps not. Either way that's too bad. I hope you learned from his mistakes.
I've used pain pills for medical reasons and I don't see the fun. At most I got little chatty or zoned out.
Maybe he was already an addict when he did that crazy shit. That really sucks for him and especially his family =(
> governmentSeriously? He can't work under those conditions? Hell he'd practically have to shoot somebody to get fired from a government job. The hell was he worried about?
>dropped out of school before the game even came outThat's dedication
It's really sad when people can't learn from the mistakes of others.  It dooms them to learning first hand.
How does someone even get a loan approved for that amount...for a wedding?
Now I'm kind of curious what the wedding in question looked like.
How do you even get a loan for that much for something that isn't collateral? 
Yes but it's awesome that he is now 6 years clean! 
LIVE TO WIN
If your significant other wants you to give up a scholarship for them you should probably break up
She couldn't continue med school when she was dating the army guy? If he was deployed overseas, might as well study until he comes back.
That one video where he pushes his kid into a stand ):
Out of the loop, eli5?
There's another current askreddit that you've possibly just answered with your response to this one: "What is the most fucked/messsed up thing you have ever witnessed?"
Holy shit this has to be it.  There can be no greater indicator of life failure than walking into a house and meeting Chris Hansen.   Unless you're the guy who did it twice. Then no one can be sure what rock bottom looks like. 
High school??
A guy in my high school (this was ages ago) killed another student because the girlfriend of the former sucked the dick of the latter. Backed his pickup truck into him and crushed him against a wall. My first thought was why run the guy over and not the person who just cheated on you? Anyway he was 18, they proved it was premeditated, it's been 20 years and he's still in prison. 
I was staying at the Luxor years ago and had woken up at like 4 am due to jet lag. I didn't want to wake my wife up, so I get dressed and go downstairs. As I'm passing through the lobby area, this guy stumbles out of the casino looking absolutely stunned. Just poleaxed. So I walk over and ask him if he's ok and he's got this thousand-yard-stare says "I have lost everything." Then he walked briskly out the doors. It was chilling. 
I had a mate at uni that had D A V E in massive gothic letters tattooed across her lower back as a surprise for her on/off bf. She showed him, he freaked out and basically said "I'm not ready for that kind of commitment, luv" - and dumped her on the spot. She went and got it covered but now just has a flower, tribal thing, smurf and something else across her back - that still says DAVE!
why does anyone think this is a good idea 
Its true, why wouldn't he have one of the crackheads try it? Just seems like poor judgement there. I think he just wanted to try crack.
Reminds of that one genius dude who pretended to be a cop in a random part of a town. He set up a fake parking meter and kept pocketing all the change. FOR 25 YEARS. Dude made over a million I think. He never got caught because there was never an incident during his time as a "cop". That my friends, is a long con. 
They probably also stole his money.
Yep. He's not facing 10 years for "being stupid" but for being an armed robber. 
I always think of this book when I see witch-hunts on reddit. It's scary how little information people need to paint a picture and form a mob against someone.
These are the drug stories that scare me the most- the ones where they get clean, pull their life together and then relapse and pass away. It seems to be a common story and says a lot about the insidious nature of addiction. I'm sorry about your friend.
Yeah well honestly, before I watched all that happen I had the mentality that I would try anything once.  Seeing that though made me realize that lines had to be drawn somewhere and that I'll never try hard drugs
I used to be Twitter friends with a guy who was stunningly handsome. He had a fantastic job as a writer at a world wide publication. He had beautiful girlfriends and was a genuinely nice guy. He killed himself when his beautiful girlfriend rejected him. He posted on Twitter he was going to do it and then did it. It was awful. I never met him but I was upset. Wished I would've tried harder to be a friend. To the outside world he had it all. Appearances are shockingly deceiving. 
A lot of high performing kids are taught that it's not ok to make a mistake - that their identity is based on not fucking up.Not to trivialize DUI, but you could imagine someone like that struggling to see how they live it down. 
My parents made it clear they'd rather drive me home than bail me out or bury me.They never gave me any grief, never any questions, just thanked me for not driving. Would drive my friends home too if they needed it. IMO, that's the way it should be.
Yep. People wouldn't stop bringing it up so she couldn't keep her own name and have a normal life. Depressingly it seems like things aren't really improving as she recently posted pictures of bruises supposedly from her boyfriend 
Worst part was it was mother's day morning when it all happened. It was a shit year, he pled not guilty and the trial went on for ages. Not a fun time. 
My brother's band teacher in high school used the school's computer to download child porn. His arrest was an awkward ending to the spring concert
Yeah, but the downloading to a gov't computadora is what initiated the fucking up of his life.
Consider yourself lucky!
I think that's the difference between using them for purpose over fun.
My brother told me about how, in the US Army at least, soldiers have to undergo a financial counseling class at the end of boot camp, because they are about to get a check for 3 months of back pay from boot camp. He said about 3/4 guys blew it within a few weeks on new cars, engagement rings (So many guys proposed at the boot camp graduation without a ring, I swear there were so many girls who dressed way up expecting to get proposed to), massive TVs, etc. 
Sometimes people can be predisposed to schizophrenia but not develop it until something triggers it. Drugs are one of those triggers.
He must be a Pro Genji.
Does he understand that in the WHOLE world there is only 32 jobs for that position?
I had a new 25 year old roommate attend a funeral of one of his friends...he said it was the third one in four years.  A few weeks later I witness some members of his friends group riding motor cycles without helmets upwards of 100mph.  I was fucking nervous as shit riding along in a car at that speed, and then one of the jackasses swerves into his friends motorcycle and pulls out at the last second.  They then proceed to play chicken....see how close they can swerve to each other without hitting.These were rich kids, if that helps contextualize.  
lol pretty sure you've gotta commit fraud. "Yeah, I uh, definitely need a second mortgage on my house for you know house stuff. Absolutely not for a wedding with live elephants and shit."I would love to be a wedding guest and eat my gold covered popcorn as that shit implodes.
Bank: "So what you're saying is that you want to be in debt to us your entire life?"Girl: "I just love him so much I do--"Bank: "sign here, idiot"Girl: "uhm, my name is Sara, not idiot"
They had 800ish guests.  It was open bar (5 separate bars) and more food than I have ever seen in one place in my life.
Well, it's a little thing called a home equity loan. I spend all the money I want, and the house gets stuck with the bill. He he he he! Sucker.
You know, this is what SHOULD be shown in those anti-drug programs at school.You can see the timeline of events with time stamps. Not just some guy giving a speech that may or may not help a student. 
The October 25th and 27th ones are from 2010, a year after the first couple. He didn't go from snorting it one time to dying and going to a psych ward in a month and a half...Not that that makes the story any less harrowing, but yeah.
Right? That's not a romantic thing, that's just a big red flag about dependency issues 
Or "yeah how about you study up and get your ass into Yale if you love me so much?"
"Could a depressed person make this?"
Don't give daddyofive views. Look up Philip DeFranco, his last three videos explain the whole situation pretty well.  
Not that much of a coincidence as a thread like that is created about every 2 minutes
My favorite was the 16 yr old kid who came in and said "well, I thought the girls would like an older guy so I pretended to be 20." They were like "you're so stupid, don't do that again, go home"
I love watching these shows over and over for how the brAin tries to come up with some bullshit while realizing it's fucked at the same time 
Sometimes you just want the problems of the life to fuck off, and he succeeded.
Apparently he wasn't good at delegating.
I know a girl who robbed a delivery guy. She got $11 and also a 1st Degree Robbery charge. 
You are MUCH more likely to die on a relapse than any other time, since it is when you have the lowest tolerance, but are used to taking larger doses.
The problem with drugs is: You might see yourself as a strong-willed person who can resist temptation and "just not get addicted". But the drugs turn you into a different person, a person that doesn't have the same willpower.
> Appearances are shockingly deceiving.No kidding, I'm far from stunningly handsome, live a very no frills life, and I couldn't be fucking happier.
That's one reason why ivy league schools have high suicide rates. Suddenly, all the kids who were always at the top of their class are together, and someone has to be average. It's hard to adjust to being average when you've always been on the right side of the curve. 
Ampheticlean 
> My parents made it clear they'd rather drive me home than bail me out or bury me.If you want people to always tell you the truth, then don't give people a reason to lie to you.  That's how parenting should be - you should be able to come to your parents with anything.
Probably why they threw the book at him. He didn't take a plea deal, which would probably have gotten him out sooner. 
> His arrest was an awkward ending to the spring concertI picture a student playing the 'sad trombone' sound as they escort him off-stage.
The xanax got me, though.
Yea, best thing about when I was given a dose morphine for my broken leg was just the absence of pain. More about what I *didn't* feel that was good 
yeah, unfortunately, financial ineptitude/ addictive consumerism is at crisis levels in the US.  So much so that the US military now has mandatory financial counseling classes for various reasons including: financial problems are the number one cause of divorce and a huge factor in soldier performance.  The logic is that a soldier can't focus on the battle when he's fighting with his wife who's 2000 miles away and he's stressing about money.
The old I'm invincible, oh wait I'm dead routine. 
OK, 'Sara Not Idiot'!
I couldn't get 800 guests to show up at my wedding if I held it at the 50 yard line during halftime of the super bowl.
What ethnicity is she?Was it a super large traditional culture based wedding like you see in India or did she just watch too much TLC 
I always thought they were over exaggerating when they said you could get addicted after just one use. Well holy shit, Exhibit A.
Or even "How about you transfer to Gateway Community College in New Haven?"
They shrugged off the accusations saying that CPS have already investigated them and found nothing. They don't care as long as they get more views. It's awful.And the one kid "at least they don't beat us."
Don't forget "Ladies of Reddit: what's the sexiest sex you ever sexed?"
I... uhh.. I brought the condoms so I could teach her about the meaning of safe sex
My favourite story from Reddit is about a guy in school who disobeyed the teachers, and they would tell him he wouldn't get anywhere with his attitude. He basically told them to fuck off and said "I just want to be a plumber". Years later, he was a plumber.
Harrah's does! I've stayed there and they have mini ones, you can step outside though. 
Yeah I don't get people that rob delivery drivers. They don't carry more than 20 dollars in change. You get some that will stupidly carry all their tips on them but even then that's not much. Certainly not worth the risk/effort. 
Working in a prison's health care unit, I see this all too often. An offender will be released, go back to their same pre-incarceration dose  and it's too much. 
How much sooner? 
For me it's all about nasal sprays.
I'd go
But he didn't do anything!
*"not a lady, but..."*
Hell, being a plumber is probably the better option these days. Having a trade is where it's at.
Not gonna lie, sometimes when it's very busy I'm carrying ~150+. Most shops make you "drop cash" so you don't get robbed as bad. 
Did it help? My friend's roommate at Harvard didn't break until his sophomore year and killed himself. My friend ended up dropping out his junior year, which was probably the smartest move he ever made. Now he runs a consulting firm and is much happier than he had been all through school. Perfection is stressful. 
I've heard of this. I was using spray for a few weeks to breath better in my sleep but I needed more and more so I quit.
Was that the case before 2007?
Find me a decent bride and it's on.
Didn't he, Lisa.  Didn't he....
"...One time at Comic Con a female brushed up against the brim of my fedora and it was pure euphoria."
You've convinced me to rob you! I'll take a large pepperoni pizza, thanks! (Come to the back door.)
Was going to say, a decade ago two people working part time at Walmart with a combined yearly income of 40k would have gotten approved for half a million bucks. They were giving money to anybody and everybody back then.
hi its me ur bride
'All right!' said the banker, and all on his own,  He stamped his approval, and gave them the loan!  They'd *never* afford it,  not one little bit...  But nobody could, and the world went to shit. 
Baggage handler. If you check a skateboard by just slapping a sticker on it it will get ridden.  
I am a welder for a company that builds rollercoasters... Every single weld is inspected and x-rayed for any defect. So i guess this doesn't apply but just so everyone can feel a little bit safer I figured I'd let you internet people know.
Most everything at Applebees besides meats are microwaved 
Teacher - it's that time of year to make class placements for next year. Every year there are two or three teachers in the school (elementary) who are so awful, we cry over which students we have to 'sacrifice' to them and hope they are strong enough to survive a year with Mr. or Mrs. So-and-So. 
Many of the books you read - especially romance - aren't written by the person who's name is on the cover. Most romance books are ghostwritten and bought by someone else (often a man, I've found) and published under a female's name with a fake bio. How do I know this?I'm a ghostwriter. 
If you're sitting at a blackjack table and aren't sure what play to make, ask the dealer. No, seriously. We're trained to know the official Blackjack strategy guide and are allowed to give you that information (considered common knowledge). If the dealer doesn't know it off hand, their supervisor should have a copy of it and will help you out.
Barely anyone in the state of Georgia gets an autopsy. If you wanted to kill someone over the age of 40, all you would really need to do is make sure that they had some kind of previous medical history and the body was found outside of a metropolitan area. The coroners here are only required to have a high school diploma. Some states are worse, most better.
A certain telephone company with a blue globe logo doesn't actually have a billing department. You are *always* routed to Sales. The job is not to fix your billing problem, it's to upsell you. If you have a legit billing problem, you will be transferred because the rep doesn't want to deal with anyone that isn't a sale. Every time you're transferred, it's actually to the same department, just a different sales rep. Billing managers are really just Sales Managers.
After working in the travel industry I can tell you that hotel room rates are often not fixed prices. If guests come to the front desk and ask the price we generally start at the high end. Most people accept this as fact and pay up. However, if a customer is hesitent or threatens to walk out we can sometimes drop the price to keep them there. Often there is a bottom line price set by the owners- we can't go any lower than that or we lose money. 
Doctor here. I'll see a patient Monday morning in the hospital, work all night and then Tuesday morning in the hospital, and I won't have slept in the 24 hours in between. And this is totally normal and accepted practice in medicine.

Don't have grown up conversations in front of your children..they come to school and tell us everything. Everything. I know more about the parents of my kids than I do my own friends.Preschool teacher*
I'm a doctor. When I'm on a 28 hour call I make lots of mistakes, and the nurses and pharmacists have kept you alive despite my best efforts. I'm sorry.
Tech startups: many places spend almost no time or effort on security. It's a race to add features and patch over major bugs to try to get some kind of revenue stream before funding runs out. Security isn't a problem until it is, so it's always on the back-burner. 
Sewer inspector. I can tell exactly who/ what house is dumping oil and grease down their drains.  It's usually the churches and businesses that get nastygrams and fines but we need to shame the house people too.
If you enter a sweepstakes or contest, some sites will use your friends list to decide how popular/cool you are and it ups your possibility to win.  
Very few institutions get computer security right. The fact that nothing catastrophic has happened yet is nearly a miracle. 
A lot of people think military is synonymous with discipline and top-tier job training.I've seen things that would make a McDonald's worker think that their job is pretty high-class.
Software development:You will always be pressed for more time and money. Your product will almost always launch with major bugs and issues- you will spend most of your final moments before go live fixing as many of the VISIBLE issues as you can, and subsequent updates actually getting the product to where you envisioned it as you were building.
In the legal profession, the most difficult asshole in the entire case is often your own client.
Teacher here: I hide YOUR secrets. If your kids know it, I know it. Children are tactless and impulsive and they tell me all about your reproductive habits, financial difficulties, domestic problems, and tindr dates. I know so much about moms and dads that I wish I could erase from my brain forever. But I will never tell! You're welcome! 
I get paid to tell you what your employees have been telling you. 
That people in the kitchen and in factories also go to work when they feel ill and you most likely have eaten something someone sneezed on.  Because there is a line between feeling so sick you can't get out of bed and coughing and sneezing once in awhile.
I used to work for a major package delivery service unloading semi trailers.The flat screen TV you ordered for christmas was under a gun safe and a lift kit for a truck.
If I start CPR on you, you have about a 5% chance to survive.  I still try my hardest.thank you kind stranger for the gold!!
It's not uncommon for assistants and apprentices to make the art of really famous, well known, expensive artists. The artist might be very involved in the process or barely involved. They can have studios with dozens of assistants churning out all of "their" work, and then just sign their name to it. And I'm not just talking about, sculptures or art installations where assistants might be doing the grunt work. Even paintings could be barely-touched by the actual artist. 
Every driver of a truck has nodded off at one time or another making them an 80,000 lb death missile.
FedEx Office doesn't recycle.I've personally killed probably close to an acre of forest.Waited for a long time to post this so it'd get buried.
Valet driver here, dont leave your drugs in the car. A kid took a pound out of a customers car a few years back and the dude came back FLIPPIN out screaming at the manager. When the manager finally asked what was stolen and he told him weed, my manager just said "oh. Well you can file a police report then"
Security guards laugh at you when you do stupid shit in front of our cameras. 
In a call centre, we're more likely to waive admin fees if you're nice to us and we like you. Also we're more likely to charge you (more) if you're rude or patronising. 
If your baby is in full-time care (40+ hours a week) the odds are that we know about their milestones (rolling, crawling, walking, talking, etc...) before you do. It's just because the majority of their waking time is spent with us. We don't tell you because working hard to provide for your kid doesn't make you a bad parent, and we don't want you to feel like you're missing out.  
Bro....Anyone who's ever been at a vehicle assembly plant knows that most cars have a quality of about 80% of their specifications and they're sold that way to everyone. 
Jeweler here- we use spit to set diamonds. Not as an actual adhesive, but to pick up and move the diamond into the setting. It sounds gross, but trying to move a small diamond with a pair of tweezers often results in the diamond flying across the room and into the bottomless pit that is a jewelry shop floor. So, yea- we lick and stick. Don't worry, there's a vigorous cleaning process at the end! 
You can sue a prison for holding you after your release day if they screw up your release, or can't release you on time for whatever reason, and it's like $7k for every day you're held over. 
Home construction. It is so bad. Amazing what people will pay a half mil for. Total rubbish.  You won't believe the number of foundation failures or how many roof trusses have termites pre-installed and for gods sake never look under the carpet. 
Biomedical researcher:80% of published peer reviewed studies are not repeatable
I'm an advertising photographer. Pretty much anything you buy based off the work of my industry won't be as nice as it looks in the ads.We put a lot of work into making something that's worth $5 look like it's worth $50.

It is against Walmart's company policy for hourly employees to call 911 in the event of an emergency. Rather, they must notify the nearest manager, which could take anywhere from minutes to weeks depending on where the manager is, what they are doing, whether the hourly employee has a walkie, etc. Employees can be, and have been, fired for calling 911 to report an in-store emergency.
Work for a very popular bar chain in the UK. If we over pour a pint the excess head is poured into another glass and reused on the next guy who orders that drink. If your pint tastes flat that's probably why. Hate doing it, it's disgusting but managers dont care as they need to hit stock targets for bonuses. 
I work for Charter Spectrum. If you want to get your bill reduced it's simple, actually. You just have to call in and tell us you're disconnecting due to high prices. If you don't say you want to disconnect, there's nothing that can be done to help you. We're not supposed to suggest this to customers because the company doesn't really want them to save money. We have a retention dept. that literally gets paid to RETAIN people. Don't call billing and ask for a deal, get right to the retention department. They can help you get a lower bill.
We aren't allowed to "mingle" with the guests. But sometimes we do. 
Work in the hotel industry. A good percent of the pillows aren't washed. Like ever.
Radio DJ here. I can get in serious trouble/fired if I take requests. Most on-air tracks of people making requests are either staged or recorded well ahead of their actual airing. It's not like this everywhere, just most places. Don't blame DJs, blame mass media conglomeration and/or Bill Clinton. 
Chipotle worker here. We don't chop our lettuce anymore. It comes pre-chopped in bags! BAGS!!!!!
Paralegals have access to lots of databases to find private info.  Depending on the database, some of us have looked up people who are not involved in our cases.  
Well, we don't do this because we want to, but because it's mandated by law, but you know those "uncured: no nitrites added" products? We add nitrites.
How we fix our computer issues in IT: We turn it off and on again.Seriously, this fixes 99% of computer issues.
Most places never clean their soda fountain ice machines. After opening a few and finding them full of mold and growth, I stopped putting ice on my fountain drinks.
IT people search your problems on Google.
Holy shit a positive one! Stay strong little post!
Can confirm. Everything is pre-weighed and put into disposable cups (sauces and such) or plastic bags (broccoli, ect), microwaved and then placed on a plate at the Mid area (I was mid).  Even the pasta is microwaved. (Pre-cooked to almost done and then bagged in portions, microwaved at time of order)Meats, Fries, Tortillas, Salads, ect are not microwaved.. But all vegetables, soups, sauces, rice, ect. All microwaved. Oh and when we were SUPER busy and some meat was under cooked the manager would have Grill cut it up and microwave it quickly. 
As a nurse .... we do this too. And we conveniently walk by those patients' rooms to make sure they're OK.
I wanted to name my son Rafe. We were in a store and my wife said Rafe is the kind of name they use in romance novels. She picked up the nearest book and the main character was called Rafe. My now 8 year old son is not called Rafe.Thanks for that.;)
How do you get that job? 
I can't count to 21 without taking off my shoes. Most of the time, the dealers tell me what to do. It's pretty effective. It takes me longer to lose my money on blackjack than on slots. 
Of course. It's the dealers best interest for you to win and tip. They generally make more in tips than salary. 
After a few domestic violence calls to my aunt's house, the sheriff finally said, "You know, we don't got no CSI here in Podunk County.  If he gets shot, there ain't gonna be an investigation."
"It will be a minute while the account loads (already loaded). So what do you like to watch on TV?  (really running their address for coming sales pitch)"Good times.
That's interesting. Someone else in this thread mentioned getting annoyed when customers keep asking "is that the BEST you can do?" which makes me hesitant to ask for a discounted rate. 
When I was in college, I asked my primary care physician if he thought I should become a doctor. He told me, "If you want to work like a gentleman, become a lawyer. Doctors work like animals for many years."I'm now a lawyer and I have zero regrets. I have no idea how you guys do it. 
I've heard the argument that continuity of care outweighs the exhaustion argument... but I just don't understand it.  We know that working more than ten hours straight impairs judgement and ability (see Department of Transportation laws for commercial driving).  Yet we expect interns and residents to work 36 hour shifts.  With only one day off a week. The fact that the medical profession is exempt from OSHA regulations is baffling. 
Yes, but your job is icky so I will pay you to do it. 
Thanks for the shout out to pharmacy! We do more than pull pills from a shelf, especially inpatient. I'm just a tech but I've caught some pretty nasty med errors myself (not always the doc to be fair).
Also legacy programmer here. Financial firm. Our backbone code is written in FORTRAN. I never imagined I'd graduate and write FORTRAN code for a living. O.oI know COBOL as well. I find it really tedious. I'm glad that we don't use COBOL at my job. Bless you for taking one for the team there.
>I hate it. It's a chore to get up and go in every day. It's my dream job and I'm lucky to have it.Heart eyes. Best three sentences.
Ssshhhh. COBOL is my retirement plan once I can't keep up with you kids and your fancy lambda, web framework clouds.
Startups? 90% of all IT systems in existence. You saw what happened to the NHS the other day.
My mother spent the last 12 years working at a major rental car company and would talk often about how bad she felt about scamming people with these bullshit insurance addons. 
My wife and her college roommates would flush grease down the sink with cold water. They thought the reason you don't pour grease down the sink was because it would burn the pipes, so they cooled it down real good first. She is beautiful though. 
No, it's just that computer security people are so used to catastrophes that you don't notice them any more.
I think most people are aware that carnival games are rigged in a way but still winnable, and that's what makes it "fun"
Infantry here got out two years ago.. unless deployed we're just glorifies janitors.. trained to do nothing but kill.. but had more time in service sweeping, mopping, picking weeds out of the motor pool than actually even attempting to do what I was trained for.. hell at least by the end I was able to tell other privates to go sweep the motor pool while it was raining
Well shit. Thank you. Do u have a business card 
I self inject medication once a week for arthritis and I'm 75% certain my kid's teachers have heard about "mommy using needles" without context.
This one is my favorite. I always wonder what the teachers must think of my weird family, because I'm sure they only get the craziest bits and pieces. 
Former teacher: this is true.And fuck those of you who were telling my student that you were going to keep her from ever seeing her other (non-abusive) parent.
I interviewed with a consulting company that step one of their consulting process was to literally go in and ask the employees which things needed changing. They'd make the changes in different stores and find out which changes worked and which didn't and which had interactions. 
Yeah, food service is brutal about taking sick days, like you better be half in your death bed to call out. And considering how virulent some pathogens are, like norovirus (winter vomiting bug), one sick worker could infect half a town. 
A letter carrier once told me that at his previous post office, there was a co-worker who would have occasional temper tantrums. Except he'd take it out on his parcels.  When loading his USPS truck in the morning, he'd throw the packages as hard as he could into his truck.  Like, REALLY hard.  Sometimes they'd bounce back out and he'd smash them in again.
If you don't start it you have 0% chance of surviving.
This is true in other mediums, too. Jim Davis has not drawn a "Garfield" cartoon in years. He has a staff that does the cartoons and he just "approves" them.Also, some pop-fiction authors--the ones who put out a book or two every year--often have staff write their books. They will just write an outline and notes for each chapter. 
People like Damien Hirst have been doing this forever - he literally has an art factory where his apprentices make art.
So Persona 5 was telling the truth about art assistants? Damn Yusuke. Damn. 
I worked receiving at Costco for 5 years. I can attest that these people are sleep deprived as fuck. They always look like zombies when I buzz them in. That, and apparently Swift Transportation doesn't offer their employees Dental. 
This is true of any one who works driving more than 5 hours a day from bus drivers to cops.. Though trucks are distinctly more dangerous.
In the same vein.  After going to fire school I realized I've put WAY too much faith in locks.  If you don't mind making some noise you can defeat almost any door with just a halligan and a flat head axe in about 60 seconds.  Your average wood door from Home Depot might as well be made of tissue paper if the fire department needs to get in.
Thanks for the heads up.
I stayed at a hotel last night and will need to stay again in about five months.  I checked three websites as well as the hotel's own site and got a price.  Asked what the booking it in person price would be.  They took fifty bucks a night off the price of the suite compared to online.  Sold and sold.  They gave me a great deal.
Jeez that manager has some balls. Most of the time, people who keep pounds of weed in their car don't really care for following laws. That guy could know a shooter or two. 
Airline catering survivor here, and, uh.Yea, all coffee pots have a nice few millimeters of congealed sludge-dishwasher detergent mix on the bottom. Tastes like soap? Go figure.Avoid any meal/snack with mayo.  Seriously.Also everything has been frozen, thawed, and refrozen a good few times.
I remember that one security guard that got sued because he uploaded a video of some woman who was texting and fell into a fountain.
I bet these guards are bored 99% of the time
So that explains why my seats aren't bolted down. Huh, TIL. 
Right?  I work at a plant making gas tanks and the MO for when a tank fails any test is to retest it.  If it fails twice, swap out a component and test it again.  If it still fails after the 3rd retest then we scrap it.
So how do you find a reputable builder?
Y'all need to come up with a codeword to put in your papers when you know that it's bullshit.
"If we knew we were actually going to *build* this thing, we'd have designed it entirely differently." 
That's what factors of safety are for.
There was an engineering student who was taking his final exam. He opened the test to only one question:*What is 1+1?*He thought for a moment and said to himself*The answer is definitely 2....but I'll make it 3 just to be safe.*
It's even worse when you lack funds but have to make do like in the military. We've had helicopters come in that we literally cannot figure out why it still runs because of how much fuckery the military mechanics will be forced to make on it just to fly that last hour of service. 
Really depends what field. Sending shit to space? yeah, probably pretty precise.  Automotive? There are plenty of parts where a few mm error here or there wouldn't affect anything.  Civil? If it's within a metre it'll be fine.     Update: From the responses, I'm not worried about tolerances any more, since I'm now too busy being horrified by everyone using inches for serious engineering.
Oh wow who would've thought!? I'mAbsolutely flabbergasted. 
So does buzzfeed 
Recently had a visit to an obgyn emergency room. They had a plastic single use wrapped speculum with a little LED in the middle. So much nicer than the metal ones.
You son of a bitch.
You'd think it would be illegal to make a patently false claim on the label.
I would say that this solves 1% of the issues.The other 99% were not even issues at all. lol
One time I had a camper who had IBS and her parents didn't send her medicine with her. We only found out on the second day when the cabin started smelling like shit. She also ran off into the woods a few times because she had issues. Shitty kid, shitty parents.
The difference is knowing how to interpret the solutions found on Google
My dad was in the hospital for ten days not too long ago, and I'm pretty sure that's what happened. Doctor was kind of a dick and wasn't real great at explaining why certain procedures needed to be done or what they even were. This freaked the old man out quite a bit, causing him a lot of anxiety. The RN he worked with most of those 10 days was amazing. She went out of her way to make sure my dad knew what was going on, and found ways to put him at ease. It helped so much. I'm very grateful to her for that.
"I don't have a TV. I got rid of it in 2007.""But don't you...uh.....wh........"I think I had someone up to five consecutive stutters on my last call to tech support.
I'd pay me to do it too.
Exactly.I am capable of unplugging that shower. But I'd rather pay you to see, touch and smell that gunk that is plugging my pipe while I stay away and not gag.
I had a doctor mistakenly write some guy's diazepam rx as 30mg instead of 5mg. Faxed twice to confirm if what he wrote was true; he says yes (both times!). I was still hesitant so I called the doctor, and he finally realizes it's a mistake and tells me, "Sorry! My bad!".  
Ha! Joke's on you geezer, I'm a kid and we can't keep up with fancy web framework either! That stuff is a never ending hole filled with nightmares and the latest javascript library fads >.> 
Yup, in IT you can have it fast, cheap, secure. Pick two.
Haha that's great.  That way would also avoid congealing in the mainline and only mess up their own.  How thoughtful! 
And besides, carnivals aren't about getting a good deal on a teddy bear. They're about proving you're not broke to your date
When deployed what's it like?
Found his boss.
...do they not have motions to withdraw where you practice? Noncompliance with a fee agreement is almost always an automatic grant in my state.
When I was 6, I told my teacher, "My dad drinks and drives all the time!" My teacher had to have a conference with my parents and my dad was put in the awkward position of explaining how I confused drinking 7-Eleven Big Gulps in the car with alcohol. 
It sounds messed up but sometimes you need to hear it from someone who isnt ina position to profit from the change.
Sounds like management is run by a bunch of idiots who know how to kiss corporate's ass.
My boyfriend works in a kitchen. We got sick from something a coworker had and were shaking, getting hot flashes and chills, violent diarrhea and vomiting and the other manager wanted him to come in to do a catering order for 500 people. Took three hours on the phone arguing and a doctors note before his coworker dropped it but he was passive aggressive for weeks
James Patterson doesn't even hide this shit anymore. The books are appallingly terrible but people keep buying them because they say his name on them. I just don't get it. The Jim Davis one doesn't really bother me because I work with kids in a library and I'll be damned if every kid between the ages of 8-12 doesn't go through a massive Garfield phase where they go insane if there are no more books they haven't read. Those kids are rabid and I love their excitement for a new book. If it means there is a Garfield Ghost writer who is keeping these kids coming back, then so be it!
Tom Clancy's is the brand. Giantbomb has called it Tom Clancy's's the division more than once.
It's actually really, really old. Like, thousands of years old. There's Greek and Roman pottery where historians aren't sure if it was painted by the person it's attributed to or by an apprentice. Which is probably why it's such a widely accepted practice. 
Swift would let my dogs drive if they had thumbs and could reach the pedals.
I'm OK with that.
oh god the rabbit hole. This is gonna get me into trouble.
Tbh Staples / UPS Store don't either. 
Hey, that happened in my hometown. That's all we're known for. That, and the poverty. 
A few modifications to that and you could have some sweet ejector seats!
Maybe I'm a weird outlier on the quality control spectrum but i dont let that shit fly at my plant. Production and shipping can push for parts all they want but im protectong the customer. Who do you supply? Chrysler?
My favorite quote was:When I made my code, only God and I knew how it worked.Now only God knows
"The only reason coders' computers work better than non-coders' computers is coders know computers are schizophrenic little children with auto-immune diseases and we don't beat them when they're bad."
I work in the tile industry, for a company that does a lot of high-end residential work, and the advice I've heard is to never hire a "home builder", but instead get a construction management company that works on a cost-plus basis.
Wait... You actually strapped a plane to the side of a rocket??? We were drunk when we drew that!
They don't have to build it, just pretend they know how to build it in the weekly meeting with all the guys currently attempting to build it.
That's funny cuz as a finance guy, I'd think, "The answer is definitely 2 ... but I'll make it 1 just to be safe." Under promise, over deliver.
Went to an AF base close to my home, saw a c130 leaking, wife said it was perfectly normal to leak. Like what the shit
I remember my Hydrology professor saying that if we had more than one decimal place in a homework amzser he would count points off because there's no way we could be that precise hahaha 
You know something? Those plastic ones BREAK. Sometimes inside the patient's vagina. Yeah. There are pros and cons to metal vs. plastic speculums. 
Basically lol, and if a reboot doesn't fix it then you're in for a fun time and actually have to troubleshoot it.
Seriously. That's like saying doctors look stuff up in a textbook. No shit, but you really need to have a well developed intuition, and some actual knowledge.
No joke, I used that line once. No television. The guy told me they are an absolute bargain down at Goodwill. 
And you do.
^^ Exactly this.  I have a snake, various wrenches, and YouTube, but I've used that snake. I've seen what lives in the darkness. I only call plumbers now.  
My sister in law is a pharmacist and she has caught mistakes like that too. 10 times too powerful preparations. 
The trick is to just run your hot water for about a minute straight once it has hit peak tempature. Then you can heat all your pipes up nicely so as to only clog the main line :) 
I've never properly disposed of my grease. That's gonna change today my man. I never knew the correlation between that and h2s, which unfortunately kills a few ppl in my line of work too (oil and gas). Stay safe!
It sucks more and you have even more freedoms taken from you.
This is like when psychics got my sister to dump her shitty bf. Didn't matter who it was she listened to, we'd all said it to no success; then the psychics said it and boom done. 
I bet boss was just like "I've been sending as many emails as I can" and corporate says "but have you tried sending more emails?" and boss is all "wow that is an amazing idea, I'll get on it right now!" 
Classic management.  Let's force sick workers with doctor's notes to come in sick and bitch at their coworkers for calling out sick.
My mom and aunt tell me it stands for "Sure Wish I'd Finished Training"
Nah, my brother drives for Swift, and he got in trouble for keeping a dog in his cab.
Me too.  I woke up one night with a firefighter in my room yelling at me that my apartment building was on fire, and he certainly didn't use a key to get in.
That was way more interesting than I thought it would be and watched it from the beginning
This saddens me, as the area I live in likes to make a big point that UPS Stores will accept your packing peanuts and other material for them to reuse, as though they're big into helping the planet, rather than trying to keep their costs down.
Pawnee, Indiana?
>The guy actually made a theft report to the police, who already had the package, so they arrested him.          Wow. You can't fix stupid
I was working on the x-ray machine at a cargo warehouse in a large international airport. You usually can't tell what the fuck was coming through the machines, but this one time, I called my supervisor over laughing my ass off. He makes it over and starts laughing even harder. Eventually, most of the other guards, maintenance staff, and loaders are at the machine laughing as well. The shipment was over one ton of giant rubber dicks going to Venezuela. And I mean FUCKING. HUGE. DICKS. 
Can confirm.Parents hired a home builder, but had two good friends in commercial construction and would drop by every Friday. It took an extra six weeks to get the house completed because one of the guys is anal about everything in his life (not just his job), but I was surprised how shitty their house would've been had they not "advised" the builders how to do their jobs. 
No, get thisWe take a rocketAnd we make the rocket a planeAndWePut itOn another planeDude, get some graph paper
When I was in the army, our mechanics told me that if the truck wasn't leaking something, somewhere, it had issues.
Significant digits are a thing.
This sounds like the main character's ending monologue of a Lovecraft story."I have seen what lives in the darkness, inside walls and under floors."
Who needs a functioning sanitation system anyway?
You can also use it to make gravy
It's very annoying when military recruiters try to glorify and upsell everything about it too.
I just had an idea. Be a roaming fake psychic that is paid to get people to dump their shitty SOs. Kind of like the show psych, but breakups instead of crime solving.
Can confirm. I was almost written up for being in the hospital instead of dragging my ass to the manager with a sick note. I'll probably get written up for dying one day. 
Yeah and not only are you already losing that days wage they want you to pay for a doctor to look at you and be like "Yep, they're sick"
> my brother drives for SwiftI feel sorry for your brother. When Im on the road I get away from Swift drivers as fast as I can. 
Because he refused to log it's hours driving?
How was the experience? 
First in friendship, fourth in obesity
I'm wondering if he was worried his suppliers would not believe him. It's a weird story " sorry boss, our cocaine was confiscated and handed over to police"Having the paperwork and being arrested Might of saved his life ..... Or he's stupid AF
She'd cry and he'd play on his phone and the she'd get pissed and start hitting him. He was honestly on of the most tolerant people I've ever met. Eventually some parents started to complain about the scene they were causing (I allowed it to go down for a while because they were in a secluded spot and weren't bothering anyone) and I had to stroll up and shut them down. The guy left no problem but she flipped out on me because I was the sorry chap who found himself in her line of fire and I decided I had to kick her out. She refused to comply so I had to trespass her. 
It's pretty easy as they are governed to be slow as fuck. 
It was hot.
SWIFT: Sure Wish I had a Fast Truck.
I thought about driving for them for a second to learn. Then I looked into them and talked to an old driver of theirs. Nope! Recruiter called this morning. I said nevermind, you can't offer what I want. She asks why not. I ask how often I'll be off.  "Every 12 days then we give you 2 days off." But that might be 1am in NY and by time I am home In CA you'd have me back on the road again. Not to mention you'd be on the road or sleeping that whole 12 days pretty much but only getting paid the amount of miles you can squeeze out @ 62mph.
For the love of god do your presentation first (unless I'm in your class).You get it done and over with, and there is zero chance of you having to follow up a stellar presentation and looking bad. 
Vacation in a foreign country by yourself. This may not sound extreme but I'm willing to bet more people than not don't have the guts to do this, which is understandable because it sounds crazy but I assure you it is not. You'll have the vacation of a lifetime doing whatever the hell you want (increase awesomeness level by not setting an itinerary and just going wherever the wind takes you), meeting new people and trying things you never thought you would. All of my best vacations were solo trips. Go ahead try it.
A bidet
Using Tang in mixed drinks.My favorite is the astronaut's screwdriver: one part vodka, one part sprite, add tang to personal preference.
Sensory deprivation tanks. 
Use conditioner in place of shaving cream.  It softens the hairs and makes for a super smooth shave.
Peanut butter & bacon hamburger. Ordered one from a restaurant once because it was weird and immediately craved them for weeks after to the point I was making them at home. Not a healthy addiction, but that shit's delicious. 
Going to the bathroom while naked at home. It's one of the most freeing experiences. 
Play D&D or some other roleplaying system. Pen and paper RPGs are super intimidating and RPing seems weird to outsiders, but once you get some of the rules down pact and find a good group, you can have a lot of fun. I always say, "why just drink and sit around with friends when you could be rolling dice and saving the world while you drink with friends?"
Pepper on popcorn.
crack a raw egg into your Ramen noodles for three minutes before eating
Teriyaki sauce on pizza.Dry humping
I haven't done this in a while, but when I was driving somewhere with a friend or two in the car, I'd tell them to scream as loud as they could. Like just really scream. Separately, and then together.It sounds super weird, but it feels kinda cool.There is really no place/time where this something you can just do full force (especially living in the city) because you don't want to alarm others/have the cops called.Driving in a car though, no one else will hear it. I've done it alone too (not in quite a while though).I dunno. Just try it.
Smell a new textbook. Put your face right on a page and inhale through your nose, letting your nostrils pack in that scent. Now flip the pages and smell again. Ahhhhh. 
Peanut butter on toast with honey and cinnamon.  Also makes an excellent sandwich but if you put the honey on the toasted bread first it makes a delightful texture.
I'm wearing leggings, and it's the greatest thing in the world.I'm a man.
Cream cheese (along with normal cheese) in your grilled cheese.
Put a donut in the microwave for 15 seconds it will get much better. 
Waffles with peanut butter and maple syrup.
Tickling your butt at the end of a pee.
Dungeons & Dragons
Salt on pineapple, and on watermelon. 
Getting naked in the shower with your SO and rubbing butts 
I microwave cookies. I microwave croissants. I microwave sandwiches. I microwave cake.It's amazing.
Wear your socks inside out. +35% more comfort in seconds. 
My Nan used to make me a thing known only as Bread, Milk and Sugar. You rip up a slice or two or bread into little chunks the size of large coins into a mug. You then pour in milk. Pop in the microwave for 2 minutes. Then lightly add sugar and eat with a spoon... God it sounds disgusting when I write it down but I swear it tastes good, try it!
Get Lasik. It's not as scary as it sounds and will seriously  change you're life. 
Dressing up as a dinosaur when going snowboarding. You're gonna look fucking awesome.
Chicken Noodle soup with Peanut Butter sandwiches. It sounds gross, but it's actually amazing. These are the sort of combinations you have when you grow up poor lol
Let's be friends with benefits
To get rid of hiccups 99% of the time bend over forward with your upper body parallel with the ground, and drink water from the opposite side of the cup of where you would normally place your mouth.  Hard to explain but you have to slowly tip the cup forwards (while upside down) until you can sip from the opposite edge of the cup.This works everytime but you look like the biggest weirdo doing it.
I got a good one here! Basically next time you're walking out to your car stand at a range where your unlock button or command start won't reach.Now take the key fob stick it under your jaw and open wide. You will be surprised to see your car unlocks or starts. Good trick for those cold winter mornings where you don't want to walk out to your car.
Licking butt. I was afraid at first. Now she and I include it in our foreplay
r/showerorange
Finger in the butt.
this was what i always did in high school. just get it over and done with, and you dont have to sit there getting more anxious or worrying that yours isnt as good as someone who just did theirs. At university if there was an assignment that involved a presentation, and the presentations would take several classes/weeks for everyone to do theirs, i would always volunteer to do mine the first week. teachers often grade you easier compared to those who get another week or two to prepare. 
My method has alway been to go second. Then you avoid the nerves of going first, and the chance of the first person giving an amazing presentation and upstaging you is slim.
You lost me with the curtain cracking nonsense. I splash water on the walls and then stick the curtain to it on both sides and seal myself in there with all that warm, steamy goodness.
More of a shath guy
Bidet to you too
Using one on my honeymoon was really a curse more than anything. Since I came home, my asshole has never really felt clean.
Yup an amazing product. Went to asia for a year. Didn't use toilet paper for atleast 6 months. Came back to the west and no one had a bum gun, felt like I was living in an uncivilized world. Dirty heathens 
Went to Japan, have no idea why we dont have them in the US
Might just be the water rehydrating you.  Mine are mostly triggered by dehydration or too much salt consumption, and water is exactly what helps if I get it in before it goes full swing.  
This is how I get rid of hangover headaches. Super cold water and hold it in my teeth until it hurts. Sucks the headache right out.
We made something similar in college but since we used vodka and Tang we called them Cosmonauts. 
Just tried this for the first time last week.  All the videos said time flies.  Thought I was about 20 minutes in, and my 90 minutes was up.
As someone who's claustrophobic I just don't think I can get down with this.  Have you actually tried it?  I'm curious.
So it actually kind of worked. I think I didn't put quite enough Tabasco in. But I definitely thought I was going to regret taking advice from reddit and I didn't, so it was a definite success
I actually ordered mine from a 3 a.m. infomercial with 100% intention on returning it after the 15 day trial.  They never billed my credit card, and 9 years later that teeter hangups is still the BOMB!
I like to balance myself parrallel to the ground when im stoned... And just lay there.
Do you get this feeling every time you use it? And usually how long do you have to hang before this feeling hits you?
Note: Do not do this on your nether bits if you are a lady. It burns hotter than Satan's asshole.
This definitely sounds like an Elvis Presley sort of creation
Makes sense to me - humans are one of the only animals that poop while wearing pants. 
Why would I put on clothes to use the bathroom, I don't understand?
I want to get into d&d so bad but I'm a single dad with no time/friends to play with.
Old Bay on Popcorn
You just keep cracking the egg for three minutes?
I freaking love egg drop. It always goes in when I eat ramen.
Not sure if this is a short list of unrelated suggestions, or one extremely specific suggestion.
Well that escalated quickly.
Also works in the back of the police car.
Really, do a bunch of ridiculous vocalizations in your car. Talk in an accent. Sing in a goofy voice. Pretend YOU'RE the host the radio show. Playing with your voice is fun and being in your car gives you the freedom of not worrying about other people hearing you.
I do this! Usually when I'm just mad about something. But I never scream anywhere else, like actually scream, besides my car.It's really quite therapeutic. Haha. 
I used to do this on long elevator rides. Now I live in a walk up and have to wait until I'm on a freeway overpass for my primal screaming.
And that crack the cover makes when you first flip open a hard-cover textbook, ahhh 
In college I created a drink I called "liquid Easter" by combining 1/4 root beer to 3/4 lemonade. It tastes like pastels. 
At little League after the game we all got a free hotdog and soda. When asked what soda we wanted we used to say "Swamp me". The person pouring the drinks would proceed to put a little of everything in the cup: pepsi, sierra mist, mt dew, root beer, and orange soda. Tasted alright. 
My mom used to mix root beer and chocolate milk. Sounds gross but it actually tastes really good! The taste resembles that of a root beer float. 
People would always freak out when I did this. Eat the lil butt too. Eat the whole damn ting.
I just can't do this. The fluffy feeling sets my teeth on edge and makes me so uncomfortable.
But isn't that normal 
I can get behind this. I just recently discovered jeans with a bit of stretch in them, and they are amazing. 5/7, will never wear non stretchy pants again. I am eagerly awaiting the women's yoga pants tend to make its way to men. It will be a glorious day, full of moose knuckles and awkward boners, but fuck will it be comfortable!
Aren't long johns basically leggings 
I put mayo on the outside of the grilled cheese before putting it in the pan (instead of butter). Real nice.
I guess youre probably not from the UK because over here they sell a doritos branded sour cream dip and it's completely normal
If you're going to try this with filled donuts (UK here) just be aware that the filling will be hotter than the surface of the sun when you bite into it. 
For fucking?
I dip mcnuggets in honey
Taking care of my grandad currently. They moved next to me recently. He can't walk so we help him stand when he has to pee.Second day my grandma is like "look, if you tickle him here he pees more". And he did.What a life.
What kind of tickling? Like the outer cheek or am I checking for prostate cancer?
It makes you pee a little bit more!
Just got into /r/criticalrole and seriously want to get a group together. Seems like being a DM is a loooot of work though..
Also good on mango.
Salt + chili flakes on pineapple....yum
I like it when we put our chests together and make a swimming pool with the water that catches, then releasing it all at once!  Showering with an SO is fun.
My bf is very hairy and I like to soap up his chest and use him as a loofah. It's hilarious
Calm down, Applebees
Microwave doughnuts from Dunkin Donuts. Do you ever buy one and the donut isn't super soft and the topping is starting to get a little more solid than you like? Microwave that shit for 10 seconds, it will taste like it's a 5am freshly made doughnut. This is especially true for their glazed, you may as well be turning it into a Krispy Kreme. Its that good.
My daughter recently discovered this trick.  Now she's like, a master chef at school, showing all these kids how to microwave their chocolate chip cookies.
Taking these small kinds of 'risks' have improved my life so much! I feel like my anxiety has practically disappeared and I'm a lot more confident. Start small: email customer service instead of calling if that's too overwhelming-you'll get there :)
I think this is the best one in the thread. I wish I could do this more often, overthinking is my downfall.
is.. is this the plot to Yes Man?
Oooohhh... I want this so bad but so scared...
Grilled cheese and tomato soup is the bomb
my job gives me health benefits. does that count? 
Working on this right now. Now accepting advice.
This has inherent attrition bias. Those who finish it love it because they're the type of people that would finish this sort of thing and love it. It's about the people, not the showers. Or maybe that's your point?
It's currently -4 Fahrenheit where I'm at and I work outside often. Call it a excuse or a reason or whatever but I'm not passing up a warm shower after work. No fucking thanks. 
Lol I have had chronic hiccups for over 3 years. I have tried every remedy in the book, but I see how it might work as a distraction to pass a typical case. 
I can't decide if this is something that works like a Pringles can antenna, or just another trick to make it look like I'm jerking an invisible dick onto my face.
Should I microwave it first?
...and everyone acts like you're literally eating a loaf of shit off a greasy Chinatown bathroom floor. He said *lick her butt* not *eat her shit*.
The first time I went to the US. I landed in San Jose airport. There's an In-n-Out just round the corner. Went there. Saw a fat arse hispanic kid. He looked at me, dead in the eye, dipped his chips in his milkshake and ate it. That was my first fucking day. Y'all are fucked.
Your finger, your butt?Your finger, their butt?Their finger, your butt?Or their finger, their butt?
And they look highly on people with the balls to go first.
This guy bowers.
That's where you shit in a bath. 
^^^^^Do ^^^^^you ^^^^^spice?
Found the critter
See, if the product was marketed as a bum gun, it would totally catch on.
I always got relief from an ice pack on my neck when I had a migraine, so likely its the cold constricting the blood vessels and not the water.
We make something similar in college but since we use Country Time and Everclear we keep it nameless. 
Could you describe your experience?
Same I went for two hours and thought I was in there for 30 minutes.
I feel you the whole concept always sound like a panic attack waiting to happen.  
Any noticeable effects in your sons behavior, or is it just so that he can turn off the noise?
My main concern is that the sound will be so quiet I can hear my body, like a heartbeat. That thought unnerves me (I hate heartbeats), so will it be a problem?
Well, good.  You should of course adjust the idea to what works for you.  
Good find.> Conclusions: Oral ingestion of wasabi is well tolerated. While it appears to cause a subjective sensation of increased nasal patency (openness), **it actually congests the nose**.
Was it the older guy with white hair with magical posture doing inverted situps?  He almost got me too.
Could you not just lay on the floor then?
Thank you so much for saying that. I was actually debating testing out OP's conditioner tip down there. You've dissuaded me otherwise (thank God I read the responses).
What are the other ones?
found the Marylander
as many as you can
I mean what are they going to do, right? Double arrest you?
but you can hear people just talking inside the elevator when you're walking past in the hallway...I can't imagine what was going through the heads of all the people that heard you screaming 
Like *pastels*? Are you a synesthete?
We called this suicide! I loved it as a kid but haven't tried it in a long time 
FFS, can I go one day on Reddit without being told to eat a butt?
I now eat it while driving. Extremely nice driving food.
It feels like what I imagine a tarantula's abdomen feels like.
There's something about that texture that seems distinctly unfoodlike.
Yea I tried to, but it's kind of hard to act nonchalant when I have "love pink" written on my butt. 
Not even close. Get a pair of compression pants and you're going to find out what we're talking about.
Well that's an interesting twist.... I hope nothing bad happened. 
Believe it or not we do have filled donuts in the U.S. as well. 
Thats the only way I can eat them. Has been for 15 years.
I would like to subscribe to daily Kevin Costner facts. Please and thank you.
?
It doesn't have to be. I tend to do maybe an hour of prep per session, mainly because my players never do what I expect anyway. If you do some work up front, like say 5-10hrs of building the framework of the story, then you can just improv everything in between. Also, if your players are cool, they won't care if you fumble around a bit. Everyone still has a great time.
You forgot the lime!
It's because you only change the head monthly. I have very coarse, thick facial hair and shave daily. I need a new blade weekly.
You can even do this alone by bringing your knees up to your chest and rocking back and forth gently!
do you say "I loofah you honey"?
I have never seen a comment with this much Karma before, Jesus Christ.
How does it feel to out-karma Poem_for_your_sprog in this thread by only typing three words?
KK actually recommends microwaving for 8 seconds.Source: It's on the box of dozens.
As someone who struggles with anxiety as well, I have to ask if there's anything in particular, even if just a quote or something to change your perspective, that's helped with the fear of public embarrassment? It seems to be the basis for my anxiety most of the time :(
Could you guys give some examples of small risks? It would be helpful to have a checklist or something. I'd *like* to do this, I just have a hard time thinking of things that don't sound exhausting. 
That's why you should just stop thinking. It might sound weird but trust me
Oh my God, you have changed my life. I bought a onesie for the first time around Halloween and now I can be kickass unicorn, mysteriously appearing out of trees!! 
Idk if you're just saying this unrelated to the threads question but this is literally one of the most common combos ever.
That depends, are you just friends with your job, or is there something stronger - something *realer* - under the surface? Do you find yourself thinking of your job at times, even though normally, you wouldn't think of other jobs in the same way? Do you notice little things about your job that you didn't before? Simple things, really, just small details that make your job more precious to you than your other friends? If so, you might be more than just friends with your job, even if you try to tell yourself otherwise.
Whenever my hiccups last more than a few hours or even carry over to the next day, I fear that they will never go away. You are living my nightmare. 
Just remember if you do that the filling will be hotter than the surface of the sun
But, butts is where the poop comes from!
I laughed so hard at this. Welcome to America. 
Little of column A, little of column B, little of column C, little of column.. D
Does it have to be your bath or can it be someone else's bath?
There's dozens of us! Dozens!
Constructing the vessels and rehydrating would both increase blood pressure. So maybe that's where the answer lies? 
I would say maybe they just short you on time on purpose and tell you "yeah man you're so sensory deprived that you don't even know how fast time goes!" but actually they only really leave you in there for 30 minutes but then I realized most people have a phone to verify -- I'm dumb. 
For about a week, he was so much calmer. He seemed centered. I don't know how else to describe it. We are making this a regular thing for him.
Whenever I hear my heart I'm reminded of my fraility. 
Whether a little wasabi works or not, having eaten super-hot peppers before, I can say that they leave me breathing completely clear.  After 30 minutes of excrutiating pain, but clear nonetheless.
I'm over 72 years old *pause and jump* AND I FEEL GREAT!
YUP...thats the one!  and its true!
*attaches 2nd set of cuffs*You are under double arrest for screaming in a squad car.  You have the right to remain twice as silent as before.  Anything you say can be used in a court of law twice.  You have the right to a second attorney. 
Sometimes they would press the button and I would stop before the door opened. When they got on, they would ask, "Were you just screaming?" And I would shrug and say, *weird, right, I heard it, too* and they would eye me suspiciously as we rode down to the lobby.
Like pastel candy? Pastel easter candy? Crap. That could be chocolate, gummies, smarties. Anything!  All easter candy is pastel!!!
I eat stickers all the time!
I know it sounds weird, but just try it. 
Why not eat a bowl of cereal while driving as well, you goddamn weirdo.
You've ruined everything. 
It's like the carpet at a bowling alley. 
but underarmor makes my leg hair feel funny after a while :(
Haha luckily I was standing right there and noticed immediately, it was mostly just smoking with a tiny flame that I easily blew out. Once I was sure everything was safe I hurried the hell out of the room  and no one at work ever asked about it, so I think everything turned out okay. 
I hate when you ask for honey and they give you honey mustard.
It takes some time and practice as both a DM and player to get to the point where you can DM like that though.
Goddam, it ain't even pineapple at that point. 
I go through Tajin at an alarming rate for a white guy...So.fucking.good.
Best part, is your tears will mix with the water and you won't be able to tell that you're crying!
No he conditioner to not make bad puns
Just click the upvote button 3 times when that happens. 
I think I think I used to think,  But now I think no more -  The thoughts I always thought I thought,  I thought, I think, before.And now, I think, I think a thought  Infrequently, and so -  The rarer thoughts I think I think  Are lesser thought, you know? So shed the thoughts you think you think,  And when your thoughts have shrunk -  You'll see the thoughts you thought you thought  Are better thought unthunk.
The great thing about tigger outfits is you can wear it every Halloween. Last year tigger police, this year tigger army man, next year tigger stripper...it's great!

That's funny, I only see rows...

That sounds like it would make me take a nap...and that light would not be enough to wake me.They'd have to come tap on my floating nudity to get out that pod.
I have a very weird phobia where I'm afraid of my own heartbeat. Especially when I go to sleep and lay on my left side, I become super aware of it and become afraid that I'd hear it stop. 
Oh my bad, I thought it was something that you bought for your house!
Dude got like 4 inches off the ground, but damn, I hope I'm that healthy when I'm that age.
Can I get the other guys attorney? If the state doesn't have an attorney, and I have both attorneys, I win. 
Trick is to keep on screaming when the door opens. They won't get in, you can continue your ride alone. 
It tastes a great deal like crayons too though. The 4-year old in me says that's a good thing. I've asked him to get out, but he doesn't want to. Such a pain in the ass.
This is how this sub was meant to be used.
Taste like sand 
he isnt some donkey brain idiot
I can't believe you've done this
Maybe I can fix it.It feels like going down on a woman that shaved a few days ago.
Huh. I've never tasted the carpet at the bowling alley. How exactly did you discover this?
Every fucking time! I try not to get aggravated, but its hard not to when you say: "Yes, honey, the sauce that bees make." And they still fuck it up! 
No,  it's something new,  something fresh,  something *better*. 
Sounds like something straight out of Dr. Seuss. A+
Remind me to never ever do this
Try some of column A, try all of column B. I'm in the mood to help you, dude...
SOMEONE ELSE WITH THIS!
There are a few companies that build them but a quick Google search reveals that you can also build them for just under $2000. The expense comes from the pumps and the heaters meant to keep the water at a consistent temperature.
A lot of 72 year olds struggle with just standing up unassisted. Jumping at 72 is downright athletic. 
^^"aaaaaa ^aaaaa aaaaaaaa ^aaaaaa ^^aaaaaaa""Huh, I just read about that on reddit"
Instead it's all "outrageous sexual thing that's just as ridiculous with context"
That pears not ripe, dude
He never should have come here.
Well great, now you've just made me associate that with tarantulas too.
*For five years, I was stranded on an island with only one goal: survive. Now I will fulfill my father's dying wish - to use the list of herbs and spices he left me and bring down those who are poisoning my fruit. To do this, I must become someone else. I must become something else*
It's an 8-6-8 meter poem, almost a duotrain but each stanza doesn't start with the same letter. Dr Seuss uses anapestic tetrameter :O
Screaming: "HUH, I JUST READ ABOUT THAT ON REDDIT"
That's why r/evenwithcontext exists. But people managed to mess that up too. 
He burned us. Gypsy son of a bitch burned us!
Fine.It feels like going down on a freshly shaved tarantula.
I am... the green salted chili - flaked lime covered pineapple.
And now I'm sad
What're you doing to my friend, bozo?
Well you picked it out!
The entire album called Age of Winters by The Sword. Electric Machine by Acid King. Anything by Red Fang. Kadavar is another good band. Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats. Pallbearer. Kyuss. Elder. 
Kingdom by Devin Townsend Project is the perfect see metal can be beautiful song.
Cemetery Gates by Pantera
Shooting star - Gojira.    Fuck it, just listen to all of Magma.    If you're still not satisfied try Crack the Skye by Mastodon. If you need more, let me know.    When you learn how to hear the music in what you are referring to as "noise" listen to The Great Collapse by Fit For An Autopsy. Your head will violently fragment.     If you use to listen to Cradle of Filth, graduate to Anaal Nathrak.
I'm listening to these recommendations, and it's official -- you guys just created a new metal fan. I'm really liking Animals as Leaders in particular. ETA -- Thank you for the gold, kind strangers! 
Language : Intuition by The Contortionist. Also, Blind Side by Skyharbor.
Sad Wings of Destiny - Judas Priest. Old school British metal and almost operatic.
Mastodon - Oblivion
Colors by Between the Buried and Me. . Whole album is absolutely amazing. Also not super heavy in comparison to some.
Orion - MetallicaOne of my favorites
*Orion* or *Call of Ktulu* by Metallica.  Can't be considered screaming if it has no vocals.  
Fiddler on the Green by Demons and Wizards or Sacred Worlds by Blind Guardian. 
I can't think of much that *is* just insane noise and screaming. Most of it is very structured and technical. People just can't look past the abrasive dissonance. But if they need to hear something that's less of that, maybe Insomnium's latest album. 
*Fear of the Dark* by Iron Maiden. 
Children of the Grave - Black Sabbath, I Want Out - Helloween, Princess of the Night - Saxon, Holy Diver - Dio, and almost anything by Iron Maiden
Anything by Sabaton, really.
Anything by Animals as Leaders 
*Sleeping Stars* by Wintersun
Metallicas S&M concert with Michael Kamen and his orchestra.
anything from the the album symbolic by death
Come Clarity by In Flames Is my choice here i think, or anything from the album A Sense of Purpose.
- Dream Theater - Pull Me Under- Dream Theater - Another Day- Pagan's Mind - The Celestine Prophecy- Symphony X - The Odissey
Symphony of Destruction by Megadeth. The video is awesome and still relevant as fuck.
Master of Puppets by Metallica
Ladies love Type O Negative. 
Are we considering Tool as metal?  
Almost anything by sabaton
Metal often rivals classical music in complexity (no exagerration). People who only hear it as "insane noise and screaming" have trouble processing it as music for some reason. I would probably pick something slower with simpler passages, like Black Ninja by Battle Beast and continue with faster and more demanding songs if they can catch on.
This is amazing. Thank you for sharing!
>and a copy of Odin on our Side or Jomsviking    What? Not Twilight of the Thunder God? Not Surtur Rising? DECEIVER OF THE GODS?     How dare you, sir. How dare you.
Found the stoner.
Sleep is the band that got me into metal; I never thought I was into it until I heard Holy Mountain when I worked at a record store in college, and then quickly got into everything else you listed. 
Don't forget Electric Wizard.
Anything from the Sword really
If you like Nightwish you should maybe try Epica.
Any time someone says they like Nightwish, I recommend Within Temptation. I like some of their older stuff, like The Heart of Everything. Their newer album Hydra is also pretty good.
I love her voice, makes me think of a siren song
Really, anything by Iron Maiden would work, but Hallowed Be Thy Name would be one of the best choices.
Iron Maiden is another of the bands that made me realize you could actually sing like hell in a metal band instead of growling.
Of all the Iron Maiden songs I've introduced to my friends, dance of death is the best received.
As the priest comes to read me the last rites, take a look through the bars at the last sights
Also came to say Iron Maiden, but I was going to say No More Lies.
Don't forget Blind Guardian!!*A Twist in the Myth* and *A Night at the Opera* are nuts.
Holy fuck Kamelot showing up in an askreddit thread. 
Holy crap another Sonata Arctica fan on reddit
GAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYTEEEEESSSSS!!!!!!
Pantera is just a kickass band. Even though Anselmo's voice is gravely and he does scream; I feel that it's not as noisy as other metal.
Whyd i have to scroll so far down to find panteraBasically all of vulgar display of power
Crack The Skye, man.I love that album. My favorite of all time.Amazing album and super emotional, after you get to know the story behind it.Shit crushed me.
Oh shit! Twelve Foot Ninja! That's a great starter!!
Dude check out polyphia, intervals, and chonAnd vitalism is nuts as well
Animals as Leaders is a band that lots of non metal music lovers really like. 
One of us! One of us! One of us!
Yeezus the Language album is PUUUREE BLIIISSSS... Once Language part I comes in it cannot go out and without part II
The Drapery Falls is another good example. 
Opeth is an amazing band. Any metal vocalist that can growl like a demon dog and still have the throat for clean vocals get my vote.
I love that whole album, especially the end of Deliverance! But I might play The Lotus Eater or Bleak (I love the bit from around 6:40 onwards) that shows off a lot of their range in one song. 
I can't BELIEVE I had to scroll so far down for Priest.
Whoa someone who knows Diablo Swing Orchestra! I found them while looking at electro-swing and have been obsessed with that weird quirky sound ever since. Bedlam Sticks is a great one to confuse the hell out of people with haha
Ahhh the warm fuzzies of seeing a Dream Theater mention.
Absolutely stunning album. This guy knows what he's talking about. 
Best metal album ever made imo, but will probably just sound like random screaming to someone who doesn't listen to a lot of metal.
Couldn't believe the solo was a bassguitar when someone first told me that. 
Might not be everyone's cup of tea just because it's an instrumental. But tbh this is my favorite song of all time and has been for quite awhile. It's just perfect to me beginning to end.
Another is the Call of Ktulu was a great instrumental by them. Probably my favorite of them
Anything by Ghost really. They have a lot of hauntingly beautiful songs.
god seeing this live was insane. papa paused an extra few moments in between "can't you see that you're lost...........without me" and the crowd lost their fucking minds in between
TIL Call of Ktulu is by Metallica, not Megadeth
I feel like Metallica is an easy entry point for anyone to get into metal.
The percussive and vocal techniques common to most metal are very grating.  The dissonance is not an issue for me.
Fear of the Dark live.
The bass line in children of the grave though....... :)))
THROUGH THE GATES OF HELL
IN-TO THE MOTHERLAND 
Seeing them next week! Cannot wait
In particular some of the sad songs they have would be a great introduction... "The Final Solution" in particular gives me goosebumps every time I hear the chorus.    "Where freedom burns,    the Final Solution,    dreams fade away,    and all hope turns to dust."Such an intensily sad song
THEN THE WINGED HUSSARS ARRIVED!
BAPTIZED IN FIRE
Nice man, I was just about to post a link to something from Night is the New Day.
The technicality, off time signatures and experimental noises might shy some away. I love AAL. You might also dig Polyphia or Chon
Didnt Chris Lee have a metal band of his own? (I can call him Chris, we were close like that)
I don't think they're for metal beginners, I had to ease my way into their style but anything by death is hands down the best death metal in existence.  Check out "unquestionable presence" by Atheist if you haven't heard of it
Finally an In Flames mention. I personally think Clayman is quite accessible as well.
"Mist" is one of my favourite songs by them. It's just such a happy song.
Holy Wars, son.
So, for some context. Odin on our Side was my introduction to Amon Amarth, so it's got a special place in my heart. It's my favorite album by them.I'm also one of those weird folks who really likes Jomsviking more than most. Twilight of the Thunder God is like neck and neck with it for what I was going to put here.
Nah not me. I only get stoned when I'm high.
The joke is on Kyle's mom. Who smells like pot now.
Sleep is so fucking good. It's funny to throw Dopesmoker on when people ask me to pick a song. I'm down to listen to anything that involves Matt Pike as well. High on Fire is brutal. Doesn't fit in with this question but they're still brutal as fuck. 
Dopethrone is a masterwork
And Kamelot, too. 
And Delain
Tarja was trained in opera, and has some solo work that frankly isn't as good as her Nightwish stuff, but is still pretty good considering she has the voice of an angel. Annette, their second singer who did all the female vocals for Dark Passion Play and Imaginaerum, brings more of a pop element to the band. And Floor, their most recent singer, I think is a good balance between the two with good range, but more poppy than Tarja, but more opera than Annette. All three are very good just at very different things.
Which singer? There's been 3 (at least)
Thanks, I'm a big Devin fan but never listened to Strapping Young Lad stuff because the song or two I tried I didn't care for, this was a good song tho
Plenty of Judas Priest songs as well. If a person thinks metal is all screaming, they're probably just looking at the wrong subgenre, frankly. It's just as misguided as saying all rap is about shooting cops - no, you're just listening to the rappers that rap about shooting cops. 
They were around long before growling was a common thing. Most of the big bands from that era had very talented vocalists.
Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, Ronnie James Dio, metal bands all with great singers, that's what metal was in the eighties, right up until Metallica changed all that. My point being, it's two different kinds of metal, underscored not just by the singing, but by the playing, too. Old metal is melodic, new metal strident, anxious and aggressive. 
Some bands can do this, Maiden being one of them. Other bands fall flat on their face when they try to do that.
At a world that has gone very wrong for me.
Maiden:Fear of the Dark2 Minutes 2 MidnightRun to the HillsPowerslaveThe Number of The BeastThe Trooper...and so many more. Just listen to everything. Your life will be better for it.
I'd recommended basically every other Maiden song if you loved Hallowed Be Thy Name so much. Sabaton is another band that I got into because of Maiden though their sound is a bit rougher in some songs than anything by Maiden. 
Are they rare?  Like, they're not a huge band, but it's not like they're incredibly obscure as far as power metal bands go.  I'm a fan, pesonally.
Crack the Skye is also my all-time favourite album. I love how the album flows from one track to the next, the technical musicianship and of course the emotion behind it all.
Been busy 'ave ya, mate?!?
Intervals are so fucking great
Gobble gabble gobble!
The whole of Blackwater Park is something special to me.
Can confirm. Album is a masterpiece. Some of the songs may be fairly heavy for a noob but Ants of the Sky has enough different genres in one song to please just about anyone. 
metallica's instrumentals (orion, ktulu, to live is to die, anesthesia) are spectacular. orion gets me every time. 
"He is" is beautiful and melodic all while talking about the how great the devil is. It's fucking awesome!
Ghost puts on some of the best live shows I've ever seen. Papa *really* knows how to engage with a crowd
True, though Dave Mustaine is credited for it.
I particularly like *One* to introduce doubters to as well.
There's a reason Metallica is often cited as the group that brought metal from a niche genre to the mainstream.
I never realized that some people don't like metal drums. 
Gotta be the live version. So good.
AS WE MAKE OUR WAY TO HEAVEN
THE GERMAN ARMY MARCH
For me it's *To Hell and Back* and *Resist and Bite*. There's something about the helplessness those song convey that gets me every time.
Reddit is filled with a lot of elitist people, please don't see them as what the 'majority' feels. Sabaton is fucking amazing. 
COMING DOWN FROM MOUNTAIN SIDE!
Ahh...the album responsible for getting throngs of punk kids (like me) into metal in the early 2000's....
How can you get high if you're stoned
"Put a song on!""Ok!" Puts on Sleep's Dopesmoker on vinyl[half an hour goes by]"Hold up. I got to flip the record""Damn, this is a long song...""This is only disc one."
And Within Tempation
And Leaves Eyes. And Sirenia. 
Yeah, I feel like it's a case where a lot of the criticism would just come from people who are fans of Tarja-era Nightwish being fans partly because they like Tarja's voice and style, which would naturally make them not a fan of the dramatic style shift when Annette joined.
Dude listen to the "City" album. That is one of the greatest things Townsend has ever created. 
I saw Judas Priest in Toronto in 2011. Halford was 60 a the time and he belted out two hours of hits like it was nothing. Hitting all the highs and vibrato like crazy. It was incredible.
True, but nowadays most people aren't as familiar with classic metal bands and just associate "metal" with death metal and metalcore.
Well tbf the whole point of thrash when it first started was to be the fastest metal around. And Metallica did manage to mix aggressiveness and melodic stuff in their stuff bar Kill 'Em All which is just all alpha male stuff lol
> Some bandsNot sure how much metal you listen to, but fuck tons of bands do this and succeed. Hell, the overwhelming majority of power metal bands are clean and well sung vocals. 
Tears fall but why am I cryingAfter all I'm not afraid of dyingDon't I believe that there never is an end?
I really like Aces High. I'm seeing them in June but it doesn't look like they will be playing it.
Typical, though."Hey metal head, what's a good metal song for me to try?""Here's a full 120GB iPod to start with."
I love all of Mastodon's albums, but this one will forever be at the top.
Busier than a dog with two dicks!
Libra is insane. First time I heard it, it put a smile on my face. That doesn't happen much. 
Metallica has some other great instrumentals:* "Anesthesia (Pulling teeth)", from "Kill 'Em All"* "Call of the Ktulu", from "Ride the Lightning"* "To Live is to Die", from "...And Justice for All" (has some spoken words in it, though)
It really comes down to the use of the bass drum.  If they really lay it on thick, particularly for long durations, then I just can't stand it.  
But which live version? Iron Maiden is a band that has quality changes based on who the singer is.If it is Rock in Rio, hells yeah.
THROUGH THE NAZI LINES
COMRADES SIDE BY SIDE.
Hell yeah. I saw them live at a rather small venue a couple years back. They came in and just fucking delivered all over us.    The crowd chanted for the vocalist to show his "tits". He tried to wiggle out of it I think and was "what the fuck is wrong with you people?", but the crowd as unrelenting so he took off his shirt.  One of the best nights of my life. To be honest it was more because of Avatar (fucking sick band) than Sabaton. I still to this day can't put words to what I felt that night. 
THEN THE WINGED HUSSARS ARRIVED!
Hell yes. Only for the Weak was my gateway.
That's his secret, captain. He's always stoned.
Which is dumb because the entire power metal genre exists 
Running loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow
I put Leviathan above it, but they're both nearly flawless.
Busier than a one legged man at an ass kicking competition?
Plini plini plini. It took nearly 30 years, but that guy has become my new guitar god. Love intervals, as well, but plini hits only all the right notes for me. 
That is my favorite part.
PRIMO VICTORIA!
TO STOP THE NAZI CHARGE
Found Bong Banner. I mean Bruce Bonger. I mean The Incredible Joint...Whatever, my point is that he's really stoned all of the time.
Black Halo was the first song I ever heard from Kam. Second metal band I really ever got into and still my second favorite band!
Busier than a cat.....Burying shit on concrete.

Y'all know Sonny the cocoa puffs bro is on PCP right? He'd fuck shit up.
That Boo Berry motherfucker is a ghost.  
The Raisin Bran sun would probably just incinerate everyone else.
Mr. T. Easy win.
Any generic brand cereal mascot that is sold in just a bag could fuck up any name brand cereal bitch, because those generic brands are hood as fuck.
Those rapey cannibalistic Krave fuckers for sure
Tony is a big sumbitch, and a fuckin' TIGER. I think he's got this one in the bag.
The Lucky Charms leprechaun, hands down. That little guy has been chugging Guinness, shooting Sugar Smacks, and popping Yellow Moons and Blue Diamonds all day. Plus he's Irish, has a lot of bar fights under his belt and is good with his fists.
Have we forgotten that John Cena is now on the boxes of Fruity Pebbles?He could take a shotgun blast to the face and still kick out at two.
Sounds like /r/whowouldwin 
Those little Cinnamon Toast Crunch fuckers.  They'd just run around biting off body parts, I'm sure. 
Remember the nintendo cereal? If they kick ass in super smash bros, they will kick ass in the colluseum
Oh holy shit I want this to be a movie.  Does anyone on Reddit know any movie producers?My money is on Captain Crunch since he has military experience, and probably a sword unless Kellogg's emasculated all the cartoon characters to appease 90s/00s moms.  He'd also enlist the Lucky Charms leprechaun and the Trix rabbit with promises of revenge on those thieving kids that took their cereal, feeding off their anger like Emperor Palpatine.
Count chocula, he's a vampire so probably basically immortal.
Eyehole Man, no contest.
COUNT CHOCULA IS A FUCKING VAMPIREIf this is a scenario where everyone is dumped into an arena and no one has time to prepare, thus not bringing along a wooden stake, the Count is easily winning this one.

Hi, Brendan Jones here, creator of that dusty gem known as "Breakfast of the Gods." Thanks for the shout-out and for reminding people it existed.The comic's purpose was, in fact, to answer such questions, to pay tribute to long-lost icons of my youth, to satirize the grim'n'gritty world of comic book crossovers ...and tempt the wrath of multiple corporations. I succeeded(?)Anyhoo, I hope those that have rediscovered BOTG - or discovered it for the first time - enjoy it. 
yeah but it was a six shooter...
I like the image of a bunch of anthropomorphic animated characters taking each section of the arena, and then in one corner there's just a dude with an actual literal gun that just shoots them in the face and goes home
Powdered Cocoa Puffs?
You guys realize that the mascot for Raisin Bran is a fucking sun, right? I mean, in practice it makes 0 sense - but my money is on the 10,000 degree star... 
Well to be fair, he cannot exit the arena alive then...?
I pity all those other fools.
elaborate
There is no need to be upset
Man I haven't seen that box in years.  I remember going to Florida in summer 2004 and we were commenting about that gorilla on the box.  Glad to know he's still getting around.
Holy fuck, I had no idea the Jimmies gorilla was from a fucking cereal box.
Or he'd get shot and there would be more fighting except now with everyone's dicks out.
Wouldn't he just get shot the moment he tries to grab someone?
Malt O Meal would kick some serious ass
Honey Nut Scooters will fuck you up 
I actually like the taste of generic better...
Thank you. And thank you for not calling them green jelly.

only the sun can really stop him if the sun isn't just the shape of ittigers are killing machines* 310kg mass* 50-65 KPH top speed* massive teeth* if it turns in to a really long battle everyone but him will get hungery as tigers only need to eat every 3 days * they have fought  crocodiles, wolfs, leopards and pythons even mother fucking Bears in the past
Plus he can summon his devoted furry army.
Not to mention his entire career is built off never being captured and always escaping.
The New Day are on boxes of Booty-O's cereal. I reckon they could take out John Cena.
Cap'n Crunch isn't a pirate. He is a decorated officer who gave the majority of his life to the service of.....I don't know, crunch berries or something. In any event the guy has an ethos, calling him a Pirate is down right wrong.
This is the ultimate showdown~
Holy shit.
When I got up this morning I *really* didn't expect to be reading about the Cuckoo bird ripping out Toucan Sam's trachea.
You forgot about Chip from Cookie Crisp or go back to the nineties, it was cookie cop
This is the strangest /r/threadkillers I've seen. 
I'm not convinced about the Flintstones, 2 very young children and 3 midle aged people  vs a tiger I don't think will go well if they just have clubs as they have to get right up and close to him the children lack the aginlity or speed not to get mauled for sure so that's 3 and a leaping attack or poor manoeuvring on their part leaving 1 isolated will bring that down to 2 who are then easily dispatched, even if the kill tony they will be in no state to take on anyone afterwardsTLDR:I don't think they have the agility, speed or reach to do anything without being killed themselves
 >Sonny The Cuckoo Bird not only wins, but also incites a military coup to overthrow the government, and becomes a harsh yet benevolent ruler of his people #Make Cocoa Puffs Great Again 
Yeah, this prompt definitely belongs there.  Thought it was until I saw how many points and comments it had.

"Is there any place I can squantch around here?" -That thing.
Rated NC-17 for adult situations and excessive scissoring.
Well at least he's not pretending he won't kill.
Yeah he might take out a silly rabbit or something, but he's not taking out Gorilla Munch AND Tony the Tiger with a six shooter. And do bullets even kill vampires? I kinda want to go with Count Chocula. He'll have all that blood to refuel on. Oh shit wait, does count chocula refuel on chocolate, I might have to rethink this. Damn this is hard.
The Boy Scouts official magazine is Boy's Life.  Every so often they'll re-run their first issue from 1925(?) to commemorate something or other.  In it, was a subscription offer.  Sell 20 magazines and they will send you a free* .22 long rifle.  Sell 50 and you could get a shotgun! God bless America. 
take out people like tony and the gorilla and you have taken out the big threats though
There's nine bodies, genius!  What the fuck were you gonna do, *laugh* the last three to death, Funny Man?!
Coca puffs
I was wondering that about count chocula too. 
Problem is, the mascot is an emblem of stopping ghosts, not ghostbusters, it's like a no parking sign is the mascot.
There is little more scary than Snap, Crackle and Pop's understanding of higher order derivatives.
> Cap'n Crunch has the military experiencebut by the look of it form the 17 and 1800s when the usual way to get ranks was to buy them meaning he likely only has command experience
Huuuuge missed opportunity not using "two scoops" as an attack or characteristic
Why does it do fire damage instead of Radiant damage? You know, like the *Sunburst* spell, or the *Sunbeam* spell, or the *Sun* Soul Monk?
Is the mechanic for 'bright' used in 5th edition or other editions? I've always thought of dark vision as a purely beneficial trait, and it's really interesting to see a rule where it has a disadvantage.
Mr. T will win easily.
is only game, why you heff to be mad
They have him at Trader Joe's!
Too soon 
His vest looks like it's supposed to be tiger stripes. He must have killed a tiger already just to make a vest. Imagine if his life was at stake.
I think Tony has the over on that guy.... Except he looks like he'd pull some sneaky shit.
The value brand fruit loops have polar bears or some shit on them. No personification or humanoid features. Just fucking polar bears.
Admiral Crunch outranks Captain Crunch in every conceivable way.
Kind of looks like the crimson chin haha
Unless it's fucking mini wheats. Nobody fuck with my name brand mini wheats
Each piece of generic caption crunch is melted with titanium to create and extremely hard alloy
Yea, but what if it's night time? 
Puh-lease. Tony's gotten soft after decades of standing on 2 legs, telling kids to eat the cereal he's pushing. He doesn't even sound like the killer his ancestors were. He'd probably stroke out after a minute or two of exertion in combat.
Who make porn about him
doot doot thank mr skeltal 
He also has hat eyebrows. His eyebrows are on his hat, not his face.
~of ultimate destiny
Someone animate this. Guaranteed hit.
Nobody did, man. And now it's just about the best thing any of us have read all day.
I was waiting for cookie cop to walk in and just start firing.  Now I assume he is the leader of Sonny's Choco-Gestapo.
It was a cuckoo d'etat.

They're called Honey Monster Puffs now because they don't want to be associated with unhealthiness as much anymore.

You do realize by going with tie-ins you are letting Darth Vader and Superman join the fray right?There aren't any kryptonite-o's to my knowledge.
> And do bullets even kill vampires?Silver bullets do.
Could you take out either of those with a gun like that? I'm pretty sure a tiger would be fucking your shit up before you got the second shot off.
Is this where I pull my dick out?
Fuck. What the fuck? How the fuck? Fucking fuck the fuck...*FUCK!!*
That 'No Ghosts' sign is placed at the entrance of the coliseum though. It turns out Boo Berry is a staunch follower of the law, as well he is used to such treatment and simply floats away to take no part in the kill fest.
They don't just see the changes in the battlefield, but the change in the change in the change in the change in the change in the change. They're like three steps ahead of the other Jerks.
How do we know he has any experience at all?  His title isnt captain. Ive never met a cap'n in the navy so far. Fucker is dilusional
I disconcur. While ICJ has adequate rapey vibe, this is a free-for-all. He'd be the first one gone. If anything, Sunny from Cocoa Puffs would just obliterate everyone if promised Cocoa Puffs. Fucker's clinically insane.

It also reminded me that he might be a part of the Warriors.
I think there's a generic Apple Jacks that has a goddamn train. Try stopping a fuckin train with your sports team Tony.
Carleton or Olaf?
I'm alright with the generic mini wheats until you get to the bottom 1/4th of the bag. All crumbs and dust. Generic fruit loops taste weird though. Same with the coco puffs, but I don't think those are meant for human consumption.
Aldi Millville brand mini wheats.  Comes off the same line as General Mills, just put in the genetic packaging and sold for less.  My mom has eaten frosted mini wheats for decades and finally tried it.  She swears it's the same thing.

Whoa, did you make that yourself? 
Are you making fun of his prosthetic?
In the first two he's preparing the cereal for you. In the last one, the cereal is ready and he is saluting you before you sit down and dig in. He's paying respects because you're the captain now. Enjoy your breakfast, sir. 
In the Navy, if you're the commanding officer of a ship you're called Captain regardless of your rank. Don't worry, your childhood is safe.
Good guys, bad guys and explosions.

It's also the best part of a nutritious breakfast. 
He's only firing at the chocolate cereal 
A Langolier with arms. He literally eats time.
Woah, hey! I'm squanching here!
I think that's werewolves.  Regardless, I'm unaware of any silver-based cereals or cereal mascots.  Unless we're counting promo boxes.  Silver surfer may have wound up on one once.
Well that certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
Boo Berry got the squad though. Frankenberry, Count Chocula, Fruit Brute, Yummy Mummy.  You can't kill what's already dead.
I see what you did there.
Upvoted. Now go fuck yourself.
It's an integral part of their strategy.
But can they see why kids love cinnamon toast crunch?
It's an easy win for Mr. T
BAZAAAA
They updated their mascot as well. It's now Harambe Munch.
Mascots, come out and plaaaaay
But a train can't kill any creature smart enough not to stand on the tracks...
Um Ya Ya!
Try smelling the cereal after leaving the cereal to go soggy in milk for 30 minutes.  Not for human consumption. 
I.. actually like the crumbs and dust.
Aldi has excellent generic cereal, way better than most stores 
Genetic packaging? Ew!
But he would then be able to see everything. 
Not *all* of them!Some of us lack the talent and more importantly *realize* we lack the talent!
Yes. He's an alpaca.
But that doesn't explain the Ensign or Lieutenant ranks. Maybe a Lieutenant could be in charge, but I doubt they'd let an Ensign prepare my mouth-destroying breakfast cereal.
As far as the eye can see.
!remindme 55 years
RemindMe! 3 Years 
!RemindMe 2 weeks
Not sure if it was intentional but this goes perfect with 'the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny' tune.
I squanch my family!
But according to The Witcher, a silver blade kills all kinds of monster so it should at least put the vampire in stasis.
Elaborate
BAAAAAAAZZAAAAAAAAA

This train is so hood, it doesn't need tracks. 
Dog food actually tastes pretty great when you're high. It's the ultimate munchie in my opinion (aside from treats)
That is probably the milk. It doesn't like to left out in the warm.
His tummy has the rumblies that only hands could satisfy 
And only one can survive... 
Nope. That's waaaaayy too long.
In three years you'll have forgotten all about this, so nope! No reminder.
That's a pretty optimistic time to complete an animation of this size
You traded your legs for wings
Mr. T will win with ease
C'mon mom! I'm gonna miss the bus.
Now I'm wondering what the definition of a train is. When does it become a car ?
I've had milk stream out of a cow's udder when I was prepping her for milking, and spray onto my bare leg in the summer. Cow's temperature runs hotter than us, and the small hot stream of milk felt really weird. Almost like a really small stream of pee... The milk does smell better when it's cold though. A tank of fresh, cold, good milk is one of my favourite smells. It reminds me of raspberries and whipping cream; it's a sweet smell. 
I wonder who it will be.
That's what she said.
What if he makes it just half a screen size instead? I'd be ok with that. 
E L A B O R A T E
Trains are made up of cars, though, both railed and non.
Not to you. 
Animation doesn't work that way
Mr. T will win without difficulty
Your name is my cat to a T
Oh.   So a quarter screen size then
