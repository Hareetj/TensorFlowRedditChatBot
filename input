I was dating this girl that was a little dysfunctional due to being sexually abused by her grandpa and nobody knew about it. I noticed some red flags and got her to open up and tell me about it. After we broke up, I told her mom she should stop inviting grandpa over to Thanksgiving dinners due to the sexual abuse. The mom called me a liar, but after asking the other daughters/cousins about it they confirmed it was true and that they had all been molested too.   After word got back to grandma, she said, "I'll take care of it".  Fast forward a week and grandpa is dead. Apparently Grandpa had a lot of serious medications he was taking and grandma messed with the dosage, which killed him. His death was ruled natural cause and nothing ever happened to grandma. 
Turned left into my sister's driveway at 3 am. A guy on a Harley was doing 60 mph in a 30, with no headlight. My half ton pickup left 4 feet of skid marks from being pushed back by the force. I still remember seeing him do mid air somersaults this was 1976 
I've posted  this before in more detail but the truncated version is when i was 16 years old I hit an 87 year old man after he ran stop sign.  I was with him holding his hand when he died on the sidewalk.  He had a heart attack.  They weren't able to determine if he had the heart attack before the accident which would explain why he blew through the stop sign or if he had one as a result.  His family was very gracious and I am very grateful for them.  His son called me the day after it happened and told me his mom had died 6 months prior, his dad had been very depressed and while they were sad he died this way they were happy to think their parents were reunited.   
When I was 18 I was working the night shift in a nursing home as an aid. Part of my job was to turn the paralyzed patients every two hours to make sure they didn't get bed sores etc. This one particular resident had late stage Parkinson's diseases and her muscles and joints were stiff and brittle and she was catatonic. As I was flipping her from one side to another, I applied light pressure to her leg to move her back a bit and this snapped her femur. Given her age and health the doctors decided that surgery was dangerous and she would have to heal on its own, if at all. Because of this we could no longer flip her, which resulted in bed sores. She eventually went septic from those bedsores and died of septic shock. I always felt so bad about that.  
7ish am on a Sunday morning. I'm heading to work in a small town at the age of 15 or 16. Come over a crest on a hill and have no time to react. T-bone someone making an illegal u-turn in a driveway. All I remember is veering off to the right and damaging someone's stone wall after the hit, crawling out of the wreckage out of breath and stumbling to see if the other person was okay. Their vehicle spun multiple times and landed in a ditch facing away, but driver side visible from where I originally was. Driver wasn't there..move along the vehicle and check the other side.. Driver is hanging out of the passenger side window with a steady stream of blood from their skull. Bottom line for me is that I ask and implore everyone, please use your seatbelt.. 
2 years ago.   My sister was working at a dealership. Her husband and I were spending the day together until it was time to pick up sis from work. He had been drinking tall-boys all day, so when it came time to get his gal I took the keys and said I'm driving. He was mad enough that he refused to go with me. When I came back with my sister he was no where to be found, but it was common for him to go on walks to calm himself down so we didn't think much of it. 8am the next morning, State Police were banging on the door. They told us he was struck and killed by a train while he was sleeping on the tracks. 
My wife and I were both very sick with the flu. My father watched our two small children and even come to sit with me in the hospital. The day after I got out of the hospital he got the flu and died a couple days later.   I still feel guilty knowing that he didn't have to sit with my children, or that he didn't have to sit by my bedside, but he did. It helps knowing that he loved me so much that he was willing to put his life at risk to be with me.   I just never imagined that the flu could have been so serious to hospitalized, much less kill someone. I hold myself responsible and I feel guilty for getting him sick.  
A guy attacked me at 3 a.m. while I was walking to work. I tried to choke him long enough to render him unconscious. And I did. He never woke up. He was a firefighter, a husband, and a father. I know it was self-defense. It still bothers me sometimes, nearly ten years later. 
I was gaming when one of my best friends messaged me asking to talk if I was free.  Since he usually asked this of me just to talk about random stuff, I didn't think too much of it and just planned to reply back to him after I was done with my gaming session.  A couple of hours later I finally replied back to him, but he didn't reply back which I thought was weird but was probably just him being busy.  He never replied again.  I found out the next day at school that he had committed suicide around the same time that I was gaming.  I can't help but think that I could've talked him out of it if I had replied to him immediately.  To this day I still feel guilty about it, and I've resolved to never let a friend down like that again.....too bad I didn't have that thinking sooner. 
When i was younger playing xbox whilst at my grandparents house i had left the room to go to the bathroom, leaving my wired controller on the floor. I suddenly hear a thud and decided to finish my business before seeing where it had came from.  Whilst cleaning up i heard a scream from my grandma and was told to stay in the bathroom. And so i did.  Found out that my grandfather had accidently stood on my controller and fell over the wire, cracking his skull open on the table and was announced dead at the scene when the ambulance arrived.  I am now extra cautious with where i leave items, encouraging my younger brother and sister to clear up their mess once theyre done.   
I was driving a semi a small car pulled in front of me and slammed their breaks i couldnt stop in time my truck wound up on top of their car i was the only survivor of the vehicles involved  
Loan officer for a local credit union.  I ordered a repo on a guy's car; totally justified.  A week later, he gets off at a bus stop about midnight, and starts walking home.  A car hits him, hit & run.  He's found literally dead in a ditch the next morning.  I didn't kill him, but if I hadn't ordered the repo, he wouldn't have died.   
I was working in a nursing home as a volunteer. He was a painter, he told me to bring him oil paints, canvas and thinner, and he would paint something for me.  The next week when I had to return I was excited to see what he'd painted, but he was no longer there. The nurses told me that "they" came to pick him up.  I think he drank the thinner at night. 
When I was 4 and visiting Japan, I opened back door of a car in Japan to the sidewalk but a motorcyclist driving in that space between the curb and road slammed into it. Blood everywhere. I don't remember the exact aftermath since I was so young, but everybody was screaming and I just sat there not understanding exactly what was happening until my mom ran off the scene and into the building in tears.   *Thanks for the kind words, everyone. I don't blame it on anyone, even myself, as it was just a really unfortunate circumstance. As for the thing regarding my parents as discussed below, don't worry about that either. They're out of my life, but honestly while I do believe my parents did some really crap shit to me, I don't wanna be angry at them. I'm here now and by myself, and I think the best course of action is just to put them and this ugly event out of my head.   Unless it's to tell you curious folks. Thanks for the kind words and reassurance :) 
So I'm a mental health worker who has recently had a patient kill them selves, they sadly aren't my first and won't be my last. I followed protocol and didn't do anything medically wrong but will always feel personally responsible for them. There were signs I missed, lies I believed, and things I do differently in hindsight. Some of the families put cases against the hospital but I've been cleared of any wrong doing. Unfortunately when you have the riskiest cases then you can't win all the time. That doesn't stop me feeling incredibly sad when it happens and imagine the family grieving for a lost son/brother/ father.  i will always remember their names and have planted a tree in each of their honour. I strive to become a better nurse each time 
I was driving my girlfriend and I back to town from a day by the water. We were on the highway and she leaned over to kiss me, next thing I knew we were going off the road and then the car was rolling. It just happened.. I had a few scrapes but her seatbelt wasn't on properly and she died there.. in my arms on the the side of the road. Never thought this could happen to me.  
When i was 4 Years old, my mother was roughly 3-4 months pregnant              one day I was supposedly crying and throwing a tantrum over a toy or something,my mother tried to comfort me by cradling me in her arms and take me to to my room which was up the stairs but i cried and kicked so much that she lost her balance and fell down the the stairs, i was unhurt and mother recovered without any lasting injuries    but my sibling died. 
I was a fairly new driver. I was sitting in the parking lot texting someone on my phone. It took a few seconds to send the message.  I pulled out of the parking lot and immediately came to a roundabout. It was a slow day, barely any cars around. A car pulled up moments after me, but since I beat him by a second or two, he had to wait while I went past him in the roundabout.  Nearly the second after I passed him, a big truck slammed into his rear end. And he was going fast. Real fast. Probably 45 to 50 mph.  They both died. The best they could figure, the elderly driver of the truck passed out for some reason.  If I had waited to text my friend until I got home, that man would still be alive. If I had waited for my friend to reply before leaving the parking lot, that man would be alive.  I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
Throwaway account.  5 years ago I was staying the night at my boyfriend's (we were both still living with our parents).  We started messing around, both getting really into it, as usual. He came once, and seemed to be breathing more heavily than usual, which I attributed to me (and felt good about it, naturally). He then suggested that we take a breather, but I was all worked up and insisted that we go again immediately.  During it, his breathing got heavier, and he collapsed. I panicked and called in his parents, and we rushed him to hospital. Turns out he had an undiagnosed heart condition. He didn't make it. The doctors all said that it was probably the sex that got his heart-rate too high, but that I shouldn't blame myself (yeah, right).  I don't think I'll ever get over it, honestly. If I hadn't pushed to go again, he'd probably still be here. 
Deployed in Afghanistan. Urban area.   I got into programming to kill the time. Had an Arduino set complete with everything I would need to make tons of little gadgets. Got pretty good at it too (going to school for it when I get out). When it came time to go home, I didn't have room to take the kit with me, so I threw it out. Keep in mind, locals work on this base, and in my time there, at least three had been kicked out for ties with the Taliban.   Within an hour of tossing the kit, it had been taken.   Didn't think anything of it, probably some other soldier thought it was cool and took it. Big base, anything could happen. About three weeks after we left, an IED went off outside the gate. No NATO casualties, but about 20 civilians died in the blast. EOD reported that it was a "strangely sophisticated" bomb. They used my kit.  My negligence gave them the means to kill 20 innocent people. I've never told anyone in the world about this, and it haunts me to this day.  
Do paramedics count? I responded to a call from a father who needed help applying medicinal cream to his 13 year old daughters vagina to heal her STD. He said he tried to do it himself but it was "swollen shut".... I just brought her to the hospital. 
I stopped a 25 year old Asian male from entering the east executive entrance of the White House. He had slit his wrists and neck prior to his arrival, but not deep enough to hit major blood vessels. He told me that he was a secret agent working for J Edgar Hoover and that he was 60 years old. He said he had important information to pass to president Obama. I ended up having to detain him, stop the bleeding and then involuntarily commit him. Turned out to be a local college kid, going through some mental health issues. I've field interviewed hundreds of White House "callers" but this kid took the cake.  
From a post I made a few weeks ago...   I was called out to negotiate with a 17 year old female who had barricaded herself in a bathroom with multiple knives and scissors (she'd done it right too, SWAT ended up going through the sheetrock wall). She wouldn't talk with me at all but had multiple graphic conversations with her mother, who committed suicide 3 years earlier, and her dad, who's serving lots of years in prison for sexually abusing her. When SWAT pulled her out she had completed multiple circumcisions on herself with the scissors, completely cut her nipples off, and had sodomized herself multiple times with multiple steak knives. The kicker was, she was talking the whole time and her tone or volume never changed. The pain never bothered her. Or, more likely, she never felt it. The human mind is scary as fuck.  
Im not a cop but my dad just recently shared these stories with me. My grandfather was a cop in a small town in the 60's-70's.  Late at night it was common for officers to pull over vehicles driving through town, especially if they didnt recognize them.  He pulls over a bus load of people.  He walks through and asks them where they are headed, yada yada.  They were headed to California, it was Charles Manson and his group.  Another story.  Same grandfather, same stop a car passing through protocol.  Asked the driver where he was headed, BS'd for a while and told the guy to have a nice evening.  Few towns over guy gets pulled over again, shoots and kills the cop.  Apparently he was doing this as he drove along, get pulled over and shoot the cop.  When they questioned him he said he had been pulled over by my grandfather, but he was such a nice guy he didnt kill him, but he did have the gun sitting in his lap. 
One night at about 1130, this guy jumps off of a bridge into a bay. On the way down, he hits a guard rail and loses both forearms and the top of his head. One set of officers found his arms and set them aside. I was on the dive team, so we go collect his remains. While we check on his condition, we notice the brain is missing. This was me flipping up his scalp and taking a peek inside to find nothing there. It's very strange to look for something very important and not find it. Anyway, we bag him up and get him on the boat. Our supervisor tells us we have to at least look for his brains.  Gross. So we dive and look around, but the only thing we find is a piece of skull. And we had decided if we did find it, none of us wanted to grab it.   
 My cousin is a cop and he responded to a call on Valentine's Day night. A 12 year old girl called in to say her mother had blown her brains out in the living room. I guess her and her brother were getting ready for dinner and the mom just shot herself.  He said the creepy thing about it was dinner all set up, drinks on the table and suddenly she shot herself. Kids were sitting outside when he arrived, to this day I can't imagine Valentine's Day for them. But I know that is something that stuck with him seeing that.  
My department sends an officer to all rescue calls if one is available. We got a call late one night to "assist rescue" at a townhouse complex for a "woman hemorrhaging." We didnt show up until rescue had already left with the patient. So we let ourselves into the residence and eventually found the bathroom, which was COVERED in blood. Blood on the walls, all over the toilet, everywhere. CRAZY amount of blood. Rescue hadnt mentioned anything suspicious on the radio, so this was surprising. We were preparing to leave when one of the younger officers noticed bloody footprints leading to the front door...and then across the parking lot...to a dumpster. We gathered at the dumpster, lifted up the top, and lit up the interior with our flashlights. Same officer extended his baton, reached into the dumpster with it, and brought out a bloody plastic grocery bag....with a dead baby in it. True story.  
It was a stormy night on the Oregon Coast.  A lady was driving drunk and ran into the back of a parked school bus.  When she did, her car caught on fire, but she was able to escape.  When I found her slowly walking down a side street, I was telling her to stop and turn around.  When she turned around, her lower jaw was gone, and she was totally dazed.  Her tongue was sticking straight out the top of her neck, and she was trying to talk.  She ended up surviving but needed tons of plastic surgery.   
My dad was on the freeway, and saw a guy in a big truck (it may have been a mail carrier?) that was swerving and driving crazy. He pulled him over, and the driver's hands were shaky and covered in blood. It turns out he had a prostitute in the back of his truck that he had killed not long before.  
I once went to a two fatality car crash. The cars had collided head on in a 55mph zone.   One of the drivers had left the house suicidal, and it was surmised that he picked a car out at random and went straight into it.   I had spoken with that man several weeks prior and seeing his skeleton in the burned up car was a little creepy.   I won't describe the rest of the scene, but the worst part of it is...  This was Christmas Day. Not a merry Christmas at all.  
Man this was probably 2010, 2011... I was really new.  Call came I'm as an "unknown problem", basically the 911 was so fucked up, even dispatch didn't know what to call it. Turned it this guy had just murdered his step father and then walked to his grand parents house to kill them as well.  He stabbed his grandmother through the eye with a Rambo style bowey knife, one that had the compass in the pommel of the handle.   He missed her brain by about an eighth of an inch, so she did not die. Instead she came running out of the house when we got there, knife sticking out of her fucking eye, and the compass was spinning around because she was moving. My brain literally went "that's not real" and I went past her, along with several other cops, before the sergeant was like "what in the actual fuck are you guys doing?"  She survived. We caught the guy in a stroke of pure luck. Elderly woman with a massive hunting knife for an eye, definitely the creepiest thing I can remember seeing. 
Not a cop, but a correctional officer in Texas. One time a guy slit the forearm side of his elbows (where it bends). He laid there in a big puddle of his own blood. I was one of the responders that day.  I'll never forget it. As soon as you entered the cell, the smell just hit you. Blood has a strong metallic smell, which I never realized before. He'd been laying there awhile, so the blood had coagulated which again, I did not expect. As we lifted the barely conscious guy out of the blood, the blood fell off his body in chunks, like Jello.  It was pretty disturbing because I didn't expect any of it nor was I able to mentally prepare for it. We're not really medically trained, so all of it was completely surprising to me.   
Are we accepting "Not me but a cop I know" stories?  My cousin is on in a major city, apparently 911 got a call from a 6 year old claiming **VEHEMENTLY** that there was a zombie outside of his house on the street.  So a patrol car swings around to see what's up.  Turns out a tweaker on meth gouged out his own eyes, had blood dripping down from the empty sockets, and was stumbling around blindly with his hands stretched out in front of him.  Goddamn, turns out the kid was telling the truth! 
Got a call that someone wasnt answering their Phone or the doorbell. We got to the house and noticed that every window was blinded by either curtains or pieces of paper. We rang the doorbell and yelled through the letterbox but there was no answer. We opened the door and got inside. In the house it looked like someone just had lunch. There was bread on the table and juice or milk in the glasses. Childrens toys scattered all around. Then I saw a note that gave me the chills. It was a suicide note. As the door was locked from the inside, the person had to be in the house. We checked room by room and my heartbeat was at 300% when I checked the bathroom. Preparing myself for slit wrists or throats I opened the door slowly, but there was nothing. Finally one more room left which was the attic. We walked slowly up the stairs and we found the resident there, hanging from a beam. I will never forget the adrenaline I had, the scene in the livingroom or the resident I found.  
We responded to a burglary alarm at a mortuary and found that one of the rear doors was left open.  Policy now dictates that the entire building needs to be cleared (searched) to confirm that it was a false alarm (which most are).  It's the middle of the night and totally dark.  We use flashlights and never turn on lights.  We walk into one of the rooms and see a body on a table.  It appeared that it was waiting to be processed (possibly embalmed) by the mortician.  It smelled like a mildly decomposing body.  Suddenly I see a shadow to my right and I shine my light there and find nothing out of the ordinary.  I immediately smell a really strong whiff of perfume blow by me.  The search was completed more expiditiously than normal after that...nothing was found. 
From my post 8 months ago:  Got a call for a missing child, got to the home to find the mother highly distressed, and not sure what to do. I called in everyone to first search the home and property. I decided to search the backyard since it was a large wooded lot with no visible fence. After about 10 minutes I found the boy, he was caught on an old chain link fence in the woods that was blocked by a bunch of trees, so you couldn't see it from the house. He had basically gotten strangled to death on the fence, he must have been climbing on it, fell, and got his hooded sweatshirt caught on it.   The worst part for me was having to call it in on the radio, knowing the mother might hear it inside from one of the other officers radio.   
I got a call that there was an abandoned truck on the highway. I was only a mile or two away, so I headed there. It was in the middle of these curves, with a mountain wall on one side, and a drop off to a creek on the other side. It was dark, probably around midnight. I pull up and there it is. An old 50's pickup truck. Light blue. Sitting there. I have no backup. I have no idea where the driver is. I walk up, gun out, inhaling the strong alcohol vapors. No one to be found. I call for a tow truck. Meanwhile I have to wait, in the dark, in the middle of blind curves, with no idea where the driver is or why he left it. My adrenaline was at an all time high for sure. 
My mom was a patrolman at the time and rolled up on a guy fucking a pumpkin on someone's front porch. It was one of those huge ones like 3 foot diameter. Guy was apparently too into it to notice her and her partner roll up him.  (Unrelated) A year later she got a call for a suspicious person and so she's walking around in the woods behind a neighborhood and heard someone sneaking around so she hid behind a tree and tripped the person. It was a guy in full ninja regalia carrying a wooden box with shuriken, poison darts, throwing knives, and a picture of one of the girls in that neighborhood.  She also found a butterfly knife in a hooker's pussy...well it moreso fell out when she was being frisked.   
Not a cop, but worked with an animal control officer who had to go with the cops into a house of an old lady that no one had heard from in a while.   She had passed away quite a few days before, and left behind two large dogs. The dogs were hungry, so by the time they got there, the dogs had eaten most of her. 
Not a cop, but work within a school district and have heard some pretty unfortunate stories about reported abuse. Any time a child says their dad/coach/aunt/cousin/sibling/pastor touched their peepee/whoha/cookie/flower/weewee/dingdong it's creepy. Worst are the ones that mention it to a grown-up but don't know the real word so teacher thinks the "flower" the kid mentions is an actual flower. Moral of the story - penis, vagina, testicles, labia, clitoris, breasts... Get comfortable with the real words and teach them to your kids.  
A guy was at a park masturbating at around 10pm at night, and I was the first to respond...  Called another unit to help me, saying he was resisting arrest, (which he was...)... and I made the other unit arrest him... we wore gloves.  Thankgod. 
Not a cop,  But my college friend told me he walked in on an od'd crack head that had microwaved her own newborn daughter. 
Some sort of inter-dimensional being must have put that cocaine in the center console.  Or maybe the dude's truck roamed around at night trying to get high off human drugs.  Who knows?    Certainly not the man driving, who the truck was registered to, and who had a history of controlled substance arrests.

Was at a restaurant with my uncle and cousins from far away.  First time visiting with them in years.  At the end of the dinner one of my cousins snuck off and paid for everyone as a nice gesture.  My uncle got irate yelling and complained that he wanted to pay his share because, and I shit you not, he has a movie ticket points Visa card and he was close to getting a free movie.  He argued and told off our cousin loudly in the restaurant over a few free movie points.  He would not drop it until he got our cousin to apologise to him for costing him movie points.  I don't think those cousins are going to fly down again any time soon. 
Not so much a tantrum but just an incredible rage incident.  I watched as a woman exiting an Einstein Bros Bagels looked into her bag and - in anger over some error in her order - perfectly frisbee'd an all grain bagel across the length of the store, over sitting customers, and beaned the cashier perfectly on the head.  Her aim was so impressive that none of us, including the cashier, could do anything but stare in silenced awe. 
I was a kid in a mall when I was able to shop by myself and saw a lady blow a fuse at some guy behind the counter.  Calling him names and what not just losing her shit.  He just puts up the palm of his hand and says, "Mam, I believe you are too irrational to deal with."  And then just pivots 180 degrees not facing her and ignores her.  Waits for her to leave and when she does, he just proceeds to say to the next person, "May I help you?"  Like nothing even happened.  I learned a lot from that guy in 1.5 mins. 
My mother-in-law doesn't handle stress very well, she tends to start lashing out at people and starting fights for no reason.  On the morning of my son's 1st birthday party she started to lose it as we were running around getting everything ready before the guests arrived. She first cornered my wife and started freaking out over the thermostat and some other unrelated pointless crap, then found me and started a fight over the garage door (it needed oiling and I hadn't done it because I was busy setting up the party). Volume of the voice steadily increasing.  My wife marches up to her and actually sent her to her room to calm down, and she did it! She stayed up there for an hour while my wife and I finished putting up decorations. It is a memory I will cherish forever. 
Had a patient family member that was super picky, constantly calling the nurses station, constantly coming out of the room to complain.   She was upset because she ordered a guest tray, wanted a cheeseburger, and it hadn't come up yet.   Another patient coded next door. So basically, patient was literally dying. All of us nurses left crazy lady to go to the code, and the lady went batshit, yelling YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT MY CHEESEBURGER! We ignored her lol.  
The parking garage near my work is a frustrating place. The monthly customers have a parking pass that lifts the gate to get in and to get out. The thing is, the pass and their sensor dont work. You have to creep up to where you think the sweet spot might be, wave your pass around, reverse and try again, curse a bunch, endure people behind you honking despite them going through the same thing..... frustrating.   Not surprisingly, I witnessed a grown man throw the most excellent temper tantrum I've ever seen. The gate wouldnt go up, and he just started screaming in his car and smashing on the horn, straight out of a movie. The worst part is is that the gate always seems to go up right when you reach peak rage. So he's yellin' away, and then the gate is just like "Alright, man. I'll open. Jeez." 
Some poor kid was taking too long at the ticket booth and a father began to get upset. Like, shouting and yelling at the top of his lungs upset. He then pulled his young son closer and said "See that kid? That's why you're going to be an attorney and he'll still be working here" - the poor son was super embarrassed and tried telling his dad it's okay, not a big deal, etc.  He apparently got rounded up by security later on and made an even bigger fuss and his wife went back to the ticket booth and outright called the kid a pussy for "telling" on the dad. Real classy family. 
When I was in high school, my boyfriend was planning on joining me and my friends for an indie movie night at my house. Boyfriend called me up to say that he couldn't make it because he had to watch his siblings, and I overheard his dad screaming, stomping and yelling at the top of his lungs. He kept calling me a 'stupid little whore' and a 'fucking waste of time'.   I should mention that I was 14. Who calls a 14 year old girl that?!  I ended up calling the police on him twice later; once when he punched his son in the face and another when he followed my mom and brother home. He wanted to 'teach her a lesson', we found out.   I don't wish pain on anyone, but if he died in a car fire I'd probably do a little dance.  
Back when I worked at 7-11 a woman came in for coffee, and i was out of decaf. so i offered to make her a fresh pot and she said that it wasn't good enough and she was already late, threw the cup on the ground and stomped out.  people, what a bunch of bastards. 
I used to work at McDonald's. One time a guy came through the drive thru and ordered chicken nuggets. We gave him his food and he drives off. A few min later, he comes in to the store and runs up to the counter ranting about how we forgot his BBQ sauce. My manager meets him at the counter, apologizes profusely and him some BBQ sauce packets (extra too, maybe 6-7 packets). He proceeds to throw them at her and the rest of us workers behind the counter. We all had BBQ sauce splattered on our uniforms, on the walls, equipment etc. After he ran out of ammunition, he ran out of the store and drove away like a coward.  I was 15 then and I pretty much lost my faith in humanity. 
I told a grown woman she could not pet my service dog while he was working. She got herself so worked up she started shouting, and told me that if I didn't want people to pet my dog I shouldn't bring him into the grocery store. I expect this sort of behavior from young children, and I also expect their parents to keep them under control. 
I worked the front desk at a hotel a few years ago.  A guest came to check in around 10pm and asked if he could get a room with 2 beds (he booked 1 bed).  I told him we were sold out of rooms with 2 beds.  Before I could offer him anything else, he took the bowl of apples we had at the desk and threw it against the wall.  Then he took his OWN laptop, threw it on the ground and started kicking it around the lobby.  Security came out promptly and told him he needed to leave, which obviously prompted more screaming and kicking.  Needless to say, he didn't stay at the hotel that night. 
When I worked at mcdonalds I was scheduled for an early morning shifts. This guy ordered a steak, egg, and cheese which wasn't something we batched cooked. The next three people behind him all ordered batched cooked items and got them before him. The guy proceeds to scream and shout and then get in my face. I tried explaining why but he was just screaming over me. The cook came out to try and explain hoping the guy would back down. We couldn't find our manager anywhere to try and get help.... His co workers slowly inched towards the door until they were far enough to just run. In the end he demanded a refund which the cook side fine please get in line and wait (ya he actually made the guy get back in line for the refund) as the guy is getting to the register his food was ready and he took it and left with no refund. Then the manager came out trying to figure out what was going on.... 
i work in retail, and i saw one woman literally flip her full cart over and walk out after her coupons wouldn't go through  it was actually extremely impressive now that i think about it, it must've had $150 of groceries at least 
Just landed in Orlando, picked up my bag and it was SHREDDED. I knew it was a cheap bag, just went to customer service to get a trash bag to hold my clothes so I could get to the hotel. Middle aged lady in front of me is going nuclear that the little ID tag was missing from her bag. No other damage. She'd had 2 connections, but that CSR better shit that tag right fucking now, how dare he lose the picture of her dog, rant goes past 5 min. I tap her on the shoulder and ask if this is really what sher spent money to go on vacation to do, held up my fucked up bag with shit falling out of it and said some off us have real problems. She stomped off without another word, I apologized to CSR for shitty people and asked for a trash bag. CSR hooked me up with a free Samsonite because of it.  *edit words 
I was recently driving on a small country road when I saw a traffic jam in the distance. I drove my motorcycle ahead of the traffic untill I saw two ladies facing each other in their cars. Both tried to pass each other, but neither wanted to make enough room for each other to make that possible. They could just drive forward and it would be over, but no, they just refused to pass each other and decided to just sit there and create chaos on this small road because they didn't want to drive on the small patch of gravel...         
I think it has to be when the ancient super market across the way was closing, because a new store had been built a mile away. They had this huge "everything must go sale."  I was scavenging for closeouts, as was everyone else.   At the checkout, a 60-something woman, was angry that "YOU PEOPLE"  didn't have what she wanted.  Then she proceeded to tell the cashier (in her 40's) she was "happy she was losing her job and she hoped she would become homeless." At somepoint she also called the cashier a "nincompoop."  The manager asked her to leave and she went on an incomprehensible tirade.  I just hope that old lady never walked into the new store because, the entire staff of the old store worked there too... and I strongly suspect they will remember her. 
Dude I was standing behind in line at the grocery store got pissed at the cashier for charging him by the pound for grapes. He was adamant that the listed price was for the bunch and was making a huge scene and getting nasty with the cashier. He asked me to come with him so he can show me (was within viewing distance from the register and I just wanted the line to move). We walked over to the grapes and he showed me the label and said "what does that say?" looking all proud. I pointed at the small text under the price and said "per pound." He got even more pissed and checked out talking shit the whole way through and left.     
A woman who was in her late twenties/early thirties, dressed in a business suit, who was literally screaming in the face of a poor security guard at Heathrow after having her half-finished juice box taken away and disposed of. 
The woman in the cubical across from me literally every day.  Examples:  Her new puppy wont sit quietly beside her for 2 hours at her kids baseball game.  The person who just called her wasn't 100% sure what they wanted and she has to work a bit with them find out.  Someone kindly asked for a response on the same day with multiple apologies for the short notice.  Her mother went to Vegas without her  (she's 35).  I got a review and she didn't. (I repeatedly explained that I arranged the review so I could make sure I was doing my job well as it was a new position to me).  All of the above and so many more all result in phone slamming, needing a smoke, swearing and omg usually crying in the ladies room.  We are a department of 2 so I get to pick up the slack. 
Disney World. Every single time I've been there.    Obscenely high prices. Crowds of some of the rudest people you will ever be shoved into. Mix in a healthy dose of heat / humidity / afternoon showers.   I have seen grown men and women snap in 17 different languages. 
Once had dinner at a restaurant with a group of people who'd been partying all day. Just after the meal was served, one guy cracked it about something and upturned the whole table. Food spilt, plates destroyed, dresses ruined, and he walks off down the road. To make matters worse, we all had to chip in to pay for the smashed plates and un-eaten meals. What a great end to fun day.  
I work as a lifeguard at a waterpark over the summer and some days can get REALLY warm. I once had a lady who was seriously angrily complaining to me that it was too warm outside, like somehow it was my fault that there was a heatwave that day.  
A little old lady in an unbridled rage absolutely red in the face screaming at a teenage Baskin Robbins employee, because she wanted $0.10 off a $0.99 ice cream cone. The deal was only available on Sundays and it was Thursday.   She made us wait in line behind her while she argued over a dime. The cashier couldn't do anything because the register was electronic and wouldn't apply the discount.  I was about to pay the lady in loose change to move along, but someone stepped in to assist us off to the side. We were in and out in a few minutes, and the irate octogenarian was still raging when I left. 
I had a grown adult roommate who was mad because her parents (who gave her $1000 a month *in addition to* paying her rent, phone, car, and grocery bills) would not give her an additional $600 a month.  Meanwhile, I'm a grad student who makes $10,000 a year and have been supporting myself since I was 19.  She was sobbing when I came home, and I was very worried and asked her what was wrong.  She had been crying for half an hour, and finally told me the story and asked me for support, saying, "It's just not fair that I have to live like this, am I right?"  I responded, "I literally cannot relate to you" and walked out of the apartment because I wanted to smack a bitch. 
Someone opened a window on the bus and some guy went nuts, stood up and slammed it shut and starting giving everybody a lecture how this guy should consider everyone else. We of course all english told him to stfu and opened the window again. 
Watched a woman at a rental car counter have a nuclear meltdown because the employee couldn't rent her a car since her license was expired. Her rationale was that even though it was expired, the license still showed who she was. 
In the office I work in, there is a bin behind my desk/pod, whatever you want to call it. Its been there a long time and people use it to put their tissues in when they come out of the toilet.  Someone moved it to a different position, and there was a banterous discussion for 5 minutes about how it doesnt matter where it is. During this, the woman who sits on my table who is normally quiet yanked off her headset, launched it at the guy sitting next to her (thankfully not me), stomped over to the bin, took it back to its normal position (we have many bins in quite a small office it really wasnt a big deal) and then proceeded to scream at us till she went red in the face about how we are being childish.  EDIT- having read this its a little bit underwhelming but I took the time to write it so fuck it  
The ex wife screaming "I fucking hate you and I hope you fucking die of cancer." that time I accidentally threw away an apple.  Damn, I love being single.  
We were in a shoe store where a woman was trying on multiple pairs of shoes. The salesman kept bringing her pair after pair to try on. (It was a challenge for him because the lady was obese and could barely see the shoes on her feet.)  Finally, he said, "I've shown you practically every style shoe in your size that we have in stock. Do you like *any* of them?"  She grabbed a high heel from one pair and threw it at him, hitting the salesman in the chest. She yelled, "I wouldn't buy shoes in this store if you paid me!" - and stormed out the door. 
Driving up to my first day of high school, someone pulled up next to my father and tried to fight him for (driving recklessly) and even yelled at me, a 14 year old kid, for being a part of it.  
My best friend's husband and father of her child pitches the biggest fits over the smallest things (she cooks, he wants junk food instead; she asks him to hold the baby so she can answer the door). I love her dearly, but his behavior has caused me to distance myself quite a bit lately. 
My great grandma faced this issue.  My great grandfather was "missing: presumed dead" in World War 1.  They held a memorial for him, then she met and started dating someone else.   In 1919, he just wanders back in at the back door of the house (with a withered left arm and a wound stripe).    Great grandma split up with the new guy and carried on with my great grandfather, who ended up dying of appendicitis during the second world war.   
My dad died when he was 45 from a heart attack. My mom was 42. My mom started dating about two years after his death.    Before she died at 56 years old, 14 years after my dad died, she said if he were to come back she would choose him in a heartbeat. She even had dreams of him walking through the door all those years later.  No one in her eyes measured up to him.  
My dad died and left my mum behind at age 40 something. She's currently with one of his work friends after their relationship grew out of the grieving. I'm happy for her. Shes happy. But she would choose my dad every time. I feel for the guy because she's still grieving 3 years later. All her fb posts are about him and remembering him and photos of him. I assume he's understanding, but I still feel.for him.  
I wasn't married but might as well have been. We were together for 6 years and wanted marriage, just too young and waiting til we were ready for it. Then she was in a car accident. 4 years have passed, I've since had a couple relationships, more loves, and my life is generally happy, but nothing compares to her. If she were to come back right now, I'd choose her in a heartbeat.  
I couldn't imagine losing my wife she leaves for work soon, I'm gonna go hug her in the shower with my clothes on now. 
My dad's friend happily married had kids but wife dies fairly young. The kids are fairly young so he decided to raise the kids by himself. Years go by and he manages well kids grow up turn out smart and get married. He never married anyone for the shear love he had for his wife. However at age 50, he realizes that life gets lonely after the kids are all grown up and getting married so he married a widow and they are happy. They both have infinite love for their previous SOs but they are happy with each other aswell.  I guess, it's really a matter of whether or not it works as well as it did before.  
My mother has been widowed twice and I have a recurring dream that my dad comes back to life and I have to explain to him all that's happened since his death and mum's remarriage. I fucking hate that dream. 
My fiance died at 22. If he were to come back now, several decades later, I think we'd be strangers to each other. I am a very different person now.  If he turned out like his siblings, I wouldn't even want a relationship with him, honestly.  
I'm a widower dating a widow.  It hurts even to read this question.  EDIT (7 hours later because of some of the absurd things I've seen in my inbox):  To those who are replying with "so who would you choose," or "what's your answer," or the like, you obviously aren't understanding it at all.  Which is not surprising; it's one of those things that you just can't understand unless you've been through it.    But there is no answer to the question.  It doesn't exist.  As someone else pointed out, it's as if someone had asked a parent with one dead child and one living child which one they'd rather have.  It's a completely nonsensical question. 
Boyfriend died about a year and a half ago at 18. Would I take him back if he were to come back right now? Absolutely, no hesitation. In 30 years? I don't know. We might have ended up growing into two completely different people and it wouldnt have worked out anyway. I like to think it would, but that's just my morbid wishful thinking.   I really miss you Brandon. Hope you're doing ok wherever you are.  
I lost my husband a couple years ago after 20 years. I could never remarry.  
This reminds me of what Betty White once said on Larry King. Her husband (Allen Ludden) had died of stomach cancer and she was asked whether she would remarry, to which she said "Once you've had the best, who needs the rest?" 
I'm the fiance who has had constant suicidal idealization and attempts since childhood (currently 26). I'm always looking yet another reason to live, and all these heartfelt comments really struck a cord with me. I know I'm not the intended audience, but thank you. 
I'd be more curious as to which partner they'd want to be buried next to. 
My husband committed suicide after we'd been married a little over a year and our baby was six months old. I am still furious. I am single and not looking but if he came back now, I'd tell him to take a hike. If he came back 10 or 20 years from now, I might have forgiven him.  
My grandfather was killed in WWll. My grandmother didn't remarry until her four children were all grown up, almost 20 years later. Her second husband wasn't the sort of husband I imagined my grandfather would have been, but he wasn't the worst husband either. When my Nan was in a residential care home suffering from dementia, she only ever spoke about my grandfather (by this time my step-grandfather was a little senile and, thankfully, never noticed she wasn't talking about him).  I often wondered, if there is a heaven, what was going to happen when she was reunited with my grandfather? 
A little different answer, but someone posted about how when your partner dies, you can be at the height of your relationship and that will never be resolved.   My ex husband decided when our daughter was a baby to start transitioning into a woman. It was due to a lot of factors, but I ended up moving away and we got divorced. In my head I feel like he died because that person doesn't exist anymore, but I'm still sharing custody of someone who looks and thinks and jokes like my ex husband.   I haven't been able to really date anyone seriously, really. But when I do, I'll be faced with my 'dead partner' and my new one every day.  
This exact thing happens in the Netflix show, Glitch. It's worth a watch, there's only one season at the moment but it explores an interesting concept. 
not quite answering the OP, but a friend of my Dads had a wife and a mistress - inevitably they found out about each other and ended up running off together, leaving him on his jack jones.  There is a moral to that story but i am not sure what it is 
You guys should check out Glitch (TV series)   The dead come back from their graves, and one of the main characters has this scenario happen to him 
I never meant to cause harm. Please don't hurt me. 
That's about the time that you convert to Mormonism and get your own TLC show, Zombie Sister Wives.  
It's a little early in the night to be asking serious questions like this....  
as a kid i always worried what would happen when my gran got to heaven and her first husband (my Grandad) and her second would be there. I was rooting for my Grandad.  Then i realised that there is no heaven. 
I worked as a tower hand for a construction company.  I used to take of my lanyard and move between booms(500-600feet up.)  I also would slide down the outside legs untethered because it was faster than climbing down the ladder.  I cringe when I think about that there was zero chance of survival if I fell.   
Timeshare presentation. I now know what hell is like. 8 hours of my life I'll never get back.   And of course the "free trip" was impossible to get. "We will call you on Monday sometime in the next two months, then you need to fly out on Tuesday and come back Wednesday."  
Back in the days before soft contact lenses you were supposed to clean them with hydrogen peroxide and then use a special neutralizer tablet afterwards.    I forgot to use the neutralizer before I put my contacts in.  Hydrogen peroxide in your eye HURTS! 
I went down in the pantry of my grandma's house and ate 45 year old peaches from a jar. did you know the human body is capable of shitting peaches in roughly the same consistency they were consumed? Me either. 
Asking a woman when her baby is due.  Doesn't really need a story. It went as imagined. 
I don't drink Southern Comfort anymore, I don't remember why and that's part of the reason. 
Elementary school age. During the 80s. My great uncle gave my dad a jug of homemade wine. He put it right next to the apple juice. I got lit up despite insisting that this apple juice tasted weird. Went off to school.  I'm never drinking wine again.  
Loaning money to a friend.  Lost the money and the friend. Not a very good deal  
Every man eventually learns the lesson that muscle rub should never be used to treat a groin pull or similarly place ailment.  
103 temperature, sicker than a dog from the flu and constipated. I was miserable. I took 4 "fiber" pills in the morning and had hallucination fits for the next 4-5 hours. Desperately trying to get some sleep, I took an ambian sleeping pill (extra strength).   Woke up 9 hours later not constipated anymore and having to do a shit-load of laundry. 
Hmmm i wonder what's inside the medicine capsules? What if i just eat that directly instead of swallowing the pill? (Empties onto tongue and promptly gag) 
Just came back from a three-week backpacking trip with FIVE other people. Trip was just originally just three others (my bf, brother and cousin), but two friends wanted to join. Jesus Christ. You gotta keep those trips intimate. And preferably, with family. The two add-ons didn't want to do any of the same stuff we did, couldn't keep up, didn't want to try any local food, complained about walking, only packed flip-flops, commented after thirty minutes at the Louvre that it was "just a buncha paintings", etc. etc. etc. Worst mistake. The original squad all chanted "never again" at least fifty times each the entire trip. So yeah. Never again.  
Had a Baconator for lunch and dinner three days in a row. I was working long shifts and there was a Wendy's across the parking lot from where I was.  After I finished dinner on day three, my body says:  **YOU MUST SHIT NOW!**  I shit my pants running to the bathroom. Had to clean up, and head back to work with no underwear.   0/10, though I occasionally went to work commando on hot days after this.  
Cave exploring.    The serious kind - with lights, helmets, and occasional crawling.       Fascinating while you're doing it,  but scary as hell in hindsight.    Ample opportunities to get seriously injured or worse,  in the last place in the world you'd want to be rescued from.     
What I wish was a "never again" story?  Masturbating after forgetting to wear gloves while making spicy salsa from scratch.  Current count: 3 times. I am an idiot. 
was younger and way more stupid.    got the chance to score meth and decided to get some to see what the hoopla is all about. Loaded all .3g that i bought and chased the white dragon.     Spent the next 22 hours alternating between jerking off and being on all fours all around my house trying to find meth crumbs behing the fridge that must've mysteriously gotten there while i brought the baggie from the front door straight to my room.   Shit's nasty mane. 
I was reading the tea tree oil is anti-bacterial. I wanted to use it around my eyes since I recently had a tiny put painful infection in my eyelash gland.   I DID NOT read that it has to be diluted.   I was beat red around the eyes.. the burning would not stop, dish soap and icing helped. It looked like I just got hit in both eyes.    Fuck you tea tree oil.  
My boyfriend's father gave us two bags of smoked venison sausages his friend made. We froze one and left the other in the fridge. I guess because it was smoked I couldn't tell when it spoiled, so one day I have some, and not 20 minutes later I almost crap my pants. I ran to bathroom, and while I'm pooping out my soul I just start vomiting into the sink, which was luckily right next to the toilet. I spent the whole day in there spewing smoked vomit and poo, and I haven't eaten anything smoked or venison since. 
I trusted a fart once.. Horrifically shat my pants.. Never again.  
I was taking a trip to London and saw it was so much cheaper to start my flights in Dallas (5 hours away). So I drove there, left my car, and took my trip. Everything went awesome. I figured I could get back to Dallas after sleeping on the plane and just drive home which was a dumb idea and I eventually gave up and got a hotel I left while it was still dark, driving through Oklahoma, and I saw a storm in the distance. Of course I got stuck in that storm in the middle of nowhere. I couldn't pull over, and there wasn't any place to stop, so I had to power through till I hit the next town. It was raining and hailing so hard I couldn't see, my car would occasionally lose traction, and the radio informed me there was a tornado watch in an area near me. It was one of the most terrifying experiences I've been through. I made it to the next town and got myself a victory McGriddle and swore I would always pay the extra money to fly out of the smaller airport near my home town. 
Long story short I made a batch of pot brownies with a good ounce of weed. I was a freshman in high school, and had no idea what I was doing. I ate a brownie and felt noting so I decided they were weak and ate the whole batch. Needless to say, that night I was moonwalking with Michael.  No seriously, I was so stoned. I was on the ground and I could literally feel my thoughts (does that make sense? Idk) and I couldn't move. I didn't even know if I was breathing. I was high for what seemed like the next 2 days  
I let my husband convince me to get pregnant.   NEVER. AGAIN  I mean, I love my daughter. But being pregnant was terrible. 
I walked up an escalator that was going down cause I was too impatient to go down then up again turned around to look at my mum. Fell. Had 4 holes in my leg. Only realised cause my leg felt wet(blood was trickling down it). Now I don't walk on escalators and am terrified walking on broken escalators that aren't moving  
Started smoking for like a month this year. At first I thought I liked it. But then I realised it was a temporary effect, which just left a terrible taste in my mouth. Sports and singing also became harder. So I dropped it immediately. Never again. 
Second post in this thread.  The blazing wing challenge at Buffalo Wild Wings.   I decided to order the hottest hot wings B-dubs has to prove to my friend that I could eat more than him. I think we each started with 6 or so. He bitched out after two wings, I had already finished mine. It was painfully hot.  To add insult to injury I decided to finish my friend's wings so I could talk a bunch of shit to him while I did it. The others in our group were cheering me on and I powered through it. The burning didn't leave my mouth until I got home.   It's true what they say about "shitting fire" after eating food that hot. The following day was spent on the toilet. Cheap beer and mega hot sauce explosion of fire out of my ass. It hurt so much I didn't know that kind of pain was even possible.   I still really like hot sauce though.  
Once I hooked up with a girl who claimed to be actively practicing a number of pagan rituals and religions, and also was somehow Buddhist. Ended up being nuttier than a squirrel turd, tried to put a curse on me and stuff like that. Never again! As silly as it might be I will always ask someone prior to sex if they claim to be or have at any point considered themselves to be "spiritual" beyond your basic belief in God.  
I will never again attempt to enter a friends with benefits arrangement. My heart can't take it. I'm in my 40s and lied to myself for a long time about how I enjoyed it. Better to learn the lesson late than never, I guess.  
I know you are hurting right now, but things will get better. 
"I can't believe how expensive this is. Nice box though." 
"I always loved how she looked with that pearl necklace." 
"I wish you hadn't brought the children. How are we supposed to explain this?" 
"Who's the stiff one?"  "Quicker we gets this thing over the quicker we can go and eat."  "Damn that's a big box."  "Praying ain't gonna make it hurt any less."  "Don't just lay there like a cold dead fish."   
My parents met because my dad went up to my mom, grabbed her ass, and said "last night was fun..." - turns out my (party animal) aunt had been at a party and boned my dad the night before. My (extremely prim and proper) mother was mortified and ran away. My dad saw my aunt again later and was like "what was THAT this morning?" and my aunt had to explain. He later saw my mom and apologized and about 5 years later they ran into each other again and he made sure he knew which one she was when they started talking.   Dad and aunt now hate each other.  
My wife's identical twin sister is the most annoying person ever.  Funny, after identical twin my iPhone suggested the rest of the sentence.  
I was talking to a twin and I asked her out to a movie date, she brought her twin and when we were chatting after the movie I realised I liked the other one's personality better and dated her. It was a little awkward after that 
I actually dated an identical triplet. Thankfully they all had very different styles and kept different hair colors, so I never got my girlfriend confused with her 2 sisters. I'd be a liar if I said the thought of a foursome with 3 different variations of my girlfriend never crossed my mind.  
It's not as confusing or tempting as anyone may  think. They look the same ( my parents still mix them up after 10 years) but different personalities. Fun fact, my brother ended up with her twin anyways! 
Girl twin here! Just on the other side of things, I can't tell you how difficult it was to find someone who wasn't completely infatuated and intrigued by my twin and I. Almost all of my relationships, my SO would somehow get in touch with my sister and ask for nudes. It's always been extremely hard on me, and I have a lot of self esteem issues in result. To cope with it, I just get out of the situation and remind myself some people are just the way they are, and that means there will be someone who is good enough to see and want my identity only.  
I briefly dated a twin and she once said to me "so if you didn't know me at all, but you knew my sister instead you'd be going out with her not me right?" The truth is yes obviously I was physically attracted to both of them since they were identical, and you cope with it by knowing the person you're dating on a deeper level, obviously more than just thinking about her looks and body. At least for me that was it. 
My buddies father has an identical twin, his mother has an identical twin, and they are married to each other... both guys to both girls. Its really fucking weird.   **edit**   damn that comment blew up, so many questions, ill tackle a few;  - only one set had kids (my friend and his sister) so no idea if they would look alike if they both had kids  -his aunt/uncle hooked up at the wedding of the first two... - yes they go to twin conventions - didn't know them well enough to ask the swap question - they lived 3 doors down from each other in a cookie cutter development, with the same layout (this really weirded me out) - 
Dated a girl who has an identical twin, Weirdest thing that happened was when i came to pick her up at her place, i thought she was the one who answered the door, called her babe and leaned in for a kiss, she shoved her hand to my chest and said "Woah! i'm not chelsea". It was goddamn awkward after that. Told my SO what happened and she laughed her ass off. 
I dated a girl with an identical twin sophomore year of college.  It was hard to tell them apart (even for their parents) - they even dressed alike and ate the same type of food and listened to identical music.  The attraction was there equally. But the girl I was dating said, "Think of us as 2 dishes of identical ice cream - you can stick your spoon into one, but not both." 
I dated a twin, I never messed them up which was good, but there was this one time my girlfriend asked me if I wanted to play a game, I said sure.  She showed me a bunch of old pictures of her and her twin sister and asked me to figure out which she was.   I'm thinking, fuck I better know, this is probably a test, but I ended up getting really lucky because she seemed to almost always be the one in pink or the one on the left lol.   I asked her if she could tell, and she said no, she just memorized where she was, if it was her first time seeing them, she never would have been able to guess correctly each time.  Idk what kind of chance she thought I had or if she just wanted me to suffer, luckily I was pretty good at the game lol 
I'm a woman married to a female twin. Her and her sister do look a lot alike in the face and body wise, but have always had extremely different styles. It's easy to tell them apart because my wife has long, curly natural hair and her twin keeps hers short, plus it's dyed and straightened.   The most confusion is when we are together. Not because of the way they look, but because they also happen to have a very similar voice. If we are all hanging out, my wife and I, her sister and the husband, whenever one of the girls says babe my brother-in-law and I both look.   Upon first meeting them, I actually saw the twin I'm not married to first. I thought she was cute, but didn't get gay vibes so imagine my delight when there was a single, gay replica. Nowadays, they are both still very attractive, but of course my wife is more beautiful to me because I'm in love with not only her looks, but her soul, her personality, and all her little quirks.  
My best friend (a dude) had a twin sister that I always had the hots for, but I couldn't bring myself to ask her out because she looked too much like him. It was hot-kward. 
Currently dating a twin who lives with his twin brother. I'm not attracted to his brother and I'm not really sure why, they're very similar in personality and interests. His brother's girlfriend however, has been weird/jealous about me dating her boyfriend's twin from the start.  
I dated a twin when I was younger. She presented herself much differently than her sister, so it wasn't usually a problem. My gf had long dark hair and dressed like a hippie; her twin had short red hair and dressed a little girlier. Both were gorgeous, but I was much, much, much more attracted to my gf than her sister, so I was never conflicted.  Anyway, one night my "gf" comes out to meet me. It's dark. She's wearing a hoodie. I put my hands on her hips and go in for the "hello" smooch, and she just dies laughing. "I'm not XXX, dumbass," my gf's twin says. We got along well, so there was no drama, just laughs (including from my gf and her twin's bf).  
This is very similar to the "which one of us is Hikaru game" 
To all of the people saying that the other twin was a jerk, let me shed some light.  Sometimes guys will be standoffish to their brother or friend's significant other so that they aren't perceived as being competition for said mate. Probably doubly so for twins where attractiveness is equal. It's just a way of keeping a relationship out of the way of friendship or family.  
How do you cope? They are identical. Just pretend you're fucking the sister. Done.   
Not quite the same but my girlfriend looks exactly like her mom from the back. Not attracted to her but have definitely called her babe a few times. Super awakened.  
I used to date a girl with a twin, like both of them were 10/10. the threesome question was always on my mind and one day I got drunk enough to ask. If you don't ask you don't get, turns out she was down for it and her twin was an all around great guy. 
Got a call on my phone from an unknown number - I was at my laptop, so I typed the number into Google and hit enter (this was years ago before Google started futzing phone # searches), and when it didn't load immediately, I went ahead and answered it.   Turned out to be a tech from work who needed help accessing one of my systems. I walked him through it, then turned back to my laptop.  The top hit on google for his phone# was a craigslist ad for gay erotic massage. And it wasn't a wrong number - it had a couple months of ad history and even though there were no face pics, his unusually hairy arms and a small tattoo were easy to identify.   I kept that story to myself for a few years, only relating it after I left the company. I told the story at a bar with some old co-workers, not knowing that this guy's wife was friends with one of them.   Anyway... my bad.  
Bit of a twist  I caught my exes ( there was two, two separate times) escorting on backpage.  Ive been single since the second time. I dont trust my judgment  
Two wives of clients knew about me because their husbands flat-out told them, under the sad misapprehension that once they were divorced, we'd be free to have an (unpaid) relationship. The first time, I was flattered, conflicted, and saddened. The second time, I was pissed off. You threw your happy homelife away because you just /hoped/ some college girl was going to ride off into the sunset with you?   Now I only do 2 hour maximum sessions, because I've found that clients who book overnights or full-day sessions are the most likely to lose their grasp on the reality of the situation. Somehow, sleeping next to someone is more intimate than fucking them, and it makes these men confused. 
At this strip club I worked at one of the dancers had a daddy that came in legit almost every day he actually was good looking and charming. His wife saw his car in the lot and pulled in and tore past the bouncers and ran into the VIP area. They were back there it came to seconds of them getting caught. She didn't get her tip that day so he tripled it the next time out of guilt.  
When I was pro-domming, I had a great client--one of my favorites. He was this older guy, worked in construction, who liked to be dressed up like a pretty girl and humiliated. This is an incredibly common fetish and easy money.  For his 60th birthday, he decided he wanted to try getting pegged. That wasn't something I'd do for just anyone, but we had good rapport and the idea delighted me so I went ahead and made him my bitch for the evening. He loved it, we had a great talk afterwards about how liberated it made him feel. How, as he got older, he wanted to try new things, and how he wished his wife could understand and be adventurous with him. This is not an unusual conversation.  What IS unusual is that the guy apparently told his wife. I got a nasty email telling me to stay the hell away from "her man." I never responded and never heard from him again. I hope they made it. 
Friend of mine is a male sex worker  & massage therapist who mostly sees other males.   It's not uncommon to have sessions with married and ::cough:: "straight" guys.   One lady found out about her husband seeing my friend (I don't know how) and came down to this place screaming and carrying on, banging on the door, claiming he enticed this guy into homosexuality, etc.   oooookay, lady.      The next day they found someone spray painted  FAGOT (their spelling not mine), SLUT and some bible verse about homosexuality on the front door of warehouse space.   The thing is, my friend didn't live there, just rented the out the space by the hour for these sessions.     
Not a girl, but about a year ago one of the guys I was seeing paid extra to film a meeting with his phone. Apparently he had never told his wife he was into guys, and he had definitely not told her he was banging one. About a week after our meet I got a text from his number saying it was his wife and to never contact him again. Never did learn if they worked it out or not but I'm guessing it didn't go well  
Had a super tall Jewish fellow who was a regular.  Super sweet guy;  he was he kind of guy who would bring me food or run errands for me..bring me soup and Gatorade when I was sick.. sometimes just see a movie.  Anywho, his wife called from his number and politely asked who I was.  I just said I worked for Marriott hotels and wanted to see if she would be interested in a free, all expense paid vacation package, which she immediately hung up (I'm not very creative).  I guess she either figured it out or googled my number.. I haven't heard from him in over a year.  It sucks, clients can sometimes turn into your best friends, regardless in the nature of the work. 
Well I was 16, and stupid on drugs so it didn't occur to me what I was doing was bad. but... the police caught us and while my dad came to pick me up from the hotel I passed by the SO and his kids yelling at him while hes in handcuffs. 
Nice try to get the usernames of all 'Escort girls of reddit'. 
Not me, but a friend had been having an affair with a married guy for 9ish month. He said he was leaving his wife, but always came up with an excuse not to do it. Then one day, my friend was staying at his house when the wife showed up early from a business trip. She walked in and pulled a gun, aiming at her husband.  This broke out into a huge fight/scramble where I guess the guy tried to tackle her. He failed to pull her down but managed to knock the gun out of her hands. So my friend ran and picked it up and turned to see them screaming and trying to tear each other apart.   When the woman saw she had the gun she turned and begged my friend to shoot her husband; saying he was a cheating bastard, etc. My friend just stood there (bare assed) holding it. She said she was tempted, but very quickly chose to walk out, grabbing her clothes on the way. She threw the gun in a dumpster outside their place and drove off, never seeing either of them again.  
Hi! Escort here!  I have definitely gotten a few calls/emails from SOs.  Some very angry, some eerily calm.  Once, a lady was very relieved that I was a pro, and it wasn't an emotional affair 
I worked as a masseuse for a bit. I was never caught per se but I had a good client who came in a few times and he even paid to hang out outside of the establishment. We were friendly and all of our relations were purely business related which he was fine with but one day I got an angry text from a girlfriend/wife/etc threatening to kick my ass. I noped right on out and blocked his number. Never heard from him again 
Happened to one of my close friends but in an ironic twist.   So she caught her fiance doing the dirty deed with an escort in their own room. Here's the ironic twist. The escort is my friend's best friend and my close friend is also an escort who decided to retire a little while before their marriage.  
Level 8 mage here.  Was paid to escort some Orc lady through a flooded settlement.  She hurt her ankle but it turned out she used to be a shaman  
My best friend is a sugar baby & a dominatrix. She had an issue with a client who's live in girlfriend found my friend's number in his phone. She called yelling, screaming, cursing, etc. My friend laughed it off, saying first of all I don't know who you are, second why are you mad at me, and third- I'm not the only gal.   Sad note-   A few months later the dude started bragging about how he was molesting the girlfriend's 14 year old daughter in Disneyland. Friend called the crazy GF and she did nothing. Friend called the police & CPS, but it turned into them interviewing her about her life choices vs a kid being abused.  
Gangs murdering people who flash their headlights as part of a 'gang initiation' 
My mom still insists that killer bees are a major concern  
Rainbow parties. There was a big hubbub in the news a few years back about teens having get togethers where the girls would wear different colored lipstick and go around blowing all the guys until their wangs were rainbow colored. There is not a single confirmed case of this ever happening even once. 
Dangerous trends that bored and paranoid stay at home moms spread around like syringes in ball pits. Maybe it's happened once, but that's not something worth spreading around the internet like as if some international super villain syndicate is banding together to drop syringes into all of the ball pits around the country. 
I used to work at a computer tech support firm. Held the job full time for 3 years, back to back calls...  My confession...    Our customers weren't nearly as technically illiterate/ rude as me and my colleagues made them out to be. Actually, 99% of our customers were kind and just wanted help.   I guess 'exaggerated stories of the call center' just made for good smoke break conversation; its like a right of passage in the phone support world.  We sometimes received a rude customer, but chances were that they had just been worn down from an earlier call with an inexperienced employee. Rarely did we get the entitled prick, and when we did, he/she was always pretty easily taken care of. 
I hear more people complain about other people saying "new year new me", than I've ever heard someone say "new year new me."  
A cashier giving someone a weird look because of an item they bought or commenting on items they're buying together.  Never worked as a cashier but I'm pretty sure they don't care what you buy and 'Hi how are you, find everything you were looking for?' is code for 'hurry and pay for your shit then get out' 
Claiming that the POTUS will hijack democracy and stay president when their 2nd term is over.  Some claimed that dubya would do this. Similar claims about Obama. If Trump manages a 2nd term, most likely someone will claim the same about him. 
The "war" on Christmas. Pretty much everyone loves Christmas and celebrates it in North America, or at the very least, tolerate it.  
People getting Taco Bell shits. Smh y'all just got weak stomachs... 
I've read stories about people (women) yelling at men for holding the door open for them.  I don't know if that's *never* happened, but where I am I'm willing to bet it's never happened.  I'm a woman, and I hold doors open for everyone. Most people I know do. It's common courtesy.  
Not being allowed to say "Merry Christmas" anymore. So often this is used as an anti-pc argument and though I'm sure it has happened in a couple of customer service environments, it's way overblown.   
Hooking up with someone and getting a card that says "Welcome to the world of AIDS". I'm pretty sure these stories were presented by pastors at church to promote abstinence. I mean, if you have HIV or AIDS and don't disclose it to a sexual partner I'm pretty sure that's a felony.  
Your gay marriage corrupting my kids and turning them into sexual deviants who are okay with marrying a horse and other terrible, terrible stuff.    
Its like 10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife.   NEVER HAS ONE PERSON ACCUMULATED THAT MANY SPOONS. 
I'm always wondering why the people most afraid of terrorism are the ones who live way out where the buses don't go and almost certainly don't regularly spend time with people who don't look an awful lot like themselves. 
The mythical welfare queen in front of them in line at the grocery store buying $700 in steak with food stamps before getting in their brand new Escalade.  Like, welfare fraud exists but it is so statistically small/infrequent that it's extremely unlike that people see it anywhere near as much as they claim to.  
people requesting trigger warnings for dumbass shit. all the trigger/content warning requests i see are usually pretty reasonable, or contained to actual "safe spaces" where everyone is on the same page with that kinda shit anyway. Every trigger warning request for something stupid ive seen has been by obvious trolls 
This is something my local community deals with, but the presence of Muslims and implementing Sharia law in America.   I've seen countless blogs claiming that my city lives under Sharia now. Though not one can cite an actual law (they're "secret laws.") No one can point out a court case upholding such a thing ("yet..." they say.) No evidence of community leaders pushing for Islamic domination ("the Quran tells Muslims to lie...") A couple even cited an instance where a local Christian church was cited for a civil property infraction... which the church admitted to, corrected the problem, done; but it was evidence of "a war on Christianity." 
There was a children's clothing store in my home town called "Dumpster Baby". They must have thought they were being clever. They closed down after a month and reopened with a new name. 
There was a Chuck E Cheese type place in Lima, OH called the Squirty Worm. 
Local law firm is "Allen, Allen, Allen, & Allen"  Gets a little redundant. 
I once drove through a rough town in England and there were two newsagents next to each other. The original one was called The Shop. The one next door that was built later is called "The other shop" 
"Vic's Chainsaw Repair and Video Rental". Not dumb. Just a weird combination of business.  
I've once drove past a van on the highway in the Netherlands that said "Jens Beenhakker - Rolstoelverkoop". That loosely translates to "John Legchopper - Wheelchair vendor". I nearly caused an accident laughing about it. 
A restaurant called Jerk King.  I laugh every time I pass by it 
In my hometown there's a driving school called "Rape". Rape is a quite common last name in that area and they just called their school after their name. 
There's a gym down the road called Gym'll Fix It.   It's a play on a British TV show called Jim'll Fix It, where celebrity host Jimmy Saville made kid's wishes come true. Unfortunately, shortly after his death a few years ago he was outed as a hugely prolific paedophile, who'd abused hundreds of children over the decades. The name of the gym would be quite funny if it now didn't have all sorts of nasty connotations associated with it.  
There's a design company here that's called "Unicum." There's also a company called "Pussi" that makes cat food. Their slogan is "As good as it looks."  
Kum n Go. Pretty common gas station in Iowa. They sell hats. 
Bich N'ga.  I think it's some kind of Asian restaurant. I've seen them in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana.  
Feedler Roofing Company......cmon guys....Feedler on the Roof was right there for ya 
A shop local to me was called "Fergies". I asked inside one day why they were called that. Turns out the previous shop used to have a big sign up saying "Fruit and vegetables" and the new owner just made whatever word he could from the letters. 
Saw a cleaning van with two peoples last names then cleaners with a K.. it was something like this:  Kertzman &   Kleinberg   Kleaners  The van was white. 
'A All Animal Control'....  It's either not grammatically correct, or just dumb sounding.  
There's a sewage company close to me called "turd busters"  
I visited Chicago once and there was a watch repair place called "Jewel Restore".  It took me a minute. I don't think I've ever been more miffed in my life. 
No sure if it's dumb, but there's a Nemo Sushi in Plano Tx 
In Budapest there is an Irish pub called Publin. It's so simple yet so genius and while I acknowledged the fact that is the opposite of what this question asked, it was an opportunity for me to report my find.  
Literally any Barbershop or beauty salon found in a strip mall. They're all puns...and the worst kind...hair puns. 
I used to live near a shop in North London called 'Sale of Scarves and Showpieces.'  As far as I could tell it sold box files and ugly porcelain figurines of ladies.  
A cafe near my house is called The Rustic Aristocrat. Cant stand the name. 
Seafood restaurant here called Dirty Dicks. Their slogan is also "I got my crabs from Dirty Dicks.  
There is a liquor store here that's called "Best Beer" 
Have you guys seen that store Tuesday Morning? What is even the reasoning there? 
Microwave nachos. Chips salsa cheese. Power level 8 for 1:15ish so the cheese melts but the chips retain crispness  
Same as my go to broke meal. A glass of water and a nap. 
Shredded cheese sprinkled on crackers then microwaved. Top with hot sauce and either avocado or jalapenos.  Lazy, crappy nachos. 
Microwave an egg in a coffee cup....or fuck it peanut butter on a spoon 
4 slices of peanut butter toast. That shit is fucking good 
Most of these aren't nearly lazy enough. If I have to use the stove and cook something, it's already too much effort.  
Microwave a hot pocket (bacon egg and cheese) for 2 minutes. Go sit on the couch. Forget about the hot pocket in the microwave. Go to bed hungry 4 hours later. Wake up. Open the microwave to heat up yesterday's coffee. See hot pocket. Scoot it over and put coffee next to it. Heat both up. Cry. Go to work.  
I either:    Slice red peppers and dip them into a sauce, usually soyaki.    Or I heat up Dino-nuggets in the oven. I'm convinced chicken tastes best when in the shape of a dinosaur. 
A hot dog. Might even pop it in the microwave for 20 seconds if I'm feeling ambitious.  
Microwave a hot dog and wrap it in a warm corn tortilla. Tastes a bit like poverty, but still delicious. 
A horribly basic PBJ sandwhich. If there's no bread, I'll gladly just stick the spoon in both jars. 
Kinda lazy: grilled cheese  Lazy: ramen  Super lazy: cereal  Super duper lazy: order food  Super duper uper lazy: order food and willing to pay my roommate to meet the delivery guy (I live in an apt where it's one big building and unless you have the electronic key, you can't get in. So for delivery you actually have to go down 5 flights of stairs and meet them in the parking lot)   Edit (typo): There was no way to buzz in. It was university housing. You had to literally meet people down there. And it was like big bang theory, the elevator almost never worked. And I didn't give my roommate like $20 bucks. It was most like a drink or a cookie or something small AND this happened like 3 times in the past 2 years. Because I had just finished finals and literally wasn't leaving my bed  Edit 2: yes I know ordering food isn't homemade. But it is my ultimate lazy meal, so it counts in my book.  
I call it fake garlic pasta. Basically what you do is you make your pasta and melt some butter on it then dump a shit ton of garlic. Powder on top . Yes I am a college student 
Lately it's been baked potatoes. You heat the oven, throw in some potatoes, wait an hour and then boom. Done.   Sure you can step up the flavor/effort a bit and do things like coat it in olive oil/salt and a million toppings or make some awesome twice baked potatoes. But as far as lazy filling meals go, there's not much easier.  
My Dad invented something we call "Stuff". Brown off a pound of ground beef, season it to your liking, mash in half a bag cooked tater tots, mix in a couple handfuls of cheese, Serve in tortillas with salsa. It's ethereal. Like a culinary, white trash magic trick. 
When I'm lazy and am going to "cook dinner," it's spaghetti. Brown ground beef. Dump a jar of Prego sauce into the meat. Boil water. Add noodles. Done.   It takes very little time, and is "homemade" in that I warmed up each of the 3 ingredients, then put them together.   
Beans on toast.   (Edit : Heinz beans, original. From the UK).  
Kraft Mac and Cheese with cayenne and black pepper. 
Ramen. Then again, that's the only the thing I have to eat because my budget is very limited in college.  
Pound of hamburger,  box of mac and cheese and a can of Rotel=Bachelor Chow 
1) Aglio e Olio. Pasta, olive oil, a pinch of chili flakes and garlic - takes 20 minutes tops to cook, tastes great.   2) Scrambled eggs and a Bratwurst.  
It may not sound "lazy" but steak. Honestly all it needs is a bit of salt and pepper, and cook it for 3ish minutes each side on a cast iron skillet.  
Mexican  cereal.  pour salsa over chips.   eat with spoon  
A small bowl of Stove Top stuffing with some dried fruit and nuts added (raisins/pecans, cranberries/walnuts, cherries/almonds), made in the microwave.   A measuring cup, a spoon, and bowl to eat out of and about three minutes to dinner. 
Fry up a couple spoonfuls of fresh pico de gallo in an omelet pan until the oil starts to separate from it.  Add a couple beaten eggs; cook like a regular omelet.  Add shredded cheese and chopped cilantro, fold and serve.  Intense flavor, almost no work. 
Doritos dipped in whatever salad dressing I have. Bleu cheese, ranch, honey mustard...yeah that sort of thing.  
Mom let my hair grow into a typical 90s mullet. I was nine.  
I wore my frosted tips, with my button down Hawaiian shirts unbuttoned so you could see my wifebeater undershirt.   
I once wore my clothes backwards to a middle school dance because of Kriss Kross.  Yikes.   
I had a shirt with flames on it. Thought I was the most badass mofo my middle school had ever seen. 
Way too much hair gel. My hair was like a rock. This was 7th grade, circa 01-02.  
Hypercolor T-shirts  In theory, it was neat that parts of the shirt changed color with heat.  In reality, you always looked like you were sweating horrifically. 
Top to bottom, circa 1989  Mullet  Torn Guns N Roses tee shirt  Acid washed jeans  White high top sneakers 
I'm a woman.. as a teen in South Florida we all had this phase where we wore men's boxers hanging out of our pants. Even more embarrassing was a Winnie the Pooh phase somewhere in the middle of that, and also people were drinking regular beverages from baby bottles..for some unknown reason it was a thing. Embarrassingly, I did all of those things.  
I used to wanna be a scene kid, except I couldn't really afford all that type of stuff, so instead my best and I decided we were going to be 'new breed scene'. We literally dressed the same as we normally did but attempted our best scene kid hair, which was really just bands swooshed over our foreheads. MySpace angles and awful eyeliner, foundation so pale. I cringe when I remember. Also tried the whole ~gansta gurl~ phase. So much cringe.  
I used to wear two different styles of converse at the same time, most often it was orange on one foot and purple on the other.  
When I was in middle school, I had just seen The Matrix and Hackers. I was very interested in computers and was friends with the goths and punks. I learned about Cyberpunk from the infamous Jargon File, and decided to 'go' cyberpunk.  My mom worked at the mall, so I spent summers there. I shopped at various stores to buy things like cargo pants, boots, and shirts with weird materials and grew my hair out. Ordered a few linux and hacker tees. Started wearing welding goggles and carrying my laptop everywhere.  Got back to middle school and told this girl that I had a crush on 'You might be punk but I'm **Cyber**Punk!  Needless to say, it didn't go over very well. 
I had a rats tail. Spiked hair, shaved sidelines and a single long tail off of the back. It lasted through a lot of high school.  Also fluorescent shirts and pants. Like brilliant blues and yellows and greens with a lot of white. I don't regret the fluorescent at all though. I would wear that now. 
Jeans under my dresses. Not even skinny ones I'm talking bootcut  
wasn't a trend but i intentionally wore very contrasting colours together like pink and green. 
Feathers with stripes on it in your hair.   Glasses rims with no lenses.   The hot topic shirts with cute little cartoons on it that day some dumb shit like "I mustache you a question".  
When I was younger my mom would patch up my jeans and use this glue pen thing to draw pokemon on them.  
Those early 2000s jeans with around 5 chains on each leg. 
I used to wear cat ears, in elementary school. Not sure if that was an actual trend but it was definitely cringeworthy. 
Lots of black.  Band shirts.  Long hair    FYI, still the same, except everything fits better, and I cut my hair. 
Long keychain hangin out my pocket.     I still use them, just that I now tuck the chain in. I **hate** losing my keys. Whenever they are not chained to my trousers they fuck off. I think I must have offended the Queen of the Key Pixies when I was younger.     I can be in a house by myself, put my keys in the middle of the table, leave the room, count to ten, walk back in.....keys are gone.  
Tucking tracksuit pants into your socks.  This was before chavs, when there were two types of kids... Goths and Townies.  
80's...the so called "French Roll", you folded over the cuffs of your acid wash baggy jeans super tight and then rolled them up a few times for a taper so suffocating your feet would go numb. Very "cool" to wear a knit pastel sweater without an undershirt as well. Major cringe..... As a bonus, my hair style was called "The Side Spike", combed off to the side...one line of spiked hair along the hairline, COOL! Please down vote to oblivion, I feel so much shame. 
Cargo shorts and graphic tees... Except I'm also still wearing them currently. I can't help that I like comfort and the ability to store a great many things in my pockets.  
Bodysuits, the kind with snap-crotch  Also, "standing room only" jeans 
Leaving your shopping cart in a parking space because you're too lazy to lug your fat ass to the nearest cart station. 
Proposing at a wedding without the Bride and Groom's permission. Even then it's still iffy.  
Buying a patent not to use it, but in order to keep others from using it. (Not sure if illegal, but definitely a dick move). 
When someone on the subway takes up the seat next to them for their bag while loudly playing shitty music from a speaker. 
Using a public restroom and pissing all over toilet. Or leaving a massive shit and not flushing. 
Parking on the street in front of a house exactly in the middle so that nobody can park in front or behind you. 
Taking a parking spot that someone else had been waiting for.  
Persuading your Grandfather to remove your brother from his will so that all will be left to you. 
Saw Wonder Woman a week ago and not one, not two, but three God damn people brought babies in.  Two of them went off when the volume got loud.  Please people, leave em at home.

Filing for custody of your dog during a divorce then putting it down for no medical reason. 
Sticking your gum under the table at restaurants or bars. So nasty to catch a knee on that. 
Not re racking your weights/gym equipment.  Nothing annoys me more than having to go hunting for that extra clip or matching dumbbell. Or when you see someone finish their set and just leave the area without returning the item.   Scum 
Weaponizing custody of the children in a divorce.    
Neglecting your pets. I know in some cases there are animal abuse laws, but the amount of bullshit some people get away with doing to their cute fluffers that just want to give love is terrible 
Sitting right next to the people already there in an almost empty movie theater. 
Being that one person in a group project that contributes nothing and still tries to act like they did for the grade. 
Using the turn lane/off ramp to bypass a line of traffic before cutting back in. 
Tailgating. It may actually be illegal in some places, idk, but nobody really does anything about it. Either way, it's fucking obnoxious. Whenever it happens I just pull over and let that fuckstick drive ahead of me. 
When you call shotgun but someone else says challenge or some other BS. Bitch, I called it first. Live with it. 
Not taking your rubbish with you after a movie or similar event. Music festivals are particularly bad.  The kids working at the cinema are on minimum wage or less, don't make their life shittier because you are too lazy to take your shit to the bin that you pass on the way out. 
Telling your SO that you want to move out but stay a couple but secretly you fuck his brother, your coworker, Jim from Colosseum of Comics, your drug dealer, and your friend who went into the Marine Corps when he came back on holiday all in the span of a month while still kissing my lips and telling me you love me and picking out names for the kids we will never have   ps Lenny I know you browse Reddit and if I ever find you I'm going to break your arms  
Those parking spots with signs on them for "x parking only"? Only the handicapped ones are legally enforceable. The ones for expectant mothers and the like? You can park there and you're in the clear from a legal standpoint.      Kind of a real dick move, which is why I don't do it myself, but it's possible. 
For men, I'd say approaching a urinal immediately next to one that's currently occupied, when there are several other free urinals readily available WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS, LET ME URINATE IN PEACE YOU INCONSIDERATE FUCK.

Letting your kids fuck everything up in a public place and not cleaning up.  
Pay day loans with 1000%+ interest  Never been desperate enough (thankfully), but it is so shitty to lure people into a vicious cycle of debt 
Recording unknowing strangers in public because you think they're weird or funny.   My friend and I were having an interesting discussion in a fast food place. Of course my friend started talking excitedly during the discussion. Then, suddenly, he went completely quiet in the middle of a sentence and started looking at his phone. I thought it was weird, then he explained he wanted to leave the place. When we got outside he explained the girls behind us had start listening in and using their phone to record him on Snapchat. Fuck people who do that. We're allowed to fucking exist in a public space.  The discussion was also related to LGBT stuff, so double "don't fucking do that shit" there. 
Not cleaning up your dog's shit when it shits anywhere other than your own yard. 
Linking /r/thathappened on literally every fucking thread where someone said they did something, even if I was totally believable. You can say you went to subway for lunch and people will immediately call bullshit just because they can. 
People sitting in front of me pulling their airplane seats as far back as they possibly can while I'm eating with my tray down. That shit's not fun. 
Not turning off your bright lights for oncoming traffic. 
Bidding one dollar over the last person on the price is right.  
Asking any woman how far along she is on her pregnancy if you don't know her or she hasn't told you if she is pregnant. 
As a teenager I spent many times at a bus stop freezing my ass off, baking in the sun, or being soaked by the rain. As a result I always promised myself that when I was older and driving a car and I spotted someone out in harsh conditions that I would offer that person a ride to wherever they were going. Now, however, my desire to not be arrested prevents me from even presenting the offer. 
I stopped shaving my head.  I used to do it just because it was easy and I hate going to the barber. I had a couple buddies who also had their heads shaved, one because he was pretty much bald by 18, and the other because he a had surgery that required it and just started keeping it that way.  One day as we were walking through the mall after seeing a movie, I noticed that people were moving to the opposite side of the walkway as we made our way through the mall. Suddenly it hit me, we were three white guys in leather jackets with shaved heads. We looked like skinheads. I never shaved my head after that.  
I would sometimes give kids a ride home after youth choir practice at church if their parents didn't come for them - but no more. 
I'm very paranoid about my interactions with young females now. When I was 13 my younger sister was 5. We would have wrestling matches where she would attack me and I would do the basic over the top wwe wrestling throws and moves ending with me tickling her into submission. She would scream "wrestle!" I throw her, repeat until she's bored. Basic big brother stuff in my eyes.   Fast forward she told her mom (shes my half sister) that I "wrestle funny" word for word thats what she said to her crazy ass mother. Next thing I know I'm knee deep in a child sex abuse case and being investigated by cps. Of course it was determined nothing happened but it tore our blended family apart.  Ever since then I'm paranoid about any 1 on 1 interaction with a young kid. especially a female with no other adults or witnesses present.  I understand being cautious and reporting suspicious behavior but my sister saying I wrestle funny shouldn't fuck my life up. 
Walking behind women for a few streets. Feels like I am following them. Purposely take a turn and sometimes cross the road or take the long route. 
Looking up when walking up stairs, idk always paranoid someone will accuse me of stealing glance 
I stopped going to the playground with my niece. She loves it when I'm there with her. Going on slides with her or pushing her swing. But according to the mother's there and the old ladies its creepy for a man to go there, even with my niece.   At first I didn't care, I just ignored them. But some even went as far to ask my niece who's only 3 if I was her father and other inappropriate things. Even got the cops called on me twice and after explaining the situation and having to go as far as having to get my sister down there, they left. But I'm still a creep to the woman's eyes. I don't talk to the other kids, I say Hi back and answer them if they ask something.   But... I just don't understand.  
I work as a manager at a fast food place, so I work with a lot of teenagers. Pretty much I have to play "people are lava" so I don't accidentally bump into one of them, we've had a lot of young managers date the crew and do inappropriate things so I want no part of that liability.  
I've been getting driving lessons recently and after the first one the instructor dropped me off and when we were organising new lessons we just said we would meet at the same place. It's outside a school.  We probably met there about 10 times at various parts of the day in a car with massive "Driver Learning School" stickers all over it.  A woman came up to me yesterday as told me how it was wierd that two men met there and how people were talking and how there were "weirdos" about who people thought were selling drugs and how we wouldn't want anyone thinking we were "weirdos".  I just kinda laughed and said "Ok thanks, we'll meet somewhere else in future" but she just kept, on and on. I had to walk away when she was in mid sentence. It was pretty insulting. 
basically all the comments are "dont be nice, and dont come within 1000 meters of children. including your own." 
People get really weird when i discipline my daughter, like since shes a little girl she should be able to do anything she wants  
For some reason I get watched heavily when I go into some stores. So I try to avoid putting my hands in my pockets and going around corners or blind spots. 
Walking behind women.  Especially at night and/or if they're alone. It seems like I'm following them or something when I'm just trying to get to a destination. I try and cross the road if I can but it's fuckin proper alarm bells if the woman does it too!   And what can I do? Shout "hey I'm not weird! Don't be afraid!" I'd be better just sitting and waiting for them to get far ahead   
For me, mostly being very aware around kids that are not my own.  I have a 2 1/2 year old boy who is now very active at playgrounds but still needs a lot of attention when there. This occasionally brings me into contact with other kids. I feel very anxious at times with this- if they talk to me - I try to respond with non-committal answers. If they fall over, I'm going to think twice before going over to help, for fear of people thinking bad things are afoot. My wife has no such issues- she can talk to other kids all day and it not be weird, or anyone question her.  It is sad. Being a dad is the best part of my life and I love kids- I'm a softie- but we are now paying the price for the evil in the world.  
As an instructor for a marching band, I am acutely aware of how I must speak to my female students. There are certain sayings I do not use and I do not presume to touch the students despite that being a common technique for a visually oriented activity. Even slight things as a tap on the shoulder to let them know to relax or to stop scrunching up. Also I do not friend any of my students on facebook. I have to ardently keep those professional boundaries separate.  
The jokes I make in public are completely different  
If I find myself coincidentally walking behind a random woman with both of us alone after-dark, I will make a detour or just stop and wait for her to get further away because I don't want to look like I'm following them.      
When hanging out with my nieces I didn't give a fuck about hugging them or playing with them. Or holding their hand in public. You know, normal human being shit which they often initiate.  Now, I often think "Oh fuck, everyone is going to think I'm some kind of pedo." 
I completely ignore kids. I don't look at them, I don't talk to them, I pretend they don't even exist. The last thing my long haired, goateed self needs is to be accused of being a kid diddler. 
Checking the clock at the gym. Sounds stupid but there's a reason. I like to time my rest between sets and can't be bothered setting a timer on my phone. Anyway, the clock is over the cardio section of the gym (bikes, cross trainers etc) and is almost always occupied by women. Only recently I realised it totally looked like I was checking out chick's asses (and not I  a subtle way) and so I had to stop. 
Being friendly or helping children.  I was walking home from work along a very busy street, loads of pedestrians. A little girl around 4 (maybe? not sure) run past me from behind and faceplanted the ground, looks really sore. She has a few DVDs and they scattered across the ground.  I immediately stopped and knelt down. I handed her one DVD and then asked if she was OK. She didn't respond. Looked around for a parent but couldn't see one. I just wanted to help but I'm a man so I totally didn't feel I was allowed too. Another guy stopped and seemed concerned, looked at each other and that was about it.  Luckily her mum appeared thanked us and checked she was OK. I just left. I'm annoyed I wasn't able to help. 
Going out of my way to try and connect with women I am interested in. Or just friends for that matter.  When I talk with friends and hearing from other women about how creepy some men are cause they try to make plans with someone they are interested in it scares me that I am doing the same thing. When people stop texting me I don't try and restart a conversation later on in fear I am acting desperate or clingy.  I give women too much space when I feel that they need it and then they get mad cause I didn't try and rekindle the relationship, that's how my last relationship ended. Its something I want to work on, but that constant nagging in my head that I might be too creepy/clingy keeps me from trying.   
I see lonely and miserable looking kids when I go to the park with my nephews and I try to get them to go at least ask if they want to play hide and go seek or some game while I chill. If they don't want to then I keep walking and thinking about how they must feel.    Breaks my fucking heart man.  
Helping children.  Growing up I've always wanted to help people, so I joined the police, I've got a good career ahead of me. I've waved to children before, because they waved at me - either because they've seen me in my patrol car or because they're being children. I waved back. I got called a paedophile.  I overheard a conversation about a lost child inside a clothing store, and I found him. I knelt down, told him my name, and that I was a policeman. I took him by the hand, and returned him to his mother and the security guard.  Again, I got called a paedophile.  And both of these incidents, it was my then-girlfriend who said it. 
Take cutlery on picnics.   Had a cop slam on his brakes and vault a fence to confront me for brandishing a knife... While I spread peanut butter on my 3 year old's sandwich at the playground.   Offered the good officer a snack. 
I don't take my nieces or nephews to the park anymore unless one of my sisters or my fiancee is with me. I used to do it all the time, but the women at the work would always give me evil looks. A couple of times I had the cops on me for "acting suspicious" since I was a lone male at the park "staring" at children. In reality I was keeping a close eye on my 3 year old niece, 2 year old niece, and 6 year old sister.   Once I got everything cleared with the cops, they asked me not to come back as I kept making people uncomfortable.  
How about the opposite to brighten your day. I'm about 6' tall 230 lbs with a long beard. Was traveling recently. Full flight. Sat next to a young couple with about a 2 yr old girl. We hadn't taken off yet and she was already fussing until she saw me. She looked at me and gave me a big smile.  Like a serious day brightening smile. Hesitantly, I smiled back knowing the parents would probably take me for a pedo. Lo and behold they didn't! Instead I got to meet a wonderful family and made a new best friend, the little girl. We played Patty cake, read books etc. And I even held her for a bit so her folks could eat their in flight meal.  It was a win for me. A young couple had faith I wasn't a pervert, a little girl had a great flight, and I met great people! 
I don't keep my hands down naturally at my sides anymore because of all the molestations occurring daily on Tokyo commuter trains. I'm tall, so I make sure I have both hands up and holding the baggage rail overhead. I've heard horror stories about men being falsely accused of molestation just so the woman can get quick cash from him. If he protests his innocence, she screams for the cops. And the man's word is nothing more than dogshit. 
I avoid children like they have a horrid cross between black death and ebola that can be spread by eye contact. I also avoid being alone in the same place as almost any woman. I prefer texting over face to face contact, because it gives a written out "he-said-she-said" I can use to save my own ass if someone starts lying.  Basically I'm afraid of woman and children 
Well apparently, I'm oblivious as a woman. I've never thought someone was stalking me, or that the man/child duo was some sort of perversion, or think every man that strikes up a conversation with me is trying to get into my pants. These people need therapy.   I did ask a male co-worker this question.  His response was that he is the main "grocery fetcher" in the family, and that sometimes he'll run into the same woman repeatedly as he shops. He says after the first two-three times, he'll purposely go to the opposite end of the store and start shopping from there.   Apparently a woman accused him of "following her" a couple years back at Kroger and threw a fit to the point the cops were called, and he's afraid it will happen again.   
Went on a walk today and walked past an open car port stuffed with crap in boxes.  I gave it a glance as I walked by and got glared at by a woman who obviously thought I must be casing her junk pile for a future robbery.  Spent the rest of my walk looking at my feet... 
Driving around in a van in clown makeup, naked from the waist down. 
For some reason people told me to not look them in the eyes since it made them feel uncomfortable, so now I just glance away from their eyes every few seconds 
Never sitting next to anyone on the bus or train.  
Holding doors for people. At the college I used to go to I would hold doors form people men or women if you were close. One day I apparently held the door for the department chair of women's studies and she said some shit about "I don't need a man to hold a door for me it makes me feel inferior" so I said ok then I won't and let it close in her face. Which probably justified her but ugh. Come on I was just being friendly.  I try and avoid looking around when talking to women so they don't think I'm being creepy and looking them over. :/  
As a man in a relationship, simply making female friends.  
Being friendly towards women.   Apparently, that comes off as I'm trying to get into their pants, interestingly enough. I just wanna talk. Is that so much?  
Although I know this question is more socially oriented, I will weigh in on test taking. I am very paranoid about being wrongly accused of cheating, even though the last time I cheated was years ago. I get very anxious and look at my paper a lot, and when I do look up to ponder, I look at my teacher exclusively. Which of course, in turn raises more suspicion towards me due to the good old: "The only reason you would look at me is to see if you can cheat."   Besides that, talking to people in unsociable places of the world. You just get weird or blank looks.  
I love right outside of Flint and have Detroit water. It's interesting driving around because you'll see apartment complexes with giant banners saying "WE HAVE DETROIT WATER" in a larger font than the actual name of the apartment complex. 
Travel to Flint for work from time to time. They are starting to replace some of the pipes. However, the cost to do it right is astronomically high. The state doesn't have the funds or the budget to do it. They are currently appealing to the federal government for funding. I still bring my own water.   Another fun Flint story. We had a few members from a hospital come to train with us. One of the people brought homemade cookies. They looked and smelled incredible. Nobody touched them. They sat on the break room table where something like that would be gone within 10 minutes. Even though we knew she lived in a city that was still on Detroit lines (Detroit City Water is some of the best tasting and cleanest water in the country) we couldn't get over the whole Flint water thing.  
Still won't drink the water. Sent a test to Davison, Mi and it came back okay to drink, but not gonna risk that.  Showering is fine.    
Sorry for my ignorance, but can't the people file a class action law suit or something? I'm no college boy, but I'm fairly certain us Americans are good at suing the shit out of people. 
I guess I'm looking at it from a UK standpoint, being such a small country this would make headline news everywhere for a while. And then you'd have all the national and EU agencies lining up to sanction the company (as all our water companies are private) to kingdom come if they didn't fix it.   I can't really quantify a country the size of the US and all the layers of bureaucracy that comes with your Federal system.  
So honest question.   Lead pipes were pretty much never used by the 1920's. A lot of people here are saying a big part of the problem is with the lines into the residence.  Does that mean that Flint continued to use lead pipes long after the rest of the country stopped using them, or that most of the houses are 100+ years old.  When you demolish a house to build new you would shut off the water and replace that line (especially if it was decades old lead).  
Live an hour from flint, half hour north of detroit.  All the pipes are fucked. Flint has it the worst BY FAR.  I had a sink hole open up a few miles from me.  It was a serious mess.  (Google fraser mi sink hole)  giant pipes packed full of sewage.  As in human waste.  However, there are *billions* of gallons of human waste dumping into the great lakes at an alarming rate.  I live not far from lake st clair, which is a connective lake between erie and huron.  In the last 30 years, almost all summer, ever summer, all the beaches are closed due to e coli poisoning. Everytime i walk along it, theres just pollution and dead fish everywhere.  There are also old oil lines that could go and cause major damage under lake superior (or maybe in the straigh5s)  but no one gives a shit.  Thats our drinking water!!!  It holds 20% of the fresh water in the world!  
I'll probably get buried since I'm here so late. From a suburb, roughly 40 minutes away, one of my friends just bought a house for super cheap in downtown. It's weird to see the water handout stations so close to my comfortable suburban midwest neighborhood. Lots of rumors that the Michigan AG is announcing new charges tomorrow. Hopefully things can get better down there.  
Wait, so the US has shitty electricity and STILL has cities without clean water. How is this possible when it's one of the largest and most developed economies in the world? 
What is with the current drought of [serious] tags in /r/askreddit? 
Not from Flint, but near the Detroit area. There was a loss of pressure from a power failure that resulted in bacterial contamination of our water supply. The city issued a warning telling us to boil all tap water for at least one minute before consumption. They closed down the drinking fountains at my high school as well. 
Would boiling water/using a pur or Brita water filter make the water decent? 
Wait is that still going on? I figured they fixed it and no one said anything. 
Like general affection, even with hugs and compliments I'm pretty reserved unless our relationship is clearly drawn out and we both know that nothing is being implied 
Not me, but my little sister started dressing as the stereotypical butch lesbian when she went off to college. Said that it made things a little easier.  I'm still not sure how to respond. 
Trying to politely decline their advances. Sometimes I have to be rude just for them to get the point.   
Asking a question or giving them a compliment.   But the worst thing is when I've walked back to my car alone and in the dark. I'd been out that day and was wearing cute and kind of revealing clothes. A guy followed me from the train station to where I'd parked (about 10 minutes), and when I got in my car he started to yell at me for leading him on. We hadn't spoken, but we'd made eye contact a couple of times on the hour long train ride, which seemed to be enough for him.  I didn't think that the phrase "leading someone along" was so literal, but okay.  
Let's just say I don't eat bananas in public anymore.  
If I have to pick something off the ground I bend my legs and squat down to do it so it doesn't look like I'm showing off my ass, even though it'd be a lot easier to just bend down. 
I've stopped using voice chat in dota because as soon as my team finds out I'm a girl, they start saying all kinds of creepy shit. 
Today, apparently, I shouldn't have carried a nightstand down the street. It was a little awkward but not heavy at all, and some dude came up to me and tried to take it from my hands, unasked. I held onto it and told him, "no thanks." He kept pulling on it. I had to ask him to let go. When I said "Jesus Christ" he went on, "oh, like it was such a bad thing." Yes, dude, that was *absolutely* a bad way to try to help someone out. You don't take something from someone's hands unbidden if you actually want to help them. Frankly, you *pulling* a medium-large object from my grasp makes me think you're trying to steal from me or con me. 
Mentioning that I have a girlfriend, weirdly enough. You know how saying you have a boyfriend is normally pretty good for making guys go away? Well, saying you have a girlfriend just leads to a bunch of gross questions and offers of "if you're ever looking for a threesome, hit me up" (gag). Like what, does this guy think I'll go home and excitedly tell my gal pal, "Guess what? I met a guy at a bar, and, you won't believe this, he wants to have SEX with BOTH of us!! What a rare and exciting offer, we need to take him up on this!"  
Not accepting any favor from a man. No rides. No coffees. Avoid avoid. It sucks.  
there was that time when i was eleven and i started needing a training bra and my teacher gave me a weird talk about keeping bra straps hidden at all times? i didn't even know how to properly adjust the straps so they wouldnt slide and i really didn't need Mr. N's bra strap advice as an impressionable eleven year old 
whenever I'm talking with a guy I'm always super conscious about not mentioning too soon/too late that I have a significant other. Too soon and its 'geeze bitch god I  was just making conversation!!!!' and too late and it's 'geeze bitch way to lead me on!!!!'. Thankfully since becoming engaged, this is less and less of a problem as my ring sort of speaks for itself on its own without my input. :) 
I'm thinking more in terms of social media, but I've found if a guy messages me and I send back so much as a polite 'hello' that guy will never leave me alone. Every couple months he'll pop up trying to start a conversation, usually being rude or lewd, long after I've stopped messaging him. Last time it happened the guy had been trying this for a while and right now I'm 7 months pregnant and in a serious relationship and I just went off on him. It's so sad that it has to come to that. And I know it's just a few delusional, ridiculous guys that do this but Jesus...what on Earth makes them think this behavior is ever going to get them anywhere? 
I'm quite fat and face none of the issues you gals do. Bonus, maybe?! I get to be nice and talkative and be invisible. 
Showing any kind of concern for a guy. Like if you have a guy friend that looks sad and you try to be a good friend and comfort them that's seen as flirting somehow. (plus most of the stuff everyone else posted)  
When I was 13, my dad warned me against talking one-on-one with guys. He said that exclusivity could be interpreted as flirting. So yeah, that I guess.  
I don't ask random men for directions anymore.   One time I was taking the greyhound bus for the first time by myself. Asked a random guy where the line for where I wanted to go was. He didn't know but he was also looking for the same line. We agreed to look together (why not?) and ended up sitting next to each other and chatting.   2 hours into the 5 hour bus ride he says he's "tired" and then falls asleep. Wraps his arm around me while he's "asleep" and then starts kissing my neck. I was so uneasy and scared in that moment bc I didn't know how he'd react to me pushing him off and I didn't want to make a scene. Also the seats were all full, half with actual sleeping people so switching wasn't really an option. I was leaning almost fully into the aisle to get away from him.   Eventually he "woke up" and THEN asked if I had a boyfriend and wanted to date him. I promptly turned him down and listened to music for the next 3 awkward as hell hours  
So what I've gathered from the two threads is that neither side can be friendly to the other out of fear of misunderstandings thus leading to a positive feedback loop 
In addition to what others have mentioned, I've had to deliberately force myself to stop squeeing or smiling at puppies being walked by single men who aren't obviously gay, because of the frequency with which interest in the puppy gets interpreted as interest in the human. 
During my pre-pubescent years I had a lot of male and female friends and I found it easy to talk to both genders because I treated both the same way--as if they were full people deserving of my interest and attention during a conversation. During the teenage years I realized that more and more of my male friends started dropping off because they assumed that my friendship meant that I was really in love with them. In early adulthood I became apprehensive to even start friendships with men and as a mid-20s adult I am apprehensive to even hold deep conversations with men lest they expect something in return. Sure, I'll do small talk and am friendly but I won't ever let you know me or try to get to know you unless I know for SURE that you're not one of *those* guys who thinks that women are incapable of holding an engaged conversation unless they crave the D.  
Not female, but I've noticed one.  Bananas.  Women don't peel it and then slip its length into their mouth.  They break it off in small chunks.    Guys, otoh, just gobble down on that thing... 
Went to a bar with partner and friends.  Wasn't standing next to partner while talking.  Immediately started getting hit on by strangers.  Attached myself to partner for the rest of the night. 
I don't change anything, if a guy interprets my friendliness or outfit as flirting that's his problem and I'll keep on being nice and wearing what I like   But generally I'm the one hitting on the guys I'm interested in so there's no room for guys I'm not into to step in  There was that one time some guys tried to steal me from my date when he went to the bathroom and I was like "I'm drunk, I'm not going with you lol"   Im generally friendly to everyone who seems nice but I have heard from my friends that I give off a dominant and intimidating vibe when I'm out, so maybe I'm just scaring them off  
Along the same lines of all these--making new guy friends. I have a lot in common with guys, but almost every guy I've befriended has asked me out at some point, and after I decline (as nicely as possible) they don't want to be my friend anymore.   So I've come to assume that guys don't want girl friends. They want *girlfriends*. And so my boyfriend is basically my only friend. Being a pretty, boyish girl is a lonely life.  
Not itching my boob in front of guys, even though it's really itchy. 
I used to always try and talk to my guy friends and get to know them. I just wanted to be there for them to listen to them vent and genuinely take an interest in what they're saying and give my best advice. They confided in me and I cared about them. 9 times out of 10 the guy would think I wanted more and would try to and take it to the next level and then we'd end up having to stop being friends and it sucked.   Now I don't do that and try my hardest to ignore guy friends that want to talk about their feelings or give them a more generic answer instead of going in depth. Which I feel really bad about when they "need someone to talk to" and I'm the one they reach out to, but I feel like it's better for the both of us.  
Late to the party, but I once offered to do my male friends dishes while at a party at his house. The mother of his 3 week old child was super pissed he invited me and two other friends over, and when I offered to do the dishes bc he kept mentioning how disgusting they were, she almost punched me in the face.   After that I stoned and drunkenly walked to another friends house to sleep. These friends had their band friends from another state coming over to crash, and most of us were sitting on the porch. I commented to the one guy as he was walking inside, "wow! Your pillow looks so comfortable!". Everyone proceeded to tell me how slutty and awful that sounded. Like what the fuck??? I genuinely just wanted to know where this fluffy pillow came from, and help my friends with a newborn get their house cleaned up.   I just don't speak to any of these people anymore :/

Well aside from the classic zero response to the ask for volunteers, my favorite would have to be when the audience member in question got scared/frustrated and threw the cloth I had had her hold at me and run away.  
Was at a magic show on a date last year, the magician asked for a volunteer and a little girl no more than five runs up on stage  "Hi there little girl, I'm [insert magician name], what's your name?"  "Katherine, but my friends call me Katie"  "Oh, can I call you Katie?"  "No"   Then she ran back into the audience, only trick done was embarrassing the magician  
This is a bit off topic, but I feel that it belongs here. My father is the son of a relatively well known magician, and thus knows a lot of the tricks of the trade. One day he was with some friends at a place with a magician who went from table to table. When he reached my father, my dad challenged him to a somewhat duel, saying he could figure out any of his tricks.   The man agrees, and begins doing a mind reading trick, where he acuratly described every tiny aspect of my father's childhood bedroom. My dad, of course is blown away, as he had no clue how this man knew any of these things.   The magician saw his face, laughed, and walked away saying, your dad and I are old friends, I stayed with them last week in your room. I recognized you from the pictures still up in your room. 
Finally a question I can answer!  "Please hold out your hand and take this card"  Guy holds out his hand.  "No the other one."  Guy takes arm out of his jacket pocket to reveal a stump where his hand used to be. 
I was at a dinner for a family member and there was a magician walking around doing tricks for all the tables. When he got to my table he did a few tricks and ended up talking to us for a bit and found out that I knew some magic tricks. He asked if I would want to do a trick for him and I said, "Sure, shuffle the deck and while you do, think of any card you want. Stop shuffling whenever you want to." He shuffled a few times and said he was thinking of a card. I told him to tell us what it was and that whatever card it was it would be the 15th card in the deck. He looked at me like he knew I was bullshitting him, which I totally was, but he went along with it and said his card and counted out to the 15th card. It was his card. I was dumbfounded but didn't show it and the look on his face was priceless.  
I was at a fakir show and he chose me to do a trick with broken glass.  The setup: There was broken glass all over the floor, he would lie down on his stomach and I would step down on to his back from a stool.  Unfortunately, I was drunk and absolutely unable to stand unassisted on a stool. So while he was getting ready to lie down, I stumbled off directly into the broken glass with my bare feet (they were bare because I was about to stand on the fakir).  The audience gasped! And I looked down in wonder at my totally not bleeding feet before announcing loudly: "Don't worry, guys, it's just plastic." 
One time a magician trick required three volunteers to give up something amd so the magician suggested wedding rings. At the end he joked "Take the most expensive one". The first guy picked a ring, the second guy picked a ring, and then the third guy said "this remaining ring isn't mine". The first guy actually took back the most expensive one. 
Not a magician, was the audience member. I was about 9 and the magician called me up to the stage. He had a mesh bag of lemons and a $20 bill.   He told me to sign the bill and he would make it appear in one of the lemons. I reached into the bag and tried to grab one from the middle, but it was sewn in a way so that all the other lemons in the bag were in their own compartment and I could only physically grab one lemon.  I looked him in the face, and into his microphone, I loudly asked, "Why can I only grab this lemon?"  He quickly finished the trick and ushered me off stage as quickly as possible. 
How a about a science trick instead?  My daughter was watching a liquid nitrogen demonstration at the science center, and the demonstrator asked if any of the kids in the audience had a penny he could borrow.  My daughter, who compulsively collects small objects, had apparently found a penny at some point in the day - so volunteered it with a level of enthusiasm only available to preschool-aged children.  She sat smiling away, *sooooo* happy she could help out, so happy that her compulsion was useful instead of a nuisance for once.  And then the demonstrator froze and shattered her hard-won penny treasure, right before her eyes.  The look of shock and betrayal on my daughter's face was one of the most raw examples of human emotion I've ever seen. We tried to make it better, but all the pennies her grandparents and I had between us couldn't make it right.  My wife still keeps a broken piece of that penny in her purse as a memento. 
I once saw a hypnotist get soaked with water by a guy he thought he hypnotized. Halfway through the show the guy grabs his water bottle, places his thumb across the hole, and squeezed all of the water onto the back of the hypnotist and just kept laughing. He was thrown out of the Ren Faire.  
I was a spectator for this one.  Watching a street busker tell everyone he's going to make a balloon animal for someone and asks for a volunteer.  All the little kids are jumping up and down and he picks a little girl.  He tells her and everyone that she's going to get a balloon dog.  Then he hands her a deflated balloon and tells her she has to make it herself.  Then he turns his back on her and goes into his patter talking to the audience and not watching her.  It is clear from his patter that she is not supposed to be able to make a balloon dog.  Nevertheless, without pause she inflates the balloon and makes a dog.  Audience is cracking up until he turns around and realizes she did it.  She could have been a plant, but the trick stalled out at that point and he just moved on from there- never saw how it was supposed to end.  So I think it was unplanned. 
I was in Vegas and watched a street magician ask a group of 3 incredibly shithammered drunk girls if he could perform a magic trick. One of the girls screams "Sure! Lemme just-" and immediately throws up in her friend's purse.  
Well, this might sound strange. I was told it was magic night at the club by a couple of my female friends. I thought it sounded cool. They insisted that I wouldn't want to go. I told them I would, and said I practice a little bit at home. They looked intrigued, and so they brought me.  Before the main show started, they were looking for volunteers, so I put my hand up. He said, "Dude, it's probably not for you." I told him, "I have always wanted to get involved, so please pick me." So he did.  I got brought out to the middle of the stage, and sat down on the chair. From here I noticed that the crowd was mostly women. That's when the music hit, and I looked over my shoulder to see what was happening behind me. There was a half naked fireman coming out.  Turns out it was Magic Mike night. It was full of male strippers. So... I just played it cool. 
In the audience for a stage hypnotist.  My friend was called up, along with a random woman.  Hypnotist did his routine and told her my friend was her boyfriend and that he had cheated on her.  Before the hypnotist could stop her, she slapped my friend across the face, hard.  Hard enough to make him stumble and nearly fall over, and he's a stocky guy close to 200lbs.  They moved on to the next part of the act very quickly, and my friend was sent back to the audience with a massive red mark on his face. 
Audience member at a hypnotist comedy show here:  A lady was brought on stage and hypnotized and convinced that a handful of napkins were $100 bills.  She was told that people would try to steal them, so she should hide them in the best place possible.  I think the hypnotist expected to get a laugh with people stuffing them in their bra or underwear.  Not this lady, though.  She took her shirt off, exposed her breasts to a room full of about 100 people, tucked the napkins under her tits, then pulled her bra back down.  I've studied up a bit on hypnotism, and I learned that most people won't do things that are out of character under hypnotism.  For instance, you can't convince someone to murder if they're not a murderer or smoke a cigarette if they're not a smoker.  So I'd guess this woman had no problem taking her tits out on stage.  But it happened. 
I'm not a magician, but I do remember the time a magician came to our school when I was in Kindergarten as part of a big assembly of some sorts.  I was called up and he had a bunch of rings with me and a few other kids having two rings each. He said that if we rubbed the rings hard enough together, they would magically interlink with each other.  I couldn't get it to work until I noticed there were clips on it. The magician walked over and noticed I was having troubles and tried to help me. He had the microphone in his one hand, and it was close enough that when I asked what the clips on the rings were for, it could be heard all over the gym.  I don't remember what happened next except I was rushed off the gym floor back into the bleachers. 
I've had a volunteer, when asked to pick an even number pick 11- in complete seriousness. I even asked her if she wanted to to change "you can think of another EVEN number if you want", but she was adamant with number 11. I just looked at the audience and smiled the smile you put on when you know you're screwed.  
We're at an outdoor mall gathered around two street magicians.  It was time to do some sword swallowing so they ask for a volunteer and randomly happened to pick my cousin (she was in her late 20's at the time.)  She walks up and is asked by the man of magic to make sure that the sword is real.  She gives it an inquisitive look, inspecting it from top to bottom, and then immediately starts smashing it on the ground as if she was trying to slay a concrete monster.  The magic man rapidly snatches the sword from her, which is now clearly damaged with a collection of jagged edges.  He's hesitant.  Doesn't really know how to respond, but being the showman he is, proceeds to swallow the sword as promised.  People cheer while I ponder whether he is bleeding internally.  When I asked her wtf she was thinking, she replied "I proved it was real, didn't I?" 
The trick is never calling someone who is a real volunteer.  
Most serious magicians, of the sort that do like Vegas shows and such, use assistants planted in the audience to avoid this sort of thing.  Even if the trick works with a real audience member, you always risk getting that one asshat who tries to troll the magician by intentionally sabotaging the trick.  E: Also, it helps to have at least one person out there that knows to save you from an awkward moment by raising their hand if no one else does. 
So I was performing to these two young kids with their mom, and the mom went to get a drink. So I was performing for these two kids, probably around 8 years old or so. Anyways, I was just doing a simpler trick where they pick a card, I reveal a card, but it's not theirs, and then it "magically" changes into their card. So I did it, and neither said anything, then one of them started crying, which made the other start crying. Now they're just bawling their eyes out, and the mom comes back and she sees them and starts reeling into me like "what did you do?!?!" then she shuffled the kids away.  tl;dr oops 
This probably isn't the right place but how do you go to a magic show and just enjoy it without being called up on stage?  I've been called up every time and I hate being in front of people like that.  I tried looking away but obviously that makes the person focus on you more and then they pick you out of the crowd.  The next time I looked directly at him so he probably thought I WANTED to be picked.  It's a terrible problem I have. 
People don't bother me, I don't mind if someone cuts me off in traffic. I am pretty calm and typically, a non-panicy type of person.   However, I know for sure that on the inside I don't have **ANY** of my shit together. Its just that those around me count on me so having a stable mind and an overall content personality keeps them at ease. 
I have calves of steel and can hike up mountains with no leg fatigue 
I'm a big self doubter but I still try things anyway. And I usually succeed at things when I try. Feel the fear and do it anyway type shit.  
I have a very shitty memory for feelings, so I tend to get over things that make me unhappy very quickly. As a result, I'm naturally very happy-go-lucky, optimistic, and bounce back from setbacks quite easily. 
I look better wearing glasses. Kinda "egh" without them, though.    
I can ignore responsibility and the stress associated with it, at will....  
The fact that as a grown man, I treat kids with respect  and always behave around them like I would have wanted adults to be when I was little. 
I can fall asleep within 5 seconds of lying in bed. 
I'm currently 70lbs down from 263lbs, only 20 more to go :) 
I'm a very kind person. Even the people who don't like me say that. Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps me going. 
I don't know if I could pick one favorite thing. It's either my abs, my ten inch cock, or my impeccable ability of lying.  
I take time to consider all sides of every situation before responding / reacting.  
I had a brain tumor when I was 18. I wasn't expected to survive without major side effects like having one side of my body paralyzed.     I survived just fine. 20 years on and life is amazing. My favorite thing about myself is that I appreciate every small thing, every refreshing sip of water, every bit of food, every ray of sunshine warming my skin, every comfortable chair, every quiet morning in bed, every kiss from my dog, every little thing. I'm so happy to be alive.  
I'm a damn animal magnet. They fucking love me. I'm a natural and can read them. I don't try to make a cat come to me before he is ready and I don't try to force an excited dog to calm down. I do it their way, and they flock to me. Little kids and old people too. I don't even have kids but my wife tells me it's because I talk to them with sincere interest like they are little adults. And I do not speak to even the most elderly person with condescension like they are "cute."   Animals, children, and old people. They all love me and it all comes naturally. It's my favorite thing about me. 
My favorite thing about myself is also my least favorite thing...  I always put other people first. I consider their wants, needs, happiness light years before I'll think of my own. I would literally do anything for someone I care about - even if I don't know them well. It makes me feel good to see other people happy.   But - it is also my least favorite thing. I often end up hurting myself by putting others before me. I make decisions in my life that benefit other people but cause me harm - physical or emotional. I am taken advantage of quite frequently...and that sucks.   I love too easily and I sacrifice too readily...but I'm a kind person with good intentions and I can't say I'd rather be any other way. Even if it causes me harm - I'm glad for what I can do for those I love.  
My calves. Genetically blessed with large calves. It makes me feel good because a lot of guys have really small ones 
My motivation, drive, and willpower.  I'm the only person in my family to go to college and moved out of my house at 17 to do so. I'm studying Computer Science and Electrical Engineering and have a GPA decent enough to be part of the top of my class.  I've got my shit together and it feels great. When you're motivated, you can do a lot. 
I'm highly empathetic and in tune with other people's emotions. I can "feel" when something is wrong, when someone is being dishonest, or when someone wants to say something but can't. I sometimes feel uncomfortable that I can understand why people to really fucked up things (even though I don't agree with it), but I believe that it has a purpose. I just graduated and am beginning my first job as a therapist so I  believe my empathy is my purpose in this crazy world. 
I am not a talkative person. My friends know about it and tell me their secrets without forcing me to reveal mine. I know quite a bunch of things about my friends that other people in the group don't. 
I'm really motivated to get things that I want done.  From work to my personal life I've been able to set goals and work hard towards them.  Being driven in all my ventures increases the success of each as well.  Success at my job helps me afford my hobbies like funding custom rubber ducky porn, which then gives me more content for my montages and gifs. 
I used to be a very timid and insecure person, who never wanted to be pushed out of my comfort zone.  Now I continually push myself to do things that scare the crap out of me, or things that I don't think I can accomplish. It stresses me out like crazy, but every time I succeed in something, it makes me feel a little bit stronger. 
I like that I'm compassionate and not just for close friends and family. I recently saw a girl crying in the mall in passing and asked her what was wrong. She mentioned getting into an argument with her boyfriend and he left her there. I offered her cab money but she said he was on his way back. She probably thought I was crazy lol, but I mean you have to be having a pretty shitty day to be openly crying through the mall. I figured I could try and help. 
There's a bunch!  My best is my belief in myself. My first boyfriend whistled at a girl as we were crossing the street and I ignored him. He ran up to me and asked "what I was going to do about it?" I said "nothing, if you don't want to be with me, you can leave". We weren't together much longer than that for a multitude of reasons.  I'm nothing special looks-wise, and I've struggled with confidence issues in the past. But there's an untapped store of "nah, fuck that" in me that I love.   Other things I love include my mental and physical ability to adapt - within reason - and my ability to embrace a natural high. 
That im fairly smart but still manage to be the dumbest person in the world 
I seem to have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Learning new information is just so satisfying to me for some reason 
3 things as well actually:   -My skin is great. It stays blemish-free, rosy, and regulates itself with just the right amount of sebum to make it look dewy (but not oily) at all times. It's never temperamental; I don't really take care of it beyond using a basic cleanser and SPF-containing moisturizer  -I am always above average academically, partly due to Asian parents. I'm in med school currently; so, I'm proud of that, I guess?   -One of the cutest guys in my university HAD a crush on me before. We are now just best friends, and he is still popular with the girls, but he's glued to me for now, and I'm proud to have him :) 
I am proud to have never taken a drag off of a cigarette or done any illegal drugs. 
I can take an alarming amount of drugs without passing out  
Not someone with a favorite, but I'll tell you my least favorite:  I have an inferiority complex. And I'm not very good at it.  
Her current one, but they've been dating for years.  He's just a quiet, hard working guy that keeps to his own.  He likes comics, too, so he can't be all bad.  
My daughter is currently living with her boyfriend, and he's the nicest guy she's ever dated. He's 5 years older than her, and works for a bank as a programmer and software analyst. He's 27, and makes slightly more than I do at 55. He studies Philosophy, and wants to teach. He's unfailingly polite, and clearly adores my daughter. He stuck with her through a health crisis that lasted months. We just got back from a week in Orlando with the whole family and the boyfriend, and he was good company the whole time. He shares my terror of heights and wild rollercoasters, so he & I spent some time talking while the rest of the family rode coasters at Universal. The day we went to SeaWorld, he stayed behind and cleaned the condo, washed dishes, and did laundry. We have decided he's definitely son-in-law material.  Thank you for the Gold, Kind Person! My first Gold ever! 
I'm the daughter in question, but it is obvious that my current SO is my dad's favorite, and the reason why is very clear: he brought a BB8 robot when he first met my family at my college graduation, so that he could better connect with my autistic brother. Now, whenever we visit my family, my brother will talk to him for hours about interests he usually only shares with family. Most recently, my SO sat with him for 2 hours at a wedding reception just talking about Pokemon.  He's obviously an introvert, and can get overwhelmed by social situations, but at every turn he has made it clear that he cares about me, and that he sees caring for and being kind to my family as a natural extension of that. Also, he's a programmer, and my dad is a programmer, that helps. 
After my boyfriend met my dad for the first time, we drove him home and on the way there we stopped at a McDonald's. Both my dad and I are coffee drinkers, and my dad likes his exceptionally sweet. I always get a bit embarrassed when others see him pouring literally 15 sachets into a small cappucino cup, so I apologised to my boyfriend out of habit. My boyfriend responds with "he needs all that sugar because he's a sweet man!". Needless to say, my dad is very fond of him! 
Parents, make sure you get to know the boy rather than judging him on superficial impressions. My parents loved my football-player boyfriend who was gregarious and outgoing. They were chilly toward a later boyfriend who was nerdy, socially awkward and reserved. Turns out the football player talked trash about me on the school bus and tried to pressure me into sex before I was ready. The nerd married me and twenty years later we have two beautiful children and a wonderful life together.  
When my daughter was 4 or 5, she was wearing a Pisces shirt with the 2 fish on it kissing. I scooped her up fork-lift style and she started flopping around like a fish out of water. Her nickname Audrey-fish was born.   Fast-forward 11 years and she started dating a kid who was in her inner circle of friends. He was no looker, but he had a strong moral compass, was active in the school, sports, and scouts. He joined the cheer team for her. They became more and more serious, continuing to date while attending different colleges (2 hour drive). It was beginning to look like they might eventually marry. Then he broke it off.    His last name . . . Fish 
not father but elder brother. polite, well mannered, well read. makes my sister learn about things and they do very interesting things together.  he's moving away now and I feel bad cause it's hard coming across guys like this. 
I came here to learn more methods on how to impress my girl's dad. Only to see a bunch of people with kids below 10, people who are not dads and some guy who had a hot dog for dinner.    
I won over my wifes dad. He came home after the bar way back when my wife and i were 17 and 18. He gave the old thousand yard stare and "what are your intentions" etc. I said I was going to marry her. He yelled "no little punk like you has the balls to marry my daughter".   At the reception of our wedding 4 years later, I leaned to him and said "not bad for a little punk with no balls huh?".   He laughed and slapped me on the back. Been really good ever since.  
I'm the boyfriend that the girlfriends family seem to want to stay in touch with even after we've broken up.  So I guess i'm the favourite. 
Not a dad but a boyfriend, I had a girl's dad pull me to the side and gave me $100 and said "Your the first boy she has brought home that isn't a piece of shit good job." Dude was cool as fuck. I'd sleep over and wake up to him putting rainedx on my car and changing my windshield wipers. It was weird how much he wanted me to marry her.   He kicked her out when he found out she cheated on me. 
Not a dad but a daughter, my dad told me he loved my SO because he "looked at me as if I had hung the moon". He figured if a 21 year old guy could look at his daughter with such a mix of respect and pride that had an effect on him, then he was good enough. 
My daughter is still a teen and her boyfriends have not been serious yet.  I don't have a favorite, but my least-favorite is the one who was too intimidated to speak to me or my wife.  And, it bothered my daughter too, so it wasn't just us old parents being weird. 
My 4 year old daughter recently confessed, very shyly, that she has a crush on Link. She came to this conclusion after watching me play a lot of Breath of the Wild.        So I guess it's the whole "saving the world" thing that makes him stand out. 
My 6 year old daughter has informed me that she is going to marry a boy from her class. I told her we'll just have to wait and see. I even recorded her prediction to share with her later. Nice kid though. I hope I don't have to break his legs some day. 
The grotesque looser neckbeard that stalked her online since she was a teenager and convinced her to move 3500 miles away to some BFE backwoods town when she was 19.   He's an idiot and she's even more stupid for making such poor life choices, but I finally got my office, so winning. 
One time, my family and I had my daughter's boyfriend over for dinner, and he pretended that he did not know what a potato was. 
The most important thing you need to know is that "Dad" was once in your shoes (most likely).   We're all a bunch of damned hypocrites - we want our daughters to behave the exact opposite of how we once wanted our girlfriends to behave. And we want their boyfriends to do the exact opposite of what we did at their age.   my little girl is a toddler and I've already started the indoctrination process... she's not allowed to date until after college. Just ask her and she'll tell you. But O.M.G. - if karma is a real thing I am FUCKED... and she will be too.  
My daughter is 4 if she has a boyfriend I'm going to burn him at the stake.  
My step daughter usually has long distance relationships she makes online through games. I like her current girlfriend. She seems to always be there for her when she needs someone to chat with... 
Simple thing that I do when I have to meet a the parent of my girlfriend for the first time, ask her about them, dress decently (wearing your "I like big butts' T-shirt is probably not a good idea), be polite and respectful. That's about it 
I'm actually a teenage girl, but here are my suggestions:  Unless the dad is super protective, the mom's opinion will matter more  Actually talk to her parents  Hopefully if her parents are decent people they will just be happy their daughter is happy  If you are invited to dinner bring like a salad or side dish (parents like people being considerate), at least the first time  If you're girlfriend has dated before ask her what to expect. 
The great rebuilding. AKA you should have done this years ago...idiot.

32: Crippling insecurities and how they ruin everything. 
Filler chapter about spending the summer looking for a girlfriend and failing miserably  
Parents manipulating their children to depend on them more then they need to. 
Social isolation. It's also usually a precursor to worse forms of abuse  
Financial stuff Both my parents worked making similar money but my dad controlled it all. Mom would sneak to thrift stores with cash after work to buy us clothes, shoes, other essentials. If my dad found out he would fread out about how we were about to be homeless. I was under the impression we were gonna be on the streets anyday until I was 10 or so.  Combined my parents made close to 150k a year. We were never close to be homeless.   
When someone consistently undermines your interests and goals and mocks you for them. 
Rage driving. Intentionally driving fast/wrecklessly to frighten passengers. 
Making fun of one person in your group of friend constantly. Everyone talks about abuse from bf/gf or family, but rarely mentions that friends can do just as well.  
When parents tell their kids you all need more friends, but never allow them to hang out with such said people, then continuing to urge them to get more friends 
Children being asked to choose between their parents ot being asked to judge which parent is right in a quarrel.  
Controlling and manipulating someone through money. My step-grandpa made sure to put everything in his name after he married my grandma, including bills. He was so controlling that eventually she didn't know how to pay bills anymore since she was never aware of what was happening with their money. She could never leave him because if she did she wouldn't have anything to her name or even know how to take care of herself financially if she did. 
Keeping someone from going to sleep (the whole spectrum of just talking to them so they can't go to sleep to taking away blankets and physically keeping someone awake) 
Constantly undermining someone or second guessing someone. My mother does this on a regular basis about big, small or totally irrelevant stuff. At first I didn't think much of it but after a long time it started to make me not be able to make decisions properly because I was always told my decisions were wrong. It took a lot of time to come to the conclusion that even if my decisions are wrong, they're MY decisions and I'm learning from my own mistakes.  
When your manager keeps asking you to do "extra favors" on your own time (without pay), such as:  Picking up his dry cleaning on your way to work or getting the take-out lunch he ordered from a restaurant while you're on your own lunch break. 
Sabotaging birth control against a partner's will. If your s/o doesn't consent to having a baby, that's extremely abusive, whether it's poking holes in a condom or not taking birth control intentionally..  
I'd probably go with "institutional abuse". I used to work in various care settings and it happened all the time. I'm not referring to things like violence or shouting, I mean things like people asking "can I please have a cup of coffee?" only to be told "no, coffee time is at 3 o'clock"... or "can you please unlock this room so I can take a shower?" and then being told "no, I'm too busy right now". These may seem like minor things but they mean everything if you're being held somewhere 24 hours a day for an extended period of time.  It happens every day all over the world but it's something that's almost never talked about. 
Religious/Spiritual abuse. Yes, emotional, physical and/or sexual abuse are part of it this type of abuse. I am talking about a cultish / strict religious upbringing,that "fear of God" culture that steals faith or any spirituality from a person.  
A SO trying to dictate who you can and can't be friends with. 
Spending money on someone when it was not asked for  My stepmom is like this.  I did not ask her to buy m furniture.  She shows up at my apartment with a Rooms to go truck, knowing full well that I just bought new furniture.  She was livid by my "I didn't know you were going to do that" reaction  She still, to this day, holds it over my head.  I'm ungrateful because she spent thousands on new furniture that I never asked for.  People take her side because they don't know her behind closed doors.  
Extream pranking. Doing something distasteful and saying its a prank bro look at the camera  
Same sex abuse. Hetro couples abusing each other is known and actions are taken to stop it. Homosexual couples rarely get heard when their partner starts hitting them. 
Verbal abuse. Degrading and demeaning comments in passing. I'm sure everyone would agree it's abuse but this happens a lot more than is called out. 
Forcing kids to hug grown-ups even though they clearly don't want to.  
Financial abuse. It comes in many forms and is often mixed with emotional abuse. If you have a stay at home spouse your home environment, your lifestyle wouldn't be possible without their support. They are entitled to the standard of living made possible by their hard work just as much as yours.   Financial abuse includes things like, only letting them have enough gas money to run errands so you know they aren't doing anything outside the house behind your back.   Family court might be outdated, but the original premise of allimony was to stop one spouse from preventing the other from escaping an abusive relationship by forcing them into destitute poverty.   
"tough love". a lot of the time it's just a flowery term for abusive behaviour. it's rarely positive. like.. intervention for an alcoholic would be positive tough love. but putting someone down constantly to 'toughen them up' is not ok. 
Animal abuse, hardly anywhere in the world has jail time for killing or injuring an animal on purpose. There are people out there posting videos of them mutilating animals yet they will never be prosecuted for what the have done to a living animal.  
Emotional/Psychological abuse.  Been there, got out. Currently doing my college thesis project about it. 
Prescribing ADD/ADHD medications to children who don't actually suffer from these conditions.   These medications are potent and come with side effects and, according to some research, permanent consequences such as eye tremors and poor motor skills. These effects may be worth it for a child who truly needs the treatment and could not otherwise lead a normal life, but giving them to children because parents and teachers just don't want to deal with a "difficult" or energetic child is abusive.  I've seen a significant increase in family law cases involving these medications (one parent wants the meds, the other does not) and the described symptoms these kids are suffering is heartbreaking. 
Teacher making you hold it in until the lesson is over. Made me hate learning, and now all I care about is lifting /r/ForeverChest 
Becoming more recognized, but women physically abusing men is often glossed over.  
Not letting your partner have friends of the sex they are interested in 
"You'd be nothing without me." "If you break up with me, I'll kill myself." Constant negging, especially when it's female on male. More attention needs to be raised about both female on male abuse and emotional abuse, because they're both incredibly dangerous. 
Competence  It seems like everyone suffers from Impostor Syndrome but in reality a lot of people are good at their jobs and know it. 
SO is a psychologist.  Sadness. It's OK to feel sad, even for a couple days. Sometimes life sucks for whatever reason. There is no imperative to feel happy all the goddamn time. 
Question. I have a tendency to do this thing in high stress situations where it feels like my emotions turn off. Example. My SO struggles with depression and anxiety and she's come a very long way but whenever she has a break down and I'm attempting to comfort her...I don't feel bad for her or anything. Like I'm aware of how I should feel I guess but I just cannot. This isn't the only situation this occurs, just the freshest in my mind. It frustrates me after the fact but like all my emotions shut off. I used to feel sympathy during a breakdown and I love her to death so I feel guilty about it. We have talked about it but it seems like I can't make my self not shut down in the moment. 
This is very true with people with anxiety. But the idea that you are crazy or going crazy. A lot of people think that since they can't stop their thoughts and emotions that they must have all these terrible mental diseases and people will think they're crazy, if they don't already believe they are. I went through this, and almost everyone in my group counseling felt the same way in one degree or another. Always just remember that your thoughts and emotions during those moments are not you, and any decent person will understand and not judge you for them. 
Having to take care of a chronically sick person, child, parent, etc.  Wishing that they pass away. 
I'm guessing this is probably more widely known, but self-destructive thoughts/urges, like taking a step off a cliff when you're standing on it, known as 'The Call of the Void'. 
Any 'negative' emotion for that matter. It's absolutely ok to be jealous.     Sometimes, this leads to something called as meta worry. I worry that I am jealous of someone. I worry that I worry too much.  No emotion, by itself can be classified as negative or positive, since almost all emotions have got an evolutionary reason to exist. It's the intensity and the behavioral manifestations of emotions that make them adaptive or maladaptive. 
Intrusive thoughts (e.g. "I could totally kill this person right now," "I don't love my S.O. anymore," etc.). Not a psychologist, but I have OCD and in all of my research it's been astounding to realize that nearly everybody has these thoughts; the difference is, people without OCD can usually move past them. An OCD-wired brain is more likely to stay fixated on these thoughts, which is why we sometimes think we're the only people to experience these types of distressing thoughts.  If you have thoughts that don't seem like they're coming from your own brain - you aren't alone! It's how you react to them that counts. 
Is it normal to have conversations with a person who isn't there? I've done it since I was little. 
You are good enough.  Corporations make a lot more money from people with lower self-esteem and or low self-worth. So many companies are selling products or services that implicitly promise that whatever commodity you are going to buy from them will make it all better. Next time you see an ad, watch it more critically and see what are they really trying to convey? You are good enough.  
Question: Does anyone else constantly get that feeling that their work isn't just right, or is really bad, even when everyone thinks it's okay? Or the feeling that you need to perfect each sentence before moving on, constantly revising, deleting, and editing a single paragraph? 
I have a vivid imagination and make up scenarios (whole worlds in fact) in my head, even play them out sometimes.  I often wondered if it meant I was crazy, but it turns out almost everyone does it and it's normal - even healthy. 
Not a psychologist, but The Truman Show Delusion  A lot of people, in one way or another, feel like their lives are staged and those around them are acting to preserve their false reality. It is a form of delusion and narcissism  Sometimes, I do too... 
Social Worker here.  I'd have to say the feeling of having nobody to go to.  For some, this is a legitimate concern, as most of their friends/families/etc are enablers to bad behaviors that they are trying to fix, and they haven't re-established new friends yet.    What I usually tell them to do is make newer, healthier relationships.   
Most people think they have above average intelligence. 
My wife is currently on day 4 of a psychiatric stay at a hospital - I don't have much to add to the topic, but this thread is very helpful for me to read.   Thank you to everybody contributing.  
Psychologist here! But probably not the type of psychologist you meant, I study cognition.  It's totally normal to feel the position of your body parts in space. It's called proprioception and it's really important for how your brain plans out movements.   But most people don't really think about it. (Also you forgot the [serious] tag) 
Not a psychologist but the answer has to be intrusive thoughts.   
I have flashbacks to negative moments in my life. The worst day of my life was several years ago, and until recently (about six months ago) I had intense flashbacks to that moment. I would remember it in detail and it felt like I was there in that moment again. Is that normal? 
Not a psychologist, but one thing a LOT of people have (if not everyone, just some won't admit it) is Imposter Syndrome. This is the idea that no matter where you are in life in your career or what not, even if you're successful, you feel like you're a fraud who faked their way to where they are and everyone is going to call you out on it.  
Not a psychologist, but the daily realisation that your latent superpowers still haven't activated. 
"Can you say your alphabet to J for me?"  "Which one of you dudes is Jay?" 
I just picked up my paycheck back in high school, must have been 16/17 and a fairly new driver.   Officer pulled me over for not pulling completely into the road going from drive way to drive way (like I drove 10 feet on the wrong side, but there was no traffic.  Officer: "Can you afford a ticket as a new driver?" Dumbass me: "I did just pick up my paycheck"   It wasn't till afterwards that I thought more along the lines of having the demerit or points on my license is more than likely what he meant. Let me go with a warning. 
We were in a car park just off the motorway in a Toyota MR2. Police pulled in and got out their car. One of the officers put his hand on the bonnet (hood) of the MR2 and said "bonnet's a bit hot...been ragging it have we?". I replied "funny that mate, it's rear engine". The second officer found it hilarious, the first looked incredibly embarrassed. 
I was waiting to buy something at a store, but there was no one behind the cash register.  There was already a lady in line in front of me who seemed to have been waiting for a while. We rang the little bell a couple of times, but no one appeared.  After waiting some time, I joked "We should just steal this stuff, that will get their attention."  The lady in front of me responded by showing me her drycleaning bag: full of police uniforms.   So I said the first thing that came to mind: "You have to get your uniforms dry cleaned?? Does that get expensive?"  And we ended up having a cheerful conversation about dress codes and employee perks and the laundry facilities in different neighbourhood apartment buildings and the turnaround time of different neighbourhood drycleaners until the cashier finally showed up. 
Got pulled over on my motorcycle:   Cop: do you know why I pulled you over?  Me: cause I wasn't wearing my seatbelt?  He got a chuckle and I only got a warning, next cop didn't find it nearly as amusing  
Cop: Were you eating an apple while driving?  Me: Can't I eat while I drive?  Cop: No  Me: But I can smoke  Cop: Yes  Me: Then I was smoking the apple. 
I work nights so the cops will occasionally cruise through our parking lot in the middle of nowhere and just check things out. I was outside on my break smoking and playing Jetpack Joyride when they lowered their window.   "What are you doing here at this time of night?"   "My fucking job. What are you doing here at this time of night? "   "Our fucking jobs. Have a nice night"   "You too"   Montreal cops are nice, despite their silly pants.  
He asked me if I had a dead body in my back seat, I said "Oh! Totally. You wanna meet him? He's kinda shy".     He laughed. Told his partner "he said totally."       Took my license, sat in their car for a minute, then drove up next to me, handed me my cards from their window, and drove off.    I later realized that a coat and hat were on top of a mess in my backseat and actually could have looked like a dead body.  
Cop pulled me and my friend over when we were both 17. Pretty sure he just saw a couple of teens in a car late at night and fogured we were up to no good. That being said we had a lot of weed in the car (in a bag). Cop comes over and is like "soooo you have anything illegal in the car?"  "Just my good looks" i reply. Cop laughs and lets us leave. My heart just about gave out it was beating so fast 
He told me how much over the limit I was going and I said well you looked bored sitting there so I figured I'd give you something to do. Laughed and let me off the whole thing with a warning  
Pulled over for speeding and when the cop asked why I was pulled over I responded with "well if you don't know I'm sure as hell not gonna tell you"  I do have to admit this was a guy I knew as my dad was a firefighter and they shared the same station. 
Got pulled over and the cop asked me if I had any weapons in the car. I had a hacksaw sitting in the passenger footwell. He asked me why I had it and deadpan I said 'To cut up dead chicks.' This keep in mind was at like 3 am. He laughed as told me to go home 
I was flying back from Europe once - at the Brussels airport I bought a jar of mustard in duty free, they sealed it in the special bag.  Put it in my carry-on.  Get it through customs no problem.  Bringing it back through TSA in the US - at a major international airport it gets confiscated.  It is in a sealed jar, in a sealed bag, having clearly been bought at an airport and just brought through an international border - TSA guy confiscates it.  Told him to keep saving the country one jar of mustard at a time 
In college once thanked a cop for "not being a dickhead about it, you know, like most officers are" after getting ticketed. He wrote it all down and the judge repeated that to me when I fought the ticket in court. She was clearly amused and I got out of the ticket.  
Years ago, during a heavy drug fuelled bender at a London festival, I walked up to some policemen and said "Guess what I'm on!"; they smirked and told me to move on.  
Friend got pulled over doing about 20 over, we were college kids at the time. Officer walks over to the window does his normal "do you know why I pulled you over?" Routine and than turns to me when it's all done and asks "so should I give your friend here a ticket?", with a smile I said "yes sir, he most likely deserves it."  Cop laughed, smiled and walked away.  
My birthday three years ago.  I was crossing the street to my car and suddenly two squad cars pulled up, each with two officers in them for some reason. As I was unlocking my car, all four got out of their cars and approached me. One of them asked me to please stop and walk over to them. I did. Then he asked if I knew why they were stopping me, to which I replied "I'm assuming you are strippers."  "Excuse me?"  "Yes, you must be strippers. It's my birthday and four suspiciously good-looking police officers just stopped me for absolutely no reason."  Three laughed, one did not. I then had to wait for 10 minutes while he wrote me a warning for jaywalking.  
My brother and I, both underage, both VERY drunk, walking home with a dozen donuts and the remains of a six-pack when the cops saw us mostly stumbling along the main road.  They pulled around behind us, and scared the pants off us with the siren.  One cop got out of the car, and asked us where were were going.  We offered him our donuts.  He took our beer.   Joke was on him, it was Bud Light.  They left us to continue our own way home.  Don't think we'd get away with that today. 
Yelling at a cop for calling me 'jack sparrow' instead of 'captain jack sparrow'. Whilst heavily intoxicated and dressed as Captain Jack Sparrow. 
"Did you see the speed limit sign?"  "Yes'sir. I just didn't see you sitting behind it."    I'll never forget how hard he scrunched his face up trying not to laugh. 
Not me, but I was there for the smart ass remark.  When I was 18, a friend of mine and I stepped out of a restaurant to have a cigarette. We were in the parking lot smoking when a cop pulls up. We weren't doing anything illegal, so we kept doing what we were doing. He walks up to us and asks what we were doing. We tell him, but he doesn't believe us because "there were reports of cars getting broken into" (which I doubt). He decides to search us. We should have resisted but didn't know any better at the time. He pulls a brown paper bag out of my friend's pocket, and with a smirk on his face, he asks, "What am I going to find in here?"  My friend is straight faces and says, "It's the emancipation proclamation." To which the cop gives a "yeah right" face.  Turns out it actually WAS a copy of the emancipation proclamation. He had been to the history museum that day and got a tiny copy as a souvenir.  The cop didn't say anything, just handed back the bag and got in his car. 
was exiting the beer tent at a local summer festival.  There was 2 county Sherrifs guarding the entrance/exit at the time.  Drunk me walks up to one and say " To protect and serve, right?!"  he replies, "yessir"  again, drunk me says: "Well you can serve me by protecting this beer.  I'll be right back".   Then i set the beer on the ground near his feet while I went to use the port-a-john (bathroom).  I came back and my beer was still there, untouched.  Officer did his job. 
A party got busted when I was in college. A majority of the attendees were underage. The cocky campus policeman walked up and said "well well well, looks like we're going to be checking IDs and handing out underages tonight." Immediately after saying this, his 19 year old daughter walked out. I was sitting on the porch and said "still want those IDs?"  
Them:  You were driving 20 miles below the speed limit.  Me: Yes Them: Why? Me: A cop was following me.  
Got pulled up very for wearing headphones as a hands free device. Apparently doing that is illegal in PA, he said it was because then you can't hear sirens so I replied "then why can deaf people get drivers licenses?"  
I tried to call the police to report a crime but it was not an emergency. A guy was walking around my neighborhood, obviously casing houses. I called the police department after hours and couldn't get ahold of anyone. I passed a cop while driving and sped passed him so that he would pull me over. When he said "Do you know why I pulled you over?" I said "Yeah because I wanted you to so I could actually talk to an officer". He went and found the guy, and arrested him because he had a warrant out on him. 
I was riding my motorcycle away from the traffic lights at a speed allowed in the area. Admittedly my engine revved rather loud.  Police officer "I have stopped you for speeding" Me: " I wasn't speeding?" Police officer "I could tell by the sound of our engine you were speeding" Me " that's absurd, are you trying to tell me you can tell what speed something is going by the noise" Police officer "yes" Me: "ok, *pointed at plane flying overhead* what's speeds that going then"  No ticket, but he wasn't very amused.   
I offered the officer a doughnut from the box on my front seat when he pulled me over (due to a burned-out tail light).  He took 2, and gave me a "warning" to get it fixed a.s.a.p.. 
I was pulled over a few years ago while driving 90+ MPH on a highway where the speed limit was 55. Cop pulls me over, walks up to my window and asks for license, insurance and registration. After I hand over my information he asks if I knew how fast I was traveling. I responded with "I don't know... 90?". He then asks me if I knew what the speed limit on Woodhaven road was. I responded with "I don't know... Not 90..." The officer thanked me for my honesty and let me off with a warning. I feel like I was kind of being a smart ass because I was going to get a ticket anyway but turns out I was just being honest. 
The same year I got my licence (17), I noticed that a cop car that was driving around town had one of the front lights missing. So I turned around, and flashed my high beams at him and he pulled over. I then went out of my car, walked up to him and asked him if he knew his light was out. He got out to check and thanked me for letting him know.   Not really a big deal, but pulling a cop over because his light was out must give some badass points? 
I was leaving work late on a Friday night and got pulled over for a random breath test. The cop asked me if I'd been drinking and I said no. Asked where I'd been and I gave him the raised eyebrow and said work. Asked where I was that I was working so late so I just completely silently looked down at my uniform and name badge and back up at him with the "really?" face.  
16 years old, walking back to work from my lunch break, smoking a cigarette. Cop pulls up beside me, I walk up to his window. "Yes sir?" "You got a light?" Sure, pull out my Zippo, light his cigarette for him, brain telling me I'm underage and smoking so be cool, be cool, say something casual. So in my wisdom I say "I always light my bitches cigarettes." I immediately freeze, he just chuckles and drives off. 
My friend has a habit of being very dickish.... But technically right. It can come off as being a smart ass or asshole.  One time he was turning left on a Green arrow. The cop was turning right on red. My friend "cut him off" so the cop pulled him over.  And when he told my friend he cut him off my friend responded with, " I had a Green arrow."  The cop immediately said, "well I was turning right so I had the right of way."  Which my friend said, "well, if we both had the right of way the system kind of breaks down, doesn't it?"  The cop immediately realized he himself was wrong and issued a warning of "we'll make sure you are paying attention."    
I always call an officer by his name but always pronounce it a little wrong. The best one was when I called Officer Smith, Officer Sith. He kept telling me to pronounce it correctly and I happily obliged to Mr Sith. He was so fed up with my tiny bit of smartassery that he told me, and I quote, "You're really startin to piss me off son. Get the fuck out of here before I have a stroke" No ticket for speeding. For the record, this is something you really shouldn't do because this isn't meant to get out of anything but it sure as hell is fun. 
Was driving on the highway and my state has this "keep right except to pass" rules. Feeling adventurous and with no cars around me for a couple of miles (it was around 3 am) I kept driving in the left lane. Cop car is parked a couple of miles down the road and hits his lights as soon as I pass. Here is what happened...  Me: Hello Officer  Cop: License and registration.  *Hands information to cop*  Cop: Do you know why I pulled you over?  Me: Speeding?  Cop: You were driving in the left lane. You must stay in the right lane except to pass.  Me: I passed you didn't I?  Cop: What?  Me: Well I saw you parked a couple of miles ahead and I was heading toward you. So I technically passed you while in the left lane.  *Cop shoots angry glare and gives me a lecture on being a smartass*  He did give me a ticket for violating the rule, but I got that replaced with something less serious in court. I think he only have me the ticket out of spite. 
A cop asked me what was in my backpack and I said "that's where I keep my 4th, 5th, and 6th amendment rights" 
One time I was pulled over for speeding and my car smelled like weed. I had less than a gram so before he even searched my car I gave it over to him, as I always try to be cooperative and respectful. He searched the car anyways and found nothing else but was being a real dick, and eventually told me why don't you quit smoking pot and become a contributing member of society. Then asked where I was going and I told him I was on my way to my job tutoring inner city kids. Wasn't actually being a smart ass just it was nice to come up right after he said I was basically an asshole for smoking weed, and he seemed to respect that I did that and let me off with a warning for the speeding, but not before he made me throw my weed on the ground and grind it into the pavement with my foot.  
TL,DR; Just because a cop sees you doing something stupid doesn't mean they can do anything about it unless it is on some sort of record.  One time, I was doing 95 in a 45 and saw a cop turn around to come chase me. I quickly turned off the road to hide in a neighborhood. The officer found me and asked me what I was doing. I replied "stopped for a cigarette, I don't smoke in my car". He asked me why I was driving so fast and i replied "you know, I didn't get an opportunity to look at my speed. What did your radar say?" (there was no radar).    PSA: Don't be mean, but don't give anything away. 
"Which one of you two ass holes has your hand in his pocket of cash?!"  I said to the two cops who came over to my house when my ex husband was sitting in his car outside and my child was yet again refusing to go visit his abusive father for 50/50 custody.  They had previously jailed me for kidnapping for the same "offense".  My son was laying on the floor sobbing at the thought of going back to his dad's.  There were multiple court appointments to deal with this on-going strife.  They were there to take my kid to his dad's and I was having none of it because I was properly dealing with family court as ordered to do so by the judge.  They said, "No.  Nope.  None of us, ma'am.  We will tell your ex to go away.  Have a nice day."

This girl in college who was a sort of friend once drunkenly called me and left me a three-minute message confessing her crush on me. Then she did it again, but on the 2nd call, she tripped on something and started crying and eventually the recording was too long, so it stopped. 
A girl I knew in middle school stabbed two people with a pencil for talking about me behind my back. She was upset when I didn't thank her. 
I was her first kiss.  She was standing 5 feet away from me.  She puckered her lips like a duck, closed her eyes and blindly walked 5 feet to kiss me.  I could have met her half way....I didn't. 
When I finished my first date with my now wife, she was acting a bit awkward, well, more so than is usual for her.  She was smiling at me, touching my arm, but wouldn't do anything unless I brought it up because she was so shy.  Once I finished walking her back to her building, I asked "Do you mind if I kiss you?"  To which she said something between "Yes, please" and "uh-huh", kinda sounded like "Yuh hease".  Then, she went on her toes, was still too short, and kind of pressed her lips against my chin before turning beet red and started walking into her dorm.    Took me a second to process what happened before I started laughing, asked her to wait, and then leaned over a bit to give her an actual kiss.  Now she just throws a pillow at me whenever I bring it up at this point. 
There was a girl I used to know who always wanted to start a webcam chat. I didn't have a webcam, so she would just video call me so I could watch hers, except she wasn't really doing anything. It was just a stream of part of her face as she typed. Also, she'd get really offended if she video called me and I didn't accept, so I would usually just accept, minimize the window, and go on with whatever I was doing. 
A girl kept some of my hair in a box with photographs and illustrations of me about 2 weeks into our relationship.    My horror must have been embarrassing for her.   That was also the final week of our relationship. 
In high school a friend of a friend made me a build-a-bear that said " [my name] I love you, will you go out with me?" And presented it in front of our mutual friend groups. I was so shocked that I couldn't find the words to reply, so after a solid minute of stunned silence he trashed the bear, fled the school, and didn't come back that day-- still feel bad about it 10 years later :/ 
she told everyone that she was pregnant and it was mine.  she wasn't and knew she wasn't. 
Named her son after me (her military husband who was away on assignment was the father) 
She invited me for her birthday, but not her boyfriend. And she invited me an hour before anyone else 
Confess their interest in me in front of a crowd of people. I was embarrassed and not interested in them. But many people got angry at me for shutting her down. 
I broke up with a girl in year 7 at school after a 4 day relationship and she proceeded to tell the teacher and get them to tell me off for breaking up with her. They pulled me to one side and said 'I can see why you don't wanna be with her'  
She stalked me for several months in school...  I was walking to school one morning and got a text from her saying, "You look really good in that shirt." I looked around and couldn't find her ANYWHERE.  I replied, "Umm where are you?"  Her: "Don't worry about it"  
Back in high school I was partnered with this guy for a physics project. Really great guy, enjoyed his company a lot but wasn't interested in him romantically and he knew that.   We had to build a bridge out of some very lightweight wood that we had designed to be able to hold a certain amount or weight or something (can't quite remember the specifics of the project) and at the end we decided to cure the glue we'd used. He said he had it covered so I stayed in the other room texting or something while he put it in the oven.   20 minutes later the kitchen was smoking. Turns out he had put the bridge in with some chicken nuggets he was making us as a snack so i would stay longer and just hang out,  but he completely forgot about the bridge. The wood eventually caught on fire and we had to start the project from scratch. He was mortified. Best chicken nuggets I've ever had, though.  TL,DR: Try wood smoked chicken nuggets, they're delicious. 
I was dating this girl for like 1 month. We had a conversation about much we loved 'The Lion King'. It was playing in theaters at the time - Disney rereleased it in 3D (this is like 3 years ago). So we went to see it and had a great time. After the movie we bonded in our love for the character Scar.   The next weekend we made plans to hang out again. We were sitting in my basement and she told me she had a surprise for me. She sat on my lap with her back facing me and told me to lift up her shirt. I did, only to find that she went and got a fairly large tattoo of Scar from The Lion King. It was hideous. I was very freaked out. I knew it would make it harder to break up with her.     
Wrote me a long poem about the color of my beautiful brown eyes. My eyes are blue.  
I dated the most egocentric dude in all of New York. His dad is a famous musician, so he's lived a life of yes-men surrounding him and whatever toys he'd like... this has resulted in him believing without a shadow of a doubt that he is super talented at everything. Spoiler: he's not.     He knew I wasn't interested in him. I told him gently at first, then firmly, then flat out. I'm hanging out with my friends one night and he FaceTimes me... he had somehow clipped his phone onto his guitar really close to his face, and was live streaming his band practice at me singing directly into the guitar camera. It was a really bad angle, the music sounded terrible, his expression was just SO into himself, and I ended up ending the call after my friends got a good laugh because I felt such intense second hand embarrassment.  
In the 9th grade a guy who liked me wrote a note on a piece of paper and turned it into a paper airplane, which he then proceeded to throw at my head. It hit me in the eye. I had to go to the school nurse and wear an eye patch for part of the day. The answer was no. 
Second date, I went on a hike with a girl from work who was very into me, brought her a cup of coffee when I picked her up and brought subway sandwiches for lunch at the hiking destination. She had to pee a couple times while we were up there, which I didn't find weird at the time. Then she finally tells me "I had taco time last night and a coffee this morning before the coffee you got me, and my insides are CHURNING and I really have to go but I don't know what to do..." so I said hang on I'll ask someone for some TP, and I found some backpackers that graciously gave me a roll. She ran off in the woods and did her business while I watched her dog. Comes back and says "oh my god I've never been so embarrassed in my entire life," to which I responded "hey, shit happens." We are still together now two years later :) 
I had a girl let out a nervous fart the first time we showered together. She was extremely embarrassed and I was laughing my ass off.   Married her.  
Bought a motorbike to impress me (I was dating a biker at the time and I guess he thought it was the key to getting in my pants) needless to say it didn't work, he spent a ton of money on something he had no interest in. 
i have a couple:   messaged me repeatedly on every social media site possible and continued even when I'd open them and not answer. then tagged me in a meme that said "keep calm and love white girls"  asked to hang out with me repeatedly, I politely declined each time. after the like 4th time he offered to clean my house and cook for me while I napped just so he could be in the same vicinity as me.  went on a date with a guy on fourth of july once. the date went really well, and i let him come back to my apartment after. we were making out but i was on my period so kept stopping him trying to go any further, and eventually just flat out told him i was on my period. he said he didn't care because i was so hot and proceeded to rip my tampon out of my vagina. i asked him to leave after that.. 
I'm on the other end of this one.   I asked out one girl at work.  It was a dept. store, she worked clothing, I was in toys that night.    We were recovering the store late during the Christmas season, way after closing time.   I had NHL tickets, and had overheard she was a fan, so I invited her out for dinner and the game.  She laughed out loud in my face so hard she got the attention of all the other workers in the area.  I'm introverted by nature, and it took a lot of courage for me to even ask.  That laugh was harsh.  It crushed  my soul so hard.   
I was leaving class with this guy that was interested in me and I guess he decided he wanted to impress me. We were chatting a bit, then we get to the stairs and he stops mid conversation and just leaps down the full flight. He looked so pleased with himself at the bottom and just beamed up at me. It was a lil bit weird but I'm proud of him. 
He clogged my toilet the first time he came over. I had also just moved in and didn't have a plunger yet. 
Me and my SO were good friends before we got together. After we had been dating for a while he admitted that while we were friends he came in my conditioner when I let him use my shower.  
After a cute date out to a mountain look out point late at night, we ate some pizza at a little restaurant on the way back home. That night during a hot make-out session in the back seat of his car, he loudly burped. It was a rather wet, especially disgusting burp, delivered straight into my mouth. 
I don't know if his intentions could be described as romantic.. He showed me the porn he watched on his phone. It was pokemon porn.  
Oh this one poor guy wrote me a poem, but it was written in a sort of half-baked Shakespearean English... It was awful. I felt so bad for him, especially because I'm a super romantic English major who usually kills for that sort of thing, but it was just...bad... 
Dated me. And like, she was a lawyer and shit.  She could have done way better. 
Cool.   So I was in highschool, and there was a boy who had recently admitted he liked me.  We (him, myself, and our group of friends) were hanging around on the school field when the boys decided it was time for some tomfoolery.  They were running around on the field with a ball, playing some kind of rugby/soccer hybrid.    Guy with crush on me does big impressive sliding tackle, runs back to us with one of those movie-star big smiles.  Doesn't notice there's a perfect rip in his shirt for his nipple to be poking out.   To make matters worse, his surname* rhymed with "jugs", so I accidentally endowed him a new nickname as well.  We dated afterwards, because goofiness is endearing.  *thanks /u/historymaking101 for the typo correction :~) 
The daughter of my babysitter took me down to the basement where we were alone and cornered me. She then asked me if I loved her. It really threw me off and I didn't answer her right away so she asked me again. And I realized she was really being serious and I just kind of stuttered. And she just asked again and started crying and she kept saying over and over " Do you love me", and I was young and confused and just said yes. She gasped with relief,  wiped her tears, smiled and hugged me and just then went back to being normal like that never happened.  
According to several friends of mine who are fairly close to my crush, he plans to serenade me with a love song he wrote himself. In public. I'm kind of looking forward to it... is that weird? 
She "proposed" me on her knees with a bouquet of roses. I don't even like roses. 
I was once offered money to kiss my friends sister (only 1 year difference) because she liked me so much. Some mutual friends of ours also begged me to at a party in front of loads of people as well as her. NYE she rocked up at a different party and her and her brother both begged me to "give her a chance" in front of all my friends 
A guy once made me a tin foil lobster. Because we were in Maine. 
I once tweeted, "Who wants to hang out with me tonight, other than [roommate]?" A boy texted me the following thing:    "(sees tweet) * slowly raises hand *"   Didn't respond because that was weird. But we kept seeing each other and fell in love. We've been dating for over two years now, and I still make fun of him for it.

A real call I got once:  Me: "Tech Support, how can I help you?"  Them: "I'm not able to log into the website!"  Me: "Okay what message is it showing when you try to log in?"  Them: "SIR, I am NOT a computer person so I don't know."  Me: "Do you know which web browser you're using?"  Them: "I don't know what that is!"  Me: "Okay, when you want to go on the internet, do you click on a blue E, or a multicolored circle, or..."  Them: "SIR, I ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT I AM NOT A COMPUTER PERSON, YOU'RE REFUSING TO HELP ME SO I'M GOING TO HANG UP"

Was talking about geography and whatever to a girl I started talking to and she says "isn't Brazil in France?" And after explaining everything wrong with what she said she then proceeds to say "so then what countries are in France?" 
My old coworker said "corpses turn into maggots." I told him maggots appear because flies lay eggs on rotting flesh. He got angry & didn't believe me and insisted "No, rotting flesh literally turns into maggots." Oh okay.  
Grade 8 science class while studying biology, specifically learning about abiotic and biotic, a girl started arguing with the teacher that water is clearly biotic because it's alive. Teacher confused as fuck. Asks why she thinks this, and says it's alive because it flows just like lava. Everyone is confused as fuck. Elaborating she says that lava is alive because volcanoes reproduce it and since lava is alive and it flows, and since water flows, therefore water is alive. QED. 
We were talking about hunters and gatherers and the topic she chose to discuss was:  "Did the cavemen eat roadkill or just leave it?" 
I once has a friend say to me the Romans were from Cheshire, her logic behind all of this was that there was roman ruins there and somehow in her head this lead her to believe this is were they stemmed from.   To make it worse she was the type not to admit she was wrong, so after a group debate which lasted about 15 minutes she proceed to call her father to prove us wrong, on loud speaker. She explained to him the debate only to be met with a long sigh followed by "oh [her name] are you having one of your monents"  She was a university student.

One of many things my very sweet but not so bright roommates I'm subletting from have said.  RM 1: -talking about how she wants to stand on either side of the equator line at the same time someday-  RM 2: "Haha oh good one, that's funny cause you'd die."  RM 1: "What do you mean"  RM 2: "well the equator is just a giant line of lava right? So like if you stood on it you'd die?" 
My brother thought the UK had a billion people in it, then when he saw my confused expression he overcorrected and said five million. Got really angry when I started laughing.   He works for the British civil service.  
In physics class my teacher went on to explain how big a fourteen light year nebula was and a girl in the front row said "so it's bigger than Earth then?". She also said that beer barrels have dead fish in them. 
When discussing how we keep a flock of chickens because they're cute and funny, and they give us lots of eggs, a friend said, "Oh, I don't think I could ever eat a chicken egg. That's kind of gross."  When asked where she thought regular eggs came from, she said "You know, from the grocery store?" She had absolutely no clue that the eggs in the grocery store came from chickens.   I love her, but this is probably not the dumbest thing she's ever said.  
A dude in college once asked me why I wasn't finishing my liter of vodka. I said "I'm gonna save it for the weekend" (this was on a Thursday)   "You're going to drink day old alcohol?!"  Most college thing I've ever heard to this day.  
My sister last week was saying that you weigh less in the morning because you were laying down all night and gravity spreads out. By the end of the day gravity flattens again in your feet so you weigh more.  I couldn't even. 
"We know evolution isn't real because water hasn't evolved." 
Oh my god this reminded me of the most horrible thing I ever heard.  8th Grade. 8th. Goddamn. Grade. Sociology class. We're learning about languages and a girl raises her hand.  "When people speak in foreign languages, do they just hear English in their head?"  Teacher: "Um... what?"  "When someone speaks Spanish, do the words automatically translate in their brain to English?"  A SECOND STUDENT CHIMES IN AND HE SAYS:  "Yeah... I've always wondered about that!"  The teacher's eyes are horror-movie wide. "Why would they hear English in their head??"  The girl says, "How else would they understand what they're saying?"  I can't remember what happened next; I think I blacked out from the absolute, irrevocable stupidity of it all. 
On the 17th floor of a building, I notice the up arrow has been pressed. When I look to the number displayed by the lift, there both on floors a lot lower than the 17th.  "Are you going up?" I asked my colleague.  "No, I'm going home" they replied.  "Then you should press the down arrow if you want to go to the ground floor" I stated.  "No, you press the up arrow if you want the lift to come UP to you"  This one still itches my brain.

Not heard, read... This girl I went to high school shared a post on Facebook that said "Let me help some of us understand something.  When a man releases his sperm or Sea of Men(semen) into a woman he literally gives her his entire existence.  What's on his mind, what's in his body, and what's in his heart is now released into this woman.  Sperm that isn't fertilized is goes straight to her brain.  This is why she thinks about you all of the time.  His thoughts, foods, meds, his entire existence is released into her womb.  Women are absorbers and for this reason alone MEN should approach her with reverence and awe.  I mean after all you are asking her to completely alter her DNA for you. "

You know those clickbaity articles? Well I sent one to a cousin about the dumbest questions people had ever heard (pretty sure the questions had been stolen from an old ask reddit thread) a few days later he came back and said: those were pretty good, but that one about islands, I don't get it. They do float, why else are they islands.   Still doesn't believe me when I tell him land masses are not the same as icebergs and islands do not float. He's nearly 25 
It's Raining Men plays on the radio. This is the conversation I heard two notoriously dumb coworkers have.  "I like this song but I don't see how it can rain men" "Yeah like...how would it rain men?" "Yeah, it rains water" "I know, it's so dumb. Maybe men is a metaphor for something" "Yeah because its impossible for it to actually rain men"  Like...really. You thought the song was about like...men actually raining from the sky? 
I stayed over at a friend's house once, and when I went to take a shower in the morning found out that she kept her water heater turned off. Why? Because "taking a hot shower kills the healthy bacteria on your skin and leads to problems like skin cancer".  This girl was in college. She legit takes ice cold showers from a fear of skin cancer. 
Not the dumbest but still makes me laugh. I used to answer the phone at Christmas time while on the floor so I could give prices and stock in real time.   Me: Toys R Us, were open till midnight, how can I help you?   Random caller 1: Could you transfer me to the toy department?   Random caller 2: What time do you close tonight?   But there is such a thing as a stupid question and my favourite so far has to be the little old lady getting up from her seat and asking the bus driver:  At what altitude do Deer become Elk?   
"Isn't Hungary a country?"  "I don't know, I don't listen to country." 
I was stuck working on a group project with some kids in my English class that I wasn't particularly fond of. One of them was a real deadbeat and didn't show up for any of the workdays because they were busy. He was assigned one simple task - to write a 2 paragraph summary on act 4 of Romeo and Juliet. As it turns out, he wasn't even competent enough for that. The night before the project was due, he "wrote" the summary. It wasn't until a week later when we realized that he had plagiarized it directly from Sparknotes (with the exception of some basic prepositions.) When I confronted him, he tried to show me that it wasn't plagiarized, at which point I decided to ask him about the meaning of the word "impending," which was in the first sentence. He responded by telling me that "you don't need to know what a word means to use it." I couldn't stop laughing for the next 15 minutes.

I'm in a grocery store deciding what to eat that afternoon when I overhear this couple...   Both are morbidly obese. I'm talking over 400 pounds.   Man:"We should get some Fruit and vegetables with it."  Woman:" Are you retarded? do you know the amount of chemicals is used in order to grow them? They are really unhealthy and give you cancer"   I looked in their shopping cart and it consisted of about 20-30 pounds of candy and crackers.

I was taking classes at a community college for a semester because of less-than-stellar University grades. Was taking anatomy. First day, Prof. asks the class what organic means.

Two old ladies were sitting on a park bench when a man in a trench coat came up and flashed them. One old lady immediately had a stroke. The other couldn't quite reach. 
Two old ladies were outside their nursing home having a smoke, when it started to rain.  One of the ladies pulled out a condom, cut off the end, put it over her cigarette, and continued smoking.  Lady Two asked, "What's that?"  Lady One replied, "A condom. It keeps my cigarette dry from the rain."  Lady Two asked, "Where'd you get it?"  Lady One replied, "You can get them at any drugstore."  The next day, Lady Two hobbles herself into the local drugstore and announces to the pharmacist that she wants a package of condoms. The guy looks at her kind of strangely (she is, after all, in her 80s), but politely asks what brand she prefers.  "Doesn't matter," she replies, "as long as it fits a Camel." 
My favorite: Two nuns are riding their bikes through some old Roman streets. The younger says, "I've never come this way before." The older one replies, "It's the cobblestones."

Nobody will notice, they're all minding their own business. I show you." He gets up and asks in a loud voice: "Does anyone have a pencil?" None of the other passengers care or answer. "See?" So they fuck. After the landing, as the passengers leave the plane, the stewardess asks everyone if they enjoyed the flight. An elderly man says that it has been a bit chilly up there. "Why didn't you ask for a blanket?" the stewardess wants to know. The man replies: "I didn't dare. There was a guy asking for a pencil and he got fucked in the ass." 
A young man goes to a whorehouse to lose his virginity. The Madam finds him adorable and decides she's gonna take  care of him herself. They get upstairs and she asks him if he knows how everything works. Recalling his friend's advice he says that he does. She just smiles and lays back on the bed. He gets on top of her and slides his dick into her pussy. Right away he notices that her toes curled up. When he pulled his dick out they would relax. He had heard that this may happen and that it was a good sign that things were going well. So he continued putting his dick in and out of her and each time her toes would curl and relax with his thrusts. Eventually the Madam stops him and says "Darlin, would you like me to take my pantyhose off?" 
Someone has been secretly adding soil in my garden.  The plot thickens..

A homeless man is walking along a road, and comes across a bridge. On the bridge is a woman standing on the railing, clearly about to jump. He approaches the woman.  "Hey lady, are you about to jump?"  "Back off! If you come any closer, I'll do it!" she replies.  "Well, that's fine," he says, "but before you do, can I ask a favor? I'm pretty down on my luck, as you can see, and it's been a long time since I've felt the touch of a woman, so if it's all the same to you, would you have sex with me first?"  "Eww no, fuck off you creep!" the woman shouts back.  "Fine, fine" the man says. "I'll just go wait at the bottom." 
A sadist, a masochist, a murderer, a necrophile, a zoophile and a pyromaniac are all sitting on a bench in a mental institution, bored out of their minds. "How about having sex with a cat?" asked the zoophile. "Let's have sex with the cat and then torture it," says the sadist. "Let's have sex with the cat, torture it and then kill it," shouted the murderer. "Let's have sex with the cat, torture it, kill it and then have sex with it again," said the necrophile. "Let's have sex with the cat, torture it, kill it, have sex with it again and then burn it," said the pyromaniac. Silence fell... then everyone turned to the masochist and asked: "So, what's it gonna be?" To which he replied, "Meow." 
A man is walking down the beach and he sees an armless and legless girl crying. He asks her why she's crying and she says, "I'm crying because in my entire life I've never been kissed". So he kneels down and kisses her then starts to walk away. She's now crying twice as hard and he asks her why she's crying now.

A man brings a woman he just met at a bar back to his house to have sex. As things are heating up between them he decides to go down on her. When he gets down there he exclaims "Wow, that's a huge pussy! Wow, that's a huge pussy!"   Naturally, the woman is extremely upset so she slaps him and yells "You didn't have to say it twice!"   To which the man replies "I didn't say it twice." 
Superman is flying over the Hall of Justice when he begins to feel a bit randy. Looking down, he spots Wonder Woman, nude and spread eagle, on the roof. He thinks to himself, "Well, we're friends, and I can be in and out before she even knows what's what. We'll have a good laugh about it later."  He swoops down, completes the deed in an instant, and flies off with a deafening sonic boom in his wake. Wonder Woman gasps and says, "What the hell was that?"  "I don't know," says the Invisible Man, "but my ass hurts like hell." 
A young man goes into a drugstore to buy condoms. The pharmacist says the condoms come in packs of 3, 9 or 12 and asks which the young man wants. "Well," he said, "I've been seeing this girl for a while and she's really hot. I want the condoms because I think tonight's "the" night. We're having dinner with her parents, and then we're going out. And I've got a feeling I'm gonna get lucky after that. Once she's had me, she'll want me all the time, so you'd better give me the 12 pack." The young man makes his purchase and leaves. Later that evening, he sits down to dinner with his girlfriend and her parent's. He asks if he might give the blessing, and they agree. He begins the prayer, but continues praying for several minutes. The girl leans over and says, "You never told me that you were such a religious person." He leans over to her and whispers, "You never told me that your father is a pharmacist." 
A male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of Japan when they noticed a whaling ship . The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier . He said to the female whale , " Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink . " They tried it and sure enough , the ship turned over and quickly sank Soon however , the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore . The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female , " Let 's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore . " At this point , he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him . " Look , " she said , " I went along with the blowjob , but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen  Op: scotcheggy

Father Joseph, a missionary, was touring the African village in which he lived, when suddenly a man came up to him.  "Father Joseph!" the man demanded. "Everyone is black in this village, but my son was recently born white! You are the only white man within 200 miles! Explain yourself!"  Father Joseph sheepishly answered, "Now, uh, don't judge too harshly," and pointed towards the goats. "You see, goats are normally white and that one was born black! It's just one of nature's mysteries that you have to accept."  "Oh, I understand, Father Joseph," the black man said. "I stop talking about the white child, and you stop talking about the black goat, OK?"

I was flying from Amsterdam to New York last summer. Close to landing the pilot tells the passengers about the situation at the airport, temperature on the ground and that sort of things. After the announcements I hear the pilot talk to his co-pilot; they have forgotten to turn off the intercom.  "You know what I would really like right about know?" the captain said to the co-pilot, "an ice-cold beer and a good blowjob!".   The cabin crew heared this as well, and the closest stewardess speeds to the cockpit to tell the pilots. Just as she reaches the front of the plane a man shouts "Don't forget the beer!"

Tom and Sally have just got married, and on their honeymoon, Tom asks Sally if she would go down on him. "Oh, No, I don't think you'd respect me if I did that." Sally says.  "Ok then." Tom replies.  Now, 10 years later, it's their wedding anniversary, one of the big ones, Tom asks Sally again, if she'd slob on the knob. Again, Sally refuses, saying, "No, i still don't think you respect me afterwards."  For their 20th Annivesary, Tom and Sally have been happily married, they've had 2 beautiful children, and Sally feels as though Tom has been a wonderful husband. So, that morning, she wakes up, and she starts giving Tom the best blowjob ever. "How was that honey? I know you've been waiting so long, and I felt you deserved that for these past 20 years!" Sally exclaims.   Tom takes a moment to take in what just happened, and he says, "Yeah it was good, now get out of fucking bed and make me my breakfast, you cunt."

Logic is a core part of philosophy and should be taught at least in high school, possibly sooner. We start kids in algebra as early as middle school. Predicate logic is very much like algebra and more relevant for life so it should be taught at the same age. Inductive reasoning is even more important in life.  These philosophical foundations should absolutely be taught much earlier than they currently are. 
Ethics ought to be a course that is required to graduate high school and get a degree in college. The latter used to be the case a long time ago.  A principles of reasoning course would go a long way toward high school students being able to determine what arguments are good and bad. 
Philosophy has to start from an agreed and proven first principle. Ungrounded speculation does not qualify. And that is what I fear we'd see given that children don't have the tools to address complex questions.   Children go through a series of developmental stages and throughout elementary and junior high they're stuck at the level called "concrete operations". Abstraction does occur, but it's not the norm. So instead of teaching the kids to think abstractly they will be taught either a procedure, or will confuse abstraction with fact. Better to teach kids according to their developmental capabilities rather than try to bring them along at an unreasonable pace. 
This may have already been talked about. But the problem with teaching kids to think for them selves and question their frameworks will lead most of them to hating the way the school system is currently set up.  Schools, "Here kids think for yourself better!"   Kids, "Why are we spending 8 hours a day at the age of 7 indoors, having information crammed into our brains, to pass tests that are not good indicators of intelligence or retained information just so the school can look better?"  School, "....on second though let me take back that free thinking." 
Holy crap. This is my first time in /r/philosophy and there are so many off-topic non-philosophical related posts on here confusing philosophy with personal opinions on stuff like education and religion.  Lots of this stuff reads like that "I am enlightened by my own atheism" copypasta meme. 
While I think this would be a good idea, there are much more pressing things that need to be taught before they complete school. Such as personal finance, basic accounting, the time value of money, rent vs buy, how to balance a check book, as well as all the types of bills you will have to pay and how to build a budget.    My highschool was considered ahead of the game and one of our classes spend 2 weeks on building a budget and balancing a check book. It needs to be multi year. We have too many people living pay check to pay check because they think they can afford a luxury simply because their bank account has a larger number than that items price.  
Haha, when I read the post title I didn't realize it was an article link and thought someone was asking /r/philosophy if philosophy should be taught as a core subject. I was like wow, what are you going to ask next, if /r/aww likes cute puppies? XD 
absolutely not they dont even teach kids how to do taxes, balance a check book, create and follow a budget why tf would they add a necessity for philosophy when they dont even teach kids the basics of living  
 No, even at university where departments have greater autonomy were being told to spin certain narratives and answers as correct, despite this undermining thought and moral discussion. Giving greater oversight on philosophy by allowing it to be taught at primary and secondary sounds an awful idea. 
I don't know if it would work. A majority of the people in my *grade 12* philosophy class last semester could barely grasp a lot of the concepts we were learning and (literally) *nobody* but a small group people really understood logic and logical fallacies.   However, a reason they might have not understood it is because they were introduced to this way of thinking so late in their academic careers, which in turn means maybe we actually should be taught philosophy at a younger age. Interesting.  
There is no question about it.   No pun intended.  Any subject that encourages children and adolescents to question the accepted truth, and grow their critical faculty will do a ton of service for this world.   We need more individuals. We need more pioneers. We need more challengers. We need more critics.  Or do we? ...  That's up to you. 
Yeah great, more bastardization of philosophy at the hands of casual students. How could that be dangerous?    "A little learning is a dangerous thing"  -Alexander Pope  
Yeah, I think it's very beneficial to students. I just wrapped up Junior year of high school and my theology/philosophy class exposed us to varying outlooks on our faith (Jesuit HS) and contemporary issues. If anything, it helped me definitively determine what I agreed or disagreed with and opened some actual discussion with my classmates. Now I'm no expert in the authors I've read, but exposure to them is good in itself.  If anyone's interested, the philosophers we read from were:   Aristotle  Emmanuel Kant  Jeremy Benthem   J.S. Mill  Louis Pojman  Karl Rahner  Judith Butler  Philipa Foot   Richard Gula  Our last tri consisted of a more relaxed curriculum where we discussed AI, racism, and wrote a paper proposing how we thought a philosopher would react or approach a contemporary issue today ex: Machiavelli on the Trump administration (something some of my friends did). 
I always encourage students to read it as it can explain a lot about humans' behaviour, from international affairs to work/office dynamics.  
I've heard a lot of conjecture that Machiavelli wrote it as a parody or caricature of the Medici families actions and policies rather than an actual treatise on human behavior, has there been anything more substantial to corroborate this? 
My favourite book by far, it's the reason I stopped getting angry at sleazy politics. 
A lot of people in Acedemia believe that Machiavelli wrote "the Prince" as an attempt to achieve some of his goals that he outlined in his other works like "The Discourses on Livy". Namely, Machiavelli wanted a unified Italy ruled as a republic in a humanistic nature. Therefore, Machiavelli wrote "The Prince" to the Medicis as a way to reach those goals. The Medicis of Florence were arguably in the best position to form a unified Italy. "The Prince" is full of great advice for a ruler to quickly gain land and conquer territories. However, a lot of the information that Machiavelli gives to Medici is not sound advice. Getting rid of fortresses, arming the people, being miserly, and being cruel to the populace are great ways for the Medicis to be overthrown and a republic being formed. 
This has bugged me for a few years, have we come to a consensus if The Prince is satire or not? I constantly hear advocates for both sides when The Prince comes up  
I'm not a stupid person but I'm not incredibly smart either. Rather slightly above average. I just wish that there was a centralised place online where I could read all of these important historical books and have them written in plain modern English. As soon as I try to read them I get bored and switch off. I would love to read all of these books, even the bible, but the writing just messes my head up.  
The book is a satire.  The means justifies the Ends is valid, in so for far as the end is a good moral end.  Hence, only Moses was able to succeed as being the Prince because he represented the people.  Remember, the book was written for the Medici's which were rivals of Machiavelli.  It's a satire.  We studied this in a college in an Ivy League.

What a great service we do to all of these pigs by breeding them, castrating them in the cruelest, most unsanitary way possible, and keeping them trapped up to their knees in their own feces while they wait to do which couldn't be soon enough.  
Farming animals for food certainly doesn't help them in any way. It's ridiculous to think otherwise and sounds like someone that needs to justify eating meat. i eat meat and drink milk, but I'm not about to say that chicken factories and dairy farms are good for the animals.   I guess MAYBE if the animals got to live outside, eat grass or whatever they naturally feed on. Instead they live in overpopulated cages, are fed corn leftovers, and are pumped full of antibiotics to make them balloon in size. You'd have to be delusional to say that's good for them. 
Would it be beneficial to humans if aliens ate us?   
When most of us donate from our small excess, we express a concern and entrust the money to those with expertise; when Gates donates, he sets the agenda.  I feel like the writer thought of something similar to this sentence above first and then grasped at straws to write an entire article to support such an edgy statement.  
This article drips with jealousy and mis-directed aggression. More over, its built off the idea that a person does not have the right to determine their own preferred way of giving. Utter garbage.  
"If philanthropy means love of others, it must prove itself by entrusting the material of that love to the intended recipients. To believe in the dignity of other human beings is to honor their capacity to choose."  I disagree. You can define love in other ways. Same with dignity. One can feasibly argue that "I love you too much to let you hurt yourself, and will manage your material affairs for you" is a form of philanthropy.  "Nothing is mine or yours, but it is ours because we are part of the same divine communism."  This person is going to earnestly use the word communism, and use it in quoting the moral authority of the Catholic Church, no less? I'm growing gravely concerned for the morality involved here. What happens to those sinful heathens which stand in opposition to the divine communism? History gives us a glimpse.. 
This article is terrible.   Schneider is bordering on delusion if he thinks the politicians that are appointed to "run" the public school system are more qualified than Gates or Zuckerberg, let alone try to dictate how they choose to distribute their money.  Schneider meanders through this piece like my grandmother relaying the details of her Wednesday afternoon bridge game. He ran out of anything useful to say after about 200 words. Yeesh.   
Yeah, Gates who donated billions for humanity and worked half his life towards saving lives. People have to learn that spitting on philantropists just to clickbait people to their worthless article is both moronic and incredibly fcked up 
I found this article interesting, I didn't particularly agree with everything, but appreciated some of the the attention to detail in the arguments.  In some respects the charitable nature of Gates, and Zuckerburg are like the idea of a benevolent dictator. Not that they are dictators, but in the sense that they are using their acquired power in a benevolent way - sure perhaps their wealth has accumulated through a less than ideal way (depending on your economic ideaology) but their actions are still 'good'.  It seems a little futile to bemoan that such people are able to set agendas with their wealth and actions when after all the same could be applied to any person who sets such an agenda, democratic political systems are not so perfect as to claim special pleading for their right to dictate policy.  
charity = steal ten loaves of bread from the working class and then give one back to the poor 
Don't get why there's so many people shutting their brain off in this thread.  The article simply makes a case that modern philanthropy is driven by selfishness.  It's selfish to hoard so much money when building wealth. It's selfish to solely dictate what should or shouldn't get funding. It's selfish to use foundations and charity to remain relevant after life.  The author is stating that there is a more altruistic means for doing good.  Whether it produces net good isn't the point of this discussion. While it's not perfect, personally, I'm a fan of Chuck Feeney's style of philantrophy.  It feels more genuine. 
Good post.   A person had to be pretty ruthless to believe their contribution to production is so significantly higher than everyone else's.   To accumulate such wealth means excessively over charging and then acting like Mr(s) bountiful when giving the money back instead of it being distributed democratically like people's taxes are. 
r/Philosophy is one of the few places on Reddit that actually has users who use logic and critical thinking before jumping on the socialist utopia bang wagon every time an article like this is posted, especially one with such misinformation.  
Honestly fuck anyone who makes a point against philanthropy. They're helping people, take a step back, pull your head out of your ass, and let someone help someone with analyzing every way that it's actually bad. 
Oh the irony," these rich people shouldnt decide how to give their own money away, they should listen to me and how i want them to give it away..... btw my brother was a panhandling heroin addict for years, all the people who gave him money on the street, he used to to put poisin directly in his veins......all in all these writter seems like a idiot with little real life experience. 
It makes me very proud to be a Catholic when I see Catholic Intellectualism as it has shown itself all throughout History from Augustine to Aquinas the Renaissance to Gregor Mendel.  A controversial angle the author did not discuss is essentially Gates and the Buffets are just creating tax shelters and shell companies with the cover they are charities.  There is very little redeeming about what they are doing.  Also, the problem with America is the Poor Man's Excuse i.e. "If you are so smart why aren't you rich," which leads to the corollary, "You're so rich you must be smart."  No one really realizes that whatever gifts these people have it's a niche gift, like asking Lamar Odom to work on your legal case only this time it is salesmanship.  Blessed be the Lord to the Author and we Catholics must forever continue our intellectualism.  
I guess I'm still missing something about how Gettier's argument is so stunning, and I've read his original examples.   Doesn't his argument rely on a weakening of "justification"? I think JTB only holds if you hold a strong view on justification. In other words, combine "justified true" into "proven". A proven belief is knowledge. The Gettier examples are pretty much mistakes in proof, so that's why they aren't knowledge.  
I've always been confused about one thing: why do we call the true belief in these examples justified? That seems to be the reason I don't think of these examples as knowledge -- they're *apparently* justified, but not *actually* justified, in that the "justification" isn't actually linked to the truth. The "justification" in these examples is just evidence. Evidence might or might not be directly linked to the truth -- seeing you drive a given car is some evidence that you own that kind of car, but if the car you're driving isn't yours, it doesn't feel like a "justification," just a coincidence that accidentally led you to the truth. 
Just about to read the article. Wanted to say that I have aspired to be Gettier for a long time now. Its the best possible life version of trying exactly ONCE by writing a paper in 15 minutes, succeeding so so hard, and being like "PEACE ' OUT BITCHES." Legend. 
JTB is not a perfect definition of Knowledge as Gettier showed, but it is the best we have, methinks.  
The argument in the blog post doesnt work (haven't read the original paper). It only seems to work by muddying the waters in omitting argumentative steps. When Kanye sees the described guy his conclusion should firstly be "I can see Mark Zuckerberg standing before me" which would not suffice JTB. Inversly the justification for him knowing Zuckerberg is at the concert is also "I can see Mark Zuckerberg standing before me". It works by not firstly identifying "guy" as Markzuckerberg but taking the identification as true before testing it and then drawing a conclusion from it. I'm interested to look at the paper though. 
I feel like the implications of Gettier's problem are overstated. It is an edge case. But we've known for thousands of years that people can be mistaken about their perceptions. For our everyday uses of the term 'knowledge', justified true belief still applies. 
Great article! Surprisingly funny too. The negatives in your first example were a bit confusing (Kanye knows his class *isn't* tired but think I wrapped my head around it.  My instinct is to say that if the guy that Kanye saw wasn't Zuckerberg then he isn't really justified in believing it. If that's the case, then the example doesn't prove the justified-true-belief view false.  Have you thought about that idea? 
Y'all try to tie justification with the truth, but leaving formal problems on the other hand, try to follow that Kanye will act with certainty that Zuckerberg is over there, and he is. Therefore knowledge capability to emerge in dynamical coordination with reference subject IS possible even with inexact justification, what is more, higher level concepts might affect justification of lower level concepts. Justification is not necessary if things are going right and if we assume that belief is not "truth-false choose one" but some kind of a subject reproducement.  
Gettier was not the first. Gettier seems to me, as a lay person in the field of philosophy, merely restating what Descartes wrote: Namely, I think therefore I am. Cartesian philosophy marks the entry of philosophy into the modern era precisely for the reason that it parted so severely with the ancients understanding of epistemology.   Descartes idea is that he can not be sure of any truth except the truth that he exists because that is irrefutably true on the basis that to deny his own existence only affirms he exists as a thinking thing--a res cogitans. Conclusion: cogito ergo sum.  Gettier merely reformulates Rene's original philosophical query. And I am JTB, as a scholar of philosophy, knowing what a scholar of philosophy knows, he knew this, hence he reason for his reluctance and humility on the matter.  
The line " you can't know things you don't believe" is off.. If I know something I dont have to believe you or take your word for it cuz I already know 
I am an experimentalist and not familiar with modern metaphysics. The article states 'today, metaphysics focuses on abstract concepts such as time, space and existence'. My knee-jerk thought to reading this is that if they are backing up their ideas about space and time with physics, then it is theoretical physics. If they are not, then this article fails to convey to me what metaphysics has to offer to the study of the natural world.   
Metaphysics: a cool sounding word that this article tells you nothing about.  Seriously wtf. Can anyone explain what metaphysics is to me? 
I don't see why this is getting upvoted.  Metaphysics is, by definition, false... so it has nothing to offer to the study of anything.  Perhaps I'm missing something -- are we using different definitions of the word? 
If, as you claim, immanent critique cannot be formalized, then a concrete example of what you mean is pretty crucial. Otherwise, this explanation is forgettable as far as general interest goes, and the people who do understand concretely probably already know what you're talking about. Also, what about sublation? I think that's the most interesting and paradoxical element of it all. Maybe there are more parts coming? 
Kind of a left field question, but does anybody know why certain sectors of right wing conspiracy theorists hate Hegelian dialectic? I have a morbid fascination with deep diving conspiracy theories (they are akin to folklore, after all) and often see them decry Hegel in posts. I only have a Philosophy 101 understanding of Hegel and don't get how "thesis, antithesis, synthesis" is supposedly ruining American culture. 
Does Hegel himself clearly state all this, or is this reading taught? Also, as someone else mentions, what about sublation, isn't that the most nuanced concept of all? 
Hey, I'm gonna look at the blog in a bit. I was wondering earlier though, is it true that in order to understand Hegel, one must read the Critique of Pure Reason? Is it advised to begin in this manner? 
A very short synopsis on what Hegel's supposed dialectical method is. Because the method is generally known only by the term dialectics and presented in false formulas people fall into a misunderstanding of what Hegel is really up to and doing. This shortly covers on why Hegel's real method, immanent critique is so misunderstood and so difficult.  
so what is the point of excluding the context of whatever subject?  
Best way forward is with example. Use and dismantle example to a formula. Explain why the formula doesn't work.  If you dissect backwards, you more understand the concept. 
Do you know why Schopenhauer hated Hegel so much and did Schopenhauer have any valid criticisms? 
nobody can synthesise this giant, monster world to just ONE principle. Hegel tried to do that.  he tried to create an absolute and complete philosophy of everything. that's so silly. first of all - it is so arrogant, second - he tried to cover all of his nonsense with big words and complicated writing.  never again I'm gonna waste a minute of my time reading his works. 
These investigations tend to confuse themselves as they tend to treat time as 'what clocks do', when in ordinary language we speak of the phenomenological experience of time, that is one moment of experience coming after the next. This phenomenological experience of time is represented materially by clocks, one second coming after the next, or, when clocks aren't available, by the identification of repeating periods of some natural process.  What ever goes on at a quantum level, if there really is such a thing and it really is fundamental, humans still experience reality in an orderly manner. I can't bake a cake today and eat it yesterday, the period wherein I baked the cake comes logically prior to the period wherein I eat the cake.  There are plenty of little sci-fi stories with time-bending plots where someone grows old then makes some choice or does some action that causes him to be born in the first place in a reverse causality, but that doesn't take away from anything I've said. 
"Toldson said black scholars also must contend with the long-held belief among some whites that blacks cannot write about race with objectivity."  isn't this exactly what the paper is saying about the lack of black scholars reviewing the paper? are they not implying other races would not be objective in discussing matters of Race? 2% of Scholars are black, odds are there wasn't going to be a black scholar reviewing this paper.  
I appreciate the rigor of your thought, however by limiting, and making equal, the utility values, you're not solving the problem so much as reformulating it to simply remove the possibility of a utility monster. Indeed, the argument could be made that such utility monsters exist (capitalism provides many examples), which poses a serious challenge to your interpretation.  
By reducing utility to a binary measurement you have just described the facebook like button or the reddit vote. Up or Down.   Interesting. 
In short, you've normalized lifetime utility to a fixed interval.  What happens when you have two beings of vastly different lifespans? You would, in theory, torture an elf for a year to save a mayfly from a few hours of soreness. Or vastly different life circumstances? You'd starve a billionaire for weeks to briefly soothe an especially pathetic kid with HIV and a leg torn off from land mines.  Instead of a fixed interval, you could use a sublinear scale. Logarithmic, square root, something like that. That would reduce the extreme ends of this imbalance. 
Its interesting - can I ask why you're discarding the traditional, Platonic, meaning of the term _poeisis_?   If you aren't, I apologize. However it certainly seems like you're using the term to describe a much more specific thing (which is largely unclear) than I've seen it traditionally used.  
When I was 11 I took a sticker of a teddy bear with angel wings and put it inside my dad's metal lunch bucket. 18 years later it's still there, although horribly faded.  
I was very artsy as a child & constantly drew or made things for my Dad...and he kept everything. One year I went to a craft fair with my Mom & found this tiny little woven basket, no bigger than 6" tall, that I just *had* to have. As soon as I got home, I went to work on a special present for Dad. I took some green paper, drew a bunch of flowers, colored them with my new cool color-changer markers (the ones that would change when you colored over with the white/clear one), cut them out, & glued into a circle to place inside the basket like a bouquet. I gave it to him & I am not kidding, they stayed proudly displayed, though eventually very faded, on a shelf in his "rig room" (he did ham radio as a huge hobby & had a room in the basement for it all) until the day he died. 
When I was little, I drew a face - in ink - on the wallpaper that we had on our stairway.   My parents were FURIOUS, and I got into major trouble.   Time went by, and my parents replaced the wallpaper.    More time went by, I grew up, and my parents moved out of that house.   I helped them pack - and when I was clearing out a chest of drawers, I found a small piece of wallpaper with the face I'd drawn. 
I visited my dad last summer, it had been six years since we had last seen each other. When we finally met, I said it was sort of weird, seeing each other for the first time in 6 years. And he said something along the lines of, "Yup, it's been 6 years, X months, and about Y days I think". He knew pretty much exactly how long we had been apart, he had remembered the day I had left i guess. That was one of the many things that made me realize just how lucky I was to have an amazing dad like him, and I can only hope to be as cool as he is one day. 
Now its your turn, show him that you love him ! You don't really have you spend a single dime if you can't, dad's appreciate everything 
My dad has some knick knacks we made in first grade for fathers day in his office :) 
LifeSavingProTip: Dont hang stuff from the mirror.  
This happened yesterday and it was me being awkward (as usual). I work in retail. I had been talking to a coworker and had to step away for a minute. Went back to where we had been standing and started to resume the conversation. Took me a minute to realize that there was now a customer (and no one else) standing there. Then I kind of stuttered and said, "oh you're not ____," giggled nervously, and walked away. 
I got in the wrong Lyft once!  My buddy just dropped me off at the bus station after a long weekend of drinking so I could take the bus the rest of the way home. I decided I was too hungover to handle a bus so I called Lyft. The app told me to a expect a blue yaris in 5 minutes. 5 minutes later, a blue yaris pulls up right in front of me. I get in the back seat and the first thing I notice is it's really messy, I slowly look up to look at the driver. She's just staring at me with mouth agape, frozen in horror. I manage to stutter out, "You're not my Lyft. Are you." She violently shakes her head and I get out of the car say Sorry over and over again while also semi-laughing at my own stupidity. My correct blue yaris came a few moments later to wisk me away. 
My dad did this to my mom once. It was the 80's- a simpler time with simpler lives, where we all owned minivans that looked very similar to each other.  My mom went inside to cash a check and my dad saw a very similar minivan behind him in the "waiting line" by the front door of where we were at. He said "watch this" and did a circle in the parking lot- we then watched as my mom eagerly jumped in the wrong van & then very quickly scurried out.  Good times. 
I had a very similar experience a few months ago... parked outside my friend's house waiting for him to come out, and some random woman gets in the back seat of my car.  It might have been scary, but being an attractive, 120 lb blonde, it was just a little weird. 
I can't understand that. Uber tells you the make, model, and color of the car to expect, along with a picture of it. It also gives you the name and a picture of the driver. How could you mistake all of those things? How could anyone be so careless as to jump into a random person's car without being 100% sure it is who they expect it to be?  
I'm waiting for the news report to come out that someone stepped into someone's car thinking it was Uber or Lyft, and was shot by the driver who thought he was being attacked. 
Recently I was coming home from work and waiting for the bus at the  crowded station. I have a dirty job so my clothes were filthy. This friendly guy with a bag comes up and starts handing me stuff like socks, little bag of toiletries, etc. while saying "whatcha need, we got you covered"  Took me a second to realize he thought I was homeless and was part of a group that helps them out. Had to explain I was dirty from work, just fine, and thanks anyways. 
I always feel awkward with Uber. My wife and I used one in San Francisco all of our trip, but I never know if everyone is supposed to be in the back, or one person up front.  
I walked into a house thinking it was my air bnb.  Google maps was off, and when I parked there were a couple people outside that said hi as I grabbed my suitcase and walked in.  Then a lady said "It's so nice to finally meet you" They though I was their relatives girlfriend that they had never met. 
My mom and I were at the grocery store about a year ago.  She was visiting from out of town, so we were in my car.  After coming back out to the parking lot, I emptied our cart into my trunk, then she went to put the cart back, so I sit down in the driver's seat to wait for her.  It seemed like I had been waiting a while, and I start looking around for her.  I glance to my right and see her SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT OF THE CAR NEXT TO MINE.  Suddenly she looks to the left and sees me staring at her from another car and she jumps out of the one she's in, runs to mine, yelling, "WHO JUST LEAVES THEIR CAR UNLOCKED LIKE THAT?"  I couldn't stop laughing. 
I was once at a Microsoft store wearing a red shit. I was checking out a tablet when a kid comes up next to me and says "I got a question about this computer over here..." I turn to face him and he sees I have 'chupathingy' on the front of my shirt. I say "I don't work here" he looked supprised and said "Oh. Sorry." And quickly took off. 
This didn't happen to me but to my brother back in the late 90's-early 2000's, before uber was a thing. In his college days, he had a short school bus he had painted black, because why the hell not? One night while out on the town, some drunk guys climbed into the bus thinking it was a drunk bus, and my brother inadvertently became a designated driver. He's a nice guy so he gave them a ride. 
Gotta make sure that Uber sticker is on the windshield! 
I just use cabs, they are much easier to understand as it is just a quick phone call, and you can recognise the cars easier. 
Yeah, starting a career can really suck.  Tell me about the othere interests. Are there no opportunities there to make a career in. Or at least to get your mind of things? 
Here's something which might cheer you up , I graduated from technical school at 21. Then was conscripted for 2 years . When I finished conscription, what I've learned in school was obsolete, I did low level computer programing jobs for 3 years earning 1.4k per month .  I saved some money and went to university. After graduation I'm at 29 years old. I practically spent my 20s not doing anything beneficial to my career . My first real job was with consulting in the big four at age 30.   I'm 36 this year and I'm learning 100k per year before taxes .  Summary,  not everyone started right on the first .   I hope you spend sometime to figure out what you want as a career instead of doing odd jobs which may not benefit your ultimate career . Good luck  
Wow, you really penned yourself in when choosing that username. 
Those that start later, dont neccessarily come last.  That wasn't the exact quote, but whatever, it works for me. I've dropped out of college two times and am about to start my third attempt and that's basically my motto. Maybe it'll help you somewhat. 
I'm 26 and just moved back in with my mom to go back to school after realizing my first degree will only let me get jobs that I hate. A lot of people our age get down because we feel like we should already have the things our parents had at our age, but it just doesn't work like that anymore. The dream of being married with a stable job, your own house and your 2.5 kids at the age of 25 is no longer something everyone can expect (or even want) due to changes in the market and various social pressures. Don't get down on yourself if things take you a little longer than you expect. Everyone's different, and we all forge our own path in our own time.  
I'm in the same boat as you. 26 graduated with a masters in December. I'm looking at tech companies for design positions but everyone wants 3 years work experience so interviews are far and few between. I think it'll help that you're at least in LA in a populated area for more opportunities. I'm in the middle of nowhere and local candidates seem much more preferred. I think we'll both find something eventually just apply to everything you can, connect with people on LinkedIn! Use your schools alumni network and career center if you can! 
Indulge me in a thought exercise here?  Imagine you got a job, but the start date was 45 days from today: what would you do in the interim? 
you should consider joining the US military, you can go in as an officer and make a ton of money. Thats what i am doing right now, actually pretty glad i did.  
I think my dad told his aunt after the second date that he was going to marry my mom.   The only thing I would say is don't be in a rush to get married. You're still very young. The two of you should focus on your schooling and your future careers. Focus on a wedding when you're stable and can afford a nice one! You don't need a ring or a ceremony to know your feelings for each other!   As for me, I'm hopeless, so I have to live vicariously through you. 
Btw yeah 20 is too young and 3 months is literally nothing. Think before you do something you might regret. 
Congratulations dude! I just proposed to my girlfriend 2 days ago and even just bought her a ring today, intended on "just looking" lol 
So OP answered every "congrats" comment and none of the "be careful, you're only 20 and been only dating for 3 months" comments. He's either gonna come back to this topic in years with a "yup, should've listened" face or "f*** all of you, in yo face" face.. 
Cool. Asking the father for permission always seemed demeaning and insulting to me, though. Like, what if he says no? It's not like that's going to stop you, so you're not even really asking. Plus the idea that a woman is her father's property seems pretty outdated. I sure as hell didn't ask my wife's dad. He's cool, but that decision ain't his to make! ;) 
My husband and I only dated for a few months before we had the marriage talk. Although I knew long before then he was my one. Congrats! 
congratulations! how did you know that she's the one? :) 
Marriage is quite the journey. I'll have my 6 year wedding anniversary in a few months, and I wouldn't trade it for the world. 
My grandpa saw my grandma for the first time when she was like 9 or 11, and he instantly told his brother that he was going to marry her one day. They didn't even meet, he just saw her from afar. They later dated and married, but he knew from the instant he saw her. They made it almost 60 years together before he passed, and had one of the most admirable relationships I've ever seen.   A teacher I had in high school had married his wife after something like 3 months of knowing each other, maybe less, and at the time I knew him, they were beyond 50 years married and he was clearly still head over heels for her.   My point is that while many people don't know very soon that someone is the person to marry, some lucky ones do know, and it lasts and is beautiful. I hope you're one of the lucky ones! 
My parents got engaged at 20 and 21 years old after 6 months of dating. They'll celebrate their 37th wedding anniversary in a few months. It wasn't always easy and it took a lot of work, but they're still madly in love with each other today. Sometimes if you know, you just know.  
I'm not going to say anything about your age, but I will say that you should definitely not make any decisions right after you're deadly ill and she just took you to the hospital. I'm sure she's awesome, but it's a traumatic experience and it's bound to give you both some strong emotions. Get better, and when you're just a normal healthy couple again for awhile, talk about it again to see if you're still in the same place.  
Since you say you're young, consider pre marriage counseling. It helps you discuss your life goals, values, skill sets and preferences which will prevent a lot of arguments later.  
I thought I had mono for a couple weeks. Turns out I was just really bored. 
I was in a very very similar situation (22 y/o with mono, love of my life was with me at the time). Do not waste this oportunity, you WILL regret it.  PS: its been 12 years... Im still kicking myself for not marrying that girl. 
I basically have a couple of bands that coincide with the music we would have sex to in each of my relationships 
That's pretty neat. I've discovered a lot of music through being in relationships. Now there's a lot of bands that reminds me of them when I listen. Sometimes I get sad and become wistful. At least it let's me know that I feel something and I'm alive. It's bittersweet.  
I do something kind of similar, but I make playlists that directly correlate to my life. For example, I have a playlist right now that started back in January and I'll close it at the end of this month. The playlists used to go for a whole year but I started to get into music more and the lists started to get overloaded so I split them into 6 month time frames. When I listen to songs from an old list, it takes me right back to that moment in time. 
Well, my ex introduced me to k-pop and I've been hooked ever since. 
I've got a gorgeous diamond and amethyst necklace, and a stuffed penguin named Frog after the Chrono Trigger character. The relationship ended on good terms - it just wasn't the right time for us to be together, so they are still very special items to me because he was an amazing guy and I wish our time together wasn't cut short due to life and stuff. 
That's cute. I really enjoy music and use it to bond with the people I love. So yeah, I do have periods in my life where I was into different things, say hardcore/punk/r&b/lo-fi/electro (...) all of them I had the privilege of meeting amazing girls and we shared both physical and cultural love. Now I'm waiting for the one that genuinely enjoys bossa nova and phill Collins so I can hopefully marry her :) I've come to terms with myself and not planning to change too much from now on :p 
All the girls i've dated have been absolutely obsessed with Panic at the Disco and Fallout boy and NOTHING ELSE. It's like every part of their minds left the "Rawr xD" phase EXCEPT for the musical taste part of the brain. I tried-- time and time again-- to like those two groups, I really did, but to no avail. This equates to somewhere around 3 years of my life dedicated to attempting to like Panic and Fallout Boy, but I only seemed to dig myself into a deeper grave of hating those bands.  What you will find in my Spotify history is countless hours of music that I attempted to use to combat the emo boys that haunt my dreams. As a result, I've gone through phases of being an indie shitface as well as listening to obsessive amounts of rap. Actually, my musical taste has evolved A TON during this time.  Maybe I need to reevaluate my love life... 
Unfortunately, I had to go through a period of remixes soaked in synth. #redflag  
I've actually noticed the opposite. One of my exes would always be listening to really sad music. Shit that would just make me feel miserable inside. To boot, she already had issues with depression.  Once we were through I began to notice that I don't really listen to anything sad. Sure some of it (mostly classic rock or EDM) could be called moody/reflective for the down times but none of it is outright depressing. I know my collection so well that I can sing just about anything that comes on and it makes me feel really happy when I do.  I think I owe my subconscious for such a positive attitude. Can't imagine what life would be like if I intentionally brought myself down all the time. 
According to my Spotify music, I'm a good mix between "Stuck in the 90s rock" phase and "Getting into strange alternative, indie, and metal music" stage. It's a weird mix of a bunch of different music but nothing from a relationship besides single songs. I'll recognize them when they come on and it reminds me of that person which can be nice sometimes. 
Congratulations and I wish you both the very best in your marriage!  I'm sure the age gap will rub some people the wrong way but as long as you're both happy that's all that matters. At least this has helped you both open your eyes as well to see the people that truly matter in your life. Wish you all the very best.  
Congratulations. If she makes you happy, that's all that matters.  
Jesus Christ who do I read these threads when they just remind me of how lonely I am  
I really don't want to come across as judgey....but 29 and 55? You deserve happiness but man she's going to feel weird in another 10 or 20 years. My SILs ex husband remarried a woman 20 years his junior and she looks young and he looks incredibly aged and feeble. She is not happy and didn't think what it would be like when they got older. She's 40 and he's 60. 
Congratulations my friend, and you're not old; you're only as old as you think you are. I hope you have a lovely wedding and best wishes for your future together!  
Congrats! I've been dating guys 15-25 years my senior for a long time, and while I get a lot of flack for it, the people giving me shit I don't nor have ever considered friends, so I've never let it negatively affect me. I'm the same age as your fiancee, and I hope neither of you let other people's negative opinions affect your relationship! 
You rich? Sorry I know that's a rude question but I'm so curious 
Congrats!  I, also, had a good outcome today: while at a job fair that was a bit outside my interest but still relevant, one HR rep stepped away to make a call to a colleague because he knew the colleague needed someone with my exact qualifications. Too early to know if it will turn out, but his colleague did say she would get in touch with me. 
Congrats, Hopefully one day, I will be in your position and go to college, happy for ya :) 
Congrats dude! I'm still finishing my first semester but I already know the feeling! Just yesterday I found out I got a 9.7 on my last calculus exam, making my final grade a big ol' 8! Super happy right now, I thought I would never make up for that stinky 4.6 on the second exam. 
Congrats! As a current long time college student, you've passed the first hurdle of college. My first year, I was amazed at all the freedom I had to do whatever I wanted. So amazed in fact, I forgot to do a lot of my work. I'm an A student now, but my first year was not pretty, so good job, friend. You're off to a great start. 
Congrats!! That's amazing news :)   I find out on the 15th my final degree classification, the provision one was a 2:1 so hopefully that stays! Wish I was back in first year like you! Best four years of my life  
Congratulations! I had my second-to-last exam for first year today, not feeling too confident about my grades right now though! Last one is on Wednesday so hopefully that will go well :) 
The only class I had trouble in I did terrible with, but mine came back as well and I passed by .3 points...maaaaybe not as prestigious xd 
Awesome, man! One of the great things about getting good grades is that it keeps a momentum within you to keep getting them.  
Oh wow! I graduated on Friday and about 2 weeks ago got back my last grades of my university career. Good luck with your next 3 years! 
With how little I actually went in I'm just hoping to pass the year, 4/5 passed so far an just waiting on the last module. What uni are you at? 
Congratulations! My first year of college starts in a few months, do you have any tips? 
Great work!  My time at college was tough, but I wouldn't trade it for anything.  As for today: I'm hoping to hear back from more companies about a new job. I got a lead, though. New gig pays a little less than the current, but I hear the team is great, and I'd be working for a nonprofit instead of a money-hungry tech startup that can't sort out its own product, so. 
'grats man! from your post history I see that you're in community mental health, sounds cool! I still have a couple of weeks left in my first year in junior/community college and hope to do well enough these next several quarters to transfer out for my third year. enjoy your summer :D 
This is way too nice, it doesn't seem like Reddit. 
Congratulations! It's a great feeling to have your efforts rewarded. And good on you for taking the time to savour this milestone.  One problem I had in post-secondary (tech college) was constantly focusing on what was ahead, and not appreciating the positive feedback I was getting along the way.  All the best to you in the years ahead. If you're especially lucky, you'll come out the other end with one or more great, lifelong friendships as well. :) 
I'm going to write my exam today. Hope, I can have the same feeling as you  later on.  
Eyyyyyy same here! I'm really happy about my grades this first year. It's gonna make me feel good when they start crashing and falling in the next 4 years (please don't actually happen...) 
Great to hear! I had two big exams yesterday which also went great, so close to being finished completely. 
Congrats! I got my university grades a few days ago aswell and was very pleased with them!  
Congratulations on passing! What kind of thing will you be doing in year 2?   I've just finished my second year of university, and the last two years have just been general arts courses. The next two are English and Creative Writing, so I'm getting quite hyped now. I did my exam a couple of weeks ago, and my results should be in around August. 
Congratulations! My university's honor roll came out last night and I made President's again, and I've been super stoked to tell someone all day! 
Well good news in a different sense, my university acknowledged me dropping out allowing me to finally join my apprenticeship :D 
I kinda see where you are coming from. I once dated a girl I was not all that into at the beginning, but she asked me out so I took her up. She really grew on me. 
Maybe it's your weird self that makes you so attractive. Maybe you have mutually compatible weirdness? 
i am currently with someone that has completely shattered my expectations when it comes to a relationship. it's kind of gross, being able to look back and realize that you've just endured a series of unhealthy relationships, but there you go...two years ago, i didn't think someone like this existed. now, i can't understand how the hell i managed to make it this far without her.   so, yeah. i feel you, OP. congratz. :) 
I'm on the same boat as you rn, only Im still working on the asking out part. Any advice or maybe sharing how you went about it? 
I know how you feel. It's amazing how much positivity one person can  bring into your life isn't it?  
Now you know.  Explaining things like being in love, being a parent - if the person hasn't done it they can't understand. 
Love is a great drug. That is awesome. I remember when I proposed to my  ex wife but then I also remember when she cheated on me. Love is great. I also remember I'm lying because I've never gotten married. Love is great.  
Yes. Sometimes you just need to get it out. Bottling things up isn't healthy but we all do it to some degree. We should let ourselves cry more often.  
Every once in a while we find a moment to be kind to ourselves and to love our ourselves.  This was a moment for you. 
For any other confused metric users, I just figured it out. One foot is 12 inches. So 5 feet 8 inches is the same as 4 feet 20 inches.  
What are these measurements translated to a more sane format? :P although that is pretty funny.  
Imagine someone asks "how tall are you?" and you reply with "4/20". Can't imagine the reactions haha.  I'm also 4 feet 20 inches too, and I feel pretty short around other people. By the way, I'm from the Chicago area. 
I am so jealous of people who live in the part of the world with 4 seasons. Here in South East Asia, either it's raining or hot af. It sucks, i am yet to feel snow for the first time. 
spring. I have no allergy, i can do so many stuff outside. Summer gets too hot after that 
I like autumn.  The searing heat and humidity of summer is finally over, the trees are changing colors, the holidays are on the horizon.  It's the best.  
I'm a big fan of the two weeks of spring we get in the Midwest. Mind you those aren't a continuous two weeks. It's 14 days scattered anywhere between late January and early June. 
I love late spring. It's got the goodness of summer, but it's not summer. 
I love all the seasons actually.  Cuz I'm really bored in my office here's what I like about each season:  * Winter: I love the snow and love the holidays.  I also love it when we gets lots of snow because I don't have to go to work.  Plus hot cocoa is the shizz.  * Spring: Flowers bloom, the cherry blossom trees bloom, everything comes back to life.  Also the weather is perfect.  Not too hot not too cold.  * Summer: The season of leisure.  Camping, trips to the beach, and drinking beer in the outdoors? Fuck ya bud, sign me up.  Not to mention Halloween is one of my favorite holidays.  * Fall: After getting sun burnt and dehydrated the fall is a good break from that heat.  Plus all the leaves turn into different shades of orange and yellow.  It's so beautiful.  Early fall also has the perfect weather.  
Hi!!! Spring is my favorite because it means winter is over and the sun's out and it gets warmer and everything's growing and there's so many flowers!!!  
I feel you on that one. Autumn is wonderful. I was in Chicago once in October, and the scenery was captivating. I have this daydream where I'm walking down a somewhat busy Chicago street, it's slightly windy, leaves are changing colors in Millennium Park nearby, and I'm sipping on a coffee. I look up at a muted grey sky, take a deep breath, and keep walking. No other season makes me feel that way.  
Fall.   Halloween, NFL, NHL, start of mite hockey leagues, my kids birthdays. It's light jacket weather, the smell of leaves, bon fires, just everything 
I love all seasons except summer. I *hate* summer.   It makes me sick actually, it gets too hot, and I'm gagging and almost vomiting. Cannot find any reason for it.   Fall & winter are my favorite seasons. if I could live in perpetual fall/winter I would definitely do something.   Summer = Hell No.  
I didn't buy the Honda extended warranty either. Mostly because I drive alot.  I did ask " Why the extended warranty? Aren't Hondas supposed to be reliable?"  Their response: ummm... yeah..  but you'll feel more at ease! 
Fuck I hate dealerships. It sucks they passed laws making it so we have to go through them.  
I made a spreadsheet to calculate lease payments when I went car shopping a few months ago. Boy, did the dealerships hate me lmao 
Dealerships are so irritating with the "Dealer math". We leased a new Nissan for my wife and they insisted that we put another $1000 down cash to "lower the payments $25/month." That worked out to the term of the lease divided by $1000 = $25. Why would I give them $1000 liquid cash up front to save $25 over the course of the lease? I thanked them and said we would just pay the "extra" $25 a month. 
*Yay. I have no idea what brought me to CC, actually, it was such a long time ago.*                                                  *I was studing in school three years ago.  I was a bad student... I still am in school, but now I'm a good student.*                 *I feel like writing poems is the only thing that is making me happy right now, there's a tough period in my life right now, I feel very sad and lonely. But when I write a poem, then all seems a lot better for an hour or so...* 
I stalked a reddit friend and saw she posted in cc... Thought it looked friendly so I started to take part.   3 years ago, I had just finished my dissertation... Now 3 years later I've transitioned mtf. Got an awesome job I love, and things are pretty darn good :) 
Happy birthday CC!  I found this sub about a year ago. I'm not sure how I found it. I've visited it almost every day since! I love being part of such a nice community. 
Happy birthday!  What brings me to CC. Came across it just a day or two ago and thought it seemed pretty cool. Occasionally I find the need to chat but doesn't seem to fit a sub so this should be awesome!   Where was I three years ago? I was in my last year of highschool trying to figure out what to do with my life. Haven't figured that out yet but having fun  What makes me happy? I am just about to start a new ski season and I am super excited to meet new people and make friends from all over the world with a passion for the snow :)  
Happy birthday!  I found this sub clicking RANDOM and was very pleasantly surprised.  Three years ago I was working a job I hated, absolutely hated, and felt like the world was gonna close-in on me and that was it, this is my life. I left that job for a better position, and I still am not super happy with what I do but it's a million times better than where I was, so I'll take it.  Making me happy these days is stuff I do creatively in my own time, trying to get my YouTube channel going, art, writing, whatever - anything I can do to flex my creative muscles. 
I came to CC after it was featured in /r/subredditoftheday.  Same thing we do every day, ~~try to take over the world~~ er, fixing things. Yeah.   Wooo Friday! 
I went to Big Hero 6 by myself, though there were some kids and parents in the room with me, it was mostly me. For the first time I put my feet up and was laughing out loud in public. It became one of my favorite movies simply because I got to see it all by myself. It was one of my only goals to do before I graduated (I was sixteen at the time!) and it's a moment I'll never forget.  
Dude I loved the books as a kid. So many of my childhood favorite books are now movies. Is it any good? 
I'm 28. I went to see Captain Underpants on Sunday with my wife, my mom, my 14 year old cousin, and 6 year old nephew. My wife and my mom could have done without out, but the rest of us loved it. The animation was beautiful (DreamWorks always seems to be top notch) and I loved the references to the original story- especially the flip-o-rama.  
I went to see F8 of the furious with my friends and we had a great time. I'm definetely seing CU along with cars 3 once it comes out in new zealand 
I just went with my co-workers because we all wanted to see it, but none of us were under 30, and we would have felt weird going by ourselves. All of us really enjoyed it. Best idea this week. 
Movies like the new cars and this are for us anyways ;) since we grew up with it. What'd you think of the movie? 
I remember reading the first 5 Captain Underpants books, when I was 13 years old, back in 2001. I might have been a little too "old" for this book series, but that didn't stop me from having fun reading them! :P  I'll probably see this movie, whenever it becomes a rental on Google Play or the PlayStation Store. 
I was reading those books when I was way too old to be reading them. Kind of want to see the movie.  
Thank God for that.   I understand that one sometimes wants to indulge in dumb/childish entertainment but watching Captain Underpants is going too far.  
OOOOOOH. You know so many women TRY to get white hair. And to me, there are few things more attractive than an older woman(meaning she has white hair the more typical way) with a nicely styled head of white/silver hair. I think it would look amazing on a younger woman. And hey, if you want to do bright colours, no bleaching! I'm almost jealous :)  
When I was around 4 years old I managed to smash my face and create a quite large scar on my upper lip. That scar was the bane of my existence for a very long time, and when I finally just accepted that it is always going to be there a very large burden was dropped from my shoulders. When you learn to live with and accept things that you can't do anything about, it feels very good! And in all honesty it doesn't affect me in the slightest now, so why should I care about it? 
I hate being that person, but you should post a picture of it. Personally I think white hair looks pretty good on a lot of younger people that dye it that way. 
That's awesome! I am going to stop dying my very long hair shortly so that when I go gray I can just have long gray hair. Don't want to be one of those women with dark hair and all gray roots. 
Do you have vitiligo? It causes stuff like pigment loss. Did you get a bad sunburn when you were a kid? 
I have one girl who only ever called when she needed something. I have cut off communication with her for the past couple years. I don't have time for that shit. It would be different if she were at least grateful, but she treated me like shit when we hung out. And now she deals weed and has to attend court-ordered parenting classes and is on 3 year probation. (My sister still keeps in contact with the girl and keeps me in the loop) 
I feel like I'm let down by most of my old high school buddies. After graduation I moved about 4 hours away, nothing too crazy. I'd go visit them and they'd always offer to come see me (I live in a city, they live in the middle of nowhere...there's actually stuff to do where I live) but it would never happen. I got to the point where I just stopped trying & gave up on engaging in the friendship. Now we rarely ever talk and I feel like I'm a lot happier that way...even though I miss them sometimes. I feel like I've moved on with my life & my life has improved so much...but they're still doing the same things. I guess I just outgrew them. I did, however, run into an old high school friend last week while visiting for the day & they've clearly gone down hill...getting in trouble with the law and stuff. Not my style. I'll keep my college friends.  
This happened to me! They messaged me on LinkedIn (I added them because I'm still building my network) and they asked for my number. Didn't think anything of it and gave it to them. Then they text me saying they want to talk to me about a job opportunity since they saw that I'm looking. We arrange a time to talk and when they call they go into this whole pyramid scheme type business they run with their dad, all the while l refusing to tell me the name of it. I told them I wasn't interested as politely as I could and ended it right there 
It sounds like your old high school buddy's life has gone absolutely nowhere since graduation. Pity them for a moment, reflect on all you've accomplished in the past eight years, and move on with your life.  People do have this strange idea that you will forever stay in touch with high school, and even elementary school friends. It just isn't the case as (interesting) people tend to change so much once they hit adulthood.  I am friends with one person from school. I am still the acquaintance of about four or five.  
I've felt like that before. I find that feeling changes when I change my friends. If people don't seem to like you but you don't agree with their criticisms of you, chances are you just need to find people that do think more like you. :) you deserve to be liked, and I'm sure your likers are out there in plenty! 
It sounds like you need new friends. Hi! I'm delibertine.  
I feel that way sometimes, too, but you have to realize that it's most likely an insecurity.  As for your friends ... are they really good for you if they are making you feel like shit?  You should have people you feel comfortable around, that encourage and support you.    If there are positive changes you want to make, start working on yourself.  You'll attract more people into your life, the ones you'll want to keep, by learning to love yourself.   
I'm your opposite: people like me (well enough I guess), but I don't like people much.    
I only care about people who care about me.  It's not worth my time thinking about people who don't like me. I cannot change how they feel about me, and I'm sure as hell not going to change myself to suit them. 
Could be insecurity. You could also just be interpreted as cold and aloof. If you want to change how others perceive you, then you will have to change yourself a bit. I know the cliche is to just "be yourself", but if that's what you've been doing all along and you don't see the results you want, then perhaps it's time to address what's causing it. 
Back in the 5th grade I made friends with a guy named Tyler. He turned out to be one of the best friends I've ever made. But on the flipside, anytime he introduced me to one of his friends, they always ended up hating me for one reason or another.  The most memorable of which was Chris, who also happened to be the first of his friends who introduced to me. Long story short, we visited him on his grampa's farm, he was hostile to me for no particular reason, and he started a fight with me. I whacked him with a stick, and Tyler and I walked home. 
I used to want everyone to like me. This was high school me. I've done a lot of growing up since then and one of the biggest changes I made was living a life where I only want certain people to like me. My friends, family significant others, etc.   It's exhausting *trying* to get people to like you. Kinda like dating, but that's a different story. Point is I only want a few people to care about and I feel much better living this way. I'd rather have a small network of people I can rely on than be in slightly good graces with lots of people. Worrying about people you barely know just seems unfair to yourself. Like, why should they get to put a debbie downer in your day? Who are they to you? No thanks. Life's too short for that. This is how I feel. Maybe it would help you too? 
I'm a bit late late here, but yes, I feel like that a lot.  I think one of the guys I play volleyball with is a pretty good example, especially about why I'm wrong. On the court, if he has the chance he'll place himself next to me in the lineup, when we just play for fun he'll try to set when it's my turn and he'll step in and take the dig from me. I felt like he was trying to push me off the team.   I was gearing up to confront him about it while walking to the train station one day, but didn't get around to it before he thanked me for helping him with the blocks and spiking for him, he felt like we'd become a duo on the court covering each other's weak points and both playing better for it... Turns out I'm a good friend of his, who helps with the things he can't.   Different perspectives  
Someone who criticizes you all the time is not your friend.     If you are introverted and/or shy, many people will take you to be cold, and you won't make friends quickly. But the friends you DO make, the REAL ones, will truly appreciate you.     If you want to make more friends, two strategies that can work:        - Get involved in more activities that you truly enjoy or would like to try and that involve other people. For shy people, it's easier to meet while doing something rather than just going to parties or bars where the only activity is social interaction (at which we don't tend to be very good.)       - Read and practice the advice in the book: "How to Make Friends and Influence People." It's a classic self-help book that's been in print for f**king ever because the principles in it are simple and effective.  
These comments are risky not just for speech of eating babies. Which I don't do!  
I do feel like you, I have just about 5 people around me that I even talk to, then there is that girl at my school, that I don't even talk to, that for some reason hates me so much, I don't know why, maybe cause I am just ugly? 
My friends and family seem tolike me despite me being a horrible douche. Whenever I meet someone new and try to befriend them (important to note that I'm horrible at human interactions), however, I'll get almost exclusively negative responses, even before my sonofabitchery is revealed.  Maybe this friend of yours is not too patient, or is just snob. If you are nice to others, you'll eventually find good people who will appreciate it. 
you are good no worries - do not let them make you feel bad  
I'm in a small school with 37 kids in my grade. Let's just say I don't have the best rep. Sadly, I am no longer trusted with secrets, and it's pretty fucking hard to gain trust once you've lost it. I'm getting there (and since summer is here I hope a fresh start next year). Most people don't like me because I'm a bit pretentious- I know that.  Just hang in there, and relax for the summer. I'm making a big change and cutting ties with a person I like. 
In my environment, I don't really feel anything like that around my friends or people. However, in online world, being nice somehow attracts trolls. 
I have similar thoughts, when I am alone a person I connect very well, we talk about personal things and conversation is full of jokes and puns, but in a group I don't connect with anyone even if is the same people.  
Just my .02 but the times in my life where I have felt people didn't like me were times where I really didn't like myself. The more I pursued things that made me happy the more I attracted positive interactions with others.  
I feel like most people don't like me either. Not that they dislike me, I meet a lot of people and they always say 'she's such a nice girl' but then I fail to move to deeper connections past that most of the time.  My close friends are people I've studied or worked with so we've been together daily for months and then became friends because they got to know me over time and I could open up properly.  I think the answer to that is make friends through shared interests, do a class, join a sport, do sth that will put you in the same space as people who like the same things for a longer period so they get to know you better.  Also get rid of the one who criticises you. If they don't want to be friends with the person you are then part ways respectfully. 
this happens to everyone.... Time will heal it. You jus need to be patient.  
Just a glass half full perspective here:  It seems to me that you are significantly more successful in one way or another in your friend circle. Try to find out what that x-factor is and make it better.   Also you have to learn to take  criticisms  from those around you and filter the constructive ones from them.  
Not sure how old you are but I realized that the older I got, the less tolerant I became of "little" things.  I still have close friends but spending too much time with them makes it easy to become a little too liberal in what I say/think about them.  We all have life hitting us and don't put up with much.  Once you have a spouse, kids, maybe a dog, how likely are you to put up with your friend chewing too loud when you're trying to relax.  Haha maybe not the best example but hope you know what I mean. 
If you want to be more likeable you have to learn to be more outgoing. Or find people with similar introverted interests.   I'm in a boat where I'm not necessarily likeable, but people either love me or hate me, because in pretty blunt and sarcastic, but also genuine and transparent. So people who can't take the bluntness cause they're used to lies and flattery think I'm mean when I'm just honest.   You would need to do a similar introspection, try and identify why it is you find people don't like you, do they get mad, bored, sad, annoyed, grossed out? Etc.  Also feeling like nobody really likes you is depression 101. 
I used to think I didn't like people, but the truth is that I seem to like all people and want to know more about them. It's highly unlikely that people don't like you, and that you just might be a little unapproachable or distant. Try opening up a little, I'm sure good things will happen :) 
I don't know. You'll have people who like you, and there are some that don't just for no reason. Only thing you can do is be the best you you can be and keep it movin. 
I'm probably similar to you in the way I act.  Though, I'd say I'm far more unlikable.  But people tend to like me.  People even claim to be really close to me to other people, as if I'm someone to show off.  I hate this.  In fact, I don't really like people, and I have very few actual friends.  Sometimes I consider why people like me, and I think it's because I'm genuine.  I'm honest, I'm straight forward, and I don't BS.  This comes off as pretty harsh often, and I'm not saying everyone likes that - but too many people do for my comfort.    My advice to you is to always be yourself, don't compromise to make friends, speak  your mind, and stop caring how others might perceive you.  
I hope your day gets better OP. :)   I hope tomorrow is better too - with a bunch of puppers licking your face and cuddling you until your heart is content.  
Have you seen the life of brian?  Look up the crucifixion scene.  It will cheer you up. 
Why was it a rough day (assuming you want to talk about it)? Anything we can do? 
Woah, those are great! If I wasn't a poor college student I'd definitely buy one of those!   You could commission sculptures, you definitely have the talent, I'm sure there's a demand out there for it somewhere. 
If I were closer to Seattle, I'd definitely work with you to promote your work! I think if you develop a very polished website and marketed your services as high-end sculpture, or even produce a 2-3 minute interview style video that showcases your process and share that around, you would absolutely drum up business. Just need to find the right clients, but Seattle seems like prime real estate for this sort of marketing to me!  
Beautiful art! Have you tried selling your work at art fairs? 
There are time where I am proud of the things I've fabricated. Then I see shit like what you do and renounce my pride. Those railings are awesome, and  the sculptures are top notch. 
You mentioned doing a children's book or graphic novel like the Tuscaloosa piece; that would be really cool. I don't know if anybody has done something like that before. Where does your interest in graphic novels/children's books come from? 
Hey :P Its night here and there is very bad lighting for scenery but I'll definitely do this for ya noonish tomorrow :P  Also just wanted to shout out /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/ If he ever needs a meal post over there for us; lots of kind hearts on reddit don't be afraid to reach out.

I tried to take a photo with the message just a moment ago,it didn't turn out good at all,so I will wait until tomorrow morning to get a better shot of scenery outside my window (with the message of course!)

Thank you so much for taking the time to write this. I'm having a particularly hard day and your comment brought out the first smile of the day.  
You should get her number so you can text/ask her out! Most interesting place I met someone was on an Internet forum... I drew her and she was so intrigued she gave me her number. That was five years ago and we are still very close. 
Sounds like you are living in a really cheesy romantic comedy :P 
Yesterday, I passed by a cute girl on the street. Normally I look down at the ground and avoid eye contact but I took a shot this time by looking at her and smiling. She immediately smiled back, looked me up & down, and continued to smile as she walked passed me.  What a feeling that was... Pure elation. I'll never see her again but that moment is a Huge confidence booster for me. 
That sounds like the opening to a movie haha. I once drove six hours to a concert, wemt to the show, slept at a hotel then drove back six hours. When i got home I was hungry so I ordered some food to pick up. I was wearing the shirt of the concert I just got back from, i go into the store to pick up my food and while waiting in line a voice asks me if I saw the band the night before. I said I did and she was at the concert too. Crazy. We chatted a little about music but then I got my food and got out of there.   Venmo id: Ven-MoOnedollar Total raised: $3 
Lol at a Spirit Halloween store. I was there with a few of my male friends and I noticed one of the cashiers was super friendly with me and would sort of go out of his way to help me. I ended up asking him out for a date and he said he'd been trying to work up the courage to ask me! Went on a date, it unfortunately didn't work out, but was still the most interesting way I met someone. Lol  
See, that's the best way to do it. You surprised even yourself. Can't accidentally spoil the surprise if you don't even know about it!  
This is a freaken amazingly fantastic thing. Hopefully he understands affection with Acts of Service... :) I know I would remember this for decades if someone did this for me. It's actually been a hope of mine to have basically this exact thing happen to me, for years now. 
This is like the happiest thing on Reddit I've read in a long while.  You should sooooo value that you have a relationship like that.  I can really imagine the loving energy in your home and that's so special.  I'm so glad you could pull it off and have so much fun together.  
Why was the cake made up to look like a redfish?  VERY cool of you to pull this off for him! 
I usually get over my shyness by utilising a mild existential crisis about my place in the universe and the mortality of life.  You could also try practising what you'll say in a mirror beforehand.  If all else fails, flee to Alaska, change your name, and get a dock job helping unload fishing trawlers.  
As a guy, I'd love it a girl was flirting/asked me out in the gym. A lot of the time, we're expected to make the first move and that gets so draining.  He'll probably be super flattered. Have you talked to him before, or just been checking him out? 
There's only one thing you'll regret. You'll regret what you never did and could do if you just talked with her.  If you talk with her and nothing came out of it, at least you tried and you won't feel bad about it 
You should just go up to him!   I have a small crush on one of the employees of the gym I go to. I get way too self conscious at the gym to actually approach girls. I look around at all the dudes with hulking muscles and just go "Yea there is no point in trying."   I guess what I'm trying to say is maybe he feels similar, so if you went up to him it might make things easier. 
Don't worry man, it'll come evantually. It took me like 8 months before I talked to my crush even once, second time coming soon I hope/think since we did greet each other when we randomly came across each other (this sounds so pathethic haha) 
You should do it so you can post an update here! Homework :D 
Fuck, well that sucks. Hope a Co-worker shows and you don't have your front door locked. 
Why not call the apartment complex? They should have a copy of your key in the leasing office.  
The sound is made when your finger hits your palm, not the fingers rubbing each other. You're just trying to build up tension so your middle finger hits you palm quickly.  
'bout to go home and enjoy my weekend. Fuck yeah!  Is there skin glue? 
Imagine the people that made the documentary about glue 
I do. Especially when I see peaceful and remote looking cabins on r/cozyplaces but then I start thinking of bugs and spiders and bears. I think I'd like a vacation somewhere like that though 
The grass is always greener. I've lived in rural areas all my life and all I want is to move to a big city, live in a tiny apartment, and see everything the world has to offer.  Cabins in the woods are fun, but I've had that opportunity most of my life. It usually weighs me down after a couple of days. 
I'm so tired. My girlfriend pushes my buttons a lot. Sometimes it's funny but other times it's just frustrating. I'm really hungry but I don't want to get out of bed yet. It's really cozy but it's 10 and I don't want to waste half the day in bed and on Reddit. Today is my dad's birthday so we're probably gonna go out to dinner. My birthday is in a week but I won't even be around to celebrate it with my friends  (going on a cruise to Alaska on that day). I get jealous way too easily. I wonder if anyone has fed our dog yet. If not, I should get up and give her some food. 
*a) my head hurts           b) I am tired             c) yesterday I went to a party                 d) I felt so lonely there                 e) I read a book              f) I ate too much and I kinda feel sick now.* 
I've been both in pain (annoying medical issue) and backsliding into depression lately, both of which I keep getting exasperated-yelled at by my well-meaning mother ("All you do is lie around! Wait, why are you cleaning the house?? Go lie down!"), I've been feeling isolated and bummy and upset, and I need to find a new job asap...  SO. I took my sad bummy ass outside for three hours and went salmonberry picking. Even when everything else is shit being outside in the woods on a beautiful day is healing. I washed the berries and I'm freezing them now. :) 
I'm doing fine, recently got properly into this community, listening to the podcast and joining the Discord server. :) 
Did playing a man so badly bullied by his co-workers have an effect on you IRL?  Also, your dog is awesome. 
Hi Jim!  You sat in front of my friend and I at a performance of Hedwig and the Angry Inch on broadway about two years ago. Not only were you kind enough to introduce yourself and my friend and I stared at you in awe, but you took the time to take a picture with us when the show was over since we weren't allowed to take them in the theater. You were so kind and willing to talk to two awkward 18 year olds so I just wanted to thank you, two years later!  My question is: what's your favorite encounter you've had with a fan? 
Hey Jim Gengurch!  I love your acting in many shows I've seen, especially P&R.   The finale after special refers to you being the most different from your character. Which other actors are most distant from their characters and most similar?!   Also, how much do you miss P&R?! 
Hey Tim,  You've kind of been defined by your role on *Parks & Rec*, but you've had a long and impressive career. Is there one movie or TV show you've been in -- other than *Middle Man* -- that you'd recommend to people looking to see a little more of you? A performance you're particularly proud of? 
Hi Jim!  At one point in P&R, it is referenced that your character has a very large penis. Does that take any method acting on your part? 
Hi!!   Who was the funniest cast member on Parks and Rec and who was the most fun to work with?   Also how similar is Nick Offerman to Ron Swanson? (in my head they're the same person)   Thanks!! 
Hi Jim!  Jerry/Kerry/Larry/Terry/Gary Gengurch was one of my favorite characters. I can relate to being the clumsy one who's always the butt of the jokes. You never failed to make me smile while portraying him.   What are your dog's names, and can you tell me a bit about them? 
Tim,  With this being described as a "black comedy", how was this role different for you in comparison to past roles, and how do you feel audiences will react? 
Was it difficult playing such a wholesome and naive character, when a lot of your other work is so dark and twisted? It's great you have such a wide range. 
Have you been able to keep any interesting props or memorabilia from any of your roles? 
First Aubrey played a character named Lenny in 'Legion' and now you're playing Lenny in 'Middle Man'.  Who do you think the next one from Parks and Recreation to play a Lenny...?  Personally, I'm hoping it is Li'l Sebastian. 
Hey Jim! Big fan of your work, my dad was actually one of the people that invested enough to be an extra in Middle Man so we are super excited to see it in theatres! My question to you is, who has been your all time favorite actor/actress to work with?  Thanks so much! 
Was the cast of Parks and Rec overly nice to you off camera to make up for how Jerry was treated on camera? 
Who was your favourite director and actor that you've worked with? 
How often do you pull a classic Jerry move?  Also: I remember seeing you in a Castle episode, and I swear it was the most amazing thing I've ever seen, as I decided that your character (who was a butcher with anger management issues, if I recall correctly) was Jerry Gergich trying to process everything he was put through in Parks and Rec. 
Would you rather fight 100 Aziz-sized Li'l Sebastians or 1 Li'l Sebastian-sized Aziz?  Credit to /u/GodDamnNameDoesNotFi for the tweak to my original question 
Hi Jim!   If you could be anything other than an actor, what would you be?  
Was the makeout-fest on Late Night planned between you and Aubrey or just improvisation?  
Hi Jim! So Chris Pratt's Kardashian cumback joke has basically become legendary. Were there any other funny moments like that one that didn't make the blooper reel?  
Hey Larry, what did you type into Altavista to get here? 
Ask you anything, eh?  Okay. Let's put this question to bed: Is the reason that Gayle was with Jerry/Terry/Larry/etc., was because of his massive penis?  According to Dr. Harris (whom Chris Traeger said was literally the meanest person he's ever met), it's the biggest penis he's ever seen. I mean, he didn't even know if you had mumps. He forgot to look. He was distracted. By the largest penis. He had ever seen. 
We know of your enormous member thanks to your PandR checkup, but what I really want to know is did you have mumps?  
Hi Jim.  Altoids or Tic-Tacs that night on Seth Meyers?  
Hi Jim, i just want to say that i love your acting, you're extremely funny. The scene when Chris is proposing to Ann while Larry is choking in the back is one of my favorites of the show! Congratulations on the emmy! My question is, Was there any Jerry in the Parks and rec crew? 
Hey Jim, I can't wait to see your new movie, but I'm afraid I have to ask, do you ever see the Parks and Rec gang reuniting in the future?  Maybe for a reboot or even a film? Would love to see you all back one last time. 
I loved you on the show! Who was your best bud on set? 
Hi Jim! Are you a Billy Joel fan? You were married to his ex wife! Also, murinal! Lol 
Hi Jim! Thank you for taking the time to answer some questions.  How do you think your character Lenny and Jerry/Terry/Larry would get along?  If you chose a boys day out for them where would you go? 
Who would win in a mud wrestling match, nick offerman, or chris Pratt?  
Hi Jim!  Has DJ Roomba come back to haunt you with Black Eyed Peas yet?  
Hello Mr. O' Heir,  I am a big fan of your work. You captured the essence of the nice guy who seems to finish last almost  perfectly. I just have to ask, how did you discover the character of Jerry within yourself? He reminds me a lot of myself growing up. I was always helping with stuff but was never acknowledged for it so thank you for embodying that role so well. 
Off the top of your head, what was the funniest parks and rec scene you participated in shooting? 
Hi Jim!  Do you and Chris Pratt keep in touch? Do you keep in touch with the other P&R cast members?    
My sister is a theater teacher for a middle school and we are both huge fans of your role as Jerry in PnR.  Any advice for her class that are about to go into high school theater?  
Which actor/actress on Parks and Rec was most similar to their character? 
Hi Jim! What was your favorite and least favorite episodes to shoot of parks and rec? 
What was it like working with Michael Schur? Is he as comedically inclined as we all believe, or is it just the great casts he has worked with that should take credit? 
Hey Jim. I love your doggos! What are their favorite things to do? 
I was watching Rosanne and was delighted to see you in a random episode. Do have a any cool memories form back then on set and what do you think about the reboot? 
What was your favorite "Gerry-Burn"? Mine was - i know it's kind of basic - the fart attack.  
I loved Jerry (Terry, Gerry) on Parks and Rec. We're there any jokes you made in the outtakes that you wished they used and what were they? 
Are you and Aubrey still a thing?  Who was your favorite guest star on parcs? 
Do you have any thoughts on the passing on Parks and Rec guest star, Glenne Headly? 
Thanks for taking your time Tim!    What do you think about the shows final season? 
How did they feel about learning English? Resentful? Enthusiastic? Indifferent?  
What wildly held belief among your students surprised you the most? 
What kind of measures did you have to go through to make sure your notes or any other evidence of your actual work would never be discovered? 
Hi Suki! I read your book this spring - thank you for writing your experiences; truly enlightening, and also, empathy-invoking. Would you ever go back to DPRK? Do you think you'd be allowed to? Any plans for more books?  
Are there any linguistic things/cultural habits that North Koreans do that the rest of us Koreans also do? Like the "aigoo" and the "oh moh moh" when surprised? 
What ESL teaching methods and approaches were favoured by schools in North Korea? Additionally, what kind of resources/texts were available for you to use in the classroom? 
What made you want to go undercover in North Korea considering all of the dangers? 
What level of access does the DPRK have with the outside world, on a day-to-day basis?  
Hi! Which do you like writing more? Nonfiction or fiction? Do you consider yourself a writer of "Korean-American" literature or does that tag/category bother you?  I thought _The Interpreter_ was a great novel; one of my favorites.  
Hello Ms. Kim.   I enjoy your Twitter posts and found your Guardian piece comparing the political chaos in Korea to the U.S. very enlightening. In your experience, what are the biggest misconceptions Americans have about either North or South Korea?  
Is it true that crystal meth and cannabis use is widespread both rurally and in urban environments? If so, could you describe your experience of this phenomena? 
How long did it take between the time you had this idea and actually going through with it? (Apologies if you covered that in the book, it's been a while since I read it.) 
How much did u make as a teacher? Easy thing to get into (teaching English in N Korea)? Last one - any dangers associated with just teaching in N. Korea?  
Are North Koreans allowed to speak English in Pyongyang? 
In '92-93 I taught English in Prague in the Czech Republic.  Eastern Europe had just been opened up from the communists.  The sense of euphoria among the people was palpable.  Hope exuded from everyone.  I taught businessmen and women who for the first time in their lives had freedom for their entrepreneurial spirit.  They came to me every day with hopes and bottles of champagne.    I'm curious about the demeanor of your students.  I cannot imagine 'hope' was anywhere around.  How can one teach without hope?  Thx and best wishes. 
What was the best thing you've eaten in North Korea? 
What use do they have for English if they never get to leave? 
How is the adpocalypse affecting you and the broader tech YouTube community? 
Hi Linus!  How much shit do you get for your footwear choice? 
So Linus, what video do you hate the most on all of your channels? And why? 
Hey Linus, any plans to bring back Kickfarted?  Working off that, are there any other "series" that you plan on continuing (like the workshop?) I love your content across all three channels, keep it up! 
Hey Linus, what's probably the most exciting project that you've done on the channel (LTT)? 
Linus, did the "walking in the rain" video have the effect you wanted? Just curious as it's quite out of character from the rest of your content.  
Hi Linus, was it a conscious decision to remove the part at the end of Scrapyard Wars when the teams share the specs of their builds and the prices of everything? If so, why did you make that decision? The reactions from the teams over what parts everyone found have been one of my favorite things to see. I believe much of the community agrees that we want to see that part on season 6, even if it is included as some sort of like director's cut, specials, or whatever you want to get another video out.  
Hi Linus, can we get a updated ofice tour youtube video? 
Hey Linus! Thanks for doing the ama :)  What kind of video would you like to make which you still have not had the chance to make, because you lack resources or something related to the idea? 
What's the most expensive thing you have ever broken? 
Any recommendations for best cable management practices? Zipties? Velcroes? Twine? 
Linus, you helped me build my first computer while you were at NCIX so thanks for that!  Do you ever regret making a company with your name in it? Do you ever get grief for that from coworkers or random fans? 
hey Linus, where do you and the team see the company and the channel in the next few years, especially with all of YouTube's recent and coming policy changes? 
Hey Linus, I'm a long time fan! I've got your Noctua fans in my system and I'm a floatplane pilot. It's been mesmerising seeing you jump from height to height, going from NCIX to where you are today and it's truly inspiring.  My question to you is, how do you unwind and relax at the end of the day after working so hard for so long? 
How often do you work with other tech YouTubers like Kyle Jay, Paul, and them? Is it more a business relationship or do you all text and talk often? 
Is Luke getting his own space for Floatplane Club, and how separated is he going to be from the rest of the crew? 
Will LTX become a regular yearly thing? (PLEASE? :D) 
What upcoming product are you and the team most excited to get a review sample on? 
I'm curious if the upgrade to RED equipment seemed "worth it" to you?  In the end you dropped big bucks on not only the (IMO) extremely overpriced RED cameras and their required accessories, but also a huge new storage server to hold the footage, and new editing workstations to be able to edit the footage more easily.  It seems like a pretty massive upgrade when your quality was already very solid.  
@edzel: Do you prefer Final Cut or Premier?   @brandon: What is your favorite camera that you personally own?   @luke: Thoughts about E3 so far?   @linus: What has been your favorite video that you've hosted?  
Do you prefer to film scripted videos or do you like the more "freestyle" Videos like random unboxings?   Personally I love the crazy unscripted videos, or videos like about you almost loosing all your data. Those make LTT for me! 
How do you balance your personal time with your wife and kid against work time? 
Given unlimited Budget, what would be a video that you would like to shoot? Most interested in answers from Linus and Brandon. 
Hi Linus, how much of your time actually goes into making content nowadays, compared to how much of it is needed for managing the business? 
Good afternoon to all at LMG, I was wondering how hard it was for you guys to develop into what you've become? How did you build the reputation you have across youtube and the computing world as an important group, and how do you deal with things like hiring new people? I imagine that a large number of people want to get in for fame and recognition, how do you deal with that vetting process?  
Hey Luke, are you still trying to switch to Linux? I'm still using Windows for gaming on my main PC, but switched to Ubuntu (and now to Arch) on my laptop. It's a great experience, especially for programming 
Hi Linus, would you ever take your ear piercings out/get any more? 
Is there something that you have always wanted to do on YouTube (maybe as a fun challenge) but didn't really fit on any of your channels so you decided against it? 
This question is for Luke specifically. Do you still regret not using flowers for Scrapyard wars? :3  
How much will the videos be delayed because of this AmA? 
Hey Linus, what's with the nails in some of your videos? 
Hi Linus,  How do you deal with people outside of the YouTube community when trying to explain what you do for a living? You've made great strides in creating your own company, was it ever difficult trying to get loans or other business backing (outside of the tech industry like when you got the warehouse) with such a unique company?   Also, what do you tell your kids your job is? Any ideas on what awesome build to bring for your first "Parent Show and Tell" event in a few years? ;p 
Hi Linus.  Did you feel the growth in Linus Tech Tips as it got on and on or was more of a "Holy crap we're bigger than i thought" kind off a thing? 
What's one piece of tech that you'd love to see come back or updated, and one piece of tech that just needs to stop? 
What's happening to the old workstations now that you've upgraded to x99? Are they just being thrown out, or will there be some kind of giveaway? 
Hey Luke! Are you still planning to finish your engineering studies? 
Do you watch other Youtube channels? What are some of your favorite ones? 
With the talk about Luke moving into new offices for FPC, is FPC growing much faster than expected? And will the two branches of LMG remain in separate locations or is it just temporary? I don't want Luke to leave, I like watching the whole crew and Wan show with him in :( 
Hey guys! Are you ever going to do another PC build in mineral oil? The last one was very captivating to watch.  
Any chance for a follow up video on Linus' Civic?        Perhaps RGB lighting :) 
Hi LMG, I have two questions.  1: What are some of the perks of working in such close proximity with the CEO of the company?   2: When new members are added does everyone get less work or the same amount ?  
Oh man... Is there any reason not to make content "Linux" related? It would be such a good thing if you could just check how Linux works out of the box in all those laptops you review...  And thank you for such an amazing channel!!! 
How different is working at LMG for you original Members nowadays with more people?  Do you miss the old days with only a handful working together?  
What's the most gut-wrenching moment you guys have ever experienced when building a computer? Commercially or personally.  I'll never forget spending every last penny I had saved for months on a 2nd hand GTX 670, only to plug it in and have no response. Thankfully it was the PSU, but after a couple restarts my heart still sank.  
Linus, have you ever watched Mr. Robot? What is your opinion about it? 
Hey there Linus, why do look so depressed taking that picture for the ama?  
What is the future for LTT? Do you guys collectively or individually have any ideas for new shows, ideas or challenges? How does Floatplane tie into it? Thanks! 
Do you want your kids to be tech savvy as you are or just let them be what they wanna be?? He was team red the way he chose all the red colored parts when building a pc with you lol  
Why does LTT base everything on "How good is this for gaming"? 
Kyle from BitWit is using Youtube Premium to achieve early release videos to subscribers. Why not use that format instead of re-inventing the wheel with FPC? 
What is your end game for LTT/LMG?   Will you start a PC web-store similar to NCIX/Newegg/etc..? 
Hi Linus, I love your channel and watch it basically every day, how do you find the creativity to come up with a new video every day? 
Luke, Ed, and Brandon:   Is how much creative freedom do you guys get? Or put another way, are the channels "The Linus Show with supporting characters" or is there feedback from most of you guys as to what you want to do?  Second question, whos idea was the $130K+ worth of RED Weapon gear (not including Petabyte Project)? Was Linus really that shocked when he read the pricing invoice? 
Any camera related videos in the pipeline? Haven't seen Brandon in the spotlight recently 
Hi linus, what is the current state of float plane club and how close do you think you are before other channels start to use your platform?  
What was your reaction when super soakers became as successful as they did? Are any of your other patents as recognizable in their respective fields? Did super soakers help you jumpstart any of your other research either through funding or recognition  
what's your opinion of foam dart guns? And do you have any good puns related to nuclear energy? 
What's the strangest reaction you've come across when people find out you invented the super soaker?  
Will we ever see a toy water propulsion system better than the super soaker or is the super soaker the peak of toy water propulsion technology? 
We can clearly see this product was a hit. Can you tell us about one of your failures, or inventions that didn't "take off"?  Thanks for making childhood a blast 
Was it an instant success? How long did it take to become popular? 
I remember the first time i saw a Super Soaker when my family was on vacation in Florida. It was a Super Soaker 50 and I knew I had to have one. When we got home my mom got me one. My friend down the street got a Super Soaker 100 and I was never able to compete in a fire fight which made me so frustrated with my beloved SS50. I still schooled all of the plebs with inferior non SS products. That was fun. No question here. Thanks for the memories!  What are some of your favourite childhood toy memories? 
Is it true that the world of toy merchandising is super-cutthroat and full of industrial espionage? 
Is it true that you are working on a super super soaker contract for the department of defense? 
Hey man!  How did you realize Hasbro was undercutting your royalties?  What are you doing for fun these days?? 
What is the secret to make a super soaker shoot really far? 
What's the strangest use you've seen for a Super Soaker? 
Any wisdom to offer about life?  Clearly, you were a smart guy on a good path. But was there anything beyond, *Oh, that would be a cool watergun*, that led you to create one of the most successful toys ever? 
Is there a Super Soaker model which reached an unexpected commercial success? Likewise, is there a model which failed to meet expectations? 
So, do you get free super soakers? If so, I can imagine that a weekend at grandpa's would be pretty awesome.  
How does it feel to be a part of millions of people's childhoods?  
Do you have a giant wall / room in your house dedicated to displaying every super soaker ever made?   If so, can we see this holy super soaker hall of fame of yours? 
you said it was an accident, what were you working on or trying to create when you made the super soaker? 
Do you feel that other nuclear engineers judge you because of the Super Soaker? Don't get me wrong, but in such a high-level industry, it feels very easy to become the "water toy" guy. 
When it was being designed, did you or anyone else wonder, "Hmm, are people going to convert these things into flamethrowers?"  
What's your opinion on the fidget spinner? Is it just a fad to be forgotten or a classic here to stay? 
I understand that the JTEC could be used at nuclear power plants. Is it possible to apply that technology to nuclear reactors on aircraft carriers, or other nuclear powered vessels? If so, do you think there will ever be government contracts to install one of these converters on a carrier? 
What is the best invention or idea you've had that for whatever reason never really materialized? 
Did you ever expect it to take off in popularity the way it did? 
What kind of Super Soaker ideas were left on the cutting room floor? 
Do you feel that as the inventor of the super soaker it overshadows, or causes other scientists to be reluctant, of any scientific work that you undertake?  
I gotta ask did the super soaker pay off ???? If so how comfortable are you?  
I have many ideas, but so afraid to move forward in them because I fear they will be stolen and I well . . I don't think I can handle watching a million dollar idea be stolen from me while I cannot afford legal representation to fight it off.  Uh, how did you overcome that fear (if you had it that is)?  
Were you ever paranoid that you'd received bait money or that somebody saw you get into your vehicle, or were you really that calm? I don't have the bone in my body that would allow me to do something like rob a bank, but if I did I would imagine id be super paranoid about trying to deposit the money. 
Was your wife or family aware that you were robbing banks? Was this a dirty secret?  
What's the most cash you ever got from a single robbery? 
How much thought and planning did you put into it beforehand? Did you have a clean getaway car, pre selected route, etc?  Did you scout banks and pick the best times? Or did you just decide to up and hit one? 
Would you want your experiences to be made in to a movie? 
If you'd be able to tell your 10 year old self one thing, what line of crime would you recommend him? 
Do you think you'll ever rob a bank again? If not, why not? 
How do you think the world of robbing banks has changed since you were doing it? While the cameras are slightly better than they used to be, it seems that very few bank robbers actually get caught barring ridiculous stupidity. Even those whose faces are caught on camera walk out of the bank with typically a couple grand and no consequences thereafter.  Considering it is a federal offense, I am curious as to how seriously you believe law enforcement takes some of these robberies, given how small the quantity of money is and nobody being harmed in the process. It seems as though, given the lack of news coverage on such small time jobs and the lack of anyone ever being caught, that someone could easily rob a bank or two and continue life and working their 9-5 job as though nothing ever happened 
If you drop an object into the goal of a foosball table (let's say a cell phone) and you can't get it out by hand is there any way to remove it without somehow destroying the table? 
How did it feel always living on the edge like that? Always looking over your shoulder and trying not to get arrested? 
Is it a lot harder to get a job after robbing banks? 
Did you ever leave a calling card, or take any trivial souvenirs? 
I am an unarmed security guard that worked in a variety of banks to be that first response for when people rob banks. So if you ever seen that commercial where someone robs a bank and everyone turns to the security guard and say, "I'm not a security guard. Im a security monitor", that's me!  My question: when you see a 3rd party officer, is what is your reaction and what do you to get around them? Does it make the robbery and easier.   Because I always said as soon as someone pointed a weapon or threatened my life, I was quiting right there. 
Do you feel guilty about how the tellers must have felt being robbed? 
Let's cut the shit here and tell us, are there Bank Robber groupies? 
First off, thanks for the book, secondly, the heist scene in Heat (i.e. Where they're actually in the bank / controlling the staff and punters) *felt* pretty authentic, was it?  Also, what other films have shown the craft well? 
How many years of your sentence did you actually serve? I see in your attached proof the sentence date is 2008 for 20 years, so release 2028, but as far as I am aware it is 2017. 
What are your thoughts on your fifth grade teacher? 
What was your education level at the time of your crime spree and do you feel anything in your upbringing would have swayed you from NOT robbing banks?   I would rather my children not rob banks for fun.  
I was robbed at gunpoint when I was 20. I have a lot of hatred towards the man who decided that was a good idea. It made me have panic attacks and eventually caused me to quit a job I loved and was good at.   Do you ever think about the tellers who were on the other side? Do you feel any remorse for what you put them through?  
When you decided to turn yourself in, how long did you expect your sentence to be? 
I am very curious, if you never wore a mask or gloves, how were you never caught? Also how did you handle the threat of being caught at any time of any day? 
If a teller had refused to give you any money, what would you have done?  Did that ever happen? 
Was your family in shock when they found out you were going to prison? What was they're reaction?  I saw in your previous AMA that you only admitted to robbing three of the countless banks you robbed, could you still be tried for any remaining robberies if they figured it out/potentially see a thread like this?  Thank you in advance! I am very intrigued by your story and just want to wish you well for whatever the futre holds for you. 
What was it specifically about robbing banks that appealed to you? Why not any other type of theft/crime?  
This probably a naive question, but we're you nervous when going to jail? Because everyone seems to make it out like if you don't join a group in there your just going to get shanked or some shit.  
How did cameras never catch you or how did the teller never report your face? 
I'm about to start grad school in order to become a psychologist working in the prison system, is there anything that you experienced in prison that you would be willing to share in order to give me a better idea of what I'm getting myself into? 
How was Dave Ramsey off mic?   Lame question, but honestly just wanted to say thanks for the book and you were definitely the most interesting guest on the show. 
Is there anything a teller could have done to spoil your plans? If so, what? 
Odd question... If you take your total haul and divide it by your time served in hours plus the time to commit and plan the work... what are your hourly earnings for robbing a bank over your lifetime? 
I think I know you. Did you ever live on the 23rd floor of a building in Austin? 
What would you do if the teller said no when you handed them the note demanding money? I use to be a teller and was always curious what would happen if I refused.  
Would you consider bank robbing a sort of "gateway illegal activity" and you still crave the feeling of doing something bigger or have you just called it quits? 
What did your notes say? Why would people just hand you money in exchange for a note 
If you didn't go to prison would you be better or worse? 
I robbed banks too!  Small world huh?  Yeah my parents and siblings never suspected a thing when i took an extra 20 or 50 from the monopoly bank.  I knew only to take small bills so they wouldn't get suspicious.  So glad i got that off my chest.  I feel better now. 
Are public land giveaways determined by Congress or are their things that state/local governments can do to chip away at these protections? 
They must have kept this very quiet, given that I work for one of the agencies in charge of these public lands and am completely unaware of these attempts at sell-offs.  With that in mind, can I ask you what you think of the State owned vs. Federally owned public lands argument?  For those of you that grew up (like I did) back east, you may not be aware of what a privilege it is to have Public Lands out here in the West.  Cattle and people both roam freely out here, there is land aplenty for recreation of all kinds, it really is an entirely different feeling than the eastern half of the country where there is a constant questioning of whose land you're on and if you're allowed to be there doing what you're doing. 
Not sure if this is quite relevant, but what kind of enforcement do lumber companies have in making National Forest land "private"? I'm a big fan of my local NF, El Dorado National Forest, but when just wandering around or exploring it's almost impossible to really explore and enjoy the isolation due to "No trespassing, property of (lumber company)" signs that seem to surround both sides of every road that keep anyone from really going anywhere off the road. On top of that, they put up locked gates, metal barriers or just simply tear up the forest with bulldozers to make trenches to keep people out. Is this legal? 
How do you feel about tribes buying culturally important land? 
Is it possible for private citizens to purchase these lands? There's some state owned Adirondack parkland near me that my family would love to take under our stewardship, if only to assure its well-being. 
Are there specific companies that profit from this? 
Considering how, in the west of the country, enormous amounts of States' lands lie in federal hands, can it really be said that vast untapped territories are really rendering the nation any service?  Why is it ethical for the federal government to requisition land and bar the public from purchasing it? What of States' sovereignty? 
Out of curiosity, and it may have little to do with the issue, but is that anything like the eminent domain issues were currently facing in the small town where I live?  
What can I do to have the government give me free public land? I then want to turn around and sell it to somebody else for a profit. Ideally, I'd like my land to be mineral rich or oceanfront. You know what? Just let them know I'll take all of it. I'm not even greedy, I'll settle for half.   Please and thank you.   Also, what's your favorite piece of baseball equipment?  
* How would you get the two sides to start communicating? I know people like to play the blame game, but it's the fault of who's in charge of both parties  * Media is here to sway people's opinions reporting on things without facts. When did the media take such a bad turn? 
What can we do to get hunters and hikers to partner up and protect public lands?  
How recoverable will these lands be? Unless America continues on its current path of self destruction and ignorance, I am forced to believe the next president will be a sane one who will want to undo this. How easily can it be undone, if at all? Are the drilling practices they plan to use going to permanently damage these areas? Once given away can we not get them back? What is the long-term assessment for regaining these lands for the public or have we lost them for good? 
Where can I get information on how I can buy this land? Is it just going to be auctioned off? 
why don't you think states should oversee their own land? could you explain your position on that? shouldn't people that live in that state control the land there not someone in D.C.? 
What other people/organizations do you feel are doing the most to fight against the transfer of federal land?  Is there anyone or any organizations that you feel could do the greatest amount of good with our support? 
What's the problem in giving land back to the states to take care of? Seems like it's a 6 to one, half a dozen to the other scenario?? 
Is the land actually decent? AKA not like when they sold it to fools gold rushers back in the day? Or will people be stuck with 5 acres of gorgeous desert in the middle of nowhere?  Can you choose your location?   Is this some sort of land lease program where you'll have to give the government every cent you make off the land until you die - aka what's the catch?  
Why do you support unconstitutional federal holding of property? How is it ok for 80% of Nevada to be federal instead of state or private, when the Feds have no enumerated power to hold it and by common law the lease holders should have ownership rights? 
I'm a baby journalist, freshman in college! Any advice on breaking into the industry? I already schmooze with the higher ups for advice and work on the school paper, trying to open an investigative unit.  
What's your stance on the vast federal lands in the western United States? Should those not designated as parks or military  bases  be given back to the  states? 
I'm a libertarian, I firmly believe that the government should not be involved with anything & a great stepping stone toward that would be States Rights. That being said, my least "libertarian" stance is that of the environment. There needs to be a "higher power" to protect our gorgeous land. I would much rather National Parks exist by the state than say, McDonald's. What is the difference between federal land & state land? Shouldn't individual states decide what to do with their land?  
Do you seriously consider yourself a non-biased journalist with no personal agenda here? 
How is giving away federally owned land to the states wrong? It's absolutely silly for the federal government to own vast tracks of land and charge people for its usage. The government doesn't in any way use "public lands" responsibly by not allowing the states to use it. Local governments exist for a reason, because local governments can serve local interests. If you want the land used responsibly you should want the land to be under the control of the people who live there, not under the control of the federal government which is phenomenally difficult for anyone to hold to account. 
So why is this a bad thing? It gives people the opportunity to purchase land? Land is only going to appreciate so it looks like a great investment opportunity for people. 
What's the matter with the Federal Government giving land to the states in which those lands exist? 
Did you have any memorable moments encountering wildlife? 
What is the night sky like in the middle of the ocean where there is no light pollution? 
How did it feel going that long without a shower?  I can only imagine how gross that must have felt....  
You mentioned rowing through a hurricane..  How does one even do that? How do you manage yo keep a rowboat upright through a hurricane or tropical storm? 
What was the hardest or most dangerous part of your journey? 
What was the plan if the boat was damaged and sank? Was there a small life raft in the boat somewhere? Handheld emergency beacons? 
How long were you into it before you said "Man, what the heck am I doing?" 
Did the boat have everything you needed or were there support type vessels with you? If so, what kind of services did they provide you?   Also, does your mental state become an issue? I feel like I'd start to get a little funny doing the same thing day in and day out for 2 months. 
What was a typical day like, what were you eating? 
Did you see any sharks, whales, wildlife of any kind? 
Wow this is extremely inspiring.  Might have to try and do something like this within the next couple of years.  Were there any times you were scared for your life? 
What was the first meal you ate when you got back?   This is one the coolest and most fascinating AMAs I have ever read. What an adventure!  
What did you use for navigation?  If your electrical system failed what would you rely on to know your position? 
You mentioned that upon your return your family/friends(?) claimed you couldn't keep a normal conversation. Do you feel different?  
wow that's amazing.. were you bored at any point?  
That's absolutely incredible! How did it feel being in a tiny boat, knowing how incredibly deep the ocean underneath you was? Also, how did you get all the way across and still spell 'Atlantic' wrong?  
Wicked chaco tan. Why did you even wear shoes at all?   Also, this is a super quality AMA. Reading it has been inspiring and awesome. 
How long did you train?   Which season and route was best?   When is the inspirational Disney Release?   Can you too the door from a fridge? (Lats)   Peace out  
What's your favourite sea shanty? Any spontaneous renditions of "row row row your boat?" 
Who sings louder? I tried finding it in your videos but wasn't able.  
How much rowing dod you do in prep for the journey? 
Were you both conscious of the "Personal time" a human needs when at sea for 58 days? Did you accommodate for that or just ignore it? 
1. How did decide when was the best time to leave? 2. How long did you estimate that it would take? 3. Was there any romantic activity between you and George on the trip and if either of you were not single, how did your s.o. feel about you being in a boat with someone else? 4. What was the plan in case something horrible happened? 5. How much weight did you lose by the time you were done? 6. Were you noticeably stronger after rowing for ~60 straight days? 7. How'd you poop and pee and what'd you do with the toilet paper?    
How much food did you have to take? Was it mainly tinned/dried food? 
Man I hate even swimming in the ocean where I can't see whats around me, and you manage to travel across an entire sea!  How were you okay with the fact that you're in this small boat with hundred of miles of sea under you?  That seems terrifying. 
I have a couple of questions.  Looking through the pictures, it looks like neither of you lost much weight (not that there was much weight to lose in the first place). Was this due to a lack of exercising that you could do?  Also, did you guys end up having any sex during the row? 
Oh My God! I never even thought that's possible! Amazing and congratulations! Why? :)  
Did you arrive in Antigua? Seems like Antigua is the place. There was 3 or 4 that just did the same thing in the last couple of years (trying to break the record for time).  
Why did you choose a 3 hour on and 3 hour off shift? Was there a reason behind not choosing a longer shift? 
I didn't even know this was a thing that people did. What is the history of this type of endeavour? Also, go big red! 
I know George's dad. He was the judge who married me. My question is: What's up? 
Who designed and built the boat? How much would that cost? 
Any surprises along the way?  Would you do anything different on your next ocean row? 
On a personal level, what are some of your favorite films? 
Two questions (if that's ok)   How did you get back home (if you did lol)?  What were you feeling/thinking when you left?   I'm just an adventurer, who plans on traveling.   Thanks!  
Did you ever get bored? What'd you do to pass time? How did you manage 58 days without a shower didn't you get all rashy? I know I do if I go like 3-4 days without a shower much less 58. 
1) How did you guys stay clean? Was it even an issue? 2) Watching your video, seems like dryness was an issue, any recommendations in hind-sight? 3) Could your average in shape person do this? 4) Would it be possible to do an 8 hr on 8 hr off shift? 5) Have you ever done a long backpacking trip? How would this compare to doing say a week long 100 mile 30k elevation gain trip in terms of daily effort? Obviously a lot longer, but I hope my question is at least somewhat clear?  
How often are you on Reddit and what are your favorite subreddits? 
What other outdoor sporting activities are you really good at? 
How did you 2 not get major sunburn? Did you each have a gallon of sunblock supply in which you could  apply some every day ? 
How long after you hit land did your body still feel the movement of the ocean? 
Would you want to write or co-write a book about the rowing trip? 
How, did you get 2 months away from work? Are your bosses that nice and generous?   And When you you got home did you go straight back to work or were you able to relax and get a massage and day spa treatment? 
I read about some of the snacks you brought on board...did you guys make sure your freeze dried meals had efficient calories for that kind of exercise?  What about salts to retain water, macronutrients? Was that tracked or thought about very much? Did you lose weight during the journey?  Thanks! 
How did you get involved in something like this? I rowed in college, but crossing an ocean is another thing entirely.  
Did your journey involve crying? I just watched a documentary on 4 women who rowed the Pacific. There was crying.  
Did you get enough food? how/what did you eat to get enough energy?  Remember seeing someone doing this in the pacific and they got burgers flown in by helicopter near the end 
Were you the first boat to finish the race? If not, then how long did it take the winners to finish? Did everyone finish the race? 
How did you achieve sleep on the crossing? Did one of you sleep while the other rowed or kept watch for some weather issue that would need both of you awake and alert? Or did you sleep at the same time? Seems dangerous, but I'm completely out of my element on this one. I start panicking when I lose sight of land, so this achievement of yours is, in my mind, someone performing the completely impossible. Congratulations to you both!! 
Did you see any cool animals on your trip? Any sharks or scary moments? 
How often do you talk about your rowing trip at bars and parties and people don't believe you so you have to show them the proof you showed us Redditors? 
What did you 2 forget on shore that you had room for and would have been helpful or enjoyable to have onboard for the trip? 
You are an amazing role model, Patti!  I love it when you and your peers pop up on letsrun to offer wisdom and commentary.   Do you think track & field "needs" to be more popular as a spectator sport? 
I'm glad I read your story, it's amazing how it all started with wanting to "be nice to yourself". So many of us, especially as young girls, we are often pressured to be a certain way, because of society, that we get to stuck in what others want from us. You broke through that, and it's so inspiring!, and incredible. It reminded me that it's been years since I've been really nice to myself, and then I stop. Being over weight I know it's something I need to be healthier over all but it's sooo incredibly hard, and even embarrassing to go workout at the gym, thinking, how did I get this far?. Anyways, it was delightful, and motivating to know of you Mrs.Patti, may you you be an empowerment for women/girls always!. 
First, I would like to thank you for helping pave the way in women's athletics. I just started running about three years ago and have been nothing but supported by my friends, family, and the running community, and I feel very thankful that I didn't have to face the same kind of challenges to competing that you and other leading women did.  Second, I was wondering how many years it took you to build up to 120 mpw. Obviously at seven miles for your first run, you've got a solid head start on most of the population. Did you jump pretty quickly into the 40s, 50s, and 60s, and then take a longer time to build up from there or did you find yourself well-suited to high mileage very early on?  If you ever find yourself on reddit again, we'd love to have you hang out with us over at /r/advancedrunning! 
What tribe are you from? Do you ever go to reservations and speak to the children/people?  I think this is so inspiring. We have a womens running group on my reservation and we participate in many runs. From 5ks-100 milers.  
Through your years of competition and training what injuries would you say are most common? I know that many people warn about knee issues but I never really hear many athletes themselves complain about knee problems. 
You wrote that you are restarting your career.  What did you do in the years between your running glory and now? 
Would you rather have Prefontaine's flowing locks or Mills's buzz cut? 
Great write up for the introduction!   At the end you said you're restarting your career. Does that mean your running career? If yes, is there anywhere you post online as to how you are progressing, that I can follow and keep track of?   All the best! 
Hello! You seem  a wonderful person!  I'm not a runner (i play tennis though) and I really admire what you do! I can't run half an hour whithout feeling dead, lol. My questions are  1)What advice would you give to a young athlete?  2)Which books would you recommend? (not related to running, sorry)  3)How do you deal with exhaustion? It's a huge problem for me.  Thank you very much for this AMA!  Love from Italy!  
When you started the Be Nice To Patti Campaign, how did you go about setting personal boundaries and not giving in to those, especially in personal and professional relationships? 
What do you think is missing for female athletes when it comes to care from doctors, trainers etc?  I've noticed that most is focused towards a male genetic make up and female athletes are mostly left to fill in the gaps for how their system works.  How did you account for that in your training and self care? 
How do you feel pregnancy impacts women's ability to sustain top class performance? I've read some articles suggesting it can actually improve performance post-pregnancy. 
I seem to be having a problem getting back into running. When I was in my 20s I ran 5km a day no problem. Now every time I go to run my smoke seems to go out and I have to stop and relight it every 100m. Do you have any advice? 
What do you think about during long runs? Does your mind just kind of empty and you go through the motions? 
I love your story and it really inspired me as somebody who's intro to running was similar to yours. At what point did you decide to start training for races? Did something or somebody inspire you to start racing, or was it more of a spontaneous decision? 
I always get shin splints about a mile into every run, any tips on avoiding/reducing shin splints? Should I keep running/stretch it out or just stop and try and go farther before next my run.  
This is great! Thanks for doing this! I used to run around Quincy a lot, mostly by the water (I would pass the old Beachcomber), and had a nice 10k loop.   My question is: Do you wish you had the chance for the Olympics in 1980? I don't think they had the women's marathon until 1984 and there was the boycott in 1980, but maybe you could have made it in the 10K? Did you try at all for the '84 team?  
What do you think about on long runs? Do you daydream? Fantasize about something? Where does your mind go or do you experience a sort of 'Highway hypnosis' during a long run? 
I just started running a month ago. I see the future runner me as going fast and long. Do you have any tips you'd give me right from the start?  
Hi Patti! Thanks for your contributions to sports and getting women more involved in athletics. What's your favorite fruit? 
What's your experience with doping? Did you do it? Observe it? Did you see anyone that was a really weak runner turn into an amazing one? 
How does it feel to have to add the "for a woman" or "for a minority" qualifier to all of your achievements?   
Did you ever use recovery techniques like aqua jogging? How effective did you find them? Asking for a friend... 
Hey! Thanks for doing this and all you do, and a lot of these questions are great, but here's a fun one! What's your guilty pleasure food? 
I'm struggling through a big mental block right now. Do you have any tips on how to stay on track?  
Hi! I get winded and tired so easily when i run.  how do you build endurance? 
do you still like baseball nut? i like it as a shake, myself. 
This is awesome. You are awesome! I've been having excellent strength progress on my powerbuilding program but I want to run well too and I'm including running goals on my plan TODAY!!!  What were some of your first running goals regarding distance and time? I think I will focus more on speed than resistance to use the advantage I have right now and build upon it. Thank you so much for your story! 
Hey thanks probably late but, did you hear Haskell closed the track program ? 
Maybe I'm late, but I've gotta know - How many pairs of shoes have you gone through? How many miles would you wear a pair before replacing them?  Your post was definitely inspirational. I've never been a great runner after a couple knee injuries/surgeries, but I feel like I should start again and try to knock a few pounds off.  
Something potentially off topic but I'm part Mi'kmaq as well, grew up in Halifax, I was wondering where you're mother was from in NS? 
This is such an amazing story Patti! I am so inspired! I myself recently started running and training for a half marathon when I previously couldn't even do a mile at the beginning of the year. Now I can run up to 8 miles and will be doing my first half at the end of June!   What are some tips that you have for your speed? And also, how do you motivate yourself to run when you feel tired, sick, or just down? Sometimes after work, I'm very tired and can't bring myself to do anything.  
You're probably never going to see this, but I wanted to say that your story is so freaking inspiring. Also we have the same birthday, are the same height, and I've also been enrolled at Quincy College! I've just been wanting to knock my 5k under 20 minutes and qualify for Boston...maybe I'll set bigger goals for myself!  How did you avoid getting injured during your quick rise to an elite level? 
How does it feel to answer all of these questions? What kind of questions are the best in your opinion? 
Kiwi are amazing! They're my favorite fruit, do you eat the skin or do you peel/bowl the fruit? 
Uh, you're white. Not Native American. Stop culturally appropriating? 
What does Ticketmaster do with all the pain they harvest from the souls they rip off at the box office? 
What "insider tips" do you have to get good tickets?  Can I bribe a Ticketmaster employee for good seats?? :-) 
ive been doing that for almost 3 years! my theater is going dark for 3 months now and i am jobless try as i might.   which ticketmaster did you use? we had an old school version TMWin99 
Why did they switch to Ticketmaster?   Did Ticketmaster convince them to through a sales pitch or did they just go out and select the most famous and biggest broker without looking at all the competitors of Ticketmaster?  Why did they no longer sell in house? What reason did they give? 
Are there any advantages to showing up in person at the box office to get tickets vs. online? 
Did you primarily do business in sports or theater sales where you were located? Always wondered what these jobs entailed, to be honest. 
What was the average "convenience fee" for tickets there? 
Have you ever done the water driving range at the GSR? 
What was the busiest day of the week at work?  What was the slowest hour of the week?  What was the busiest hour of the day at work?  What was the slowest hour of the day? 
Do you think any other options will be available in the future to purchase tickets? I know some bands like Pearl Jam have tried but have failed. Or, what would it take to overcome the power of Ticketmaster? On a side note, I met one of the multi millionaire early investors of TM. I can't remember his name. It wasn't Paul Allen but he was up there and the guy was creepy as fuck. 50 years old dressed in all black wearing Gucci shoes. Just gave us the creeps.  
Was the turnover at the box office as bad as it was everywhere else at the GSR? Also, how did you feel about the horrible management?  
How often are you on Reddit and what are your favorite subreddits? 
Hey there fellow Reno area guy. What happened to the prop airplane from Hello Hollywood, Hello? 
So how did GSR feel after Amy Schumer spent the first 15 minutes of her act talking shit about the venue?  For background: she was originally booked for their Grand Theater, which is one of the best venues in town. Then they decided to do renovations on the theater and they moved her to a convention room with ziptied dining chairs and a temporary stage. 
Before tickets go on sale to the public, what percentage of tickets are already sold off? 
Hey man, thanks for doing this. I'm a little late to the party but hoping you see this.. have a couple of questions.  1) What's to prevent people from using Ticketmaster as a "showroom" of sorts then converting to the venue's website and purchasing from there to avoid the Ticketmaster fees? Does Ticketmaster own the inventory or do they have exclusivity via the contract, etc. Could you shed some light here?  2) What's Ticketmasters opinion of the secondary market (stubhub, seatgeek, etc.)?  2a) Does Ticketmaster price to discourage resale? Or are they in collusion with the secondary market to maximize value to each channel?  3) Do you have an opinion of Nathan Hubbard? Think he probably predates you but he seems to understand the pain consumers go through when acquiring tickets (although he didn't really do too much about it).  4) Final request - give me your insider's-opinion on how we fix this market for the consumer. 
So I read that the whole idea of Ticketmaster is to throw extra fees on and take the pressure off of the artist or venue.  For example.   Better for your favorite singer to charge $50 a ticket with Ticketmaster throwing on $20 in fees as compared to $65 for the ticket and $5 for the fees.   Their whole model is to take the ire of the fans off of the artist/venue.   That is why they don't have competition.  Have you heard this, do you know if it is true? 
What hours of the day did you work?  How many hours did you work per week? 
How much does Ticketmaster give to politicians so that they don't get regulations and laws written against their anti-competion and anti-consumer friendly rules and prices? 
How often do you get to Lake Tahoe and the Ski Slopes nearby? 
What is your most angry Customer story?  What was the funniest moment at work? 
What would you have loved to have to make your job easier and/or customers' lives easier? 
Grand Sierra in Reno? Stayed there about 10 years ago. Pretty swanky.  
I just bought tickets Yo a local show and Ticketmaster sold my address to a ton of advertisers. How do I tell them to fuck off? I don't remember checking any sell my address boxes. My email was never bombarded with so much spam. It's all "music related" and conveniently says it comes from "not Ticketmaster".  I know it was them, it showed up directly after I bought tickets.  
I do Broadway-related things, and i want to pursue a career in it. What info can you give me regarding how my role (pun intended) could play in relation toward ticket sales? How could my performances promote to certain companies like StubHub or Ticketmaster?  
I'm probably dropping in too late but I recently bought tickets online to a concert. I knew when they would be going on sale so I was ready before hand. By the time I got to choose my seats the whole show was nearly booked. How can that be? If all seats go on sale at the same time, how are so many already sold as soon as they go on sale?  
what is a convenience fee? Can you make it inconvenient for me and not charge me this fee? 
Why is it that, when I tried to buy U2 tickets at the minute they went on sale, they were instantly sold out, but that there were hundreds of tickets on sale via TM in the days and weeks before the show date?   
Hey, cool! Another box office person! I manage a major theater's box office. Some years ago, I also worked at a box office that served as our city's only TicketMaster outlet (now long gone.) I fell into box office by accident, needing stable income to support my stage management habit, which ended up developing into a career. How did you end up in box office? Do you want to continue with that career path? I'm currently hiring at my box office, and none of my applicants have previous experience in the field. What do you recommend saying to fresh newbies? 
How do you feel about the annual arrival of the burners?  
Are they paying for your chemo treatments? I hear that company is cancer incarnate.  
Do brokers get the advantage of presale (and the better seats) and then jack up the prices for us regular folk? No matter how early I buy, for bigger shows, I can never really get that close.  Then I look on broker sites that seem to have awesome seats, with a 400% mark up.  
Small world.  When I worked at TM my team was building a web based replaced for the old windows & command line interface they used at box offices & outlets.    We rolled it out for the Beijing Olympics, but I left for Google after that.  Did it ever get deployed globally? 
Why don't venues price their tickets properly to avoid massive shortages that allows scalpers to make a killing? Why not just charge what the scalper would charge and actually pocket that cash yourself? 
How much over minimum wage did they pay you to buy your morals and conscience?    What is the going price to be a professional piece of shit? 
Were there episode ideas that were refused by Disney because of content matter or the company did not think it would be suitable for their general audience? 
What do you two think of *Bill Nye Saves The World*? 
Did you think that years after the show was cancelled, kids would still be screaming "BILL BILL BILL BILL" every opportunity they got? That song is like 90s kids national anthem.  
Were you ever approached about working on the new show? I would think if they were going for a reboot then they would want your opinions. At this point the new show is destroying what you guys helped Bill create, he needs you guys to come back to him and recreate the magic you once had! 
How important do you think striking a balance between entertaining your audience and informing them is? Was there ever a time or topic where you found it difficult to keep it fun enough for kids to stay glued to the TV but still educate them? 
How was Bill off camera? How much did he play up his personality? 
When you made BNtSG, how much were you influenced by Mr. Wizard's World?  I loved both and it seems like a great heritage of bringing science to kids. 
Why was the part about chromosomes determining gender taken out of the Netflix version of the series? 
IYO, has Bill changed in his approach to Science, since you guys did the show together? Like has he flopped his stance on anything he once believed? 
Hi!  Thanks for doing this AMA.  Who did the lyrics and shots for the Queen Lighteefah music video?  Oh my god, that was so hilarious and awesome... 
How did you pick Nye?  Were there other candidates with more academic credentials passed over in favor of Nye's stage presence? 
Are you related to the other famous Gottlieb from the Pawn Stars franchise? 
BNTSG will probably make the history books for its profound impact on this generation as we grow up and become more involved in the world.  Maybe a silly question, but do you feel that the show in a way fulfilled your life destiny/was what you were "meant to do" ?  
What do you desire for future educational programming?  Do you have a favorite educational show that's on right now? 
Hey guys, I think we may have a mutual connection with the fellow standing on the far left of that photo you're holding. Spencer McCulloh here. Didn't expect to see you two on Reddit this morning! But anyways here my question haha. How did Bill Nye end up being the science guy for the show?  
Hey guys! Big thank you for Bill Nye the Science Guy. I grew up watching it for my middle school science curriculum (I was homeschooled). I probably wouldn't have gotten my degree in Chemistry in college otherwise. Big thank you!  For your new show, have you had pushback in regards to finances being too "adult and boring" to teach kids? 
"Eat your crust Richie" is still one of my favorite quotes of all time.   How do you feel knowing that whenever the big tube tv was rolled into a science classroom, everyone in the room knew that we were going to watch the Science Guy, and we were all over the moon? 
Are there any statistics that detail the effects the Bill Nye show has had on young people? Is there any hard evidence that suggests there could be a trend between the amount of millennials pursuing science based degrees and professions and the original airing of your show?   
How long did it take to produce the average episode of BNtSG and what was your production cycle like and what did the process entail? 
Scientists like to debate almost everything. How did you deal with members of the scientiffic community taking issue with certain subjects that were covered on Bills show?  
What do you think of the politicization of science in our culture?  I find it despicable and dangerous. 
How much did bill get paid to go left and lie about how many genders there are? 
Who would win in a fight to the death, Bill Nye, or Mr Wizard? 
How do you become a show creator/producer? I have always wanted to create a show but I don't have any money. Do you start as a PA? 
1. How did you guys meet Bill? 2. What is something you enjoyed during your two week stay in Japan? (Awesome pic by the way!) 3. How tricky was it to incorporate and properly balance humor into the show without it getting in the way of educating? 4. Who or what would you say have had the most influence on you and what you do?  Thanks for the ama, guys. And thanks so much for co-creating such a wonderful and informative show.  
Which one of you was the deep-voiced announcer guy?  
You mentioned that you worked on Almost Live! Do you have any funny stories about that time? Any chance of a reunion show? 
How has getting a show produced changed as the technology has evolved? 
I recently went back and watched old Bill Nye episodes and your brand of humor/production (cutting clips, editing in sounds, wacky digital antics) struck me as waaaaaay ahead of its time. In fact, it kind of reminds me of Tim & Eric Awesome Show Great Job. Who's idea was it to have such zany post-production?  
What do you think of Bill nyes current show?   Do you approve of the censoring of the one scene in the episode regarding gender that Netflix ripped out?   
What are your personal thoughts on alternative medicine such as crystal therapy ? And psychedelics? 
The science of economics is rarely included in general popular overviews of science, and the expositions of it are rarely counted as science popularization. (For instance, I can't think of a children's economics show with roughly the same role in relation to adult ones like *Free to Choose* and *The Age of Uncertainty* as *Bill Nye the Science Guy* is to *Cosmos*.)  As the producers of both *Bill Nye the Science Guy* and *BizKid$*, why do you think this is so? 
Which came into your life first: a man named Bill Nye that had a persona that required you to build a show around or the idea of a fun science show directed at kids that begged for someone like a Bill Nye to pull it off? 
Did you know that Bill wasn't actually an accredited scientist when you made the show? Is that why he is a "science guy" instead of a scientist or was it just that it rhymed? 
Why does Bill Nye say sex is on a spectrum, when it is instead due to chromosomes?  
Question: Following the disappointing return of Bill Nye, with his "saves the world" show, have you been asked to produce a future show?  The show changed my life and was one of the best highlights of childhood. There is no reason it cannot be replicated for today's kids (if in the right hands as we have just learned). I hope you guys and Bill reunite. 
Why did you not come forward and debunk bill nye as a real scientist, instead you let him portray a mechanical engineer as a PhD scientist in multiple fields? Don't you think that is a false narrative when dealing with facts and scientific data in an area that is based upon truths? 
Is there a decision as a CEO that you regret or wish you could've done better? 
Any word on a splinter cell game in the works. What can we expect ?  
Do you feel like Ubisoft has improved their reputation lately?  
Do you enjoy games other than the ones made by Ubisoft? 
What's the most difficult thing you've had to do as CEO? 
Why is the Rainbow Six Siege team so small, despite having one of your largest player bases? 
What is your personal opinion on Rainbow Six Siege? 
How does one become a CEO?  What was your early life like?  
Hi Yves,  what old game would you want to be remastered with today's graphics ? 
What is your most beloved franchise within Ubisoft? (Not just now, all over the past 30 years) 
How do you deal with the negative comments from so many players about your games?  
After Berlin, do you have actual plans to open further studios globally in the nearest future? 
Will we ever see a resolution to the Desmond Miles story and the modern day assassins? The way that arc ended was very frustrating. 
Obviously a long shot, but would it be possible to meet you at E3?   So excited to see all of Ubisoft's projects at E3!   
Google has this thing called Google 20% which is set up to allow to spend 20% of employees time to work on their own projects and ideas instead of what they're hired to do. This encourages innovation. Does Ubisoft have anything in place for encouraging innovation?   P.S Not just for employees, do you allow other people to pitch you ideas and how have you made it easy for them to do it. Do you try and do anything to make their ideas or projects a reality?  what's the best way to approach you with an idea? 
Anything interesting on the horizon that most people don't know about yet? 
What do you see as the next big leap in gaming technology? 
What is the future of The Division? Will there be a Division 2?  
Hi Yves!! I love watching you speak at E3, your enthusiasm for your company and games in general really comes out!   What would you say is the most important quality in a game? Story telling? Mechanics? World-building?   Also, AC: Origins looks incredible!! 
Which chocolate do you prefer?  1. Swiss 2. Belgian 3. Whatever's melting on my tongue 4. White, because I don't know what I'm talking about ;) 
Why are you avoiding to do Assassin's Creed set in Feudal Japan? :D 
Thank you for hosting this AMA!  Did you ever think that when you first came into video games over 30 years ago, video games would become this big? (esports etc) 
Don't your fists hurt of knocking the shit out of all your competitors at E3 this year? Also what's the name of your dog we saw in a video a couple years ago? 
In a world where original ideas are so hard to come up with, is there a method Ubisoft uses to help originate ideas?  Do you reach out to gamers online to hopefully utilize other end-users in building a new game which can feel original in content and gameplay. 
Thanks for the great opportunity, sir. My questions are:   1. What's your favorite setting for an Assassin's Creed game?  2. Can we expect Prince of Persia to ever make a return?  3. Do you prefer story-driven games or more action and multiplayer oriented ones?  4. Will there ever be a cinematic CGI trailer for Assassin's Creed: Origins?  5. Do you expect the Assassin's Creed franchise to end at some point? Or will it continue expanding to other platforms like movies, TV shows and comics?  6. Do you believe comic books are a good way to finish a game's plot?  7. Can we ever expect an adventure game by Ubisoft? Something similar to Quantic Dreams' Beyond: Two Souls?  8. Can we expect a collaboration with Hideo Kojima?  Thank you! 
Will Far Cry 5 actually look like the trailer? Or are we going to get another downgraded version like every game before it? 
Hello Guillemot!  My question is a concern I have about console parity. I'm planing to buy the new Xbox One X. And I know PlayStation has marketing rights for FarCry5. Will you take advantage of the extra power on Xbox One X for that game? And all your games for that mather?   Thanks and sorry if this is a silly question.  Best wishes to you and Ubisoft from me here in Norway :) 
Hi ! Why would Vivendi takeover would be so hostile to Ubisoft ? 
Why does Ubisoft continue to put microtransactions in games consumers are already expected to pay for despite them being seen almost universally as a negative inclusion by your audience? 
What the Hell kind of creature is Rayman supposed to be? He seriously creeps me out. An alien? An animal? A lab experiment gone wrong? An especially ugly person? What?   Also, what's your favorite piece of baseball equipment?  
Mike 'quick' Swick? Love your fights man.   I have watched you since you first entered in. Absolute mad man.   Do you think the new breed of mma fighters are really that good, or just that marketable? 
Was Thailand your primary choice or did you just say Phucket? 
Hey mike another big fan here. What made you get into fighting? What's ur gym in Thailand? Do DC and them train there? 
Holy crap! I never actually thought I'd get the opportunity to ask this, but at what point did you know you really wanted to step away from fighting, and are there days that you see your guys training and miss it?  Also, for a person that one day wants to go to Thailand and train, how difficult is the language barrier and is there any kind of time frame where you start to pick it up? 
Sup Mike! Big fan here, ever since I saw you KO Gideon a few years ago. You were one of the first fighters I got to see who actually had both real KO power and slicckkk jits.   My question for you is: who's your favorite fighter/fighters to watch in the UFC today?    Wish you the best with your gym and life man! 
Hi Mike! I'm a big fan. What is the craziest thing you ever saw while bouncing?  
Hey Mike great to see you doing this I always miss these things. What's your thoughts on fighters trying to come back ie. Chuck Liddell , Tito and now Randy saying he would fill in for bellator. The reason I ask is you seem quite happy and enjoying everything you have done after leaving the sport, I wonder if they just aren't as fulfilled in their lives after the sport? 
Does the ufc actually measure the fighters height and reach or do you just report it to them ? Hope you're doing Well mike.  
Hi Mike! I'm travelling to Phuket to train this summer and I'm wondering what sets AKA Thailand apart from the other super-gyms on the island? What would you recommend doing on Phuket that's slightly off the beaten touristy path? What led you to move to Thailand and start a gym there? 
What fight for you was the most memorable?  Both your own and one that you watched? 
What do you think of bareknuckle boxing? Best thing about living in Thailand?Worse thing? 
Do you run short term fitness bootcamps ?  I might be interested 
is there any chance for an AKA gym in the Philippines? 
Hi Mike, what's your thoughts? Has what Conor McGregor's done been good for the cause of UFC fighters?  
What's your stance on kids and martial arts? I want to put my daughter in jiu jitsu as soon as she is of the required age. Do you think that instills a sense of confidence and discipline as kids grow up? I want to raise a daughter with self esteem and confidence in herself and respect for her body...and for her to have the ability to defend herself if necessary.  What's are your thoughts?  
Do I need to be a fighter to train at AKA Thailand? 
Do you think you would have become a better fighter if you had went to Clear Brook? Just joking around but congrats on living out your dream.  
Do you train people who have a background in martial arts with a desire to one day compete in the ring/professionally? Is there a screening process or do you just take anyone? 
I didn't know that you operate a Print Factory. Do you work in there yourself on the printing line?  Do you still keep in contact with Jon Fitch? You and John Fitch were some of my favorites from AKA back in the day. 
I trained with Kaensak for a couple years and it was an incredible learning experience. Is he still talked about in Thailand? It seems he was a pretty big figure in a really tough time to succeed in Muay Thai. Also have you considered bringing the vlogs back? I enjoyed the shit out of those videos you made with Huerta back in the day!  
Hey Mike, are you still contractually connected to the UFC at all? If not is there any chance we get to see you have any more fights or have you completely retired from active competition? Would love to see you give Dan Hardy one last fight.  
You fish at all and if so what's your biggest catch? 
What advice do you give to people when starting their own business?  
Do you regret doing something in your life or do you regret NOT doing something in your life?  Also what is your LPT? 
hey Mike, if you had to give advice to someone starting a business, what would you say?  
Was there any fighter you hated that you fought? Do you still hate them now?  Who's your least favorite fighter nowadays?  
Mike, knowing what you know now, what would you do differently if you were starting your UFC career today? 
Wait, Mike's Gyms Mike? I've seen your posters out there. They're everywhere. 
If you have seen any of the tuf episodes recently. Compared to when you were on it, what do you feel like has changed or do you feel like it has gotten easier or harder or do they now focus more on getting guys drunk to do or say stupid shit with the boiiiz?  
Does you gym have a website of Facebook? Congrats on getting set up after the UFC.  Feels like you have been around forever, thanks for everything you did in the UFC. Anyone you are a big fan of these days?   If you could go back and have 1 more fight who would it be? 
Big fan!! Always enjoyed watching you fight. Thanks! .. What kind of print factory?  
Love your fights Mike, How'd you like car sales? I just got in the business 6 months ago. I'm loving it, any tips?!  
What do you think is the reason for the lack of Thai fighters in the UFC? Considering the country's strong background in Muay Thai, it seems perhaps surprising that there hasn't been a top, Thai UFC fighter yet  
Hey Mike,   I have a journalism degree but have been looking for my opportunity to break into the industry.  A good friend of mine is already in Thailand shooting for UFC and I have been looking to get over there.  Any advice on how you successfully transitioned over there?  Thanks in advance for any advice or suggestions.   
When is your first trip to the ISS scheduled? Do you need time to finish instructing the following generation of astronauts first? 
How do you work up the motivation and dedication to be successful like this? I am smart but unmotivated and lazy. Were you always this dedicated?  
What would you say is the best way to build my future, while trying to attain my dream, even it it seems unrealistic?  Basically, I would like advice on how to not be dirt poor while trying live out my dreams.  
What's up Mike, always loved watching your fights and got to watch you fight live against Marcus Davis at UFC 85 back in the day. Did you enjoy fighting in Europe and how does preparation for a fight overseas differ to fighting in the US? 
Do you have any tips for people who have just started doing mma or will start recently? 
Hi! I'm starting Brazilian Jiu-jitsu this week. I'm nervous because I'm kinda out of shape and not corrdenated as a woman. Any words of motivation?  
How shitty is it to do your taxes? It sounds like you would have 1099s from hella places, a mess of different self employment income to repott, etc. Im assuming you probably had a tax accountant do it for you. 
What kind of print factory? Like corrugated cartons?  
Hi Mike!  I wonder if you classes for kids/teens? If you do I would like to know a bit about your philosophy when it comes to training kids/teens in martial arts. The reason I am asking is even preteen Muay Thai fighters are in a sense professional prize fighters in Thailand.  
Do the AKA Thailand guys get hurt as often during training as the AKA San Jose guys? (only asking in jest).  Love your fights, miss seeing you in the octagon.    Also, you might get more questions if you post in /r/mma instead of this IAmA sub.   
Mike, when Dana let Brock Lesnar fight Mark Hunt without Brock undergoing standard drug testing, how does that affect the morale of other fighters? And, how contentious are these drug issue inconsistencies within UFC, from the fighter's perspectives? 
What's your advice for someone wanting to move from the US to Thailand?  Say, someone with a wife and kid.  Thanks! 
What are the nerves like when entering the octagon? I couldn't imagine stepping in without the anxiety of so many people watching! 
Hey Mike, just wondering if you had to keep up with any vaccines or therapies to avoid the endemic diseases (e.g. malaria, typhoid...) in Thailand when you first first moved? Or if you still have to keep up with them. Thats always been my biggest concern when traveling abroad. I loved watching your fights!  
So besides add, were you ever diagnosed with anything else? 
Fellow expat here living a couple hours away from you. How do you guys balance the party/drinking lifestyle with your training? Do you set rules for your students? 
Advice for a Nak Muay looking into transitioning to MMA? 
Mike,  I watched Gustafsson exploit the eye-poke advantage, clearly increasing his strike output while he had Teixeira fighting with one eye. What do you think the penalty should be for eyepokes? 
Hello,   My friend told me that sports at any high level, the athletes are using PEDs.    What are your thoughts and experiences with PEDS in MMA?   Thanks for your time and God bless!  
hey man, was just in Thailand for 2 weeks, Phuket is gorgeous. I'm considering moving there. How did you handle the visa process, it seems aside from getting married you can do a 1-year work visa, what did you do? And any advice for moving to TL? 
Sup Mike! Great to hear from you in this way and glad to see the post-fight career is moving along. Been an MMA-fan since the late 90's and always rooted for you!  Whats your thoughts on weightclasses? I think the UFC really could use a revamp around 170 where they add 165 and 175 and also maybe a cruiser weight at something like 215? Weight cutting might be mitigated a bit and some of these divisions are just too damned stacked atm. 
UFC changed a lot since its beginning. What do you think changed the most? What remains the same? 
So you're in a job interview. They take a quick look at your resume and ask, "Why haven't you stuck with one thing?" What do you tell them?  Is having such a diverse work history become a detriment? 
The biggest, most important question for Britain: do you support Lord Buckethead leading Brexit negotiations? 
How do you plan to bring the national debt under control. When would you do this and how would do so while paying for your huge increases in spending? 
What would your response be to people calling your policies "communist"? 
Its always hilarious to me when people make delusional AMA requests lol.  
Way too risky for potentially the next prime minister, nothing to gain, Reddit users already vote for him, and we'll just ask about his views on privacy, snoopers charter and the like and realise Labour are just as authoritarian as the Tories. 
Why did you celebrate a defeat like it was a victory when Labour candidates have won more seats than you and resigned? 
Good luck getting him to answer Anything. He won't be answering.. Would you use Trident? 
When will you finally step down so Labour might actually get back into power again? The one and only question that needs to be asked.  
Why do you believe in multiple genders? EDIT "More than two genders"/ 
This is a question from someone in your district. The quality of life in Colorado is being diminished by traffic. We see improvement being made around Denver, except for those of us on the north side. What will you be proposing to alleviate this critical issue?   
What do you think about the fact that CO real estate market has climbed so fast that middle class people can barely afford to own a home in CO? The rental market is out of control right now and doesn't seem to be coming back down any time soon. Any thoughts on this? 
My biggest complaint about John Hickenlooper has been that he's quite a bit cozier with oil and gas interests than I feel he should be, especially given recent issues such as the pipeline leak and subsequent explosion in Frederick. How do you expect your approach to these groups to be different? 
Assuming you win the primary, how do you plan to reach out to conservative sections of the state like Colorado Springs? 
What are your thoughts about NSA surveillance? Federal Reserve? Edward Snowden?  
Hi Congressman Polis, As a Colorado resident, I am increasingly worried about the poor condition of the state's infrastructure. Our roads are terrible and getting worse. How would you address our infrastructure as governor? Best wishes on your campaign! 
I'm 46 and current work for the City of Denver and seem to have a similar outlook as yourself; I've been thinking about how to work toward running for public office.  Any advice based on your path? 
Hi Mr. Polis. Thanks for stopping by my company (Namaste Solar) recently and supporting renewables in our state.   My question is, do you have any plans to further reign in or eliminate TABOR? 
Hey Mr. Polis.   Do you support free public higher education? If so, how would you plan to get there?  Single payer healthcare systems (if written better than last year's 69)?  Thanks! 
Good evening, Mr. Polis, from a fellow Coloradan.   Others have touched on the issues of housing, transportation, and infrastructure - significant matters, of course. My question is a bit more narrow, but it relates to jobs and to something you should be rather familiar with.   You and I both have a background in technology, and with the astronomical cost of living in Silicon Valley, many tech companies and qualified engineers and developers are starting to look elsewhere. Places like the Denver Tech Center, and Boulder, are promising hubs of technical development and innovation here in Colorado, and I'm optimistic that there is an opportunity for us in this area.   My question for you is this - what thoughts do you have on growing the technology industry in Colorado, and how can those of us already in it work to support this growth? 
Jared, how will you do more as a gov of Co, than you have as a voice of reason in the house? 
The Democratic primary looks already to be a somewhat crowded field. What good things do you have to say about your opponents and how do you plan on differentiating yourself from the rest of the pack? 
Congressman,  I'm a constituent in Clear Creek county. As a rural area, we have a lot of issues funding our school district, getting healthcare in the county, funding meaningful infrastructure repairs and upgrades, etc. My question is: how do you plan on addressing these sorts of issues in rural Colorado as governor?   
What are your thoughts on a universal basic income? 
If you were a color combination in MTG, which would you be? 
Jared, in what Areas would you like to see states have more rights over certain things rather than federal control? 
Where can I view your CNN special "Freshman Year" that you did with Jason Chaffetz? It seems to be gone. 
Jared, with the enormous amount of lakes, rivers and forests and large number of state parks and national forests and parks in your district and throughout The Centennial State, what efforts as a member of the house of representatives have you made to protect the environment and balances that with the protection of property owners and what efforts would you make in the future to protect the environment while protecting property management/control rights by citizens of Colorado? 
What do you think Colorado's most pressing infrastructure needs are? As governor, what infrastructure projects would you prioritize getting done?  What did you learn as a tech co-founder that has helped you most as a politician? 
Don't you think that Car sales tax in Boulder is a little bit high?  
What do you think of the question of whether Puerto Rico should be a state or not? 
Hey, I'm a member of your congressional district and I've always voted for you.  How many times has your LoL account been banned for flaming?  Secondary (serious question), 20 states now allow you to change the gender marker on your birth certificate without needing sexual reassignment surgery, but not Colorado. Will you support this and other trans rights policies if you are elected governor? 
What are your thoughts on the transportation crisis for individuals with disabilities and our seniors? 
Submitted this at town halls but it didn't get picked:  We've seen an increase from progressives in efforts to defend religious tolerance, but there's still massive cultural and governmental momentum to craft public policies based on the doctrines of a single religion. Are there any parts of your plan for Colorado that include bolstering research-based, evidence-backed decision making for state policies?  Sorry for the wide-ranging question, I know a lot of you goals are pro-science and pro-data, just wondering if religion-neutrality in government is something that's ever on your radar. 
Boulder County here. I'm glad to see you are running. My question is, do you think you can manage to not say something stupid every time you open your mouth like Hickenlooper does? He continually makes me embarrassed that I voted for him. I have been saying for a couple of years now that I want a different Democrat as Governor. 
Considering you're only one of 7 openly gay members of congress right now, what advice would you give to other LGBT Americans who want to get involved in politics and join congress? 
Jared, what are your thoughts on the TV show "South Park"?  In all seriousness, what could be done from the governors office and state congress in Denver to help those 80 plus miles away in rural Central Colorado improve their area economically?   
Hey! German politics student here so I really appreciate it when politicians of any kind actually dare to openly ask questions like this.  With Trump resigning from the paris climate deal, soon news came up that Governors and their respective states would "simply" bypass the white house's decision by pledging directly to the deal (I know this is vague as hell but it's 5:26 around here so please pardon me).  So I guess my question is, what's your personal stance of the climate deal? How important do you think it is for the US and it's states to stay relevant in fighting climate change (and the opportunities we got at hand e.g. the paris deal) and how what's your expectation/hope for the next 4 years should Trump stay in presidency?  Thanks in advance and good luck (or congrats) to your announcement and I hope you will rock it! 
Colorado has had a great windfall from marijuana taxes, but as other states continue to legalize the drug, how would you plan for a lower tax revenues, or do you feel the income will stay the same? 
I'm curious about how strongly you're going to stand against Fracking?  This is one of the bigger issues that matters to me, and while your probably going to be the best candidate regardless of your stance on this but it will help consolidate my continued support in you, and possibly influence my parents as well.  Best Regards,         SmaugTheMagnificent 
Hi Jared,     As a FC constituent I'm so excited to see you're running for governer! What do you think you could do as governer to encourage development of and access to high-speed fiber broadband in Colorado communities? Hope I can get involved in the campaign! 
Beyond the traditional Facebook/Twitter platforms, how are you leveraging social media such as Snapchat and Instagram in your campaign? Do you differentiate your efforts between fundraising and awareness/engagement? Good luck! 
Can you make sure John Elway stays the GM of the Broncos? 
Hello,  As someone who has an extensive background in entrepreneurship, philanthropy, and education, I was hoping you might have advice for my situation.  I am starting a charitable non-profit that will provide a free security offering to consumers, including free incident response services. I would like to collaborate with universities to give aspiring security professionals an opportunity to get real-world incident response experience while contributing to a good cause and fulfilling a serious public need.  Without an especially strong personal network, the marketing aspects of the venture will be the most daunting aspect of the endeavor. But I ultimately feel it will be worth that hard work to do some genuine good in an area where there is no focus by others. Given your own experiences, do you have any insight into how someone in my position could best engage the public, universities, and the government to raise awareness?   Thank you so much.  
While it's exciting news that you're running for governor, there's so much more you could accomplish-- especially on modernizing Congress with new technology and ideas. And with your position on the rules committee, a switch to a democratic majority could make you even more influential.   What did you weigh in making this decision and what do you hope to accomplish before your congressional term ends? 
I'm visiting Colorado for the first time next week. Any food recommendations in the Denver metro area? 
What do you think of the Job of how the Rockies are playing this year?  
Hey Jared, used to be a Colorado resident, voted for ya and I'm glad I did. Thanks for your good work.  Here's a funny question for ya, I'm curious what you think:  What do you think about the private military presence in Colorado? I know of a couple bases/compounds/buildings that contain and or are housing military-grade equipment under private/corporate control. How do you feel about this, both specifically in Colorado, and private military in general?  And secondly, if I may, gene-editing technologies are moving much faster than government. What do you think government could do to contain or subvert the threat of biological warfare from non-state actors? Is spying on citizens our best hope to stop this? It seems to have the largest existential threat to implementation-cost ratio. 
Jared, I named my fish after you. That said, what will you do to make Colorado better (and college students specifically. I go to CU)? 
Hello Congressman Polis. I had the great pleasure of meeting you in Fort Collins to talk about immigration and DACA issues a few months back. Do you have any preliminary ideas about the things that you would do as Governor to increase protection for immigrants in Colorado?  
Are you at all concerned that giving up a democratic seat in congress could help to further this administrations insane polices?  
Hi Jared, super psyched about your run for gov. We'll miss you in CD 2, but I guess we can share with the rest of the state!  My question is on education. Your plan for Pre-K and Kindergarten is awesome, but do you have anything in mind for funding the rest of K-12 and maybe even helping higher ed?  Growing up in a struggling district and then paying ever-increasing tuition for college, I feel this continuing underfunding of education is a growing issue that will hamstring our state economically for years to come.  
Constituent in Northern Colorado; have voted for you in each election. As governor, how will you support funding for higher education? As I'm sure you are aware, we benefit from an educated populace, but the cost of higher education keeps rising and pricing low-income qualified students out. 
How come you Congress people have the best health care coverage and you give us peons garbage coverage? 
Do you feel that if you don't do the bidding of the oil and gas industry that your livelihood will be jeopardized in some way? Why is meeting the greed of corporations more important to you than the health and well being of the people you are entrusted to represent? 88 and 89. 
Hi Jared,  Bit of a curly question for you:  If you had absolute power over the legal system in the U.S., what laws would you immediately implement/alter/eliminate?  Thank you for all of your hard work, I appreciate it greatly!!   --(constituent of yours in Boulder) 
Any thoughts on former Rockies manager Walt Weiss? He's an alumnus of my high school in NY :) 
When you voted for the SAFE Act in 2015 was that just xenophobia and bigotry or were you just engaged in some fear mongering to try and appear more moderate for this run?  
Do you support the Middle Eastern wars that America has been waging for the past 16 years? Why or why not? 
Do you feel that the legalization of marijuana may create a disconnect between a child and parents? I ask because, in our day and age, it's becoming harder to get through to our children with the amount of media they are exposed to. So my concern is that if we legalize marijuana, that increased availability of the drug may make it increasingly harder to connect with our children. 
I am also interested in pursuing an MD/PhD in something analytical, potentially biostatistics, computational biology, or data science. I'm super interested in the research, but the extra years of school is really off-putting. What does a day in your life involve? Do you regularly interact with patients? And do you get paid about the same as an average radiologist, or more because of the high-end research you're conducting? 
Have you looked at the study suggesting depression/suicide can be seen 5 years away, any relation to your work? 
Can the AI with all its testing, perform anything that has shocked you?  
As a radiologist, how did you end up doing research in  AI? 
Do you have any concerns that the technology you are developing will be exploited/ repurposed, so that the prime initiative is not to "help people be healthier", but rather to discriminate against them in regards to ability to obtain health/life insurance, secure/ maintain employment, etc.?       
What platforms do you leverage?  What has exceeded your expectations with regards to development & results progress? 
What would you like to see the outcome of this research to be? What do you belive Will be Done, and more importabtly, should be Done with it?  Thank you for doing this AmA btw. 
How does someone without a medical education go about learning enough about radiology to be able to interpret scans (CT/MRI)? Are there any books / resources you would recommend? 
How much data exploration did you do to identify potential relationships?  Why did you opt for your model to be a neural network over a regression or classification? 
How much will life expectancy rise within the next 20-30 years? Considering that we are working to 3D print living organs; you are literally creating an AI to tell how healthy someone and what is possibly wrong just by scanning them. Modern medicine is getting awesome. 
^^Oh ^^man, ^^I ^^should ^^really ^^start ^^lurking ^^'new' ^^and ^^'rising' ^^more ^^often...  Hi, I'm a radiologist too! ~~SO YER THE GUY TRYNA GIT A 'PUTER TO TAKE MAH JERB!~~  How did you approach joining/starting a project that isn't entirely within your professional field? Any obstacles you had to overcome?   I have my own interest in doing research in the field of neuroscience, particularly in regards to neurodegenrative disorders and neuroplasticity. But as it turns out our health care system is only interested in filling jobs and getting quick returns from whatever they invest in. 
What do you think about AMD and Nvidia, and which companies are at the cutting edge of AI? 
Congrats on your paper getting so much attention! Any specific reason for choosing generic mortality rate as opposed to looking at a single disease?  As far as the industry predictions on your blog, your understanding of the field is off in a lot of ways. Plus, when I click on your links which are used as references, it redirects right back to your own blog. Then that reference article contains misconceptions that are backed up by, you guessed it, links to your own blog again! It reads like a conspiracy theory website. 
Are you at the point where your program can adapt for differences in technique, scanner specs, and anatomical variants? 
Can you recommend a good book for an intermediate programmer who wants to get into deep learning neural stuff? I personally like books that start building knowledge from the ground up and explain exactly what is happening without using confusing simplifications (one of the worst examples I can think of is explaining object-oriented programming in terms of real-world examples, like apples and bananas with properties, absolutely terrible and confusing). 
what genius of logic told you to focus on death to increase life? please answer.  why are we wasting valuable time and resources on bullshit like this? blood drop crystallization has already been perfected for  one hundred years. all information is in the blood.  now you want to take a sick or paranoid person and subject their bodies to what?  anyone who falls for this is 1)lame, 2)collaborator,3) desperate manipulated sheep who thinks AI is smart.  you idiots, do you know who made AI? do you research anything? have you seen how stupid scientists are? they are the zombies, only focusing on one thing, how could anyone know the truth by focusing on one thing? PLT, they can't, but they are told they can.  
Dude, where are located? I was diagnosed with an inoperable Grade 3 Anaplastic Astrocytoma in 2015 at the age of 20. If you ever feel like talking with someone your own age that is going through a similar situation with brain cancer, please do not hessite to get in touch!! Much love brother 
What symptoms led you to go to the doctor when you got diagnosed? 
Wow... That's a lot to deal with so young.   My mom was recently diagnosed with breast cancer... I just wanna know what keeps you going every day? I'm worried for her and I want to do my best to keep her happy but I have no idea what to even say at this point.  
I have two questions if you don't mind:  How has this battle impacted your perspective on life?   And   Ive heard stories about people being diagnosed that develop a bucket list mentality. Do you have any kind of bucket list or have you made certain activities/goals more of a priority in your life since being diagnosed?  Thank you so much for your time. Youre ability to continue the good fight is a testament to your inner strength and an inspiration to us all. 
Your bravery and willpower inspire me. What's your favorite form of creative expression? 
As someone with brain issues (an injury, not on your scale) I'm keen to find out, how much have you found yourself pondering where your brain ends and 'you' begin, and how united or separate they are to you? I know before my injury I would've just said that my brain is basically me as a person, but with it failing in ways there are times where that really doesn't seem the case anymore.  Best of luck with the fight :) 
Do you ever feel like just giving up? I can't even imagine doing 53 sessions of radiation never mind everything else you've been through. It's seems like it would be kind of hard not to be fatalistic in a situation like yours. Do you ever think one day you'll be in remission? Sry if the question is kind of personal.  
Where are you now in your diagnosis? Has your condition improved since?  
Do you find that you're less bothered by the little things in life now?  
Is there something that presses you on to keep living? 5 years sounds like a really long time to have cancer, I don't know about the cancer that you have, is it debilitating and you can't do a lot? Are you missing out on going to school or anything? I read you do music. 
What is your favorite activity and has that changed since your road to recovery??  
From what I can tell, you seem to be a pretty happy/optimistic guy. Were you always like this or was it something you had to work up to? Is it hard to stay positive? 
Have you had any particularly stand-out good (or bad) experiences with your medical care?  
What is the best or most memorable thing that a nurse ever did for you? 
What is your fighting force to stay positive every day? Much love and support!  
I'm a vegan too! I always encourage all my friends who have any health issues to eat more vegan meals. I really believe what you eat can have a significant impact on your illnesses. What's your favorite vegan meal? 
what is the worst part of chemotherapy?  how did most of your friend/family react? 
Tried any potential alternative treatments or solutions? 
Hi Richie, First, my best wishes are always with you. I hope you and your family are able to stay positive for as long as it takes, come what may.   My dad was diagnosed with Leukemia (M4) over a year ago and we ran pillar to post for 10 months. We went from a regular community level hospital from one country to MD Anderson, TX covering every possible level of hospital care and sophistication in between. And in our journey we came across other cancer patients who had their own stories.  We lost our dad but we are left with this intense desire to do something, to improve those affected with cancer. We hope to act on this soon.   Have you thought of anything on these lines? Do you any ideas you wish to discuss? Or do you know anyone who is doing something like this?  Richie, I wish you all good that can happen, from the bottom of my heart. More importantly a shout-out to your family and friends who are in this together with you. Always stay positive :) 
Ive heard of someone becoming severely mentally disabled after havint ear cancer due to the radiation  This sounds funny asking, but how are you not severly mentally handicapped? 
Have you ever personally experienced homophobia and what was it like? 
Are you in any current relationship, and how is it? And you also mentioned about a service helping lonely elders in need, how much has this service offered for you? 
- What made you realize you were gay?  - What is the first thing that makes you attracted to a man? His voice? Smell?  - What is your favorite food?  
Do you have any racial preferences that factor/factored in to your dating, or was it never a consideration? As a blind man, what is your opinion of racial preferences in the gay community? Do you have any other physical preferences like fat/thin, tall/short, etc.?  The physicality of attraction seems to be a hot button topic in the gay community. Thanks for your thoughts. 
Alright, here's a good one for you. What do you want your legacy to be? How do you want the future generations to remember you when they inevitably come across this AMA in the future? 
Are there any blind LGBT resources or activity groups in your city? If not, maybe you can start one!   
Hello Bob!   I've noticed recently that there are many gays who feel lonely in their life, despite the fact we now have much more tools to connect with each other than your generation had. Mental health issues are still a big problem among LGBT community, despite the fact that world is getting more accepting for us.   I guess you've had a fair share of bad luck in life, if it is okay to say like that, but what is your fuel for life? What keeps you going?   I read your story, thanks for sharing it with us! Regards from Finland, Europe. 
How did you write that note? Checkmate.  Also how can you prove you're gay? Checkmate^^2   
You don't understand AMA. Why would people trust you to run a country? 
Right, because that's when politicians make themselves available to the public. *After* an election.  
To each member of the animation team, which character from Camp Camp was your favorite to create and continue to develop?   Also thank you to all the members of the 2d animation team, Camp Camp is one of my all time favorite shows 
Hey guys, big fan of your work. I was curious when it comes to discussing the concepts surrounding new shows (like setting it in a camp, or following a rock band) how many people play a part in that process as it evolves? Looking forward to seeing more from you guys!  
How is the relationship between the writer and the animators in terms of communication? Is the script up for change on the day or do you usually stick to it? 
What has been your favourite complex shot to plan then eventually animate? 
What was your favorite episode of last season to work on? 
Are there any ambitious projects you almost gave up on, but stuck it out solely because of spite? 
First of all amazing job with Camp Camp its incredible.  and my question is who is your favourite character and why is it Space Kid? 
How long does it take, from brainstorming to release, to create one episode of the show?  Also, please release the animatics from season 1! 
Hello RT Animation team! Thanks so much for doing this AMA!  Firstly, how many people do you hire on (full time or contract) from discovering the fan work they've made? Be it fan art, fan animations, fan music/remixes, etc.  And secondly what creation have you contributed to within RT that you're most proud of?  Thanks a ton! 
Are there any features or memories of camps you went to as a kid that you've subtly incorporated into scenes of Camp Campbell? 
This may have been asked before, but who was the hardest character to write? 
Hey RT 2D team!  What programs do you use for shows like Camp Camp & X-Ray and Vav? Toonboom? Adobe Animate (aka Flash)? What does your timeline/production pipeline look like per episode?  Context: I work in 2D animated children's content and we've recently completed a whole show using Adobe Character Animator & doing more advanced animation within After Effects. I did the animation/editing, my boss and his wife did the voices and we completed a 15 episode (roughly 7-11 minute long episodes) 'show' in 4 months. I've never worked in a proper animation pipeline, I'd love to hear how RT operates! 
When you decided to become an animator, who inspired you to animate? 
Do the team members roles ever cross over into each other? (Ex. One of the writers being involved in character design, an animator pitching story ideas, etc.) 
What is your favorite moment from the season 1 and season 2?  
Have you ever hid easter eggs in scenes that nobody ever found? Like the alien on South Park sort of thing.  
If I wanted to hire a decent freelance animator to make a 90 second short, what should I pay them?  What should they charge? 
Who would be your dream voice actor for a new character next season?  
Sex Swing was understandably not for everyone, but I absolutely loved it. I just wanted to say congrats on that show, it was fantastic, and weird, and great.  Are there any fun collaborative plans you have for the other arms of Rooster Teeth for the future? Even on just a personal level, who do you really want to work with? 
What episode this season was the hardest animate? What was the hardest last season? 
When creating the characters which one went through the most changes while the series was being worked on? 
With the positive reception of season 1, has that given you more confidence/freedom in putting forward ideas and stories this time around? And has your approach changed at all compared to before? 
If you had to add a new permanent camper into Camp Campbell, what would their hobby be? 
What's something that no one has asked you about but that you're dieing to talk about? 
What TV/Movie monster do you guys think will be the most probable to attack Camp Campbell? and the most probable to attack your offices? 
I absolutely loved the end of that episode! Props to the whole animation team! Can we expect more songs in this season of Camp Camp?   
How has moving into your own building changed the department? Do you miss being in the thick of everything at the main RT building? 
In a time in which anti-semitism is on the rise, particularly here in the U.S. and over in Europe, why do you guys think it's funny to make anti-semitic jokes such as the entire episode last season, and the gas chamber jokes this year? As someone who is Jewish, I don't find it funny especially given that most of the people who DO find it funny are anti-semitic.  
In the proposal, you have mentioned that "similar Carter Center projects have eliminated river blindness from four countries in the Americas and from parts of Uganda and Sudan", how is this project different from those ones and what challenges do you anticipate with Nigeria? 
What would you do with the $100 million from the MacArthur Foundation that you are not already doing? 
1) What inspired this idea of yours? Why Nigeria?    2) Did you apply for any other challenges?   3) What do you think your chances are of actually winning?  
Why community volunteers rather than paid employees? 
Do you really think this can be accomplished in 5 years? 
Hi. Given that you have experience in eradication programme (Guinea Worm, OEPA) and Uganda, how do you plan to implement this when you get the funding?  
Will $100 million be sufficient to implement the programme? If not, how will TCC fund the gap? 
What do you think makes this project stand out against the other semi-finalists? 
Has TCC successfully assisted with the elimination of the transmission of river blindness in other countries?  
What are the risks associated with implementation? What could go wrong? 
Hi! I'm a big fan of the Carter Center and the work that you all do! What led you to your current position and program? What is the most unexpected or exciting you've learned or discovered while working with river blindness? 
how will you assess areas that where previously classified as not requiring treatment? 
Hi Dr. Richards. Your work in the Americas and with river blindness around the world is very impressive.   What are the program differences between "elimination" and "control"? Is one easier than the other?   Thanks for doing this! I'm a big fan of TCC 
What books did you read to get where you are now knowledge-wise?  
You said that its good with hardware, have you put it onto a mobile device to see how she performs? Make Stephanie completely mobile using one of the python applications.   Sorry if this is already answered, that was one hell of a wall of text.  
Would you be worried about "Stephanie" going back in time to the 80'same and killing John Connor's mother? 
First and foremost, great job on your project. What do you need to learn in order to build something like this? I'm currently at the stage where the basics of python is already familiar and have used a bit of numpy and pandas for data analysis. 
So what's next in store for you?   What do you do right now except for making projects?  I went through some of the documentation, but I didn't see anything about automation? Was that intentional? Or are you going to put something in it later?  Why not college? 
I have wanted a privacy focused concierge that is completely loyal to me, ever since I lost track of technology. What should I need to accomplish this?    
This is really amazing. Good job mate, I'll definetly look into it (both source code and the APIs). I'm a self-taught as well, even though I didn't really read any book yet (but did read lots of interesting stuff around the internet), now working as a python programmer. How did you come up with the idea of open sourcing it? I think a simple yet powerful open source assistant is really something amazing to work on as an open source project and I will try to read and understand the code in my free time. Also, if I may ask, how old are you? You look pretty young from the pictures (maybe you already stated it somewhere but I didn't notice) 
As a self taught, how you managed to get a programming job? I started this year to learn programming (live in Brazil, programming in Python) and I decided I really want work with this but I don't want and can't go to university so...my question is more regarding to python and self taught aspect of 'getting a programming job'. 
Before MOOCs, what kind of education did you have? How did you break into MOOCs? I can't seem to have the discipline to finish a coursera or edx course! How can I accomplish this? 
Awesome!  What language do you think is the best to learn as a beginner?  I used to code Visual Basic 6 , over 10 years ago as a teenager, and I  have a hard time grasping the thought of programming with 'no interface', IE buttons and such that actually 'create a program' that you can launch from your desktop?  I want to code a simple search engine for amazon -  that allows me to search amazon from my own interface; do you think this is best done in python? 
Do you spend an inordinate amount of time explaining to people that UFOs are not necessarily space ships from planet x and that they are actually, in fact unidentified flying objects?  
What is the strangest thing you discovered in your research?  
What would you most like to tell us that no one has asked about yet?  
Has anyone told you that you look like Steven Spielberg? 
Is there one incident in particular that you can point to that justifies your belief in something "very real" going on?   Also, what's your favorite piece of baseball equipment?  
Thanks for doing this AMA. Most people think UFOs actually are identifiable and belong to the US government. What is something about UFOs that most of us would be shocked to find out? 
Hi Mark,  I must admit I haven't read your book though this is a topic that has interested me quite a bit after witnessing UFO's in the past. I remember Dr. Hynek from various documentaries I've seen where he publicly denounced UFO's in his interviews as a front man and skeptic for the military, was there a pivotal moment or particular case that changed his beliefs?  You mentioned that you have come to share his beliefs that the phenomenon represents 'a new aspect of reality', do you mean simply by the existence of extraterrestrial life, or that it underlies another dimension of our reality itself?   Thanks and best of luck with your AMA! 
How did your perspective on UFOs change (or not) during the time you spent researching the book?  
Who is your favorite sister-in-law?  (Just kidding)  Where could I learn more about how another dimension or vibration may be the explanation of unidentified flying objects?   
Which Tracy brother from the hit show Thunderbirds do you think would be most helpful in the event of an alien invasion?  
What is your favorite depiction of aliens in movies/TV/books?  
Have you personally ever seen a UFO? Or do you know anyone personally who has? 
What's your favorite story about Hynek that didn't make it into the book?  
How does your experiences and knowledge conflict with or confirm your spiritual beliefs and what kind of affect has it had on your thoughts on death specifically? 
Is there anyone presently in the UFO related field who you feel is doing particularly excellent scientific work? 
If we can get a person on Mars, how do you think we'll do it? 
I think it is fair to say that UFO research as a field has a credibility problem in many people's minds. Is there something you feel people should or shouldn't be doing to attract the right/avoid the wrong kind of attention? 
Are there certain parts of the world that have either a greater number or more believable reports of UFO sightings than others?  
Hi Mark, thanks for taking the time to do this ama. I will definitely check out Close Encounters Man. Sounds awesome! Thanks again. Onto the questions:   1. What would you say has been the most hair raising thing you or Dr. Hynek found out while researching UFOs or reports?    2. Do you believe in the Men in Black stories or think they're just made up to add fuel to the whole UFO / aliens phenomenon? 
Where did you get that thing on your shoulder?  If I remember correctly, it's from an episode of Twilight Zone (though it may have been Outer Limits).  That scared the bejeezus out of me as a kid. 
Have you been inspired while writing this book to do some UFO hunting yourself?? 
Hi, thanks for this AMA, do you think UFOs can be us humans from the far future? 
Hello Sir, what's your favourite film genre ?  Favourite movie/director? 
Aren't alien abductions actually black op mind control experiments? 
I'm very surprised to see this book here -- one of my favorites -- thanks for doing it!  I really enjoyed the book's depictions of interactions with law enforcement. Where did the inspiration for Sheriff Mason McKinley come from? Was he a composite character, or really someone from past experiences? 
What would you say is the biggest myth perpetuated by those who advocate against marijuana legalization?  What would you say is the biggest myth perpetuated by those who are for marijuana legalization? 
What are the conditions you most often prescribe for in PA?  
What are your thought about long term effects on intelligence. And has cannabis measureable short term effects on intelligence during the consumption? In short: Do people really get stupider when you are high? 
I'm a sarcoidosis patient with muscle/joint pain and some reduced lung capacity. Are there medical marijuana treatment options that may be suitable? 
I am dealing with an auto-immune related inflammatory condition and have been through so many different medications and treatments, with not much success or relief from my constant pain.  I have been waiting for the medical marijuana law to be passed in PA and now that it has am now waiting for it to be implemented.  How do I start the process for applying for medical marijuana or finding a doctor that is willing to try it as a treatment?  Is your practice in PA anywhere near York?  I have also been debating changing doctors as well and don't know if that might bring in new eyes to my conditions and maybe new treatments.  Do you think it is wise to stay with my current doctor (6 years now) or is there benefit in doctor shopping when dealing with a chronic illness that has no cure? 
How long do you think it will be before marijuana is legalized all over the US? I suffer from chronic pain in a state where marijuana isn't legal, which sucks.  
What are the hardest challenges you face working with something as "Controversial" as Marijuana, do you ever find people who think less of you (either in general or as a doctor) because you have chosen to work with pot? 
I have a mild form of epilepsy that mostly causes me to experience panic attacks in fear that I will have a seizure more so than actually having seizures.   In your opinion would medicinal cannabis help combat this panic during flare ups or would it worsen the situation with potential episodes of paranoia on top of the panic attacks? 
What is the greatest benefit of using marijuana shown by research and do you have links to any of this research? Curious to read more about studies that have shown benefits. 
Illinois resident checking in! Thinking about going to get my license soon, if it's possible. I have been on and off dozens of anxiety and depression medications for the last five years. All of which either only worked for a short time or had horrendous side effects. Because I don't want to rely on highly addictive anxiety drugs the rest of my life (in my 20's) I would really want to try some tinctures or edibles. I do not want to get high or smoke, I just want some relief. Do you think medical marijuana could help me? And if so, what strain/method of consumption would be best for me?  
Live in Maryland, which is attempting to set up a medical marijuana market.  What has and hasn't worked for the PA and DE programs? 
Is smoking marijuana as healthy as other methods like pill or edible form? 
Have you ever heard of Retnitis Pigmentosa (RP)?  It's a retinal disorder that causes night blindness and eventually legal blindness in a small percentage of the population.   I'm asking because I've seen 'studies' done that say marijuana can improve night vision and wanted to hear your thoughts on it. Even something that seems insignificantly small to you could be the difference between me feeling comfortable to leave my apartment at night or not.  Thanks for your time and keep up the great work!! 
What are your thoughts on using marijuana recreationally for someone with a mental illness? I have bipolar disorder and usually whenever I ask I get mixed messages. Some people say go for it, others are very against it. Thank you!!! 
Do you believe that a national legalization of recreational marijuana will offer more benefits than consequences? Some potential negatives is that it might seem like the government is telling everyone that doing drugs is okay and that it might encourage the legalization of harder drugs (i.e., how do we know when we're crossing a line, is there a line?). Some positives that come to mind is that it could bring about an entire industry out of the 'black market,' so to speak, and lead to the creation of potentially thousands (maybe millions?) of jobs -- and as a result, more tax revenue for the government? Furthermore, if you don't mind me asking, how do you weigh the 'potential' pros and cons as an individual vs. being a physician? Is it even possible to separate the two now? :P Thanks :) 
Dr. Roman, why do you think the more conservative areas of the USA like the southeast, Midwest, mid-south, southwest and great plains states have governors and state legislators that are so opposite to medical marijuana laws for their own state? 
Dr. Roman, what do you think of the situation in California where doctors will give a prescription for almost any ailment and condition? 
Dr. Roman, related to the science of the brain why are psychologists and mental therapist opposed to their patients using marijuana? 
Dr. Roman, what are the positive or negative affects of Marijuana with the conditions of Tinnitus and Visual Snow? How are hearing and visual problems affected in a negative or positive way? 
Dr. Roman, have you made any efforts to lobby to change the federal laws about marijuana? 
the biggest misconception about using marijuana as a potential treatment?  
I once saw a program where someone with Tourette and many ticks got medicinal marijuana. He was so calm after that but still functioned well.                           So my question: if you would use medicinal marijuna long enough, would it reduce the symptoms when you lower the dose over time to 0?                                  (Sorry for my bad English)                
Could medical marijuana have side effects such anxiety and paranoia in someone who experiences this smoking it?    
What do you do if people are looking for a medical card, and seem to have nothing wrong with them? Is it awkward telling them they're not qualified to receive a card? 
Somewhere in the 90's there was a chicken disease in Belgium, my country, and millions of chickens had to be slaughtered. It ended up as a faits divers in international newspapers. A Chinese family friend's wife, in China, stopped buying chickens for months. Even though there was no chicken export from Belgium to China. Plus, the Belgians just slaughtered them all. No export anywhere.  Anecdotal as fuck, I know, but many Chinese are so irrational and superstitious, especially the ones buying things like rhino horn,  that I feel that's your best entry to alter their behavior. Spread rumors of horn or ivory contaminated with radioactive material to aid in tracking them by satellite but causing leukemia.. stuff like that.. What do you think? 
What was the hardest part of being undercover?  When undercover were you ever found out? 
Probably a stupid question, but what was it like working at interpol and how did it compare to working as an undercover cop? 
why do governments destroy shipments of seized ivory? Wouldn't it be better to sell it, and reinvest the earnings into prevention? 
What does the day-to-day of your job consist of? Are you trying to stop the people hunting the rhinos or more catching the people selling them far after they're dead, or all in between? 
Have you been in many/any life threatening situations? What's the scariest one you can remember? 
Does trophy hunting help fund elephant conservation? 
Eve of UK election - thoughts on dropping banning of ivory trade from particular manifestos?  
 If you found a lamp, would you rub it and kind of hope it was a magic one?     If a genie popped out and granted you three wishes, what would they be?      If the magic part was that after vigorously rubbing the lamp instead of a genie popping out, the lamp would reach orgasm, would you be happy that you had found a magic lamp or disappointed that you had gotten a lamp off, and presumably were now covered in lamp cum?   
i have like a friend who is like wanted by interpols how can he avoid getting busted? and what do you think of the situation in venezuela? 
Will we get any benefit from interpol after Brexit?  
Have you ever ran out of toilet paper, but only realised after you pinched one off? If so, what was your next move? 
Are you in fact a living Pez Dispenser or Jimmy Neutron all growed up?  
Hi Jordan!  Love your work on The Daily Show  What's a typical day working on the Daily Show like for you?  When they're shooting an episode that you're not in, are you still there lurking around backstage, or do you just get to stay home and watch Netflix that day or what? 
Why did you settle on guns for the topic of your special? Personal experience, outside influence, the fact that it's so hot right now? 
Hello Jordan, I like your work on The Daily Show :)  My questions are:  1.  What was the most dangerous experience you and the crew had while shooting (pun intended) the special? 2.  Do you think Apple making its gun emoji into a water gun emoji will help solve guns? 
Unrelated to guns, do you have a favorite Daily Show piece you've done so far?  
Why didn't you reach out to popular gun rights personalities such as Dana Loesch, Colion Noir, John Lott, etc. about common ground?  
Hi Jordan, really been enjoying your work on the Daily Show, and my question is what is your favorite on location shoot that you've done for the show? 
Is it true that the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is to have a good guy with a gun shoot him? 
Is there a difference between our gun crisis and our violence crisis? It seems that shootings may be the result of an underlying problem. In Europe, murderers are weaponizing motor vehicles by driving into crowds. Is there really an underlying cultural, economic crisis?  
" I even try to convince my own cousin to give up his shotguns"  If this isn't an anti-gun special, why did you do this? 
How did you get into DJing/producing? Did you have friends that were into it, or did you just learn everything by yourself? Also, which software/equipment did you start off with?  p.s. come to Cape Town and perform please, I love your stuff 
YAEJI, you have such DOPE AMAZING style in how you dress. What are your influences and what looks are you feeling right now?  
Do you have any advice to offer for anyone trying to stand out in the sea of producers right now? 
Yaeji,  You posted a picture of yourself crouching next to a late 80's car wheel and said something to the effect of "coming soon" (before noonside and feel it out came out)  I assumed it was a single cover, but that pic hasn't been used, so was this a song that got backburnered or was another image used for that song?  Thanks,  P.s. I tell everyone that will listen to me to give you a shot, the last two people i told already knew who you were! 
Does graphic design influence the way you approach music? I love the aesthetic you create with those "all iPhone created" videos your produce on your Instagram. 
Most interesting experience you've had being a producer? 
What's it like working with 88rising? Seems like they have a pretty good reputation. Love your music btw 
How long does it take you to finish one song? And do you have a process that you go through before making music? 
hi Yaeji - i just discovered your music a few days ago and it really hit me in a way not a lot of music ever as. thank you so much. I wanted to ask - what does making a track look like for you, in terms of your process? also - do you like ducks?    
Would you rather fight 1 horse-sized duck or 100 duck-sized horses? 
when did you start making music & who has influenced you most? 
If you could work with any producer/ musician dead or alive who would it be? 
Hi Yaeji! I think your music is wonderful and I really admire you! Do you have any tips for a yung gurl starting off producing? Also how did you put yourself out there and what advice do you have when reaching out to people? 
Hi Yaeji, got to say, your music is awesome. Are you planning on any European tour? 
My dad bought a sports car and kept telling me about all the chicks he was banging. Hated that time period.  
This reminds me of the Malcom in the Middle Episode "Hal quits"  
Dad shoes- check  Dad belly -check Dad shorts-check  Can confirm your dad is a dad. 
That painting is A-Fucking-Mazing.  After my divorce all I did was bang a 20 year old Daytona stripper, goddamnit what am I doing with my life. 
Does he always paint in front of a guillotine? How emo of him 
That looks soooo amazing, I'd buy a print of it! I want it on my wall!!! 
So badass. My dad starts projects, goes on a drug binge and never finishes.  
Definitely thought that was a guillotine behind the painting... 
What an amazing dad he must've been, I'm sure the kid will cherish that guitar for the rest of his life. Hopefully one day we'll see him rocking out with it on the front page!  
That Guitar is the physical manifestation of a Father's love.  I hope no one ever steals or breaks that guitar because that guy will go John Wick on their ass. 
I'm 34 and I lost my dad 16 months ago but it still stings. This hit me right in the feels...  I can't imagine the pain of losing a father at 16.   And while the meaning of the gift is everything, that's a Deans Guitar...that's a thrasher guitar... 
I'm not crying.  YOURE CRYING!  Ah Reddit.  The only place you can look at a woman's butthole one second and then cry for a kid getting a guitar the next.  All while shitting at work.  What a time to be alive! 
This kid happens to go to my high school, he gets bullied a lot and to see him get all this love has shown most of these kids we are all human and have feelings. 
While the video is awesome it makes me feel super bad.    Early on I was all like "this kid is stoned", "what a douche", etc.  Then she's like, "dad got this before he died" and I start feeling super terrible.  I am a bad human being and feel terrible.  I'd buy the kid a pack of strings to make up for my assholishness if I knew where to send them.  I'm going to go sulk for being a dick now! 
God, I've most so much faith in people. One of my first thoughts was he's going to be absolutely crushed when some asshole steals it. 
I think I was here last year on Reddit when the last one came out. I'll see ya next year, OP. 
Hilarity for Charity was started by Seth and his wife Lauren in 2012. HFC is a fund that benefits the alzheimers association. I was able to go to events for HFC the past four years, taking each iteration of this picture. Check out hilarityforcharity.org for more information on what HFC does and their events.  
*Checks OP's post history*   *Last post 1 year ago and about meeting Seth Rogen on an annual basis*   Alright, it checks out, great photo. 
*Ah-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh!* ~Seth Rogan, probably 
Could you explain how you come into contact with Seth Rogen on an annual basis?  
I can hear the laugh and the last picture's laugh and the the last and the last. 
For some reason you look like a cardboard cutout placed next to Seth Rogen. 
So, do you guys just call each other and arrange it at this point? 
As a former wild-land firefighter, the public is filled with fucking idiots and I am amazed by the fires started by people's sheer stupidity. 
"Wokey Bear"...  "Your honor, it's *completely* different." 
I've had many a sleepless night knowing that I am the only one out of several billion people that could prevent forest fires.  I even went as far as moving to the arctic circle to distance myself from forests as much as possible.  My family would write me periodically to inform me of forest fires in the states.  How is this possible?  I'm living on ice, eating seal, and fucking penguins.  There's no way I could have done that!  I killed myself last week to prevent forest fires once and for all.  It was a tremendous sacrifice, but one that needed to be made.  You're welcome, earth. 
Smokey the Bear is the mascot for the National Forest Service, not the NPS. They are separate entities. 
"When I was a kid, I remember seeing Smokey the Bear on TV saying, "Only you can prevent forest fires." So I'd sneak out of the house in the middle of the night with a bucket of water."  (Credit to comedian Steven Wright). 
Best way to eliminate forest fires is to cut down all the trees. 
"Only you can *postpone* forest fires."  Seriosuly, forest fires are natural.  Lots of trees have evolved fast burning foliage and thick bark to survive them.  Some tree seeds use heat to spread their seeds.  But if the undergrowth doesn't get burned out often enough, then it builds up, and then once there finally *is* a fire, it's too hot to survive because of all the kindling.  That bear has been tricking us.  He's got us gathering fuel for our own funeral pyre. 
I want to buy a shirt with this on it. Can anyone tell me where I can buy a shirt like this?  
They haven't been defunded though. I guess the circle jerk is strong though. 
A cut in budget is not de-funding. Typical hyperbole. 
Lol nope, the USFS budget has been going straight up for years.  
The marketing and advertising is really goofy.  I hear their commercial often on the radio in Indiana and the mid west where there is virtually no threat of forest fires.  Money better spent elsewhere.  
On a serious note... how often did they stop forest fires anyway?    Cause it feels like at least once a year some part of California's forestry burns to the ground.   
Smokey the Bear is a relic of an old and shitty understanding of nature. Forest fires are a natural part of the life cycle of a forest. Without them, you end up with a situation where there is a massive amount of basically tinder that should have burned up in small fires years ago. Instead, after humans spend decades preventing forest fires, eventually a lightning bolt hits and we are left with wildfires that are gigantic and devastating and completely unnatural and would have been completely avoidable if Smokey the Fucking Bear hadn't been leading a charge to prevent small manageable forest fires in the first place.  Get fucked Smokey. 
Sorry. You liberals spent all your money on illegal aliens, welfare, corrupt unions, middle east wars, and funding other countries so they can make solar panels (where the money gets stolen anyway).  
Collectively, we have funded many things for many generations.  In the US, the UK, the EU - whatever you like.  Things have worked for 70 years just fine.  Why are we suddenly all so poor that we can't afford the things our parents enjoyed for decades?  And why do my parents live in fucking mansions while I struggle to make rent for a shitty flat?    There are a lot of questions need answering in this day and age.  I might suggest violence, but they've armed the police to the teeth too these days.  Protest is pointless.     
Every time I see a fully clothed person fall into water, I can only think about their phone. 
Don't worry, bike guy was training for a triathlon anyways. 
His only mistake was letting go of the umbrella.   Could've Mary Poppins the shit out of that. 
I'd bet that skateboard wouldn't even have made it over that ledge.   Makes it very /r/BetterEveryLoop. 
Ironic. He could save others from water... But not himself. 
I don't want to be that guy, but his awkward movement and the way his path keeps track with the board make it look staged. 
plot twist - biker is just commuting to work, had no idea or intention of saving the skateboard. 
who skates in wet?  it smokes bearings in no time.  
If questioned about my ties to Russia, I'll take the fifth...of vodka. 
In Mother Russia nothing in this world can said to be certain except death, taxes, and vodka. 
I had no idea what a Moscow Mule was a few weeks ago, until I walked into a bar and saw people drinking out of a copper cup.  I asked what it was and decided to give one a try.  I have to say, that's one tasty adult beverage.   
Honestly I laughed, but IMO it's always a risky move to make a political statement like that. You risk alienating a large portion of your audience. If it was already a niche product that you know only conservatives or liberals are gonna buy like bibles or almond butter or something that's one thing, but vodka seems pretty universal.  
I used to drink Smirnoff. I still do, but I used to too. 
I see this picture being posted on Facebook. The first comment will be,  "NEVER BUYING SMIRNOFF AGAIN! TIRED OF THESE LIBERAL HYPOCRITES. *something about obama* " 
Didn't trump say he'd be happy to talk about it under oath too? 
Not trying to be the Reddit dick but has anyone verified the truthfulness of this ad. I could totally imagine it being a fake l33t interweb pixturez. 
I don't really drink alcohol that much anymore. Is Smirnoff any good? 
(*crosses fingers*) Please be real and not photoshop 
"you just lost a customer!! stay out of politics idiots!" - 50 year old bald white guy with jorts  
Today at r/pics:   An ad.   It's literally just an ad. 
Guess we're just not doing the U.S. Politics tags anymore? 
"why does everything have to be political?" - Trump supporters  
i used to get on at the same bus stop and ride the same bus with her every morning in Seattle. her owner hated all of the publicity she gets but he understood. she would sometimes get on the bus without him paying attention then she would get off at the dog park and he would meet her there. very cool dog  
That's what Eclipse wants you to think.  She's actually cashing Social Security checks for her owner, who is buried in the backyard. 
Wow, it took me at least eighteen years to get my act together as much as this dog right here. 
Making my way downtown, barking fast, woof woof I'm a dog with a buspass 
Good for her. I always feel bad for pets that are stuck at home alone all day while their owners are at work.  
And I know fucking 20 year olds who can't even do their own laundry.  
She's a strong independent doggo who don't need no man  
Let me start by saying this is awesome and I'm glad it happens.  But..... How is this legal? I thought most cities have rules against unattended animals and whatnot.  
This company not only understands dogs but also gave the value of two toys in one. 
What's in the sad cactus, though?  I have to know. 
This is fantastic! Was the toy marketed this way, or was it a surprise? 
It's cool when they do stuff like this.  Costco used to sell some that were like 4 legged animal toys, and inside the "feet" were tennis balls.  
Did you get this from Barkbox? Because my roomie's dog got this EXACT toy in a Barkbox and 25 min later, this sad cactus emerged. The flower and one arm of the cactus were pooped out a couple days later... 
The cynical side of me is telling me this is vital marketing and that someone making minimum wage had to chew it it to make it look authentic.  
That baby is just asserting its dominance. By the look on Dad's face, it's working. 
You got tea bagged... in real life... by your kid? 
At least there wasn't crap coming out the sides of the diaper, splattering it all over your face.  
That kid's gonna grow up to become a WWE superstar and this will be his finishing move. 
I'm a teacher.  The wife works a normal job.  We have a 1.5 and a 3.5 year old.  I have more control over 28 middle schoolers in a classroom than I do over these 2. It's week 2 of the summer, I may not live until the end of it.  
"And after this I'm gonna suck on your wife's titty" - That kid probably 
Fellow father here of a 3yr old boy. Gotta give you props on the solid diaper change. No protruding ass cheeks and is able to withstand a solid amount of violent movements. Well done. 
why do kids do this?!?! i lay on the floor to play with my son...i assume hes going to get a toy or a drink or something...seconds later its like mortal kombat "FINISH HIM" and out of nowhere...baby ass..in the face. little bugger. lol 
Wow OP you could be my husband's twin brother.  I had to look at the gif for a minute to convince myself you are in fact a different person. I showed my husband and he says "holy shit I have a twin!"  Are you aware of any missing family? (I'm half kidding, but DH was adopted...) 
My niece used to do this and we'd call it the stripper dance. Now she's older and randomly does this off-brand twerk and we're trying to figure out who taught her. 
More proof not having kids was the right choice for me 
I'm in my early 20's and there's times where I would really like to have a child of my own.. then I see shit like this. 
That's great news.  Props to the EMTs and medical staff. Some real heroes at work there. 
Good to hear.  Have we heard about the Manchester victims yet? Last I heard there were still 10 in critical condition.  
Good to read. The response to the attacks by the various authorities, from what I've read at least, was excellent. Definitely helped limit the number of casualties.  
Absolutely fantastic. The EMS crews (and anyone who gave first aid) did amazing work that night. 
I really hope there aren't too many disfiguring injuries amongst those.  
48 victims?  First time hearing this amount.  Damn 
We're so lucky to have the NHS.  Fuck anyone that wants to privatise it. 
Well stabbings in London from gang violence isn't that uncommon. I imagine Hospitals weren't too taken aback by the injuries.   Everyone knows someone who knows someone who knows someone, whose been stabbed in London. 
Great news. But what is the U.K. government doing to help prevent future attacks? Are the citizens just supposed to rely on terrorists being terrible at their jobs? 
How's the cop who took them on with just a nightstick?  
And in true vending machine fashion, it got stuck without dispensing a single item.. 
Healthy, Wealthy, Wise... "Let's fill it with chips" 
30 years of dungeon crawlers have conditioned me. I believe this may be a mimic. 
This is not a bug, this is a feature. I learned vending machines had a 'motor testing' function which will distribute one item of each when in maintenance mode.  Source: vending machine guy at work once forgot to remove it after filling The machine. Hilarity (and free stuff) ensued. 
This is like a cruel joke. All the snacks you can handle but no way to get them out.  
"...And that was the beginning of the end.  The day the machines became self aware and revolted." 
There's a trick to getting free stuff and I feel a little guilty giving it away.  Find out what day and time the vending machine guy comes in to restock.  Wait until he's done and locks the machine back up.  You only have about a thirty second window here, so you'll need to be quick.  Once he leaves the area, stab him to death and steal his truck. 
It would be rude to not break the glass and take its offering.  
1-eat everything  2-hospital 3-workers comp 4-profit 
That's what you get when you accidentally hit the star.star buttons on a machine running a 1980's program. 
"No thanks, we already have a no soliciting sign."  "Right, but as you can see it isn't working." 
"If you say no, I'll be back every single day until you say yes." 
A friend of mine use to sell peepholes for doors.  He would drive around and every time he saw a house with no peephole on the front door he would knock.  When they opened the door he would take his cordless drill, hold it up in the air, pull the trigger and say "This could have been a gun, would you like me to install a peephole for you?  It's $50 and only takes 15 minutes. "  About half the houses he stopped at would buy a $50 peephole.  He bought them in bulk for about $2 each. 
Too bad they don't work.  Source: the no soliciting sign on my house 
Had a kid come by once, selling magazines or vacuums or Civil War dioramas (I don't remember, I wasn't really paying attention), and I interrupted him and said, while tapping the "No Soliciting" sign on my front door, "didn't you see the sign?" and he throws his hands up and says "oh, I'm not a prostitute."  .......  Ok, I mean, you're not wrong, but... 
He just created a monopoly in his neighborhood preventing future competitors. Next year new sign design. 
what you need is what i do. Make a sign saying you have a baby sleeping and not to ring bell or knock. no one wants to risk it being a real sign and waking a baby to have an angry parent 
I love that this sign looks like it came from a craft shop!  Like someone trying to have something that tells people to go away but in a nice grandma way! 
Brilliant and he salts the earth behind him to eliminate the competition on his way to the top.  
Not good for repeat business, but he can sustain this model as far as his motorized scooter can take him (until it gets dark, anyway)  
Find that kid and tell him to make a sign that hangs from that one that says "Except Girl Scout Cookies" and option that as a $3-5 upgrade. 
So he was a solicitor selling no soliciting signs?  
If only those signs actually worked. Solicitors around here give zero fucks about that sign. 
I always buy when kids come and try to sell something. Seems like good positive reinforcement to going out and working for something, good for them.  
I have a No Soliciting sign on my door. It's red. I have come to the conclusion that people do not know what that S word means anymore. Pest control/solar panel/vivint guys I'm looking at you! 
I like how Netflix continues past bedtime.  If you don't go to sleep, tomorrow morning will take longer to arrive. 
This is too accurate. Who are you? Where are you hiding?? 
Definitely the panic.  I have to get up two hours earlier than normal tomorrow so I can make it to a carpool lot I'm not even entirely sure how to get into, spend two hours in a car with my boss and boss's boss, have a meeting with our pickiest client so they can complain at us in person instead of over the phone, then spend two more hours in the car to get back to my car, then a half-hour drive home.  Maybe I can call in dead tomorrow. 
HOW CAN WE KNOW ANYTHING WITHOUT UNITS OF MEASUREMENT?! PANIC INCREASING! 
I don't see "self-hatred" anywhere on this graph.  
I'm color blind, but I'm really interested to know what is what :( 
Unless you're a teacher then you don't have to worry for a few weeks! But then you gotta deal with 36 kids all day for 10 months so it evens out.. 
I was feeling this exactly and decided to open Reddit. Not sure how I feel about this. 
only difference for me is panic would be at a constant y=10 
sorry mister, no upvote unless x- and y-axes are labeled. 
I have an audit to deal with on Tuesday, so I'm dreading Sunday ending. Audit. I swear that's the most adult word. Fucking audit.  
stay awake as long as possible. keep the dream alive. weekend 4eVa! 
Sunday is definitely a shitty and overrated day most of the time. 
Serious question. How do you deal with what I call Sunday Dread? I start thinking about work just after lunch on Sunday, and as the afternoon wears on I just get more in a funk.  
Why 'Netflix shows' are a staircase? Are they consumed instantaneously? 
I really like that approach to input validation. Nothing subtle, just "No." 
For a minute I thought the site was letting you specify what age range your partners preferred range was.  
The rule of thumb is half your age, plus seven years for the minimum age to date. So even a legit 5 year-old can't go lower than a gal who's 10. That's a lot of pressure.  
I like how short,simple,and direct that is. You can almost feel the website's disapointment in you through the text. 
Typical OKC...people that are afraid of pedophiles need to grow up. 
I remember early on, their website had a question asking if you had an STD. If you clicked yes it gave you a link to e-harmony.  
The real question here is what do you have against 39 year olds? 
I have the right to date a 500 year old woman if I want to, what's wrong with that? 
Now can they use machine image learning to call out the "body shape" lies that are absolutely widespread on there 
She really had to wait for her costume to develop, lots of years went into the planning. 
this is one of those trick costumes its actually the bird dressed up as the old lady 
She probably watched this show as a kid, waited some 50 years, and then said, "Finally, I'm ready now." That's dedication. 
A cosplay post that doesn't involve a young, sexy girl? I'm proud of you Reddit. Next you're gonna tell me she doesn't play video games half naked on Twitch for donations.  
You don't see a lot of Emma Webster cosplays but this is great. Have to admire the dedication to bring accessories as well. 
Oh father, why can't you be like the other pussycat's fathers? 
This is actually really awesome. I'm sure that she heard that her grandkids wanted to go, but their parents refused to take them, so she stepped up and went the extra mile even. This actually seems like something that my grandmother would have done when she was alive. 
Y'all do realize this photo's been up on the internet for several years, right? 
Goes to show that cosplay is for anyone who wants to do it. 
Really, I'm surprised anyone on Reddit knows who Granny is.  
Why is this so highly upvoted?  And what happened to "check out this costume" why is everything a *cosplay* now? 
I actually thought this was Elizabeth from Bioshock until I saw Sylvester. The cage really did it for me. 
I was ready to roll my eyes because of the headline, but that really is a good cosplay. 
Watch Warner Brothers start doing live action movie remakes like Disney. Now I'm trying to think of what actors to cast... 
I remember seeing Adam West and Burt Ward at Comic-Con in 2010. Funny, classy guys, both of them. They had the whole Q&A audience laughing with anecdotes and jokes, and they even had little kids who had probably never seen any of the old Batman series in awe.   I went up to the microphone and asked Adam West if he would dance the Batusi for us. He replied, "Well... I don't have my cape! But seeing as how I am a master of The Boogie, I will!", then he did. Delightful of him to humor such a lame request.  Another question someone had was, "Burt, you were really young on set. Did Adam take you under his wing? Show you the ropes?" Burt Ward looked over at Adam West and said, "No, not really. He was supportive, but he also liked to take me to parties. Get me drunk...."  To which Adam West leaned over and said into his microphone, "O-R-G-Y!" 
One of my favorite roles of his was The Grey Ghost in Batman: The Animated Series. He had a number of great cameos in other animated Batman shows too.  
"Ha! What kind of name is Paul for a cat? That's a people name!"  rip :( 
Of what use is a dream if not a blueprint for courageous action.  -Adam West 
Some actors transcend their profession and become icons. Adam West was an icon.  More than a man, a symbol.   RIP Master West 
I know Family Guy gets a lot of hate on this website but he was great on that show. RIP Mayor West. 
Aw man. First we lose a James Bond, now a Batman? :( 
Oh no...  Goddamit. I used to sneak over to the neighbor's house to watch Batman when I was a little kid and thought it was the coolest thing ever.  Man, this sucks.    
Adam West is actually the greatest actor to ever live. He spent years reciting 60s Batman dialog with a completely straight-face, really owning all that insane bullshit as if it made perfect sense. There was no irony there, just sincerity to the craft. I dare you to try that. 
Holy popcorn, Batman!   One hell of a career spanning decades, RIP Batman, Mayor West and countless other characters. 
As a huge Batman fan, I remember watching reruns with my Dad who had watched it as a kid when it first aired. It was always cool for me to imagine my Dad watching Batman with as much awe and fun as I did watching BTAS. You're bip zapping in the sky now Adam West. May your villians be silly, your cave labeled, and your ward a dorky slightly puggy man in tights.  
Can he get his star on the Hollywood Walk now? RIP Batman Mayor West 
I like the end... "Did anyone else just see that?" 
You're telling me I can just go down whenever I want???? 
I've never seen such a human display of confusion from a dog before. Makes the puppy seem older than it is, and his confusion more frustration since his legs are too damn short! 
"Wait a minute..wait what? No..can't be, nope nope...but..how?" 
Doggo: "I'm trying to free your mind, pupper. But I can only show you the stairs. You're the one that has to walk down them. You have to let it all go: fear, doubt, and disbelief. Free your mind."  Pupper: "Whoa." 
Pupper32 is trying to install StairManuvers.exe... would you like to proceed? 
Nice gif, but can we all agree that saying doggo is fucking lame? 
What about the XBOX ONE X IN ONE XBOX ONE X BOX lmao 
Xbox  Xbox 360  Xbox One  Xbox One S  X.B.O.X. (Xbox One X)  We've come full circle... 360 degrees... One lap around the memes... X. 
If they really want to fuck with Sony they should just name it Xbox 6 
No longer convinced the word 'one' could be possibly spelled like that. What?  
Xbox Box by Dr Seuss  Xbox Socks Box Knox  Knox in box. Xbox in socks.  Knox on fox in socks in box.  Socks on Knox and Knox in box.  Xbox in socks on box on Knox.    $500 
It's like when Goku tried to explain super saiyan blue to Frieza  
Say whatever you want about Microsoft's gaming department, their naming sense is the worst in the whole business.  
You can tell they took xbone pretty hard, Xbox one X, from X.B.One to X.B.O.X now. 
Looked at that picture for too long and now the word "one" looks weird to me.  
I just don't understand... Scorpio was a sweet ass name for a console. Just why... 
They should have just kept the name Scorpio. It would be better then this Xbox one X shit. 
i dont even get it. is this X Box One X a new system, like ps1 to ps2? or is it a variant to XBONE, like the the xbox 360 and the 360s (or whatever the smaller one was) 
I like the unwritten but clearly present tongue click in the last panel. 
"Really, though, what's your wish?"  "That... that was it."  "Are you sure?"  "Well, I mean... hey! No, stop it! You're not helping!"  "Sure I am. If you second-guess yourself enough to waste a wish on it, then you're probably suffering from some other psychological hang-up. Fixing the symptom won't fix the underlying problem."  "So I should wish for you to fix something else about me?"  "Yep."  "Okay, like what?"  "Well, to start with, it seems like you're hallucinating genies." 
"Hey, perhaps i should jump of that cliff!"   "perhaps you should recon..."   "Nope! Wheeeee...!" 
Unfunny post follows: The inability to second guess yourself is a severe disability often caused by blunt trauma head injury.   "Metacognitive disability" comes with the inability to believe yourself wrong. Patients given a task like assembling a sandwich. will look at failed results and say things like "The bread is the wrong shape." or even tell the researcher that they are the one who messed up the sandwich. The bottom line is that they cannot help in their own rehabilitation because they are unable to correct themselves.  When I had to learn this because of a recovering family member it occurred to me that people normally have different levels of metacognitive ability to start with.  
Hey dude, I follow you on Insta. Love your artwork. Keep it up! If you're ever in Toronto let me know I'd buy you a beer. 
That moment when you dont understand the post and are too afraid to ask... 
can someone be so kind to explain whats happening? 
I want to get it, but I must be missing something. Can someone explain the joke/reference? 
Dude, you're one of my favorite follows on Instagram. Your comics are great.  Also, I want so bad for your Texan emojis to be real. 
I'd have wished for a hundred trillion dollars tax free.  Fuck you money can make you very, very decisive.  
if only the photographer had taken a step or two to the left, they could have had the peak framed by the leaves, rather than being obscured by one. 
Beautiful picture.  Fall colors and still waters.  It's snowing on Mount Fuji. 
Many thanks my friend.  This is a wonderful pic.  Its snowing on Mt.Fuji.  
Very nice image, but i can't help but think the reflection is shopped... The blur seems unnatural and the reflection of the tree leaves looks off.....   
Autumn leaves frame eye.  It's snowing on Mount Fuji.  Mogami River. 
That water reflection is fake. Unless the camera was placed almost at water level, you are not gonna get that level of symmetry for objects at all depths. And if you did, the leaves in the foreground are not gonna be at that level. 
I definitely understand why people become weeabos, Japan is beautiful and has a fascinating history. 
I'm gonna say it, I feel like this would look better without the upper tree in the way. Other than that, brilliant! 
I'm going to Hakone as a stop during my honeymoon in November.  SUPER EXCITED!  I'm hoping it'll look a lot like (or similar to) this.   
OP must be a girl because girls are always talking about how much they love the Fall.  
It wouldn't be a console launch without a Skyrim port announcement 
I used to be space traveler like you until I took a pulsating plasma bolt in the patella. 
You forgot the relaunch of their renamed paid mods program that are some how not paid mods 
In 41 years time Bethesda will only release an engine for which we have to pay for, then they will tell us to make the game. But they will release it without official tools or documentation, just to keep things like good old days.  Their marketing slang will be, *Make the Elder Scrolls game of your dreams all by yourself*  *we now included horse armour as a starting content for all creators just for 9.99$* 
spot on... pretty annoyed to STILL be hearing about Skyrim at every single gaming convention... 
I'm starting to wonder if the next Elder Scrolls game will be Skyrim 2. Hell I hope it is for the sake of them pumping funding/resources into it.  From a marketing perspective, they have to know that "Skyrim" is now more marketable than "The Elder Scrolls" at this point. 
man, they really don't want to let skyrim die huh?...I was in high school when it first came out and now I have been graduated from college for a year now and I still see mentions of skyrim...and still having presentations about it all these years later. Sheesh... 
It wouldn't be so annoying if they also said "And while Skyrim keeps you busy, here's a sneak peak at Fallout 5 / Elder Scrolls 6" that is still years away. At least we know it's coming and we can get some screenshots into our system to tide us over. Skyrim was good, but it's time to learn what you did well and do better.   AI pathing, larger towns and more civilian populations, more customized gear that doesn't devolve into "this one is better, no this one is better, no this one is" , more dynamic events (Like bandits raiding towns, caravans, patrols) , and for gods sake Horse Armor that comes standard.   
Pete Hines aged pretty damn well over those 35 years. 
Bethesda - "please keep buying Skyrim so we dont have to write a story or characters" 
I wasn't too upset about ESO because they created a new studio to make it so it didn't distract from TES VI.   As a PC player who got the special edition for free, I wasn't upset at it because apparently they ported Skyrim to the new engine as practice for FO4 anyways so might as well release it.   Legends was cool too because it was developed by Dire Wolf, so again not distracting from what we really want.  Skyrim for Switch and the "Creation Club" though? What the fuck is BGS doing? Their new IPs better be amazing.. 
At least it'll run on a new game engine, right? ...right? 
Seriously, Bethesda, are you even working on Elder Scrolls VI? 
In all seriousness they have gone way downhill. It's like EA 2.0 except they don't make new games. Fallout 4 wasn't that good and that's basically in since Skyrim and addons for Skyrim, which I played in 2012 lol.  
I see Skyrim as a game that will be ported to everything in the future, just like people today port Doom to Ti Calculators and random electronics.  Some guy will have Skyrim running on his watch. 
The way I see it, the reason it is taking so long for elder scrolls 6 is because they are making an entirely brand new engine. That takes time. So what they're doing is trying to fill in the gap years with as much as they can. My guess is either 2018 or 2019 we'll get the ES6 reveal at E3 and it will be all about their amazing new engine. 
People make fun of Bethesda but Capcom has had a port of Resident Evil 4 on every major console since the GameCube release. Surprised I haven't seen it for the Switch yet 
A lot of developers (and publishers) are simply greedy corporations. They'd do anything to milk their franchises dry if it means you are still paying for them. We'd already have a new Elder Scrolls if people would stop buying Skyrim. Although probably a worse game if we are looking at what they did with Fallout 4. It seems many devs are cutting costs because HD/4K is too taxing. But I don't care how good the game looks, I want fun gameplay. Something that is unfortunately not the priority for many gamers. 
I love my ES games. Love them to death, but lets look at the dates.  - Arena: 1994 - Daggerfall: 1996 - Morrowind: 2002 - Oblivion: 2006 - Skyrim: 2011  You're due Bethesda. 
That truck driver knows what's up. He's wayyyy back there. 
The way he strikes a pose and just holds it, definitely an alpha move. 
Does anything in the wild mess with an alpha gorilla? Or are they at the top of the pyramid? 
The term for the dominant male in a gorilla troop is 'Silverback'   Owing to, y'know, that silver back that males develop upon reaching maturity 
his son is like "yo dad you need some help?" and he is like "no billy move along" and billy moves along cause he knows his dad is noone to be messed with 
"Dave, seriously man, wish it away!"  "I wish I were a bird!" 
It's rare something in /r/funny is actually funny and original!  
Thank god I started drinking cucumber water this morning instead of my regular coffee.    LPT: Cucumber water going through the nose soothes allergy flared sinuses fairly well. Smells kind of good too. 
This is great! I hope you can post more of these OP. 
I'm just really happy to find out dinosaurs spoke English. 
What a dick. Because of him the dinasour who wanted a fresh start for the planet Earth got his wish come true :( 
I belted out laughing, that was hilarious. What the hell did he launch himself off of to get that rifle-bullet trajectory?? 
I love it when a dog is so amped up they end up knocking me on my ass. It's hysterical. 
Ok before anyone yells repost, this genuinely made me laugh out loud and I have yet to see it before.   Just let some fun things be fun pls. 
That was like a 100lb wet log flying through the air. Absolutely horrifying if you don't know that log is also your best friend.  
Does anyone have a video source with sound for this? 
Why do dogs do this exactly? It's like they're all spirit and no awareness of their own bodies. 
I know I'm getting old because the first thing I thought of was "her parent's wood floor though...." 
I can't stop laughing at this.   Thank you, OP. I've never seen this before and I've had a shit week. I needed this.  
I didn't know 'all colors at once' was an option for squirrels 
Do you have a version of this photo without HDR and saturation cranked up? I'm sure it's still a cool picture, I'm just curious how strongly those colors actually contrast in natural lighting.  
Is it sad that I haven't seen it till now? I'm from Kerala.  
For a second I thought it was a photoshop but it's really such a thing? Cool  
Does anyone know how to reach him direct?   I see his channel is about handheld games. For a period of time abut 8-10 years ago, I went bananas collecting retrogames, including a shit-ton of battery powered handheld games from the 70's and 80's. I cashed out of the vintage NES last year and kinda don't really maintain the handheld collection anymore, would happily send a package his way of some handhelds he might not have.   This isn't even a 'charity' impulse as much as it is I see how much he seems to love them relative to how little I GAF about them anymore, so may as well bring some minor joy to a random person.  
To the person who donated 800 bucks to this man...   You the best...  WHO?  YOU....   *edit* this is now my 2nd most upvoted comment. It was honestly just a way for me to make a DJ Khaled reference. Please stop upvoting it. My #1 post is about tacos. please don't ruin that. 
I know he's fully funded, but I still gave $10. I love being part of a community that comes together to help people who are passionate. It's a beautiful thing. This dude seems pretty genuine and 100% deserving. 
Epic. I just checked the link and he is topping $6,200.00 - I show my girl, and tell her about how this kind of thing happens on reddit every once in a while. The community just goes off the chain for minute and some dudes life gets UTTERLY changed. And here it goes again. Then I refresh his fund me page..... In five minutes, it's up $600.00!!!   I won't lie, I love it when you fuckers make me cry like this. 
I'm just a student with student loans and no money, but have $10. I will buy chicken nuggets from Wal-Mart instead of getting Chick-fil-a for the next two weeks.  Guarantee those are going to taste better being able to help someone. Love this so much in the seemingly mean world we live in. 
I just recently came into a large inheritance. I'm late to this but would like to donate a vehicle.  How can I find out more information?  
Don't think I've ever done GoFundMe but this seemed worth it even after they hit their 'target'.  It's not like his cerebral palsy is going away and I'm sure they'll need it.  Here's $50 man, hope for the best for ya.  Game on! 
Is there a link to donate?  I'm not seeing anything.  
Man that made me happy. My son is disabled and we tried to raise money through gofundme for a service dog. Unfortunately it's hard to get noticed. Felt good to see him so happy. 
This is really sweet.  Today has been an emotional day for me, a family friend passed away from brain cancer, leaving behind her husband and 1 year old son.  She was an incredibly positive person, and spread a lot of joy in spite of her own suffering, and i don't know.  It just makes me feel better knowing that there is goodness in the world, and that people can come together to lift others up.  Thanks for posting this OP. 
20k$ !!!! Averaging 1000$ / 5 Minutes right now! Keep it up reddit!!! 
Just donated $10 to the GoFundMe. It's not a lot, but hope it helps this awesome guy move forward with the tough hand he's been dealt.  
Someone's basic needs should not be funded by fucking charity. Fuck the US for denying his rights to healthcare and dignity. 
Can this be verified?  There was a huge scam years ago on Reddit of a gamer faking being in a wheelchair so people would give him money and video games.  
That horse has to be thinking, why is this girl trying to round House me? 
"If she can't get on, I can't throw her off when I mistake a hose for a snake. Let me help." 
LPT: Be around a horse while you're barefoot, that way you can tell which of your toes got ripped off instead of smashed if you had worn boots. 
This whole situation just really irritates me until the horse bends down.   "Okay, dumbass. Hop on." 
She trained the horse to lay down, the horse didn't do this by itself.  
"Here. Would you please stop kicking my ass and get on already!" 
by the way, she's practicing "fly mounting," which is considerably harder than even just getting into saddled horse. most people have to fail at it for a while before they can do it gracefully, or at all. a good horse is usually fairly patient for this as its strength and size allow them to take a lot of impact before it really hurts or bothers them. 
I can't get my head around someone who enters a horse corral bare foot.  That's disgusting and dangerous.    The one fool who tried to ride our horse bareback got his pelvis crushed.  
This thread is weirdly aggressive... No shit she isn't actually trying to get on, they're filming to show the horse help her get on 
If a person that fit can't get up their there is no way I'll ever do it. That's good information to have. 
Was she doing it on purpose to show this "feature" or not? It looked like she didn't jump at all. 
some crackhead probably robbed a relative's coin collection. crackheads are really good about putting old coins and bills back into circulation. 
I've recently found a small jar of these under a loose floorboard in my closet. I don't even know where to begin to take them to get looked at.  
Historical, I know nothing about antique coin value. It has to be worth something to someone. 
PM me if you want to sell it for 9 bucks, via Pay Pal 
Most nazi currency is nearly worthless for some reason. Not sure why, surely it's rare and part of an incredibly interesting part of humanity's past. 
Numismatist (coin collector) here. What OP has here is a $2 piece of the 3rd Reich. It is roughly 80% pure silver and the production of these was put to a halt around 1939 when the price of silver skyrocketed and it became more expensive to produce these than what they were actually worth. I recently saw one of these sell for $4,500 at auction and it was in much worse condition than this. My advice would be to take this to an appraiser immediately. He will be able to give you much more information besides the hot steamy pile of bull shit you just read.     
I'd probably get it appraised and put in a case, just so it doesn't seem like you have some random Nazi memorabilia just rolling around in your junk drawer. That could bring up some awkward conversations. 
"Buns confusing day" is a children's book I'd read 
My cat likes to dance.  ...well "to be danced with" more precisely.  And by "likes" I mean "has no choice but to when I'm drinking". 
That's a freaking adorable name for a cat. I'm stealing it 
Damn, well done OP.  I've been on the internet since the dark days of AOL dial-up, muddled through the message board era, watched the rise of e-commerce (remember that buzzword?), and the monolithic rise of Google and Facebook.  This is the 1st time I've seen such a picture in 20+years of internet usage.  I've seen a lot of cats, girls, dancers, and pictures of beaches.  But never before such a masterful combination of all 4.  Sincerely, thank you for this. 
"I am a kitty cat, and I dance dance dance. And I dance dance dance." 
Do you have the cat on a leash when you take it to the beach? I ask because if you didn't, I'm wondering how you would get her* to come back to you. It's not like a dog where you can give it commands, right? Or am I totally wrong? 
People are going to fap to this, then feel shame. I guarantee it. 
I can't imagine this convo going "Honey, grab the cat and lets go to the beach!" 
"There, there, it's OK, everything is fine. I'm here for you."   *Goes in for kiss*   "I'm so sorry. That was too soon." 
When I was a kid my cat would always come to comfort me whenever I cried. I miss that cat. 
I'm not a cat guy, but I ended up with a Russian Blue (like this one) and it was incredibly affectionate. I've heard that it's common in the breed. We went through a lot together. He gave me 10 good years and curled up next to me one night and didn't wake up. I'll be mixing his ashes with mine one day. 
My cat did this the morning I was having to put him down (he had terminal cancer and was in his last days). I was holding him that morning, and I was sobbing my eyes out. He reached up, wiped my tears, and licked them off his paw over and over. Then he nuzzled me under my chin. I couldn't stop apologizing to him. I can't even type this without crying more-cats are beautiful, beautiful animals.  
Cat: *"Where was that jugular again? This thing is making a lot of noise."* 
How do animals detect upset-ness? Or is it just anthropomorphism? 
My cat growing up when ever I was getting yelled at by my father. she would show up sit in my lap and stare him down. With this defiance like "try yelling at me bitch!"   
My cats lose there shit when my one year old cries, they lick him run against him and usually meow angrily at me, judgmental bastards   
This reminds me of my own cat, he somehow knew when I was down and would always try to cheer me up. When I was a teenager, I used to sneak out of my house often to hang out with my friends, go to the 24 hr diner, pretty normal shit like that. During warm months my cat would often sleep outside, and he'd see me sneak out, but then usually went back to sleep when I left and came back. One night, I was feeling pretty damn bad (my dad and I got into a huge fight, it was the last straw for me) and I wanted to commit suicide, by walking to a tall bridge near my home and leaping off. My cat followed me and meowed all the way to the bridge, as if to stay "stop!! don't do it!!" I sat on the ground near the beginning of the bridge and my cat crawled up to me and did something similar to this cat in the gif. My cat saved my life. Man, I really love cats, they're the best companion IMO 
Pets are amazing. They are loyal and caring in a way most of us aren't. When I see moments like these, I am so happy we have pets. 
My cat does something similar whenever I'm sick. Cats are sweet, if they're not then maybe you're doing something to make it hate you. Cats aren't like dogs, you could beat a dog every day and it would still love you unconditionally, a cat won't. Cats have to be treated well to like you. 
This just goes to show that cats can be just as nice as (if not better than) most dogs.  I can't stand the anti-feline bigotry coming from these so-called "Dog People" on reddit. 
One time I was having a panic attack in the middle of the living floor. This was about 13 years ago and I can't remember exactly what got to me so bad as to go down in full tantrum style screaming and crying, wishing for death. Our little tabby comes in from the bedroom and sees me face down on the rug, crying my eyes out. We were the only two in the house and she came up to me and began brushing her face on the side of my head. The purring calmed me, but the act of love that I recieved from a pet instead of a human made me cry more. Only this time I wasn't hysterical just softly weeping.  I remember now: I was 18 and living alone, far away from my parents in a different city where I knew NO ONE and I just felt stupidly alone. Stupid, because I left my family to "find myself". All I found was drugs and date rape. It was a hard time, Skittles (my kitty) was my only ray of light. I moved back home soon after.
