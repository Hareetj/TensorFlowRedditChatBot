For anyone who is in Florida and was considering donating blood or plasma, come back on Tuesday to your local blood drives since they have already reached the need volume for today. So come back on Tuesday when the next round is needed. 
I think the team at Orlando Regional Medical Center deserve some recognition here. My hat goes off to anyone working there during the time this tragic event was occurring, especially the nurses and surgeons. It takes a lot of gut to be able to keep cool and perform your duties on people so frightened, while under the stress of knowing that people have already died as a result of the event.  Stay strong everyone. 
As someone who witnessed the 26/11 shootings in India, I know what shooting at a crowd in a cramped space feels like. This is the saddest thing I've read today, I stand with with you from Mumbai, lots of love. 
Still unable to locate my friend. I've called the hotline set up and had a friend drive to the hamptons inn where family center is set up and they are still not releasing any information at this time. I've called Orlando regional and other hospitals and I get nothing.  
So I imagine that Obama will give a televised speech about this shooting some time today? It would make sense since this shooting is now (unfortunately) historic in its death toll.  
Should we random acts of pizza the blood donation centers? 
The shooting at PULSE is devastating. Two of my friend's family members were there and thankfully got out (one of them was shot, but will be ok). If you are in the Orlando area, PLEASE consider donating blood. They are in desperate need of O positive, O negative, and AB plasma blood donors. 
My brother was club hopping and was on his way there but stopped to get some food with friends, he was five minutes away before it happened but decided to go home instead. It's so fucking crazy how close some things are to being completely different, i'm so grateful. 
My best friend lives right around the corner from Pulse and spent the night hiding in her closet because she was hearing gunfire but didn't know where it was coming from or what was going on. I can't even imagine how terrifying it must have been for everyone there.  
Terrifying and devastating.  If you're a member of the LBGT community in Central Florida, from Ocala to Tampa to Titusville, you've been to Pulse at least once.   To us this didn't just happen in our backyard, it happened in our living room. 
I wonder what the police tactics were on this one? I hear the gunman took hostages and started executing. I'll be so pissed if it's a repeat of Columbine where the police waited outside for hours while those kids were getting executed.  
I live 500 meters from the concert hall called "bataclan" in Paris. So I kind of been there. Lost friends, got friends badly hurt.   I have nothing smart to say. This is absolute horror.   I stand with you from Paris as you guys were with us when we got hurt.   Fuck those murderers. Love will prevail.   Damn this is so sad. Sorry for not making sense.  
Did [edited to remove name], that dumb fucking son of a bitch, not understand that this is going to make people at large *more* sympathetic to homosexuals and *less* sympathetic to Muslims?   It's not even the horrific, utterly senseless loss of life, it's that even from his perspective, his actions will have the complete opposite effect of what he set out to do in the longer run. He wasn't just an evil fucking idiot, he was an *incompetent* evil fucking idiot.   My sympathies go out to everyone affected by such a horrible tragedy. Love yourself and each other. 
**LETS STOP TALKING ABOUT r/news, AND START TALKING ABOUT INFORMATION AND THE 50 PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES THIS MORNING.** 
It breaks my heart that pride month will always have this bleak reminder of how much more we have to fight for. This was a vile homophobic act by a maniac. My heart goes out to the families and friends of those who were murdered, and everyone involved. I hope they find peace amongst the pain.  
Obama sounded tired, defeated and almost numb to this type of situation.  
This is incredibly sad.  This is the deadliest US mass shooting since Virginia Tech. 
I live about 45 minutes from Orlando and have sooooo many friends who frequent this nightclub.  I am praying right now. Not sure if any of them were there during this, but such a horrible moment...

Honestly, the same way as a normal person.  I hear the voices of guys and it just sounds attractive to me.  Even though i can't "see" them physically mentally i can picture how they look.  I wasn't blind until i was age 14, but i realized i was gay when i was 18.  ( my boyfriend is blind, i just typed this out for him :] ) 
Watch the film "The Way He Looks", beautiful story about a blind gay teen and his love for a classmate. 
You ever just smell a food from afar and think to yourself "that must be delicious"?  It's like that.   Except it's dicks. 
Wonder how many blind people use reddit..... Wonder how many gay blind people use reddit... 
People are attracted to voices, personality, pheromones and physical touch. What kind of bodies do you want to feel? Etc. Sexuality is not strictly visual. But I'm a woman so maybe the male experience is much different 
I am typing this for my gay blind friend.   He said and I quote **"My cock is so fun to play with, I assume different ones would be too!"** 
I've never wanted to know the answer to something so badly.  
I'd imagine it's the same way blind straight people know they are straight, or how straight blind people know they are blind. 
Great question. I'm not blind but I am gay. Being gay,  I've watched a lot of lgbt films,  one of my favourite being a Brazilian film called The Way He Looks.   In this film a blind boy ends up falling for his male friend. There's a scene where he puts on a jumper left behind by his friend and starts smelling it.  There are other small things like where they go to the cinema and his friends narrates the film to him that shows they have a close friendship and he asks a female friend to describe how his male friend looks.   So from this film,  which I highly recommend,  It comes down to the usual personality stuff and also I guess smell and pheromones.  
This may be one of the best questions I have ever seen on here OP. Now everyone be weary of the next question that will come from this one. " Deaf gay people of reddit, how did you know you were a man bear pig?" or something like that. 
Interesting how overwhelmingly responders are focussed only on male homosexuals and not females. Just saying.   
Key question: how is the rice going to be prepared? Steamed? Fried? Any seasonings added to it? 
Beer. Even when that beer is Coconut Curry Hefeweizen and it seems like it would taste good over rice. It definitely does not.   ...not that I would know or anything.  
Can you imagine the people working in the grocery store are thinking with some kid coming in every 15 or so minutes buying more rice and various other items?  *There he is again, what the hell?* 
This is so strange. What made you decide to do this? I really love Reddit at times like these. 
Hot dogs and hamburgers (I have a theory that this is actually delicious but never tried it) 
Damn OP, if you really are eating all this shit you have a lot of cardio to do tomorrow.  
OP: you should take a picture of your "experiments"! 
I do feel like rice goes with nearly everything... umm, maybe strawberry jam?  OP, be careful that you don't get sick! 
Holy shit, this entire thread is amazing.  10/10, OP. You get gold. 
Ice cream, only because as a kid I was often lectured on not being able to have two good things together as in "You wouldn't eat ice cream with rice. That's why you can't have X with Y" 
I'm so sad I missed this ):  This is the shit I love seeing on Reddit. More meta community stuff! 
My neighbor who is 94 called me last week and said she is terminal and has about 4-8 weeks to live. Super nice lady I have always enjoyed talking to. She asked me to mow her front yard until she dies. I'm happy to help as long as it's one less thing she has to worry about.  
I have stage 4 brain cancer. I have confidence I will beat it though. I had it 19 years ago when it was self contained, so I have a good idea what to expect. This time it is inoperable, because it is skull based, but chemo begins next week. If I don't make it, I am content with that. I found out who I was and what I wanted out of this life 19 years ago, and no, unless your work is really important, it will never define you. I can say that I truly lived and can die at any time without regrets and full of inner peace and happiness.  I can't tell you how important it is for all of us to take a step back, look at the big picture and find out what is really important to us. After that, life becomes very clear and the way to live it becomes even clearer. 
I work at a company that sells snacks. If anyone would like some, just PM me and I can put together something for you.   I know its hardly anyones "BUCKET LIST" but hey, maybe someone out there just wants a cookie before they go.  
I have a very rare autoimmune disease called dermatomyositis. It's very similar to Lupus. I'm not terminally ill, but I'll probably have a shorter life than most. I'm not asking for anything but if anyone who has or knowns someone with a similar disease and wants to talk please PM me. :)  
 He doesn't need anything but I wanted to tell you all my dad has liver cancer  and it has metastisized. He still feels good but at his last  Dr appointment they wanted to get him started on paliative care so it's not looking good at all.    He wants to go fishing with his only grandson... but I only had him 3 weeks ago so he's not going to be up for fishing this year.  
Cirrhosis, 28, Apparently have had two versions of Hep C for a very long time, Day to day and I've accepted and don't let it bother me. 
Reading all the comments here, wouldn't it be a great if we have a Make-A-Wish Reddit edition for people who are suffering and/or terminally ill? 
At one point during my cancer treatment a few years back I was given 2 weeks to live. My bucket list just consisted of seeing loved ones and telling them I loved them.      Then the drugs started working, and I beat the fucker. So I could go back to ignoring their texts. 
I have inoperable grade IV  lymphoma and i have been relatively lucky with everything so far. The one thing i would change would have been for my wife to want to stay for the end, that would have been good. It's really hard to explain your situation to someone that doesn't have cancer. I am 32. 
What I want more than anything in the world is to get better and live happily ever after with my husband, my kitten, and hopefully children someday. There is a chance I may get better if I find the right specialist and treatment. However, each day of pain I feel the life sucked out of me.  I'm hoping to go cage diving with great whites. In October is my 10th anniversary so I'm hoping husband is up for that. I love sharks. I need to go to a few Red Sox baseball games too.  
I could die tomorrow, any one of us could. So how can we help each other today? 
Just putting this out there... I am a professional tattoo artist in Scotland. My clients quite often tell me of their "bucket list", and getting the tattoo is definitely on it.   If anyone is from Scotland here, and in such a situation, I'd be more than happy to help you out with it. Just drop me a pm or something.    
Not me, my best friend. He's 54. His wife turned 50 over the weekend. We've known each other 35 years. He's got stage four mesothelioma. Six weeks ago he was given 4-12 weeks to live. He's a rationalist, not a believer, and wouldn't welcome your prayers. He wouldn't welcome your pity either. I don't think you can help him. He doesn't have a bucket list because he's been there, done that, and has a t-shirt collection. What I think he might be happy about (I'm not going to ask him) would be if you were to just love a bit more, hate a bit less, and maybe go to your nearest animal shelter and adopt a new friend. 
Made an account just to share this.   I have been diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer and have been given 6 months to live. My doctor is pushing chemotherapy but I really don't want to die that way.   I haven't told my family yet. My wife wouldn't understand and my father is getting married in a month. I'm going to wait to tell them until I feel the time is right.   In the meantime, I have no one to talk to about this. If someone has the time, I'd love someone that I can talk to about this. Getting the stuff off my chest would be absolutely fantastic.  
I'd also love to help but am jaded by scam artists. All I imagine are people conjuring up well crafted fake stories to get free stuff. 
Actually, I'm going to go ahead and chime in here, if there's really someone who reads this, please PM me, and I will do whatever is within my power to get you what you need.  I'm in a rough spot and feel the need to give back.  :)  So this thread will be my outlet.  
Also, is it too late to make this a [serious] post? 
Is it good that there's no terminally ill people posting here? 
My cat has a little under a month to live, and although I don't know exactly what she wants, I've been giving her non stop attention, any food she wants, and a Christmas tree to sit under since that was her favorite. 
I honestly can't believe it, how is it possible that virtually every model was so wrong? 2016 has been quite a year 
I feel like I'm living in a future GCSE history exam question.   'In 2016, the UK voted to leave the EU,and Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. Discuss.' 
I like to believe that the silver lining in this is that both parties will see how broken they are and make some changes, leading to future candidates that are actually likeable, trustworthy, and honest people. A girl can dream, right? 
My favorite part about watching this victory speech is watching Trump JR try to stay awake 
Man, I'm still pretty shocked.  2016 will be a memorable year. 
Man, 2016 has been a weird year. I don't think anyone would have guessed that Donald Trump of all people would be the US president. 
"Donald Trump Beats Woman to Take Black Man's Job." 
Can you imagine if someone had been in a coma for like 6 months and woke up to find out that the Cubs have won the World Series and Donald Trump is the new President-Elect of the United States? 
Fingers crossed Trump is just the biggest troll in America and ends up becoming the greatest president we've ever had. *please*  
I don't ever want to be told I need experience for a job ever again.  
Must be the one of the most embarrassing defeats in political history for Clinton. 
YouTube comments represent this country more accurately than I thought. 
I have only seen one or two Trump supporters on my facebook feed until today. Now just about every post is thanking God Trump won. It is shocking how many supporters were in hiding. 
2016 does seem to be the year, right or wrong, that people said 'no' to the establishment.   An uncertain and risky future maybe. Well, Americans wanted to know what Brexit felt like. 
As a Canadian in Mexico right now, I'm frightened. I have to get back over 2 walls. 
Breaking news : jokes about Trump being president not funny anymore 
HOLY SHIT.   DOES THIS MEAN THE 2020 ELECTION....WILL BE   **Donald Trump VS Kanye West**?!  What....the actual fuck.....  Battle of the memes. 
Celebrities, Reddit and other social media were so vocal about their support for Hillary that I actually thought she was going to win.  Looks like conservatives are just quiet.  We got M. Night Shamalangadingdonged. 
People are talking about Trump and I'm just here worried about Vice President MIKE PENCE. He's the real threat in my opinion.. 
Trump won as the anti-establishment candidate. If only the Dems could have nominated an anti-establishment candidate... Oh wait. 
BARRY, YOU HAVE TO SAVE THE TIMELINE. GO BACK. PLEASE, BARRY.  
Random tip: go out and buy some newspapers today. Your grandchildren will be able to sell these headlines for a nice amount of money if you preserve them well. 
I like how all of a sudden, /r/conspiracy acts like they never said the system was rigged. Fucking lol. 
I'm very left leaning, pretty concerned, not happy.   But I'm trying to accept it. I realize this is how conservatives felt the last two elections, and yet life went on. I have actually learned from them, not to unnecessarily plunge myself into doom and gloom, into apocalyptic sentiments. I'm going to hope that he will be a lot more normal, and stable than we thought. His speech tonight had a very normal tone, which is encouraging.   I don't know, it's kind of like hearing that you have a serious disease, but you have a chance at surviving it. I want to accept this with class and grace, and courage. Congratulations to our disenchanted, right leaning population. I'm rooting for America to succeed, and trying to have an open mind.  
First 9/11 and now 11/9.. These numbers aren't good for America.  
I have a very low opinion of the man and very little belief that this his winning will be good for the country but I'd love to be surprised. 
"Brexit totally can't happen!"  *One election later..*  **Brexit happens.**   "No way will the people of USA elect Trump as POTUS!"  *One election later..*  **Trump is POTUS.**  I think it's our collective moral responsibility to now use the power of 2016 to get GRRM release his next book.  Let's all think: "GRRM totally will not finish his books before the end of the year!"  And by law of 2016, we'll get The Winds of Winter by the year's end.  Then let's do it for another season of Firefly.

Oh goody, another one of these threads about... about...  Uh...  ...      Error 404      Knowledge Not Found     Logic Unit unable to compute     Please reboot and try again 
Guys, when girls aren't around, how often do you *really* talk about new methods to distinguish E2 and E1cb(rev/irrev) mechanisms? 
I just want to know what every girl wants to know; is Pascal single?? 
I think this is a sex joke.    Pascal's law or the principle of transmission of fluid-pressure (also Pascal's Principle) is a principle in fluid mechanics that states that a pressure change occurring anywhere in a confined incompressible fluid is transmitted throughout the fluid such that the same change occurs everywhere. -google  I think he's asking if you can feel the change of pressure inside your vagina when penetrated. 
can someone elaborate. i feel like im missing out on some comedy gold here.  
Not really sure how to answer that...but my bladder is telling me I have to pee....  However my legs are telling me that I am not going to be moving.  
Don't know that anyone will see this, but my name actually is Pascal (I'm American, not French)   This whole thread is hilarious to read. You can address all your questions on Pascals to me.  
My fluid dynamics professor used to ask questions like this followed by "...and explain it in terms your girlfriend would understand."  I was one of 3 women in the class and was slightly annoyed by his misogynistic attitude.    One day he asked the guy next to me to explain a concept.  The student was stumbling over the answer, so I grabbed his hand, held it up to his face and said, "No, Frank.  Explain it to your girlfriend."  The professor never used that phrase again.   
Well, when the guys aren't around I no longer have to go along with their assumption that STEM fields are superior, which means I can go to Pascal's wager. As a skeptic (who still adheres to a personal sort of nature based spirituality) the idea of believing in the Christian God for fear of the consequences of being wrong just strikes me as disingenuous. If God exists and doesn't want to spare someone who spends their life trying to make the world a better place but happens to be the wrong religion, then I don't want to spend eternity with such a God.  Moreover, the time I would spend believing in that specific manifestation of God could be better spent trying to better this world. In spite of Pascal's statement that you lose.nothing for believing, I see it as losing valuable time in church each week when I could be volunteering for a good cause instead.  ETA: I derped. Did not realize it was the same Pascal. Next thing you'll be telling me he was also a lizard ;) 
The most depressing shit I saw was a tired looking couple who brought in their bespectacled, NASA shirt wearing, 8 year old geek of a son in to have some fun. The parents couldn't have been more discouraging to him. He was excitedly bouncing around the room pointing out things that he thought were clues clues while the parents dismissed every idea he had and told him to stop getting so excited. The parents took charge and proceeded to ignore the obvious clues he was pointing out and spent most of the time pursuing dead ends. Sad part is his instincts were more often than not correct but his parents just didn't listen and refused to let him explore and try stuff out.  Hopefully his curiosity and enthusiasm survives them.  
Just started working at escape the room and we have rules about not jumping out the windows and not sticking keys into wall sockets because it has all happened before. 
I own an escape room and I once guided couple into one of our more moody ambiance room and they told me "we would totally base a sex dungeon off this vibe. See, you even have a desk in here to get started!"  Also you see people's true parenting skills. My favorite quote is from a lovely family that went into a room and 5 minutes in the father gathered his overeager children and told them "you're being assholes".  We're in a huge tech area and we get a lot of corporate groups with some very important people. A week ago we had a Fortune 500 CEO through and he walked up to my staff and started bragging about his 50,000 Instagram followers, basically trying to impress college kids. We definitely giggled about that one especially when we looked him up and he had like 300 followers. But hey, he killed it in the room!   
We give people a box for them to bring in, so they can store their belongings while they play. One time, about halfway in, an inquisitive older man started going through their own stuff. He pulled out a purse and shouts guys "guys, I found some... this is our stuff isn't it" It was hilarious.  
Did a space stationed themed room. We got paired with a mother and her adult sons. The sons did just fine but mom was clueless. There was a prop fire extinguisher on the wall that she was CERTAIN had to be for something. For an hour she wandered around aimlessly carrying a fire extinguisher.  
I worked at a room escape place for a year in grad school. I learned very quickly to give thorough warnings at the start of each show that breaking things, assaulting actors (this was trapped in a room with a zombie), and sexual harassment were not cool.  (Yes, literally had guys hit on THE FUCKING ZOMBIE mid show).   Perhaps the most interesting phenomenon I noticed was just how much personality factors into the teamwork involved. I've seen a lot of shy people or people otherwise lacking in confidence be completely on the right track, only to be steamrolled by the loudest, more confident, strongest personalities in the room. Maybe it shouldn't have come as so much of a surprise, but I watched perfectly smart, reasonable people actively ignore good points, logic, and strong evidence in service of a cult of personality of charismatic players. The whole thing felt like a depressing study on group dynamics.  
Went to an Escape the Room with some friends on Friday. My one friend took his shirt off 4 times. The crazier thing that happened though was how we solved it. We were supposed to get the word Waterloo from a series of clues and use a dictionary to find that the battle of Waterloo was in 1815. Use that 4 digit number to get a key that let us out of the room. Well we got the word 'eaterloi' instead of Waterloo. We assumed that it was an anagram and we used a word scrambler to get the word aerolite from it. Using the dictionary we found that aerolite was invented in 1815. Well we got the key and we confidently told the employee how we figured it out. He was dumbfounded. I'm not exactly sure what the odds of solving the room like this is, but if someone could solve that for us that'd be dank. My friends and I have been trying to figure it out since it happened. 
The guy gave some rules to us when we were doing the room. The first rule he gave us was "Please keep your clothes on." 
Started working in an escape room around 3 months ago. This is not really a weird thing, but more a cute one. One day a dude called and told us he was proposing to his girlfriend and that they were both huge fans of escaperooms. So my boss and came up with a cool idea how we could change our escaperoom to make it more romantic and that at the end of the escape they wouldn't find the key of the room but the ring and a bottle of champagne. We also told the dude the solutions of some of the puzzles to make sure they would actually come to the end of the room.   It was the cutest thing I have ever seen. The way these two worked together in the room and how excited the dude was. When they found the ring and the champagne at the end  and he asked to marry her, they were both in tears (So were my boss and I). She said yes! After that they stayed with  us for a bit before heading their own way. It is still one of my favorite evenings and one of the reasons I love my newfound job so much.  
Obligatory not an employee, but I'm sure my friend group looked pretty weird to them. We did the one where you get stuck in handcuffs and have to unlock them, but we couldn't get the key to work on one of my friends. We assumed that there was another key to get the last person, for some reason, and left her attached to the wall for like twenty minutes.   Turns out her cuffs were broken and we had to pause the game so the employees could come get her out with bolt cutters.   They were shocked that we'd just left her there but we thought it was part of it! 
One time I did an escape room with some people from work. The final clue was "what time does Bible Study meet?" and a 4 digit combo lock. After we couldn't find any useful clues I just went over to the lock and put in 0600, 0615, etc. It opened at 0700. Apparently we were supposed to look out the window to where the church across the street had their schedule printed on a big sign. According to the attendant nobody had ever tried that before. 
Actual escape room employee here.  One couple couldn't agree on how to solve the puzzles and broke up inside the room.   Another couple had the guy surprise the girl with a proposal.   Another couple got a horror- themed escape room and just sat on the floor and cuddled. They didn't look scared. They didn't bother to solve anything either. They just cuddled with all the creepy props and sound effects surrounding them. I guess they couldn't find a creepy motel to cuddle in...? 
I'm not an escape room employee, but I asked this exact same question when I went to an escape room a few months ago. The guy working there said a man pulled out a pocket knife and started cutting the carpet out, convinced that there were clues under there 
Not an employee, but partcipated in an escape room in which a key was stuck to a filing cabinet by one of those weird little metal puzzles. The key was to open a drawer in a desk on the opposite side of the room.  No one could get the metal puzzle undone, so the guys just picked up the filing cabinet and carried it over to the desk. It was a mob themed room so we received a phone call warning about rearranging the furniture that was hilariously in character.   We escaped the room :)  
I had a group pull out a tool kit. They unscrewed every furniture to find some combinations. They didn't escape and I made them fix everyrhing, took them about an hour. 
We did an escape room one time where there were these jars with severed limbs in them. When we got out we commented to the guy running it that we found it interesting that the jars were cement glued shut, cement glued to the shelf, and the shelf screwed to the wall. Seemed like over kill to us. Well apparently the reason they do this was because another group had managed to pried the jars away from the shelf and open the jars. This is about when they realized, watching the cameras, that something was going on. So they rush in to see what's up and he hears. "Guys! We have to drink the water!!". The nasty part was the water was out of the local river a few blocks away, just to get that dirty murky look. 
A guy didn't help any of his friends he just sat and ate 2 pints of ice cream which he had snuck past me. 
Some dude was eating this chick's ass when we checked on them 
I went for a job interview at an escape room. My group didn't escape the room, so we didn't go through to the next round. I think they were using the process to get people to test new puzzles for free. 
I work at a different escape game and have had customers drop kick doors,vomit all over the place but the one that takes the cake is a couple booked our latest game around midnight. After I did my intro and left the room he proceeded to bend her over a prop and take her from behind. I called in several times to no avail. So for the next hour I had to listen to them grunt an moan.  
We had a group come in last year who were doing really well, got about halfway through the game and then hit a wall. One guy left the room to go out to his car, and when he came back he had a whole 30 rack in his bag. The whole team proceeded to sit in a circle and use their remaining 30minutes to kill the entire thing. It was pretty damn impressive to watch.  
The "zombie" in our room cornered me while he was on all fours. Then he started rubbing the top of his head on my crotch and grunting and breathing really heavily. He did this for a good 10-15 seconds while I just stood there, frozen. At that point I said "well I guess if you can do that I'm out right?" And awkwardly shuffled past him (from the corner where he had me pinned) to the dead corner.  It was a real hit for my co-workers to see that. 
Not an Employee, but one time my group of friends walked into Breakout KC, and my friend proceeded to turn off the main circuit breaker. All the doors and some of the traps were locked electronically. So basically we beat the escape room in a record 9 seconds. 
I've seen a divorce, a man came out as gay to his friends in the room. Various misuses of the props as in somebody not knowing how to you use a microscope or a MAGNET. I got mooned once. I think the msot wild stuff though, happens in the back room. The people rumning your room probably have 10x more fun than you do. Some weird shit happens there  
The easiest way to make our life miserable is the propose at one of these. It happened 3 time in the 9 months I worked there. It makes it so we have to get you to finish, and some people.... aren't smart enough 
Jesus I had this question at the end of a job interview. Here's the joke I told (I got the job):  Two engineering students were walking across campus when one said, "Where did you get such a great bike?"  The second engineer replied, "Well, I was walking along yesterday minding my own business when a beautiful woman rode up on this bike. She threw the bike to the ground, took off all her clothes and said, "Take what you want."  The first engineer nodded approvingly, "Good choice; the clothes probably wouldn't have fit." 
A farmer and his dog are herding sheep. They finish and his dog says "I counted 40 sheep". The farmer replies, "That's odd I only got 37". The dog replies "I rounded them up".

The other day, my wife asked me to pass her lipstick but I accidentally passed her a glue stick.  She still isn't talking to me. 
So there's two blue whales drinking at a bar. The first turns to the second and says   (Now you make whale song noises as awkwardly and as cringe-inducingly as possible, until everyone in the room is clearly a little bit uncomfortable with how long this has gone on)  To which the second whale turns to the first, and says: "Frank, go home, you're drunk."

Mother Superior is in the convent, when she hears a knock at the door. She opens the door, and is shocked to see two leprechauns standing at the threshold, hats in hand.   The first leprechaun speaks: "Mother Superior, would you be having any leprechaun nuns in this convent?"  "No, my son. We have no leprechaun nuns in this convent."  "And mother, do you have any leprechaun nuns in all of Ireland?"  "No my son, I don't believe there's a single leprechaun nun in the whole church!"  The first leprechaun rounds on his companion and shouts "AH TOL' YE YOU'D BEEN FOOKIN' A PENGUIN". 
A guy goes to the doctor about a rash he's had for a while. The doctor finally enters the room and takes a look at the guy and says "Well sir, I'm going to have to advise you to stop masturbating."   "Why's that doc?" the guy asked.   And the doctor said, "So I can examine you." 
Mickey and Minnie Mouse went in to see a marriage counsellor. The therapist first met with each of them one-on-one, then brought them together for a joint session.  "Let me start by restating in a neutral, non-threatening way, the concerns each of you raised in your individual sessions.  Mickey, Minnie says you are quick to anger, and suspicious of her friendships with other males. Minnie, Mickey is concerned about your mental health. He thinks you're crazy."  At this Mickey jumped in. "I never said she was crazy! I said she was fucking Goofy!" 
Two dogs got lost in the desert. The one dog says to the other "If we don't find a palm tree soon, I'm going to pee my pants."  When I was four, I heard this joke on the radio. I thought it was the funniest joke ever. Except, I didn't get it, I just thought that the notion that a dog might pee himself was hilarious. I told this joke to people for years.  Years later, I was working in a shop and a radio reporter walked in and challenged my colleague to tell him a joke and then he'd give her fifty bucks. She palmed him off to me and I got to release my joke back into the wild. Easiest fifty bucks I ever earned.

A devout Catholic man has just boarded a plane, and he's really dreading the long flight ahead. All of a sudden, the pope boards and takes a seat right next to him! What an honor!  The man sits there, thinking about how best to conduct himself and what to say, when the pope takes out a golf pencil and starts doing a crossword puzzle. *Wow, His Holiness does crossword puzzles?* the man thinks. *I hope he asks me for help. That'll be my in for a wonderful conversation!*  Sure enough, the pope leans over and asks the man "do you know a four-letter word for a woman that ends in U-N-T?"  *Oh no.* The man is speechless. He sits there, terrified but trying his best to put on a pensive face, for about 30 seconds. *The pope won't speak to me this whole flight if I say what first came to mind...*  Then it hits him! "Oh!" he says. "AUNT. The word you're looking for is 'aunt', Your Holiness."  The pope calmly nods. "Ah, of course," he says. "Do you have an eraser?"

 A young monk arrives in a monastery where he is put to work as a copyist.   After a few days, he notices that the monks making copies of the scriptures are all working from copies -- not the original. This alarms the young monk because he thinks of how easy it would be for mistakes to be repeated. And so he goes to the Head Monk and expresses his concerns.   "Yes, brother," replies the Head Monk, "you have a valid point. But this is the way we've always done it. Still, I better check to make sure there are no errors."   So off he goes to the cellar where he spends the entire night carefully consulting the original scriptures. In the morning all of the brothers go down to the cellar and find the Head Monk crying.   "What's the matter?" they ask.   Between the loudest of sobs, he groans: "The word is celebrate!"

A sailor sits down at the bar and orders a drink. He looks to his left and there's a pirate with a peg leg, hook hand, and eye patch. The sailor asks how the leg was lost. "A gator ripped off me leg while burying gold in Florida." He asks next how he lost his hand. "A shark bit ma hand off while I was throwing the gator into the sea." Amazed at the pirate's bravery, he asked how the man lost his eye. "A seagull shit in me eye." The sailor was shocked and asked, "a bird shit in your eye and you lost it??" The pirate said, "it was my first day with the hook."

Interviewing a guy for a job. Something doesn't feel right but my interviewing partner really seemed to like him. We get to his portfolio of work and I see my side project that I worked on alone as one of his websites. So I start asking him questions about it. What challenges he had, how the client was, etc.   I let him go on and on then I say, "I have to level with you. This is my work. You are showing me my own work. Look at the source near the footer. It has my website in the comments.   He went ghost white and I just sat there.   After that I coached him a little on how not to suck and he left. We called the contract agency that sent him and let them know.  
My snake did.    I had the sweetest, chillest ball python who never nipped or hissed or reared up or anything.  She'd just curl up with you and hang out.  One day a friend brought over some of his friends and all of a sudden my snake went nuts - standing straight up in her tank and hissing at one of the guys.  A couple of weeks later, that dude robbed my house while I was out of town.  RIP Guinevere.  A good snake. 
My childhood best friend's mother's boyfriend. He creeped me out and I hated being over her house when he was there. Her family went on a ski trip with mine, and my parents both thought he was great-funny, charming etc. They didn't understand why I didn't like him.   Years later, my best friend told me that he sexually abused her starting when she was about 9.  I probably was picking up on her fear of him.  
My mom brought her new boyfriend over the house one time for me to meet him. He weirded me out. I can't tell you why but I didn't like him. Maybe it's because he was a 35 year old man who wore visors. Friendly and funny guy who my family liked. A year into their relationship he beat the hell out of my mom and stole her dog. Probably the closest I've come to an assassination attempt.   Edit 1: I didn't go after him as not to implicate my mom. Also, we got her dog back :)   Edit 2: Yep, he's in jail. 
While in the Army we moved into a new house in upstate New York. We were being neighborly and talked to a guy across the street. He had 5 kids. No wife. He also had multiple neighborhood kids playing in the yard. He told us We can always send ours over. He gave us both this horrible feeling so we smiled and gtfo. About a year later my wife told me (i was in Kandahar) that his kids were taken from him. He had been molesting them at least ever since his wife died.  
Exwifes second husband. Took 10 years but i was right. He is currently on year 1 of a 32 year sentence for repeated rape of his daughter.   
Yes, but I suppressed it so quickly and fast, because I felt like it was horribly ungracious since she was being so friendly.  Over the next couple years, she became my closest friend in the new town I had moved to.  Then the following couple years it vacillated between being close, but just feeling like she really didn't want me around or was messing with me a little bit.  Turns out she was having an affair with my husband and was literally intentionally driving me crazy. 
When I played highschool football we had an equipment manager who had been doing the job for decades and was absolutely adored by the community. Guy was in his 70s-80s.   One day, I'm ready for a game early, so I head out to the bus that's taking us. I see him loading stuff up, so I offer to help him load a few things.  Once we're all loaded on the bus, he walks to me in the back (cuz I was a cool kid) and hands me a Hostess cupcake in front of everyone as a thank you.   He handed me the cupcake, looked me in the eye, and this sense of dread just falls on me. I have no idea why, and everyone's looking at me so I act normal.   I eat the cupcake (because I was, and still am a fat ass and will eat any cupcake you hand me) and just kinda write off the feeling.   That summer he was arrested for sexually assaulting some 15 year old girl. I'm pretty sure they thought he did more, but couldn't prove it or something. 
My former handball coach: Everybody liked him, but I had a weird feel about him; After training he would come into our showers and give out shower caps for us to use, or in the winter, he would bring us snow to play. A few years later, he got arrested for sexual assault, when he went to a training camp with younger girls. Apparently he got into their tents and "played" with them. 
My mom was a single mom and did the best she could.  However, she thought it might be better to leave me with the neighbor than at home alone.  From the age of 6, I pleaded with my mom to let me stay home alone until she got home from work,  that I would be ok.  My intuition was right. The neighbor was convicted of multiple murders of single mom one and two towns over when DNA evidence came into being.  He only liked to date and kill nonobese women.  Fortunately my mother was fat. 
Apparently, when I was 4 or 5, my grandma introduced me to some new boyfriend. Everyone liked him, but I would have nothing to do with him. Wrinkled my nose, wouldn't be left alone by him.     I guess he just came into her apartment one day and walked at her with something behind his back, said nothing. She got an eerie feeling and said, "Are you going to kill me?" With a dead faced stare he came at her. She managed to jump over some furniture and get away (she's always been in great shape, running 3 miles a day until age 80). She got somewhere safe, called the police and never saw him again.. 
My sister's boyfriend. I just immediately found him to be very "fake" and disingenious. But the rest of the family loved him and be found him very charming. He owned a running store franchise that was more successful than the original store and was also doing well trading on the stock market. He sold the store back to the owners for a ton on money to focus on the stock market, but this was around the time of the market crash. So to help with that he worked at the store as a salesman. They eventually got married and bought a huge house.  And that's when the cops came knocking at the door to their large home with a view. He wasn't rich. He never owned the store. He was only ever a worker and had been stealing cash from the register/products and selling them on eBay. The divorce came quick after that. 
Not me, but my sister. She has this uncanny ability to detect crazy people. My first boyfriend who was secretly abusive, she called it after knowing him for two days. My next boyfriends mom who eventually forced me to take a pregnancy test because I had been "looking rather pregnant" and she wanted to know, she knew after the first visit meeting her. My toxic ex best friend of *seven years*, she knew after 1 year. All of the people my sister calls out for being crazy, I now believe and avoid wholeheartedly. 
When I was a teenager at a new high school, another new girl my age aggressively befriended me. I was a quieter kid and allowed her to bully me into a quick friendship and I went along with it for a few weeks TRYING to be her friend but she was fucking CRAZY. She tried to strangle my kitten at one point. She began to say and do creepy things. She was featured in magazines and Reader's Digest. Then she pours her heart out and admitted to me she perpetrated an elaborate fraud on the public and her family. I never ASKED for a confession, she just blurted it out.  She was Tina Resch Boyer the 'paranormal teen' who actually made it all up, and later went on to brutally torture and murder her 3 year old daughter. She is still in prison, tho there is a faction of dummies who bought her lies and try to get her out of prison every few years.  I have discussed my story with James Randi who confirmed several details with me. You can Wikipedia most of this. 
A pastor who was involved in the community outreach program for a prison (which i volunteered to for the first time).. seemed very friendly on the outside but seems really creepy to me... he kept putting his hands on my shoulder on that day and got my number from one of the volunteers and called me non stop that night to say he is lonely and wants to talk.. i was 14 at the time..  
When I was a senior in high school, my multimedia teacher was loved by everybody, but I hated that guy. He was a complete asshole to me and I back to him.  He was super chill with the guys and an "incorrigible flirt" with the girls. Um, we're 98% under 18. But everybody laughed when I'd say something about how weird he was around the chicks and was even told it was because I was overweight, unattractive, and too sarcastic/mouthy, and that's why he picked on me. Oh well. Life went on. A few years after high school I heard he was fired for having sex with an underage student. His poor wife at the time worked in the attendance office too and had to take time away from work so the gossip would simmer down.   I knew that guy was a shitdick. 
My first girlfriends husband. She and I had a bad breakup, but eventually got to be friends again, hanging out with the same crowd all the time. She met a guy who lived out of state and fell in love with him. I disliked him immediately. Everybody else thought he was fine. They got married, and a couple of years later, he started beating the crap out of her. She wised up and left. 
One of my brothers was dating this girl, and everyone else had met her several times before I did since I was off at college. So the first impression I get of her is when she shows up at our house and just walks right in. Doesn't knock, doesn't let anyone know she's in there. Just walks her happy ass inside and sits on the couch. So then when I come down the hallway into the living room, the bitch had this super vapid smile on her face. I just had this weird gut instinct that she was hiding something from everyone and was going to fight to the death to keep it hidden. I expressed to my mom that she gave me a weird vibe and I got told to stop being jealous. But long story shorter, she ended up having an entire other relationship and life with another guy three hours away.  
Jimmy Saville. Turned out everyone had same thought and a lot of people knew. 
Guy at my school. Everybody else liked but I had a bad vibe. My girlfriend at the time told me to not be so negative and automatically dislike people. Since then he lied to her about something I said, lied to me about talking to her. And then lied to everyone saying we broke up because I cheated on her.  And guess who she's dating now? 
This is kinda sorta unrelated, but I am the creepy guy that people have bad feelings about.   I am overly friendly, affectionate, and takes jokes "a little too far." Doesn't really help the fact that I'm a 29 year old asian single man who lives by himself at a church and works a theological school. But yeah, aside from my weirdness, I ASSURE YOU that I have not nor will I ever hurt anyone. I just really like people.    It's weird, I'm always in a position where I have to explain myself I that I'm creepy, but not a creep.   Crap. 
I wonder how many wrong feelings occur for each right one 
In college (a small one), there was a guy who was generally affable but just awful to be on projects with. He would fight, couldn't handle criticism, wouldn't take direction from women, etc.... but he was fun out of class. But I just got a feeling something was off/wrong/bad about this human. I was brushed off as being an overly sensitive woman. End of the first year he was reprimanded for being found in another gentleman's dorm room whilst the other gentleman was asleep (or passed out). The kid (18 year old)woke up and the (bad) dude (26 year old) was standing by his bed, staring at him.  I think that's weird.  
Korean living in Canada here. It wasn't exactly hidden from kids even when they're young. I remember being aware of North Korea's existence as long as I can remember because of the whole reunification movement that is visible in everyday life, even before I started going to school.   The general vibe was that they were taken away from us, living in harsh conditions and that we should try to reunite as a favour to them.   I left before being taught any proper Korean history, so maybe somebody else will have more to say in that sense.  
I grew up in South Korea. It's probably the same stuff that an average redditor would know about North Korea, I guess the difference is that it gets taught at school and is brought up more often. Things like how North Koreans are suffering because of their horrible dictatorship government but their citizens are our brothers, how tragic the Korean War was, and peaceful reunification is the goal. To add a little bit more context, there was a stronger anti-Japan sentiment than an anti-NK sentiment, at least when I was growing up. This was in the late 90's early 00's. 
Yup quite strange when we had a North Korean student coming to our school and the South Koreans tried to befriend him but he kept to hinself 
Ha ha. How did they teach us??? Usually the air raid sirens and evacuation plans did the trick. I was growing up there in the 80s during the Cold war. There were constant student protests in Seoul. Tear gas in the air a lot. That had less to do with the North and more to do with the government at the time in the south.   I remember the terror when there was a drill and your mom or dad wasn't home. I didn't know if I would see them again. Even though I always saw them again, in the moment I was so afraid.  I was taught always that the North Koreans were our brothers and sisters. They were victims of a terrible madman.i was taught they were starving. I was taught that reunification was possible and greatly to be desired. "Korea"in Korean is "hanguk". It means "one people". I grew up believing that not being whole with the North was not being whole as a culture, as a people. Incidentally, the Korean weird for America is "miguk" or beautiful people".  
Not a movie but a tv series called Black Mirror. The episodes are like an hour long, and focus on technology and psychological torment. Totally a fucked up show. 
Threads. Especially as I live in Sheffield where it's set 
Prisoners.  It had me terrified and on the edge of my seat the entire movie.  It was every parent's nightmare.  I am not even a parent and I was worried for my children.  
Jacobs Ladder. Without a doubt, the most thrilling horror movie I've seen.  
Misery - No need for jump scares. The terror comes from Annie's swift changes in mood, and suddenly you find yourself fearing for Paul's life.  
Eraserhead gave me nightmares for a couple of days. 
The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre - those long, still shots where the horror just comes into frame and you are helpless and can only sit and watch as it unfolds. 
Silence of the lambs.    Most of the violence isn't even on the screen. But because we don't see it we started putting it together in our heads. Hopkins and Foster sucked me into that movie and had me looking over my shoulder for days.  
We Need to Talk About Kevin.        Don't look up anything about it, just watch it. More horrifying than scary, though, TBH.  edit- fucked up the title    edit2- should be on Netflix (US, anyways) for those who want to watch it. 
Although the second half of the movie resorts to some cheap scares the first half of 'The Descent' is terrifying. 
Mothman Prophecies to me was quite scary. Also, Coherence which is a really low budget movie gets me quite anxious and scared when watching it because I can imagine myself in their shoes if that stuff were to happen to me on a normal night. It is on Amazon Prime if anyone is interested if you like relativity and alternate reality stuff.  
The Shining. While less scary and more intense and dreadful, it's still awesome. 
The Last House on the Left. The 70's one is great but the remake is pretty solid too. The idea of knowing your temporary houseguests harmed someone close to you is an interesting idea. Made me think about what I might do in that situation.  Oldboy is a good example of this too. The more you think about it, the scarier it becomes. 
Se7en (David Fincher). Saw it when I was 12 or something, barely slept for a week 
Session 9. It's what you never see that really gets to you. 
Not traditionally a horror film but terrifying in a different way, Bone Tomahawk. 
The Girl Next Door. Not the comedy one, the other one loosely based on Sylvia Likens.  Poor girl got mutilated and raped to death orchestrated by someone who was supposed to be a caregiver.  
A Spanish film called El Orfanato (The Orphanage).  
Black Swan. A slow descent into madness is creepy and realistic and totally within the realm of possibility for most people 
The original Blair Witch project. The fact that is was the first "found footage" and you never saw the witch or anything because it was always off camera was freaky. Plus I remember when everyone left the theater the fact that everyone thought that was real footage and not a movie.  
It follows was pretty good at creating a creepy atmosphere.  
The Fourth Kind pretty much did it for me.   But I'm a sucker for "realistic" alien movies.  
"The mist" was very good for this. All about suspense and the idea of not knowing what was out there, and the ending.... Very good 
The VVitch  There's *one* jump scare in the film, which doesn't involve any horror at all. It's a fantastic period piece and creepy as fuck 
For me.....i dunno about 'scariest' but as much as people shit on M. night Shamalananan,   I thought Signs  It had good tension. There was a lot of quietness in the movie which made the atmosphere more creepy, almost like you're on the edge of your seat feeling like they might jam the volume up high as shit to scare you, but they never do. To this day, i'll never forget how scary it was when they show that video of the birthday party and the footage capturing the alien walking by. I still won't watch that movie alone. 
Nightcrawler had me on the edge of my seat.  It's a diffrent kind of scary... 
The Strangers. The fear of being hunted is just fucking awful  
Creep.  This one left me with a feeling of dread for days afterwards. 
probably very quickly. some people have allergies and sneeze a lot-they would notice 
I read this about 5 minutes ago and my nose hasn't stopped bleeding since. Please help. 
People working in hospitals might notice a little quicker, seeing everyone with illnesses stop sneezing at once. My bet would be a couple days, assuming the government doesn't try to cover it up or anything. 
/r/AskReddit needs more of these kinds of questions.  
This is the deepest shit I've read all day. I'm perplexed by this. Would we even realise? I can't remember the last time someone sneezed, could it have happened already? when did I last sneeze? OH GOD 
Is this like a twist on that movie The Children Of Men"??? 
What a tortuous condition that could be (if interpreted a certain way): you still felt like you had to sneeze like you normally would leading up to a sneeze, but you never could get the release that comes when you let out that sneeze. Damn dude. 
A lot of times I sneeze if I look in the sun's direction, so I would probably realize after a few months. Most definitely by Summer. 
I fucking love sneezing. Its a full body instaboner when i sneeze a couple times in a row. I even get jealous when i hear other people sneeze. So i think i'd definitely notice if I or nobody around me sneezed.    Sneeze.  
This is just a decoy. Hiccuping has already stopped worldwide. 
HU-man Version 1.0.2.3778 OTA update.   -----------------------------------  OTA update will be released tonight. It will apply once HU-man is in a sleep state.   Patch notes:  * Fixed a bug where HU-man would seize and a convulsive expulsion of air from the lungs through the nose and mouth occurred.   * Optimized cognitive recall.   * Added framework to resolve fatal peanut response error observed in some units. We anticipate pushing out the RC to selected participants in the 2016FLU patch.   Known issues ----------------  * Bio-waste excretion from sphincter is on average 43% thicker requiring several cleaning cycles. In the mean time we recommend the use of a wet wipe to help reduce the time required to clear waste. If possible use a jet of water to clear any waste that clings to the skin.   * Known issue where the sphincter muscle will open and stay open requiring the HU-man unit to use a scoop to clear bio-waste. If this occurs kindly do the needful.       
I'd realize it as soon as sunlight hit me and I didn't sneeze. 
The first people to notice will be those who are plagued by sneezing often. And even then they will just be happy they personally arent afflicted anymore and won't consider it to have effected everyone. Even when pointed out, most people will be like "huh, yeah I havnt sneezed in a while. odd" then move on with their life. It's going to take years to decades for a formal study to look into it.  
Oh man, damn, that's a crazy and interesting question. I think there's like a 60% chance that we wouldn't notice for decades.  
My then-not-boyfriend and I were waiting at the train station on my train home; he would leave with the bus after it arrived. My train came and I thought 'fuck it' and kissed my then-not-boyfriend on the mouth. Immediately after, I jumped on the train, on which the doors then closed. I didn't see his reaction nor felt it so I sat pretty anxious on the train, thinking I ruined it all. About 5 minutes later, I got a text saying:  'That was meant as a friends kiss, right?'  Lol, bless his heart.  
Put out my hand for him to hold and he high fived me.  
Last summer I was doing my best to seduce who is my current boyfriend. We were going swimming at a friend's house, and while they were changing into their bathing suits in the house, me and him make our way to the pool.    I take advantage of this moment to strip in front of him, as sensual as possible. (Bathing suit was underneath my clothes.)  He runs past me, full sprint, and cannonballs into the pool.  
"You are really cute and I like you" met with complete silence.... Later on that dude told me that he does not accept compliments well. We have already planned the next few dates. 
I knew this girl for a year and had kinda had feelings for her the whole time. We got close for a few weeks and one time I'm watching some films at hers. It gets late and I start to head out, she says "I don't want you to go".   Thinking she was just feeling lonely or whatever I follow her upstairs and we get in bed... and do nothing. Lights go out, we start going to sleep. I'm sitting there the whole time thinking "damn, I wish I had the balls to make a move" but don't.  Then she sits up, takes her top off in a way I couldn't possibly miss, and lies down again. Still, I don't get that SHE'S trying to make moves on ME.  10 minutes later she finally gives up and just kisses me. She mocked me about this for months after. 
I love to share this one: A long time before my husband and I started dating we were partying in my apartment. He said he was going to crash on the couch. I told him "you can come sleep in my bed". I shit you not he said "well where would you sleep? I can't kick you out of your bed."  
Not exactly an answer to the Q but related.  I was dating a guy who told me upfront that he was terrible at picking up the signs that someone liked him, was flirting, etc. So on our third (?) date, we planned that he would stay the night at my place. I thought that was pretty obvious, but just to make sure, I put a bunch of condoms on a platter on the bed, with notes all around it, pointing to the platter that said "This is a sign!" He thought it was hilarious. We had sex. It was awesome.  
Hint: "Want to have sex in the shower later?"  Response: "sure!"  ~*later, in the shower, waiting forever, door left cracked open... I give up.*~  Question: "Why didn't you come into the shower??"  Response: "Oh! I didn't know you wanted me to!"  ~*crickets*~  This has happened more than once.  
This girl was sitting with our group of boys and saying "if I was to get with one of you, it would be you [my name]" And I was just like "Ah thanks very much, very kind of you to say that" 
Back in college, my now s/o of 4 years would walk me home from class at night. Mustered up the courage to ask him to "come upstairs and have some wine with me". Hard no. Ok, he's not into it.   Two months later, he invites me and my friends to a party. He's blackout drunk when we show up, and tells my friend that he's in love with me and got wasted cuz he was nervous about seeing me. She convinces him to tell me (knowing I was also into him).   Curveball: Told me that he was really into me, but didn't want to mess up my relationship. Uhrm.. what relationship? Ya know, that guy from our class that you always talk to and giggle with. Uh.. Matt? As in Matt with the boyfriend, Matt? ........Oh, well that strangely explains a lot.  
Hitting on my now boyfriend of three years. I was complimenting him on how handsome he was and how he had beautiful eyes. I wanted a closer view of them so he texted me this creepy ass shot of his eyeball with his eye as widely opened as possible. He legitimately thought that's what I wanted. After our first date, I immediately started talking about potential future dates and how much fun I had with him. I stayed out so late that I missed my friends party. However, because  I didn't hug him properly and asked to split the cost of the meal, he thought I wasn't actually interested.  
All these comments are making me not want to try any hints at all....for now on I'm just going to be straight forward 
I was living with my then-boyfriend a few years ago. Feeling a little flirtatious, I suggested we could take a shower together, you know, to save water, wink wink.   His response? "Why? We don't pay for water."  Shut. Down.  
I started talking to a guy who was behind on Game Of Thrones. So I offered to give him my HBO password so we could watch it at his place, thinking it would be a good excuse to hang out. He ends up marathoning the show without me. We're dating now, but he sure as hell not watch season 7 without me  
Asked a guy for his number after a Meetup. Went on a date with him that he didn't realize was a date until his friend that we ran into texted him to apologize for crashing it. Currently sitting on the couch next to him, 3 years later, looking at dogs that are available for adoption. He eventually caught on. 
When i was 18 and foolish a girl once asked me if i was into 'role-playing games'   I said of course! And promptly started showing her my WOW account... she left pretty soon after. 
I was at a party drinking with a guy I had a bit of a crush on. We were joking around and I told him to touch my boob, because he jokingly accused me of padding my bra (since they're quite large).  He DID touch them for a second, but then he just kept going on with the conversation. I figured he wasn't interested and I got over it.  I think he realized his mistake cause he always made it a point to like everything I post on facebook. 
In high school I sat next to a very quiet guy that I liked and whenever I was cold I made my arm touch his. He would never move but never talked to me other than to ask about class. Ten years later I messaged him on Facebook asking about the reunion and jokingly asked him to be my date. He said sure why not. We've been married for year next month. He said he didn't remember me from high school. 
Him: "I dont want to pressure you, but it's pretty late and I think you should spend the night. My couch is super comfortable and I can make it up for you if you'd like.'   Me: "Maybe I could sleep in your bed with you."  Him: "I promise the couch isn't bad"   Brutal. 
I asked him if he wanted to go to my dorm for Netflix and chill. We watched Parks and Rec for two hours and then he went home without touching me once. 
Not a lady, but I had this girl visit me and sleep with me in the same bed on four different occasions...from half across the country.      I thought we were just friends.      Ten years later I was taking a shit and it dawned on me that she didn't travel across the country just to sleep ffs.      I feel bad for the girl now, because I was really into her too. 
One of my employees, whenever she is drunk, (brewery, not just kicking it with drunk employees) will constantly say how cute she thinks I am and how adorable my nerdiness is. Will ask me to go to bars after we close down, or to come over to hers and drink.  I pretend every time I don't notice. She's pretty and all, but I like my job.  I wonder if she thinks I am that dense.  
We were married two full years before I finally understood that if she took a bath at night I was going to get some.  Watched a lot of baseball while she lay sparkling clean in bed alone. 
I had a very attractive young lady lay down on my bedroom floor, pull her pants down and showed me her newly installed clit ring.  I told her it was nice and shuffled out of the room like the autist I am.   Pretty sure it was a hint. I'll never know. 
When I was 14 or 15 the neighbor girl asked if I had any porn (I did, duh, and on VHS!) and if I wanted to come over and watch it. Absolutely took her up on that offer. And after an hour or so went home with my tape and jacked off.   In retrospect she wanted it and I missed the hint.  
I stripped completely naked, played sexy music and started rubbing his shoulders.   He didn't even turn around and just asked if I wanted to order pizza for dinner... 
Not a chick, but my fiancee  was laying on our bed in her thing and a t-shirt (on her belly) with our "pink thing" (vibrator)  next to my pillow. I came out of the shower and sat next to her an grabbed her ass and kissed her neck...she didn't react and I noticed she was on her Facebook..the digital cock block... So I tried again, nothing. So I sat back and waited like 10 mins and she goes "wow way to miss the fucking hint"   WHAT THE FUCK 
My current boyfriend and I started out in this weird friends that flirt stage.  I was trying to find a way to get him to make a move.  One very hot evening (middle of august) we were sitting in his backyard with a few of our friends drinking beer.  I sat on the SAME lawn chair as him, kind of wiggled in, and said "I'm cold".    He left me alone in the chair and proceeded to build a giant fire.  It took like an hour.  When he was finished making the fire he sat back down in a DIFFERENT lawn chair.   
One day shortly before my husband returned home from work I stripped down and put on one of his button up shirts, jumped in to bed, sat all sexy like and waited for him to get home. He gets home and walks in to the bedroom. Boom! Naked wife with her boobs hanging out of your shirt, I thought I was being obvious.  Nope. He lays in bed next to me, talks about his day and looks to be getting ready for a nap. I thought, "Oh, maybe he's super tired. I'll catch him after his nap." I jump out of bed, but some pants and a shirt on and go down the hallway to fold laundry.  Not but a couple minutes later my husband comes running down the hallway before coming to screeching halt in front of me, he's doing his best to be smooth with a hint of awkward. He didn't realize I was initiating sexy time at all. He pulled out all his best moves and dragged me back in to the bedroom.    TL;DR - Sat in front of my husband mostly naked, he didn't realize I was initiating sexy time. 
My fiance and I were chatting on FB Messenger near the start of our relationship and it went something like this:  Him: I haven't had sex in 2 years  Me: That's quite a streak, I'd hate to mess it up ;)  Him: Yeah it's been awhile  ....  Wait, what    I then lured him into a hotel, fucked his brains out, and now we're getting married. 
As a guy, I completely see your hints all the time but I'm afraid that I'm wrong and going to get rejected/made a fool out of myself so I don't do anything. 
I'm a guy and I've told this story before but I must again to make clear how oblivious we are:  Met this girl through my (female) best friend. Her and I became friends due to our mutual love of movies. She's come by most evenings and we'd chill, smoke a jernt and watch foreign films, work through the Criterion collection or catch some underground cult classics...she'd often stay well into the night and sleep over. Often in my room with me.  This went on for a long while and then one day she just disappeared, cut off FB and everything -- gone. I knew I did nothing so I figured "life change" and went on....  Flash forward to years later/last year-ish...I'm on the phone with my best friend and make some joke about 'Netflix and Chill' to her, she says "THATS WHAT ******* SPENT MONTHS TRYING TO DO WITH YOU"...I swear I didn't know until that moment and worst part is, I was head over heels for that girl. 
Her: How much do you wank during a week? Me: Well, too much lol Her friend: Haha, we could have sex then, we're also lonely at night Me: Yeah...  Then I just continued on with the conversation because I thought they were joking...  2 sexy girls where asking mefor a threesome... And I didn't get it... 
When it's hammered into your brain your whole life that it's creepy and predatory  to get forward with a girl because you think she's into you, you learn to ignore any signal that isn't bright flashing neon. The risk/reward ratio for responding to hints is not at all in our favor. Guys like to say they're just dense, but this is deeply-ingrained cultural training. Sorry ladies, until the culture changes we're going to remain oblivious. 
When I was 8 or so my old nanny/baby sitter (choose which you prefer) was showing me a video of her time with her boyfriend in Paris. After it blacks out for a few seconds it then suddenly cuts to her lying on her hotel bed completely naked, legs spread, telling her boyfriend to 'come get it'. She jumped out of her seat tried to cover my eyes and told me to never tell anyone. I have now told potentially thousands of random strangers 
Growing up with my little brother and single Mom we never had a lot, but she made sure we always had a safe and decent place to live and there was always food on the table. She never really ate much, I remember dinners of baked chicken, beef stew, salmon (it was a lot cheaper a million years ago)... good food, nothing terribly extravagant, but always nutritious, yet she barely ever ate. When I was 10 I saw her eating pb&j on crackers in her room after dinner. That's when I realized there was never enough food for all 3 of us, she would cook what we had for my brother and I and she would eat the bare minimum, always out of sight, so that my brother and I wouldn't worry about the actual level of poverty we were at. I never asked for another material thing from her after that night. 
Was getting a vasectomy and the doctor told me not to look down.  I looked down.  ...I shouldn't have looked down. 
I was helping MIL cleaning out her closet. All was jokes and laughter until I pull out an unopened massive dildo. We were both paralyzed for a moment before she slowly took it out of my hands and mumbled something about the dildo not being what she tought it would be like and that she ordered it online. She then backed out of the room and threw it in a cupboard.  We then proceeded to clean the rest of the closet.  I desperately wanted to tell SO about this awkward event but decided to spare him.  
My boss forwarded me an email telling me to do something. I noticed the email chain had his bosses on it so I read through the chain. They had asked him to rate all my co-workers and I from best to worse earlier in the conversation.  
I used to do a little work after school at a local comic shop. One day after school I was bagging comics when the owners buddy came in. "Look at these!  Came out great!"  He had a stack of glossy amateur porn, featuring the shop owner, his buddy, and the owners wife fucking. He laid them out all over the counter and they started pawing through the stack excitedly. From what I could see it looked  like the three of them enjoyed one another's company equally and vigorously.   Then they noticed I was there. I got sent home early with a stack of free comics.  
I was driving from West Berlin to West Germany in the late 1980's.  My bf gives me wrong instructions so I have to take an exit off the Autobahn to turn back and get back to the correct exit.    On the small country road on which we found ourselves, we see a large truck with a missile on it, surrounded by Russian soldiers.    They were as surprised as we were, but just laughed and waved at us, as we got the hell out of there as quickly as possible. 
My teacher shoving a flask into his desk drawer when I came in unexpectedly. 
Late to this one, but I once walked into my dad's van while he was balls deep into a woman who was not my mom.  Dad had a drinking problem.  Mom took me and my brother to go looking for him because he was supposed to be buying Christmas presents.  Found his van at a bar.  Mom sent me to look inside the van to see if there were presents in there.    Looked back into the back and saw my dad's bare ass as he was plowing some chick.  He turned over his shoulder and looked right at me and said in the most evil voice, "Get out."  This was 20+ years ago now and I still get emotional thinking about it.  I still remember the entire thing so clearly. 
I was about 8 or 9 and my parents were going to be out of town so they had me and siblings stay with a family from our church. Once we got to the house (which was really nice BTW) they had one rule, you can play wherever you want but the basement is off limits. Me being the little bastard that I was snuck down there first chance I got and was supremely disappointed to only find rows and rows of plants growing under lights. 
More heard than seen, but...  I was golfing with my mother's fiance when he got a phone call. He had his cell volume turned up really high, and I overheard a woman who wasn't my mother say some things, including the phrase "fuck and suck," in a seductive manner. I convinced myself that it wasn't my business, or that I'd misunderstood, and dropped it.  A few years later, her now-husband was revealed to be a serial cheater, with active partners numbering in the dozens.  Yes, I still feel like shit.  Yes, they're divorced. 
Saw a Homer Simpson keychain in my mom's desk drawer. Didn't say anything.  Two weeks later its in my Christmas stocking and she goes "Wow, how did Santa know how much you like the Simpsons".  Thats how I figured out Santa must've been sleeping with my mom. 
Walking in on my cousins railing each other..... Now I understand why they were close at thanksgiving. 
When I was younger, my family went to look round a house we were considering buying. Went into the owner's daughter's room and there was a blow up sex doll on the floor, it was really funny but we didn't end up buying the house. 
Back in middle school we had this really strange gym teacher about 6'2 and ripped. Me and my friend were going to take a dump and thought that the locker room toilets would be clean since no one used them throughout the day. When we walked in to our left was one big shower room and there was our gym teacher showering while eating spaghetti out of a tupperware container. Thank god he was wearing swim trunks but he turned around and said you guys aren't supposed to be here so we left. 
When I was 14 and friend hosted a birthday party at his house with all the parents invited. Needed to use the restroom but the main one was occupied so my friend told me I can use the one in his moms bedroom. As I walked up to the door I could hear somebody in there so I decided to wait until whoever was in there was finished. A good 10 minutes later, my friends mom (who was hosting the party) and another good friends step-father walk out and see me standing there all confused. They asked what I was doing there and I just said I was waiting to use the bathroom. Surprisingly they played it cool and just said I can use it now and walked off. 
I saw a couple banging under a secluded water fall in the woods on a hiking trip with my parents when a was 12.  Majestic AF. 
My mom's attempted suicide.   I was about 4-5 when she tried to hang herself from some exposed pipes we had in the bathroom. My mom and dad were drunk-arguing all night when she went in to the bathroom and things got quiet. My dad rushed in to get her down and when he opened the door, that's the moment I decided to walk out of the bedroom to see what all the noise was all about, because they were different screams that weren't normal arguing sounds.  That image stuck around for a while...  EDIT 2: If you need to talk to someone, /u/mrlaughter has pointed me to /r/hardshipmates which seems like a fantastic community. There is also /r/MomForAMinute which also seems incredibly amazing.  EDIT 1: Thank you so much for your kind words and responses! I really thought this was going to go unread. I'm doing my best to work through all of your replies and getting back to all of you! First time getting attention, and I'm at work, but I will reply as quickly as I can. 
I saw an employees check stub that he dropped. He had been there for a month and was making what I made after my first year and was not a very good worker. I got a raise 
My parents' collection of sex toys - that was way more reality than my 10-year-old mind was prepared to handle  
Beavis and Butt-Head Do America.  My parents found out we went into that theater and they dragged us out REAL quick. 
About 9 years ago, there were a couple of notes scattered across the computer desk in my parents' study. I happened to read them because words are in front of my face, what am I gonna do?  They were notes my parents had written each other instead of just talking to each other.  Because my dad had slept with 14 hookers. 
Our cat was a little late coming home one evening (unusual for him).   I went looking for him, calling his name, not massively loudly as it was late at night in a built up area.   As I walked around a corner to a car park, there he was. He looked like he was just having a bit of a chat with a fox. They looked relaxed, facing each other, sitting and chilling out.   I called his name and he looked at me, seemed flustered, looked back at the fox then me almost as if he was saying 'he's not with me, I don't know him'.   I called him again and he chased the fox into the bushes before trotting over to me.   I'm sure I crossed an animal 'line'.  
One Christmas Eve I couldnt sleep at all so I went to the kitchen to get some water or something and out in the living room were my parents setting out presents and eating the cookies I had left out.  They said that Santa was running late and was in such a big hurry that he just dropped off the presents and asked them to put them out for him. 
My 6 year old cousin asked me if I wanted some chewing gum. I said sure, if she has some. She then goes to her mother's purse and takes out two packages of condoms and asks me: What do you want, strawberries or banana?   Next thing I know, I'm shoving Durex packages in her mother's purse saying "We should firstly ask your mom before going through her things". So the kid doesn't stop here, she takes the purse, goes in the kitchen where all the family was reunited and asked her mother: Mom, can I have some gum?" Her mom says she doesn't have any. The freakin' girl takes the condoms out of the purse and says: Sure you do, I want the strawberries ones please.   Imagine her mother's embarrassment... 
Similar story to the f-117 at the top.   I was a contractor in Afghanistan working at Jalalabad air field (FOB Fenty). I woke up to take a piss and gave a cigarette. On the other side of the runway I saw a few helicopters take off but didn't hear anything. I thought it was strange as the base was dead silent but didn't think too much about it.   It was only later when I read the news that it was the SEAL team raid to kill bin Laden.   Because of my pea sized bladder I was probably the first non military or government person to see those stealth helicopters.  
A long time friend of mines dad was showing me pics of a car he was restoring. He accidentally pulled up nude pics of my friends mom instead. He looked awkward for a minute. He never said anything and then just started looking at car pics like it never happened.    
An obese, greasy feller, sitting fully naked on a toilet, a mix of pain and confusion and surprise on his face as I walked into his stall at a Sizzlers restaurant.  Stayed with me for a while, not gonna lie. 
My dad's bank account balance when I was ~12, stopped asking for things after that 
When I was little, my father set a password on a computer I was using for playing games. I wanted him to type the password (while I was away), but set a camera to record it. Hid it behind a pile of books.  The trick was, the camera back in the days was only able to record for 30 seconds, so I had to call my father and run out of the room, so he could type it as quickly as possible. It stopped filming just as he hit Enter. 
My dads texts to a woman when I was 12.  He handed me his phone to use if I got in trouble and he changed the sim but forgot to delete the phone's storage so I saw all the texts.   I would always see him closing Facebook chats and he used to sit in my treehouse on the phone for hours every evening.   He told me he went on holiday to sort out a property he had abroad. He went with this woman.  They broke up and he forced me to tell him my Facebook password so he can 'ensure my privacy from strangers'. He blocked the woman on Facebook on my computer.  My mother had a brain aneurysm/stroke the year before. They were still married and I didn't know what was going on. It made me feel sick..  He knew this woman from school, and I hope he never cheated on my mother with her before her accident. 
Ben Affleck's social security number.  Years ago I was working for a company that I could access different departments' server files in.  I was bored one day and was poking through those files to see what else the company had going on.  I found a contract for a production deal with Ben Affleck, and his SSN was included (for payroll purposes).  I closed the file because I knew I should not have been looking at that, even if it was accessible.   No, I didn't retain it or remember it.  No, I would not do anything with it if I did.  I don't care about his personal life. 
As a middle schooler, I picked up a book at the library, flipped through the pages and found an application for a replacement birth certificate for some old man. It had every detail about his personal identification on it, so naturally I took it home thinking, "I'll just hold onto this incase I ever need to assume a fake identity by pretending to be an 80 year old man and flee the country."   My mom found it and had to explain to me that no we don't steal people's identities. 
When I was about 5, my mom took me to the bank because she needed something out of the safety deposit box. It was right when they were opening up. They asked us to turn around while they unlocked the vault, but I peeked. According to family lore, I went around the rest of the day chanting the numbers of the combination.  
My grandmother dying.   I was 7 and the phone rang, so I answered it. I walked into the back bedroom where my mother, aunt, and grandfather were standing around my grandmother's bed.   When I walked in the room, I noticed her move her head like she was looking at something on the ceiling. Then I heard someone say, "this is it..."   I've heard my mother tell the story of the moment she died and it's exactly what I witnessed. I've never told anyone. I'm 25 now.  
It's more something that this person wasn't supposed to hear than see but back in the 80's, my AP US History teacher won an award and got to have lunch with Senator Ted Kennedy and hung out with him in his office. As he was leaving, he saw an aide walk up to Ted Kennedy and whispered something into Kennedy's ear. Then Ted Kennedy yelled "HOW THE FUCK DO YOU LOSE A NUCLEAR WARHEAD!" as my history teacher was just casually walking away.  
My dad's penis. He kept it covered, but I had the weird habit as a kid of coming downstairs at midnight and going for an hour long walk. When I came home, he was usually at the computer masturbating in a bathrobe.  
Luckily I didn't actually see it, but when I was about 10 years old I was awaken from sleep in our caravan by the sound my dad having sex with my aunt (both where drunk) in the other end of the caravan while my mom was passed out drunk outside.   Ah, fun vacation memories. 
This isn't a particularly scandalous story, but I think it's amusing. My dad is a carpenter, and I used to come with him on installations to help out. One time we were putting in a cabinet for this nice Jewish couple, inside their study. I was walking by the computer on the desk, and I couldn't help noticing the open web page on it: OyWhatADeal.com  
I'm sure everyone can add the nudity of a friend to the list, so I'll skip that.    SPOILER ALERT: I learned at 6 that Santa was not really bringing me presents when I had my door cracked open on Christmas Eve and saw my dad and my cat wrestling with a present that my dad was trying in vain to get out of my cat's clutches. The scratches down his arm the next morning confirmed that it wasn't a dream. Sassy never took shit from anyone, though.  
I was camping in a huge old palapa in Mexico, near the east side of the sea of Cortez. I think it was near a town called Bahia Kino. On one side was a beach and on the other was an old rough airway. The locals had told me it was dangerous out there but I was young and dumb.  I was laying in my sleeping bag when I saw a boat flashing a light at the shore. A guy I hadn't been aware of standing fifty feet to my right started flashing a light back at the boat.   A truck drove onto the end of the runway an several guys ran down and met the boat and ran back and forth between the boat and runway. Five minutes later a small plane landed and they loaded and turned it around almost instantly.   The boat headed back to sea, plane flew away and the truck raced off toward town.  I lay awake the rest of the night thinking about how close to dying I had come. 
Opposite side: I got married towards the end of law school, and after graduating stayed with my parents for a few months while I prepped for the bar exam. My wife and I were fooling around, when my then-18-year-old brother opened the door and walked in to a perfect shot of us both spread eagle, touching each other's bits.   That was the last time that door went unlocked.  
Oh I can share something that's has some value finally.  So 16 year old me was swimming in the hotel pool when some girls about my age started swimming and every time she pushed off the top of her bikini would slip down revealing her nipples. Best holiday of my life and I must have stayed in that pool for at least two hours.... She wore a different bikini the next day :(   I was wearing googles btw that's how I could see under water 
The strange man eating a urinal cake in a public bathroom. He just stared back at me and we made really awkward eye contact as he shoved the remainder into his mouth. 
When I was 9 my Mom wanted me to do some more advanced reading, so she went to the story and bought me an R.L. Stine "adult fiction" novel (Goosebumps were in their prime then).   I started reading the book, and about page 5, a woman starts giving a bj. I learned a lot that day. I then went into my parents room and trolled my mom by reading the passage to her. 
Not see but say. I was in a long 6+ hour car ride with the parents and I decided to randomly blurt out "Dad what ever happened to the girl you got pregnant?" I have no idea what prompted me to say that. Mom turned to dad and yelled "YOU TOLD HIM ABOUT THAT?" Turns out my dad got a girl pregnant at 15 and had to get an abortion before being in high school. It was a very interesting car ride thereafter.  
My friend masturbating butt naked in the middle of his room looking at his computer. He always locks his door when he leaves. And turning the handle to his bedroom is usually a good way to check if he's home when I end up at his house. The door opened and so for the briefest moment my mind looked into his room and he was, as usual, in front of his pc. However, he was shirtless, and I automatically looked down to see if he had shorts on as a reflex and at the same time, he prioritises closing his browser window over covering his dick. So while I do regret seeing that image that'll never leave my mind, I more regret not instinctively looking at his browser because we're all pretty sure he's into Hentai. 
I was interning at a company while in college. It was not a local internship so the company found us furnished apartments. Most of the interns were in the same apartment complex and as one would expect all the young folks hung out together.   I smoked at the time and our patio opened into this courtyard type area. I was sitting on a plastic patio chair smoking a Marlboro Light and I look across to see this window that the blind was like 3/4ths open. I look over and see this hot bodied naked female walking around in front of the window looking like she was talking on the phone.   I must have been staring as another male intern walked up to me and I didn't even notice. He asked me what I was doing and he looked where I was looking. He proceeded to pull up another lawn chair next to mine and then asked for a cigarette.   Don't think we were supposed to see that woman naked. Looking back on it and considering how long she paced in front of that window, I wonder if it was on purpose.  
Celebrities will have a hard time explaining all these sudden nudes 
Probably all the not-so-great photoshops out there that appear to break the rules of physics. People missing shadows, or appear to be floating or bending space around them...stuff like that. 
Every time he refers to himself as "humbled", snort an entire ounce of cocaine. 
Every time he claims he's the only person to fix something, drink. Every time he says "great," drink. Every time he says "bigly," drink. Every time he says "fake news," drink. 
When he finishes his speech and says "Obama, you're fired!"  fuckin cringe.  
I'm for fun and all, but this just seems dangerous.  
I'm imagining it will play out like Scar's speech in the Lion King. It begins slowly, with Trump reflecting on Obama's presidency and the death of democracy.   Then, he kicks it up. The skies turn red, his voice booms as Russian politicians slowly pour onto the stage behind him. Trump announces a new era where lion and hyena live together. 
If he actually surprises us with a well delivered inaugural address, chug a pitcher of beer.  
Take a shot every time you feel displeased Trump is going to be president.  If you're a Trump supporter, take a shot every time you feel smug watching the speech. 
#Drinks with Donnie  **Yes, my lord:** If Donald compliments himself, everyone must bow. The last person to bow downs their drink.  **Glorious orator:** If Trumpy forgets his speech and goes on a tangent, the first person to say: "Excellent point!" is allowed to assign two sips to anyone.  **Wait, what?** Everyone drinks when Donald Trump contradicts himself within one minute.  **Wordator extraordinaire:** When Donny Don invents a word, the youngest person drinks any amount they want. Everyone else must take as many sips.  **Splitting hairs:** If T-Dog mentions his hair, the oldest person drinks any amount they want. Everyone else must take as many sips.  **Make America Drink Again:** When Donaldine Trumpet says "Make America Great Again", everybody takes a shot.  **Unbelievable:** If the words "you would not believe" are uttered, everyone present must reply "We believe!", with the last person taking not one, but two shots. 
Drink for every vague superlative.   "Huge" "Great" "Best" "amazing" all get shots.  Dead by the third sentence. 
Pro Tip: If you're underage and still want to play a pseudo-drinking game, find some of those jelly beans that have a 50/50 chance of being disgusting (bean-boozled, I think) and replace "drink" with "pick a random bean" 
A little off topic, but if you can, skip watching the address in any form and read the transcript later. Trump is an insatiable ratings whore and it would just kill him if people didn't tune in to watch his inauguration.  
My dad's stripper girlfriend is here and she's been farting nonstop since about a quarter after seven.  
Christmas is for people to celebrate having a family, and disposable income.  I have neither, so here I am. 
There is only so many times I can listen to Mariah Carey   
Because I'm at work. How do you like all that electricity you're getting?  Also, half of my family is in Mexico and half of them are in the Caribbean.  
I lost at monopoly. Don't feel like family right now. 
I'm stranded in a state where I know no one, hundreds of miles from my family.   My abusive and toxic (ex) girlfriend left in October, the day I lost my job, after putting me into tremendous debt. Can't pay the rent anymore, so I'm out the 26th. My car is in need of repairs but I can't afford it, so I can't drive on the highway.   So yea, I'm hundreds of miles from my family, I moved to this state a year ago for a fresh start but have been unable to make any stable friendships besides a failed intimate relationship. And I am now financially ruined.   I'm eating a bowl of rice with some butter for Christmas Eve dinner by myself because I can't afford anything else in a place I once called home with a woman I loved. I'm too sad to be angry.  
Oh fuck lol. This post got me.   There'd a bunch of little kids running around downstairs, and I'm waiting for my cousin to get here so we can open presents and stuff.   What about *YOU*, OP? 
Alone Christmas is amazing. Zero stress. Tons of food.   When it would cost $1200 to fly my small family one hour (in airplane time) away, I say fuck that and FaceTime instead.  
Because I'm cuddling in bed with my 2 yr old son.  Two weeks ago his dad told me he wanted a divorce because he's had a 2 yr affair.  I am so depressed this Christmas that I can't do anything but sit and stare.    
Because I'm at my in-laws house and yet again, after being in the family 10 years, nobody got me anything.  My wife and I got them all something and they only buy her stuff...  I hate them.  This is garbage.  Worse, I'm the bread winner in the house and bought all of this stuff.   I just don't have the energy to smile and be nice anymore.      Football and Reddit in the other room...  
Its 8am christmas morning, just woke up with a hangover. Whiskey w/ beer as chaser 5/7 
This is the weirdest Xmas of my life. Parents both passed so it's just me and the sibs. Oldest bro was thrown in jail this morning until we managed to bail him out a few hours ago. Hit the bar to soothe our woes, then last minute grocery shopping at Walgreen's (and drunken flirting with the pseudo punk cashier girl).  Now my brothers are blasting music and dancing like morons and I'm taking a break with a cig and some redditation.  Happy Holidays, love all you idiots 
Haven't talked to my parent's in over 3 years after I came out and was kicked out. Currently working overtime getting paid a fuck ton of money.  
Because I have nothing to do and pretty much nothing to talk about. If anybody talks to me I put down my phone. 
My mom told me she didn't think I could handle being around family, so she left me at her house and went to theirs. I have a mood disorder and sometimes have issues keeping it together. This is absolutely the last year I am celebrating Christmas.  
Big thing tomorrow. Wife is baking cookies and I am baking a doobie.  All is well at the Compound. 
My family went to Paris for vacation and forgot to bring me. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to finish rigging the house with booby traps before some burglars show up. 
In college I had a fair number of all nighters and usually had the tv going to help keep me up and help with concentration.  Once a couple weeks after submitting an essay for a political science class I noticed that the message I sent with it to my professor went something like: "attached is my water for Italian cooking".  My essay was completely fine and had nothing to do with Italy. I guess my brain just turned off as soon as I'd attached the paper and there must have been some cooking related infomercial on tv while I sent it.  
Was on the phone with my boss and she was getting really irritated about something, I don't even remember what. The combination of her irritation and my exhaustion made my brain misfire, and I ended the call with "okay bye bye Mom, I love you!".  I was so embarrassed but she thought it was hilarious and started calling me her adopted daughter after that. I mean, she is the same age as my mom so it's not too weird, but I certainly felt like a child around her instead of a colleague until she left the company. I miss her ): 
My husband and I had an inside joke. Whenever someone lost something, the other person always asked, "have you checked inside your butt?"    I was in a meeting at work (conservative and traditional corporate office) one day and a coworker said, "I can't find my pen." Without any thought or hesitation I quickly responded, "have you checked inside your butt?" As soon as I said it, I snapped back to reality and realized I was at work. As you can imagine, everyone went silent and stared at me as my face turned bright red.  
Not too weird because it does make sense, I recently moved to the apartment directly above the one I used to live in. My former roommate leaves the door unlocked.   The frequency at which I just storm in and enter my empty old bedroom is staggering.  
I'm a security guard for Amazon and I have to do bathroom checks. Caught myself yelling "SECURITY!" right before going to the restroom at a bar on my day off. Thank God it was empty.  
When I was in school (6th grade I think) my mom would make my bagged lunch.  She would wrap soda cans with aluminum foil so they would stay cold (pretty sure that doesn't work).  One day I un-wrapped my soda and discovered she packed me a beer that day. 
Cleaning up my face with electric clippers.  Thought, "Oh, missed a spot." and proceeded to shave off my fucking eyebrow. 
Answered my cell phone "[911 center] what's the location of your emergency?"  Makes my spouse laugh, my friends roll their eyes, and scares the fuck out of telemarketers.   12 hr night shifts are a bitch. 
Opening a Mozzarella cheese stick for my daughter, threw away the actual cheese stick and gave her the wrapper.  
I have two: 1) Walking to work on a very straight path through a nature reserve. I fell asleep and sleepwalked for about 10 mins. It was so weird, i blinked and suddenly appeared near the end of my journey.  2) Got into my car with coffee and a newspaper. Carefully held the rolled-up newspaper whilst hurling the coffee onto the passenger seat.  
I grabbed my "lunch" on my way out the door for work in the morning.  I kept wondering what that beeping noise was the whole drive there. Couldn't figure it out.  Got to work and grabbed my lunch, only to realize I had actually grabbed the baby monitor. 
Instead of ground coffee, I put a couple scoops of sugar in my coffee filter and brewed it. 
Once while playing an intense board game, I was concentrating so hard that my buddy realized that he could just hand random things to me and I'd take them and put them in my jacket pocket or place them on the table in front of me. I only realized when I ran out of space to put things.  
I cared for a horse for several years.   First thing in the morning I would go put feed and water in the field, lead her out, and close the fence behind her.  One morning as I'm walking back into my house, I hear a weird sound behind me. The sound of hooves on linoleum.   She looked as surprised as I was that I had brought her into my kitchen. Luckily, she never told anyone so my secret is still safe. 
Patted one of my coworkers on the butt. I was in the habit of walking up behind my husband and patting him on the butt, so it was just automatic. Fortunately, coworker wasn't offended. 
I used to work in a call center and would answer my personal phone with my call center speech  
I used to fall asleep in class quite often, and normally my writing would trail off in to something illegible and then I'd be out for the count for 10/15 mins. One time I woke up after an in-class power nap to find that my writing had trailed off and then I'd written "my son" as clear as anything at the end of the sentence. I was 13/14 at the time and don't have any children.  
Woke up three hours early for some reason and didn't check the clock but thought I was running late. Rushed through getting ready for work and hit the road. Think it's a bit darker then usual but it could just be grey clouds before the rain. Roads are bit emptier then I'm expecting, must be lucky today. Finally pull up to work and start opening up the shop before anyone else gets in. Look over at the clock and realize I still have two hours to go before I even wake up. Almost went home but decided to stay and just take off three hours earlier then normal. 
Texting my wife while cashing out at the grocery store. She had just done laundry so I wanted to thank her. Rather than typing, I spoke aloud to the cashier saying 'thanks, love you' 
I used to work at the airport while in college, and one day I went to get groceries and drove 30 mins to the airport instead.  
I woke up one morning in college, got dressed, left my room and got halfway out of the dorm before I realized I had no pants on. 
Spent ages cooking dinner only to pick the plate up and empty it straight into the bin. I was so tired and hungry, I cried 
Raising my hand to voice my opinion while in a conversation not a school 
I was tutoring another student on geometry (arc and area and whatnot) just after I had finished cramming for and taken a Calc test. About three quarters of the way through the poor kids homework I realized that I had not done any of the problems correctly. Rather, to the students endless confusion, I had been integrating the circumference of the circle between the endpoints of the arc. Once I realized my mistake I redid the work with him and reimbursed the session cost.   I've never seen someone so grateful to find out that they *were* doing their math right and that I was in whatever post apocalyptic math-based dreamscape. 
grabbing my keys, phone, wallet, etc. before work.  why is there a tv remote in my car?  the etc. included the tv remote 
I tried to put a pacifier in my mother's mouth as opposed to infant she was holding. The best part is that she was nagging the hell out of me.  
When I was 18, hanging out with my then girlfriend at her place. Fell asleep for a bit, and when I woke up she said, "you're cute when you sleep." My immediate sleep-brain reply was, "not when seven people end up dead." 
I drove a city bus in college.  My route and my commute home had a road that overlapped.  Driving home from work one night I ended up doing my bus route instead of my commute home and didn't realize it until I ended up in the bus terminal at the end of the line.  I guess it was better than driving into my apartment complex with the city bus. 
Lose my phone in my hand while in the middle of a call. 
I asked a customer to let me know if we were out of something and I would grab it for them and instead of saying "come yell at me" I said "come at me". Also at different job told a customer "goodnight yourself" 
probably the time i cracked 3 eggs into the sink. one after another. 
Left my house extremely sleepy and drove to my old high school instead of the university. I'm in grad school and have been out of high school for 5 years. I was turning in before I realized what I did, thought I had stroked out for a minute. 
I got out of work late, drove home. Must have dozed off because last thing I remembered was being on the freeway a couple of exits from home. Woke up in the garage 10 min later, with the car turned off. I got home safely without causing an accident. Scared me still thinking about it. 
Post Duty ER. Was already home and asleep. Mom woke me up for dinner, saying "Food's gonna get cold", thought I heard "code", so I jumped up and shouted "where?" And ran down to the dining area only to realize I was at home. 
Had a pet rat out roaming with me while I made some toast.   cleaned up, put the rat in the fridge and didn't realise until I put the butter in the cage that *oh shit*  Went to reclaim the rat, she was all "Fuck off, the food box is MINE now". Already gotten into the ham.   
Locked keys in car then locked car inside house garage.  good times 
Sprayed my hair down with what I thought was hair spray. It was Lysol.  
Was at my fiances house for dinner. Had to leave early. Was in a rush. Kissed her dad on the way out.  
I tried to put the cat into the tool drawer and then almost put the poor thing into the fridge 30 seconds later.  
I wear a fob watch at work. Pinned to my chest. On my days off I don't half get odd looks if someone asks me the time and I automatically start pawing at my boob.   When my daughter was very young she loved trains. So I'd take her on short trips and the line passed some fields, where I'd point out the animals to her. Got some weird British alarmed looks that time I pointed out of the window and loudly said "look! Moo cows!" when was on the train by myself.  
*sighs*   It had been a long, rough day at work. Once I got home I really had to pee, I pulled down my pants, sat and started peeing. I forgot a step. Pull down underwear. You read it right everyone, I pissed myself on the toilet.    EDIT - Fun fact, I never shared my embarrassing moment with my husband. I wanted to share some of the funny responses I got and finally just told him. He hasn't stopped laughing yet. (He was having a bad day so I'm glad I shared.) 
I was woken up at 3:30 in the morning for a random drug test for baseball last semester and after I pissed in the cup, I drank it.  Don't know why, but I did it. Luckily there was still enough in the cup to test.  
I often have the urge to say "ok, love you, bye", when ending a work call.   
I kissed a teacher on the cheek, she told someone "I can't hear you" while tapping her fingers on her cheek and I thought she wanted a kiss... 
Was typing up an essay, mind started spacing out, came back around and I had typed a page without any errors. Was strangely proud of myself 
I ordered a meatlong football from subway. I then got upset when the dude had no idea what I wanted.  Then we both laughed. 
 There is a walk in closet in the bathroom at my house. Once I picked up dirty clothes off the ground to put them in the clothes hamper (also in the bathroom) while also needing to go to the bathroom. As a result, I threw my clothes into the toilet and unzipped and almost pissed into my clothes hamper before I noticed. 
Poured orange juice instead of milk into my cereal, put the bowl of cereal into the fridge, walked back to the table with nothing wondering where the fuck I put my cereal. 
Put the dinner on and realised I had no carrots.   Decided to drive to the shop to get carrots - ended up driving to work.    Burnt the shit out of all the pots and had to buy new ones :( 
I put on a coat I hadn't worn in awhile and felt an Altoid in the pocket. Sweet!, loose mint. I popped it in my mouth and it was a watch battery. 
I was sitting at my father's wake and my brain was just completely shut off. I was sitting in between my girlfriend (at the time) and my sister. Everyone was extremely devastated by my fathers passing. My girlfriend was pretty torn up and I could hear her crying softly. Not really thinking I put my hand on her thigh and rubbed gently to comfort her.   I can see my sister turn to me in my peripheral. She whispered, "What the fuck are you doing? Snap out of it." My girlfriend begins to giggle as she sees me rubbing my sisters thigh. The giggles and the whisper finally make sense and I snap my hand back and laugh my ass off. We all had a pretty good laugh. Tears of sadness turn into tears of laughter. My sister and I are super close and she knew I meant to rub my girlfriend's thigh for comfort, not hers. Girlfriend knew I was fucking spaced in that moment.   (Obligatory....it was an innocent mistake, for all you pervs and down voters...)   Edited for clarification. 
Vigorously picking my nose while holding a cigarette and driving; crammed lit cigarette up my nose 
one time, one of the kids asked for... shit i don't even remember what. probably asked for a sandwich or something. on autopilot(i was tired and sick) i go into the kitchen, got a bowl out of the cabinet, sliced up a bunch of ham, put that in the bowl, poured in apple juice, stuck a slice of toast and a teabag on top and handed it to him with a steak knife.   kiddo was smart. he watched me do all that, took the bowl and knife, said 'thank you', put it on the table and went and got my wife and said 'daddy's super tired' and showed her what i'd done.   she put me to bed after that.  
When I was a kid, I was having breakfast, pancakes and apple juice.  Somehow, I poured myself a glass of maple syrup and took a slug, expecting apple juice.  Spit it across the room. 
Lately when im browsing internet i suddenly get an idea strike and i have to search for something,i open up a new tab and instantly forget what i wanted to search for,i get really mad close my eyes and try to figure out what i wanted and succeed like 2/10 times, most of times i just close the new tab thinking that im a young man with a mind of a old man with some brain damage. it hurts 
My wife and I had a really long day running all over the city with out daughter. This was three days after my second deployment where I had been gone for 12 months. We got in bed and I just sort of opened my laptop, put headphones on, and turned on the ol porn. I didn't understand why I had just gotten slapped until nearly 30 seconds after the fact. 
My Dad is a pilot and told me a story a few years back about meeting Robin Williams on one of his flights. He was actually commuting on a connect flight to Minneapolis from where he would be starting his trip from and happened to be sitting next to none other than Robin Williams' wife (Robin was sitting a few seats ahead of him). My dad got up a short while into the flight and asked him if he wanted to switch seats with him so that he could be with his wife. According to my dad, Robin Williams responded with a friendly smile and said "no it's okay I feel a bit like wandering around right now anyway." He got up shook my dad's hand and then proceeded to go say hey to other passengers for a bit. My dad said he was one of the friendliest guys he had ever met.  
"Never pick a fight with an ugly person. They don't have anything to lose."  ~Robin Williams  Out of the tens of thousands of hilarious things he said, this one always made me laugh the loudest for some reason. RIP, funny man. The world is a lesser place because you're no longer in it. :( 
When I was maybe 10 years old, I was in the lobby of a hotel in Baltimore and my dad tapped me on the shoulder and pointed to a guy standing in line. I turned and saw a short, hairy guy with a big pack pack. When I realized who it was, I let out a gasp and made eye contact with Robin Williams. He then looked back at me and let out a gasp of his own. Small, insignificant story, but it makes me laugh thinking back to that.  
I've always heard people talking about how a certain celebrity death really hurt them, and I couldn't honestly understand it. I had never really looked up to or had been effected by someone I never even met before. Now I know. This death hit me like a ton if bricks. I am at a loss of words truly. All I can say is I truly will miss this man and everything he has done.  
"If you're that depressed, reach out to someone. And remember, suicide is a permanent solution, to a temporary problem." -Robin Williams So sad :( 
Finally, the megathread is upon us. Does anyone have any favorite quotes? I like "You're only given one little spark of madness. You mustn't lose it."  
For every person who is saddened by this I feel Robin Williams did his job on earth. If you have the feels right now then he positively affected your life and he'd be happy he did. Mission complete. RIP 
Just goes to show even the most happy, upbeat, and funny people can suffer from severe debilitating depression. He spent his entire life making other people happy. He will be sorely missed.   E: Just wanted to add that I'm reading all of your replies and if anyone needs to talk, or perhaps let some of their burden go, my inbox is 100% open.   
I know this'll probably be buried, but I figured I write it anyway. I met Robin Williams a couple years back when I was in a Hostpital. It wasn't anything life-threatening, but I was prepped to go into surgery later that day. Some of the other kids and I were told that "a surprise celebrity" was coming to visit us, and we would get to spend the morning with them.   I was shocked and so freaking happy when I saw Robin Williams walk into the room. I had to wait 20 minutes before I could talk to him (we were in a circle, and each person got to ask him questions), but the wait was totally worth it. I can't remember the actual questions I asked (I had a lot of drugs in my system at the time), but I do remember him patiently listening to everything I had to say. At that point in my life, not many people had given me the same  courtesy.   He was, and still is, one of the greatest people I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. 
Goodbye, Robin Williams. You will be missed.   Why did he have to go? :( 
**Here's my personal Robin Williams story.**  I live in the Wood River Valley (aka Sun Valley, Idaho). And he's a very frequent visitor here. Meet him a couple of times.  Once was out hiking with a some friends when we decide to stop for lunch. As we're eating a small group of mtn bikers goes past and one of them has his shirt off and holy shit is he hirsute!  I've always had issues with impulse control and blurt out, *Hey check it out, it's a bear on a bike!*  It was Robin Williams.   He heard me and stopped cause he was laughing so much. His group stayed for a bit as we talked about the trail conditions and whatnot. Really nice, decent and obviously funny human being.  The world will be less humorous with him gone..... 
His portrayal of Patch Adams inspired me in my medical career.  How did he inspire you? 
How can we as a group rally to support the people we already love?  Will they speak out and accept the love that we have to give?  I just wish I could hug him and say everything will be all right...last week...  
He's not dead, he's only wandering the forests of Jumanji waiting for his time to return and take us away from the sadness and evil in the world.  
"I heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed, life is harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in threatening world. Doctor says, "Treatment is simple. The great clown Pagliacci is in town. Go see him. That should pick you up." Man bursts into tears."But doctor" He says, "I am Pagliacci." Good joke. Everybody laugh. Roll on snare drum. Curtains."  RIP Mr. Williams 
"Reality is just a crutch for people who can't cope with drugs." Robbin Williams 
I normally don't care about this sort of thing, people I've never met dying. This and Steve Irwin though really hit me in the feels.  
Who could play Robin Williams in the inevitable biopic? 
Any Robin Williams stories from people who met him? 
Not my story, but my brothers.  He lost his wallet and was retracing his steps looking for it. A homeless man approached him at a coffee shop and said to him   "Don't worry. It's in the bathroom sink. Your wallet is in your bathroom sink"  Later that night he did indeed find his wallet at home in the bathroom sink.   A few days later, he saw the same homeless man and thanked him for his help. The guy became really irritated and told my brother he had never seen him before.  Could have been a lucky guess, but I think Magical Bum makes for a better story.  
I've had glasses since the third grade. I was playing tackle football with friends after school (I wasn't wearing glasses), tackled one of my friends, really big collision, for a second I regained full eyesight...then I blinked and it was gone again. 
When I was about 10 years old I saw my old dog catch a crow out of the air then just gently release it.  
My dad swears he once saw two cats, a raccoon and a skunk all meet up in the middle of the street at night.  
When I was about 10 they started putting missing children on milk cartons. Every morning for a while I was looking at this boy's face on the side of the milk while I would eat my cereal. Then one day a car went down my street while I was playing outside, and there was a boy in the back seat with his face up close to the window looking out. I'm 99% sure it was the boy from the milk carton. I told my parents but they didn't believe me. 
I was at the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago.  I walked up to the cuttlefish tank, and for some reason all 20 or so of the cuttlefish rushed over to me.  It was a big tank, maybe 10 feet long.  I walked the length of it, and they followed me.  I walked back, and they followed.  A few other people saw and tried it themselves.  But alas, the cuttlefish only had eyes for me.  My best guess as to the cause was that the guy who feeds them is my doppelganger.   
Ball lightning. It was right after a thunderstorm passed by.  I could see floating orbs in the sky. There were a couple of cars parked by an open field and people were watching this happen, so I parked and got out to join them.  We all sorta just looked on in silence until they winked out one by one. There was at least ten of them and they seemed to fly together in patterns. Sometimes they were fast, other times they slowed down or reversed direction. They seemed small, but I could tell this wasn't because they were far up in the sky. If I were to guess, they'd be about the size of a basketball, maybe a little larger.  The whole ordeal only lasted thirty minutes. We then all got in our cars and left. I tried taking pictures but it was dark and the lights were too faint to make out. I should recorded a video instead. I noticed someone was recording them at the scene so I had kinda hoped I'd see it online at some point. But it's been two years now so I guess not. 
A chameleon escaped from a bag when my friend was giving it to me and it leapt into a big pile of snow. I looked around for it for a while but couldn't find it so I gave up. Several weeks later the snow all melted and I was out there and found the lizard partially frozen to the ground. I peeled him off and put it in one of those little plastic tanks and sat it by the radiator in my house. Within an hour or two the lizard was hopping around the cage like nothing ever happened. It lived for several years after that, and was known to my friend and I as Jesus the resurrection lizard.  
I was snorkeling in Hawaii once, and I swear I saw something that looked like a clear chameleon, but as soon as I got close it buried itself in the sand. I still vividly remember discovering a new species.  
When I was around 10 years old I went down to a lake when I was on holiday. When I get down there I vividly remember a massive ball of lightning just hovering and then it struck the middle of the lake. I never ran so fast in my life back to the litte house we were staying in.  
I was out for a walk late one night. This was in rural Illinois, so there was nobody else out. I noticed from a distance that there where these squirrels just standing in the middle of the road. Thought to myself that this is strange. When I got closer I noticed there where three squirrels standing around a cat that was lying down. I thought for a minute the cat was dead, but when I got closer and walked passed them, the squirrels and cat followed me with their eyes, none of them moving a muscle. It was a look like, "Move it along nothing to see here."  Still to this day I think of how bizarre that was.  
As a child I touched some weird pest plant in our garden, I think it stung me. Then I saw everything in inverted colors for short time. And then back to normal. I was in such a shock, I couldn't explain it to my mom. I just went to her crying.  
When I was about 6, my entire family was helping to build my grandparents a new house. I was helping my dad move some really long 2x4s from the lumber pile when a mouse ran out from under the board I had moved (out in the middle of the woods, mice were no big deal to any of us.) I did a double take though because THE MOUSE WAS FREAKING BLUE. I don't mean the sun reflected off its fur and it had a blue sheen to it, I mean a brilliant, royal blue. He was running fast but I got my dad to notice it too and he agreed that the mouse *really was royal freaking blue*. We've told multiple people, my mom included, and no one believes us. But we know what we saw.  
My bathroom had a towel holder thing, which was a fastened bar parallel to the wall. It had started coming out of one of the holders and one day I accidentally pulled too hard on it. It came flying off and landed in a clatter, but I couldn't find it.  Mind you, this was a small bathroom, maybe fifteen feet by six feet in area and the counter and cabinets are seamlessly fastened to the wall. I checked in the bath, behind the toilet, under the towers -- nowhere.  To this day, I have no idea what the fuck happened to it. 
I once saw a man in an Abraham Lincoln costume complete with top hat running for what seemed like his life along the street. I slowed down and when he turned to look at me he was missing an eye. I drove off and of course no one believes me. 
I slipped on icy stairs last winter and swear I saw my own butt crack as I fell. No one believes me. 
When I was at my family's cabin when I was like, 10, and It was the middle of the night, but me and some of my friends were just dicking around outside. Then, I swear we saw a blue flame on the water. Not just a light, it was actually fire. 
My friend and I were watching basketball in the early days that Charles Barkley was a panelist. He was apologizing for calling a team "midgets" and saying that he now knew it was offensive. But as they were going to commercial, we both heard him say over a hot mic "Besides, they shouldn't hate me, they should hate God."  My friend and I were amazed, and convinced he would be fired. But not only did we never hear about it again, the clip doesn't even exist online anywhere. It's as though we had a double delusion.  
A fat squirrel in a tree threw a piece of fried chicken at me.  
When I was 5 I woke up from my sleep and saw a man sitting on the stairs watching me. I wasn't scared though. There was something tranquil about it. I just watched him and he watched me for what seemed like 10 minutes. Then all of a sudden he was gone. A few days later I found out my dad was killed in Europe. I live in Canada and my parents were seperated. There's pictures of me with him when I was just born but he left shortly after that.  To this day, that is the only memory that I have of my dad. A ghost watching over me.  I don't believe in ghosts but I know what I saw. I've never told anyone before except my mom.  
A monkey jumping from car to car on a busy street. I could probably draw a sketch of it even though this happened about 5 years ago. Definitely one of the most odd things I saw. Unfortunately everyone thinks I am telling a bad joke when I explain what I saw, or they just nod it off and continue not giving a fuck. 
One time when I was really young, maybe like 10 years old, I came home after school and was making myself a salami sandwich.  I pulled the bag of salami out and took out two slices. I smacked the two slices together, and suddenly they became one. I tried my hardest to separate them, but there was no seam or anything that I could split them up with. I even showed it to my mom but not a single person believed me when I told them. I had fused two pieces of salami together. 
I'm in line at a cafeteria.  The guy in front of me is holding a pudding cup.  Someone walking by stumbles and falls into pudding cup guy, knocking his pudding cup out of his hand.  While everyone is looking at stumbling guy, the pudding cup goes a good two feet straight up in the air.  Pudding cup guy is totally focused and at the last second turns and catches the pudding cup behind his back.  He looks at me, smiles and that was that.  No one else saw it. 
When I was about twelve, I was riding in the backseat of the family car. I looked over and the car next to me had three people sitting in the front (this was in the 1980s) and it was a man, woman and man. In that order. At the stop light, the woman leaned down and the two men leaned in and started making out.  This was the first time I had seen anything like this. I was so dumbfounded, I couldn't even tell my family.   
I saw a bunch of crows, around 20+, gather around in a circle. I was like wtf and took a closer look to see 3 other crows in the middle of the circle, all on their backs. And some crows from the circle would hop in and try to peck at the 3 crows, while they cawed and tried to defend themselves with their feet. I know crows are smart and all but didn't expect this level of social behavior. It went on for a while before a kid ran in and scattered them all.  
While I was playing poker with a few friends, I was dealing and somehow managed to deal a royal flush on the board, giving every person a royal flush. This was well into our game and the cards were definitely well shuffled, and don't forget I'd also placed the burn cards down. The odds of this are so astronomical that, apart from the friends I was playing with, no one would believe it happened and would assume I'm just a liar.  
Years ago, when my mom was pregnant with me she saw a monkey in the tree outside her house. She went to tell everyone but no one believed her, "Sure, pregnant lady."  But sure enough the news that night had a story about Zoo break out. 
I was at the airport and saw a businessman with a carry on wheely bag get off the escalator.   He turned the corner, broke into a sprint carrying the bag by it's small strap handle on top.   He swung the bag forward and let go of the strap handle. While it was in mid-air he grabbed the currently unextended extending handle, pressed the button and on the back swing extended the handle and landed it on its wheels and continued sprinting, all without breaking stride. 
When I was 5 I liked to mix various liquids... playing chemistry, I guess.  My grandma let me play with all her bathroom stuff.  I mixed her shampoos and creams and cleaning products, etc.  (I just realize now this might have been dangerous if I had mixed ammonia and bleach, for example). I swear I created a white liquid that produced a single black bubble that would come to the surface and pop at a regular interval.  No one believes me, or maybe no one cares.  I guess it's not that cool.  
It was like a moth or something that looked like it, was a good couple of feet long. It was dark ish, on a main road, saw a few normal moths fly past me and as I turned my head watching them fly past I swear I saw this giant goddamn moth sat in the road; it was in the darkness between some street lights and looks like it sort of flew off further into the dark.  Was a pretty bizarre experience tbh, not even like I was drunk or high or anything.  I'm wondering if I saw the *Moth*ership  Update: So by the replies I've received, it was either mothman, a rare/unusual 'giant moth' type that got suuuper lost, an owl or bat, or an actual honest to god borderline cryptid *Giant Moth*  Good to know that others have had similar experiences though! I'm not totally crazy after all 
I saw my neighbor walking down the road in a red party dress around 3am.  I wasn't fucked up or on anything.  He denies it and the rest of the neighborhood thinks I'm making it up.  I saw you Tim.  You and I both know. 
I was at my mom's side when she passed away.  I swear, seconds before she departed, I heard her and my grandmother (who had died in the 80s) behind me.  Mom said "I really look awful," and Grandma said "It's time to go."  I turned around but the sun was coming in through the window so a little bright.  It was at that very moment that mom passed away. 
I don't believe in Alien invaders. I'm sure there's life on other planets, seems ridiculous that we'd be completely alone, but I'd imagine you couldn't keep a visit from interplanetary species a secret.  That said, I swear to god I saw a tall thin, long armed, long legged thing walk from one wheat field across the road, in front of my car and over into the other. I thought my eyes were just playing tricks on me so I didn't say anything for a second but the. My friend in the seat next to me said '...wait... did you see something just now?.'  No idea what it was but I saw.... something. 
My memory of watching the Challenger explode is super vivid. I was in 5th grade, our teacher had been following the story for weeks. She had even applied to be chosen as the teacher on board. I remember they brought all the students down into the cafeteria and set up the tv for us to watch. And as it exploded, and the announcer fumbles around trying to figure out what to say, I look back to my teacher's face, and she is just stricken with shock. She has tears in her eyes, and at that moment I realized what happened. And that it could've been her on that shuttle.   Supposedly this memory could never have happened bc supposedly they didn't broadcast it live. But I would swear upon anything that it was and I experienced it just as I said here.  
A man dressed as a confederate soldier walking down my street as I was heading home from work. There was a school bus coming and he stopped on the other side of the road, as if to let the bus pass before crossing, and I stopped at the stop sign. We looked at each other, the bus passed, and then he was gone.  
While having a picnic at dusk by an airfield in San Antonio in 96 or 97, my girlfriend and I saw a space shuttle land and quickly get taken away with out anyone else around.   I was thinking the air traffic was pretty light and was bummed because normally there were a lot of of big air force transports that would land there, but this particular evening there was nada.   And then I saw something coming in very fast and very steep. I could tell it was a shuttle before it touched down.   It was an unidentified space craft... literally... it had no markings that I recall. It was met by one of those tow truck rigs and was taken immediately to a hanger. The doors were promptly closed.  No press. No nothing.   It wasn't until later I read about the CIA blue space program.  
Once when I was a teenager I was watching a movie by myself. The tv room then had two chairs separated by a couch. I was on the chair to the right, and at one point I laughed really hard at the movie. I heard someone else laugh and saw what seemed to be a girl my age double over in laughter in the other chair. The weird thing is it didn't startle me; it just felt nice to share laughter. Then I realized that I was alone in the whole house and the chair was empty. So I turned off the tv and went outside lol.  
When I was in the US Navy in the midish 2000's, I was in the Western Pacific doing a tour on the USS Kitty Hawk. I was on night shift at the time and it was about 2am and there was a storm way off on the horizon lighting up the skyline something fierce to the portside. I swear to this day that i saw something that had to be about the size of a large skyscraper breaking the water, silhouetted against the horizon.   I've heard stories from people that have seen similar things. Only people that have seen similar things have ever come close to believing me. I don't blame anyone for not believing me. It's haunted me for over a decade. And I'll probably never know what it was. I just know there's creepy fucking shit out there.  
Once woke up in the middle of the night to an "earthquake"  not uncommon where I live,  nothing huge but big enough.  I'm sitting there riding it out watching my cat freak out on my bed when I realized it wasn't stopping and getting more violent. Then I noticed only my bed was shaking the rest of my room wasn't. I remember doing everything I could to check if this was just a vivid dream or something like pinching myself and checking my phone and it all checked out.  Once things stopped I didn't wanna get off for fear something was gonna reach out from under my bed and eat me at this point so I waited for my cat ( my one and only witness) to go first before I sprinted to my parents room.   Still can't convince myself something logical happened, if I wasn't so calm at the beginning/ my cat wasn't there also freaking out i would have guessed I just hallucinated the whole thing and continued on with my life.  
I was watching a football game a couple of years ago, and in one of the shots where they panned over the crowd I saw a girl look straight at the camera and mouth my name. Scared the shit out of me, but when I rewinded it the seat was actually fucking empty. Maybe I just need to find someone to fill that seat. 
I was riding in the back seat of a friend's car one night. I looked over to the side of the road and saw a dog. It's body looked something like an English bulldog. As we got closer, I could see that it had a human face. That freaked me out a little bit.  
After my grandmother died, she left her rocking chair that she had rocked me to sleep in as a little boy. I kept it in my bedroom as a reminder of her.  Not long after she passed, I would wake up and see her quietly sitting in the rocker, smiling. We'd have a conversation, just as we did when she was alive.  This recurred regularly, night after night, with all sorts of discussions - until one night, when she "disappeared" from the rocking chair right before my eyes, never to return.  I can't prove any of it, of course. But *if* those nightly visitations were all dreams, they were hands down the most vivid series ever. The sad part is that after she stopped "appearing," that rocker seemed very empty - and I realized how much I missed her. 
One night I was sleeping at my grandparents place. I woke up around 3am needing to pee. I raised my head slightly and looked at the base of the mattress I was lying on and saw a gown just floating there near the wall at the height it would be if a person was wearing it. I froze for a couple of seconds before quickly rushing to get my phone to shine the light on it. By the time I did there was nothing there. Safe to say I was scared out of my mind when I finally worked up the courage to get up to pee.  
Growing up, we had a door in the lounge with that glass in that distorts whatever is behind it. This looked into the hallway where the stairs were.   My family and cat were in the lounge, leaving the rest of the house empty, but we all saw someone walk down the stairs, but no noise. (We had no carpet on the stairs, just wooden steps and they were creaky as hell).   So weird.  
When my Grandfather died (god bless his soul) my 12 year old self was quite upset.  I asked my dad for two dimes, I know it's odd. I put one in his breast coat pocket and held one myself. Years later my whole family has been finding dimes everywhere in random spots. They attributed this to "Grandpa looking over us" kind of turned into a thing. On that token, my dad forgot about the double dime I requested at gramps funeral, I brought up what happened at family dinner recently and they think I made it up. I hope they have reddit.  
Snoop Dogg on Chatroulette. It was only for a second but I'm convinced it was him. 
I'd wish that for the next week, the days are 25 hours long so I can procrastinate just a little bit longer. 
To instantly become bilingual, but only in a fictional language,  like Dothraki or the black speech of Mordor.  
He could clean my house, he could do a kind of shitty job too.  
I get to trade in my car any time I want at no cost to me.  But I can only ever get a 1986 Datsun. 
That my fingernails and toenails will stop growing and stay at the appropriate length forever. 
I would wish that every time someone around me said they lost something, I would instantly find it but I'd have to keep it for myself.  It would be nice because I'd get all this new stuff but shitty because I could never use the new things around anyone since they would probably think I stole it.  
Can I get the ass and back hair to move back up to the top of my head where it used to be? 
I can toast bread with my mind, but only a whole loaf at a time.   I saw that somewhere once years ago and it still makes me laugh.  
The ability to throw my farts like a ventriloquist.   
Be able to leave the house without forgetting something, especially that one specific thing you needed for work that you realize you forgot halfway to the office and have to decide to either go without or turn back and end up being late! 
You know when you're trying to put a fitted sheet on your mattress, but you can't seem to get one side to stay down and you think to yourself, "Man, if only I had someone here that could hold down one side of this fitted sheet while I'm putting it on my mattress?"  I'd ask for a blowjob. 
$500, won't make shit of a difference but I'll have $500.  
I want to increase my likelihood of finding spare change on the ground by 500% 
My wish; if I get drunk with someone who speaks a different first language, then for the duration of said drunkeness, I get the ability to speak that language as well as they can. My English skills also change to match my drinking colleague's.  Basically, it would be useless for a job or anything like that, but it would lead to fun. 
Every time I toss something at a garbage can from this day forward it goes in. Every fucking time.   No look toss? In.   Behind the back toss? In.   From across the room? You know it's in.  
$1000 in loose change.  Significantly more shitty than $1000 in cash or check form because I'll either have to roll it or pay the Coinstar fee, not enough money to alter the course of my life, but would definitely moderately improve my life in the immediate short term.  I would probably spend most of it on food, or forget to take it to the bank and let it sit around collecting dust. 
For the rest of my life, I never pull into a gas station on the wrong side. On my car, I know it's on the right. But sometimes I'm listening to the radio, or thinking about something, or just being fucking old and I pull into the wrong side. And I know on rentals or a buddy's car there's always an arrow on the gauge, but still, sometimes I'm jetlagged or distracted or shit and I pull into the wrong side.   I would like the shitty genie to grant me always pulling into the correct side at the petrol stop.  
I'd ask for my clothes to clean themselves every night, even if I'm sleeping in them.  I'd look like a cartoon character because I'd be wearing the same clothes for the rest of my life. 
I'd ask that every time I take a shit at work the larger stall is available so I can live like a king for 15 minutes out of the day.  
A slightly worse genie and so on until I get the worst genie you could get 
Everytime I sneeze, a random person in a 1 mile radius of me shits their pants. 
I'll wish that he curse those people who pissed me off that whenever they push or press a button, 75% of the time it wouldn't work. 
I'd wish the farmer behind our house would fix the flooding problem. The whole field drains onto our property. The head of the drainage board in our county is best friends with the farmer so nothing will get done so the back part of our property is useless.  
I'd probably just ask for a brand new backyard fence so I don't have to worry about my dogs getting out all the time.   By the way This is a really good question that should've been asked in peak hours because it probably won't get any traction now. 
If I complete the hardest or most time consuming assignment, all my other assignments are automatically completed. 
Not have to cleanup after a wank. Can be a real downer 
Could I get a magic carpet with a top speed of 10 mph 
Give me a million reddit karma. The points mean nothing.  
I would wish that every time someone sneezed it would be too loud and stuff would come out.  
About $8 for a Spicy Deluxe and fries at Chick fil a would be enough to keep me happy for a few hours... 
I wish for my cell phone to always be at 60% battery life.  
I'd like to not go to a stupid meeting I have to go to tomorrow. 
I was on Jerry Springer. The episode never aired but the entire thing was fake. They even asked me to find friends to complete the storyline of a double love triangle. Coolest part of it all was when they literally asked me if I wanted a fake doctors note or a fake death certificate made out in a fake family members name in order to get me out of work. They literally had a guy on staff whos only job was to get people out of work so they could attend filming. 
I was on set for a filming go Ghost Hunters in Buffalo. On the show, they are "investigating" an upper level of the Buffalo Central Terminal when they hear a "disembodied" voice say "Get out!"  It was the property manager on a lower level yelling at some homeless people to clear out. Everyone knew it was him, but it somehow made it in the show as an "unexplained" event. 
While at a bar in NYC, someone approached my dad and his buddy asking if they wanted to be on a gourmet cooking show. Naturally, they agreed and asked if I (14 y/o at the time) could join. The promoter said of course, gave them the location, and told them to tell me not to eat a big lunch as this would be a large multi-course meal at an upscale restaurant.   I skipped lunch that day after a rough lunchtime soccer match, and left school early to meet my father and his friend. We arrived in a strange part of Manhattan -- near the Hudson, in a rather dead part of the city. We got a call from the producer saying "sorry man! Wrong location! We're sending a car to pick you up immediately".   We hopped into a taxi and... BOOM, "you're on cash cab!" the bald headed host declared as lights flashed above our heads.   So: we lost, got kicked out in Chelsea, and ended up spending our own money on food and a taxi home.   Very upsetting :( 
I was on "this morning" when I was about 7 and they did a big makeover for me and my siblings. The premise they created was that we were a nightmare and my poor mum  just  wanted  us to look smart for an upcoming christening. The main part I remember was them telling us to jump in the mud and shout no when our mum asked us to stop. Normally we wouldn't have dared so I remember that being fun! Oh and my sister ruined her hair three times before going on stage so they made us hold her hands so she couldn't touch it.  
In Holland there was a Dutch version of pimp my ride, a player of a football team we played against had his car ''pimped'' the car didnt even make it home, he had to call the car repair service on his way back from the studio... 
My cousin was involved in filming for the bachelor (not a contestant) and said they film many scenes in several different ways.   For example they might film them cuddling while walking and then walking while looking annoyed and so on.   Not that fake but yeah...  
My mate was on "tattoo fixers" if you don't know what it is, basically they get people in with tattoos they regret and make a design they don't tell them about, tattoo it on and cover the old one up and "surprise" them at the end. He filmed the "big surprise reveal" like 5 times because he wasn't surprised enough.  
My sister's friend's family was on House Hunters several years ago, and everything about it was staged. They had already decided on the house before the show even started filming, and other other two "options" that the couple was "considering" were found afterwards. They filmed a bunch of fake conversations between the family members to make it seem like they were still making up their minds. The thing is, this was a Latino family, and every member struggled heavily with English. The conversation scenes were obviously forced, as these people were just stumbling their way through scripted English sentences and it was obvious that they would have been having the conversation in Spanish if they were on their own. The issue was so bad that I'm surprised they even aired the episode.  
I have several friends that were on the first season of Moonshiner (discovery channel). It is totally fake. I mean, they do make moonshine, but what you see on the show is not what it's like in real life. Most of them are licensed to sell alcohol, and do sell it locally at the package stores, the others only make a little to have for themselves and a few friends (more to keep up a family tradition than anything else). But the producers had them set up stills in the woods, and even told them what to wear to make it look more "back woods, redneck, good ol'boys" than anybody in this area has looked in 50 years. Most of us sat there , with the guys that were being filmed, watching the episodes and laughing at all the people that probably think this stuff is real, while drinking store bought beer. The hard stuff is only for rare occasions*, it'll rot your gut if you drink it all the time.   *Rare occasions = Saturday nights 
When my wife and I were looking to buy a home in Michigan, our agent told us we had the opportunity to be on House Hunters if we wanted to. We talked to some person from the show, and they told us the basic process: we'd buy whatever home we wanted, then they would film us there before we moved in, as though we were just looking at the place as well as looking at two other "prospective" places that they had selected. Then we'd ultimately "choose" the house we'd already bought and live happily ever after.   We watched a few episode (or I did, my wife already liked the show) and I convinced my wife of how stupid they would likely make us look, so we passed.  
I was on a European version of "Survivor" where we went to an island and had to survive for 2 weeks. Whatever was seen on camera was what actually happening.   The only fake thing is that we got some food to maintain a somewhat healthy diet. 
My younger brother was a side character on a show about a family that raised a rare breed of pigs, since he was friends with the family. It was a lot of bullshit. My brother grew up in town and literally had never worked on a farm before shooting, and was introduced as someone who helped out a lot. They let one of the pigs out on purpose to catch it while being filmed, and the one that "escaped" used a fake name that sounded better. He said most of what happened was done for the cameras, and they had another weird side character the next episode that was a "gun nut". I'm pretty sure the only thing that was real were their names. 
My uncle was on Pawn Stars attempting to sell something. The item wasn't even his. He knew a guy who worked on the show. 
Worked on love it or list it. The reactions at the time of the reveal of the house were meant to be real and they actually sign a contract saying they won't go in the house before renovations are complete. 99% of the work isn't done by the people shown doing the work on tv. It's done by subcontractors. The entire staff works until 1 or 2 am the night before filming to get the house ready. Most of the stuff they put in for design purposes was taken back after the shoot because it wasn't part of the homeowners budget. We got blacklisted from several stores because we would buy thousands of dollars of stuff and take it back after we shot.  
My brother was on Xfactor UK. There are several rounds before the televised rounds, so all those rubbish acts you see on TV have been picked by producers to go through.  I've also been in the audience of The Voice and Xfactor and they make you do loads of fake cheering, dancing and clapping before the show starts so they can cut it in to the actual show. 90% of the cheering you see/hear on the televised shows have been added in post production. 
I was on a TV show in the UK called 'Bargain Hunt'. I went on it for a bit of a drunken dare and never expected to get past the online application form but after a phone interview and a 'Bargain Hunt' try out day we got on (we as in me and my workmate - I asked workmate as he was going through a crappy time). It was shot over 2 days, day one we had 1 hour to choose the 3 antiques to sell and day 2 was the auction day (where we sell chosen items). The only 'fake bit' about it was that we had an hour to choose our 3 items, but we actually spread this over 5 hours as we had to film, get sound right, get lighting right etc... and as the TV crew are sorting out lighting and stuff me and friend would keep on looking around the antique house for other objects to buy. 
A guy did an AMA about being on Pimp My Ride. Everything done to the car was cosmetic. I believe his car didn't run before the show and didn't run after. Basically, a polished turd.  
I had a cousin on the new Chris Hansen. I wish that was fake, it's not :/ 
Never been to the Pawn Stars store but one of my customers told be about going there.  This must have been 4 years ago, they said they had to wait in line to go into the store, and they all pitched in $100 to have Chumlee come out from the back room. 
A family aquantience had a house built for their disabled adopted kids from Extreme Home Makeover. I think Ty was a dick, but they were just so grateful to have the house that they didn't dwell on the negative aspects 
Obligatory not me but my cousin: She was on Hell's Kitchen and said that they would film for over 10 hours on a day, then would go to sleep around 11pm only to get woken up at 2am to film again to make them more irritable. The producers would purposely bring up topics to create drama within the chefs. They re-tapped when they answered the door in the beginning a couple times to make them seem "more surprised." They portrayed my cousin as the "classic hot blonde". It was certainly more of a reality TV show then a cooking show... 
Had a friend on an MTV show where one person goes on a date with two different people at the same time and they try and create conflict between the two daters and make them fight for the one person. He said that it took forever to shoot because they were told to "be themselves" but they both absolutely hated the girl and kept making fun of her so there was very little conflict so they finally had to script things in for them to say. My friend "won" the "Real date" with the girl and she did give him her number but he said no thanks and went and got drunk with the other guy where they continued just making jokes about the lady.  
A husband and wife that I know, who that run a historic park in Kansas, had the "Diggers" TV show come to their park and film a show. They said they spent a few hours doing some shots for the TV show, then broke out the rest of the team and did an actual archeological survey. They didn't expect them to find much since the site had been picked over for decades, but they ended up finding quite a lot of artifacts. 
I went into the Pawn Stars shop when I was in Las Vegas. They have a line on the side walk to get in, bouncers at the door, and none of the cast in the store.  The place is pretty much packed all the time, so my guess is that if someone brings an really interesting item in, then employees have them come back in a week and clear out the store for filming. Either that, or none of the items are actually from real customers. 
I had a friend who auditioned for The Voice on the second season I think? He has a beautiful voice but was told his "look" wasn't right for the show. Always thought that was pretty stupid. 
Has anyone been on Impractical Jokers? How 'real' is it? Especially in the later seasons - since theyve become quite popular dont people recognise them on the street while they are doing various challenges?  
I wonder if supernanny is fake? I know kids are good at acting but still... 
Does anyone have an experience on the show Naked and Afraid? Something tells me that show is bs 
Step 1 - Pretend you are yawning Step 2 - Arm around her shoulders Step 3 - Please let me know, I never have gotten this far

This has gotta be the best derailment on reddit in a while. 
It's hard to distinguish between who's kidding and who can't read  
Just saw another post that OP commented on and you guys followed him to tell him, "Not movies." God I love Reddit. 
OP not realizing that a good make out movie *is* a good make out move. 
You're six comments in, I'd say it's a thread about makeout movies. 
I got really confused reading the comment section until I reread your title. lol   Also, Alien. Not like the movie - what you do is you grab her head, stick your tongue down her throat and put your babies in her. 
Jesus Christ, I can't be the only one who read the question correctly on my first try, and got extremely confused by the rest of the thread. 
In highschool my girlfriend and I would always make out to The Godfather part 2. To this day I still haven't seen the full movie, and can't watch it without getting turned on. 
1. Cut a hole in a box. 2. Put your junk in that box. 3. Make her open the box. And that's the way you do it. 
I'll give you a real comment. Bite their lower lip gently when you go to open your mouths. Also, move your hands all around their body, rub their back, stroke their thigh, grab a handful of hair. Good stuff 
First of all Rat, you never let on how much you like a girl. "Oh, Debbie. Hi." Two, you always call the shots. "Kiss me. You won't regret it." Now three, act like wherever you are, that's the place to be. "Isn't this great?" Four, when ordering food, you find out what she wants, then order for the both of you. It's a classy move. "Now, the lady will have the linguini and white clam sauce, and a Coke with no ice." And five, now this is the most important, Rat. When it comes down to making out, whenever possible, put on side one of Led Zeppelin IV. 
People just love movies man. But I found that killing that awkward silence the moment before by just announcing that you're going in for the kiss works well. Saying it right comes off as confident 
breath in ear and kiss on the lobes. then progress to labia, while watching that eternal sunshine whatever movie with Jim Carey I think.  
I got so drunk, that about an hour after the new year I jumped off the balcony, fell to another party and stayed there for a few hours before realising I don't know anyone. 
Had to convince my friend not to jump in the pool because he thought "This water is 2016 water, I gotta jump before it becomes 2017 water!"  It wasn't even a pool party. 
clapping to the beat of a song, a drunk man from holland comes up to me and says I have great, powerful claps and we should clap our hands together in the form of a high five 
ER Nurse.  Guy came in complaining of scrotal pain. Stated he was at home, in his living room, high on coke and quite drunk, sitting on a bicycle when he slipped and caught his marble purse on the sharp pedal. He felt wetness and assuming it was blood wrapped his manhood in TP and ran to the ER. He got back to my room and finally found the courage to check the damage himself. Noticed it was just urine and he had peed his pants. Ran straight back out into the night without another word.  Happy new year central Ohio.  
This lady was much drunker than everyone thought and no one realized until around 12:10am when her husband tried to get her to leave and she grabbed him by the throat and push him down some stairs. He got up, dusted himself off, and calmly walked out the front door. She attempted to sober up in the dining room while someone downloaded uber to her phone so she could get home.  I felt bad for the guy, but secretly I was so happy to see he said F This and bounced completely.  
My friend started belting out the theme tune to an old British kids show called "poddington peas". Then he started crying, and said "when I was a kid there was an episode, about a fucking pea who was too fat to get out of his house - all the other peas tried to help him, but they couldn't get him out - I remember identifying with that pea - that pea was me!" He cheered up once we bought him a kebab 
I ate a 8 piece family bucket of fried chicken and chugged a few beers. While walking home I  vomited in the middle of the sidewalk and basically laid down on top of a bush to recover. Some guy with his lady walked past and when he saw the scene I just heard him say "Jesus Fuck".  
"STOP TELLING ME WHAT TO DO, I HAVE NEVER DIED BEFORE." a  friend who got kicked out of 2 clubs and wanted to keep drinking and partying.  
We asked our friend how drunk he was, he responded, "twice." 
On our way home after the party we got pulled over by a cop for taking too wide of a turn. It was raining pretty hard and our DD wasn't super familiar with the area. This is when the drunk asshole laying across the back seats starts panicking and screaming, saying he knows we are getting pulled over because he wasn't wearing a seatbelt.   Long story short cops don't appreciate it when they can tell someone's freaking out in the back of a car they're walking up to. Luckily he was a cool guy, ended up giving our DD a sobriety check and sending us on our way. We apologized for the actions of drunk people but it was pretty late and the cop just seemed glad we had a sober DD. But I don't recommend reaching out through another persons window to try to grab at a cop, even if you're just trying to get out a drunken apology. 
Was on the beach and this guy couldn't find anywhere to hide his bag so he just tossed it into the ocean and yelled "those fuckers can't steal my beer now!"  
I live in Texas and have a friend who moved here from Scotland a few years ago. Ever since she moved here she consistently has faked an "American" accent to fit in. Last night she got so drunk she forgot about her American accent and started calling everyone dirty sluts in the thickest Scottish accent for an hour or so. 
Went with a friend to his coworkers party. By the time the party was settling down his supervisors girlfriend was all over him and I mean like sitting on his lap, trying to get him to dance, kissing him on his cheek on her way out, etc. Meanwhile his supervisor was right there, kinda drunk, fairly embarrassed. She kept looking over to her boyfriend and saying things like "It's okay if I dance with him right, you don't care right? See he doesn't care." I felt so bad watching the whole thing unravel in front of my very own eyes. 
No Ubers were running late after the party ended so my two buddies caught a ride home with the Domino's delivery guy 
Shook up an open bottle of champagne and sprayed the ceiling, TV, and the host's girlfriend. Party fell apart shortly after. 
Had a small get together with friends, we were all getting stoned and playing the new VR I got for Christmas. One friend is playing and out of no where he starts falling, once he hits the ground he just lays there and says "so this is how it ends." 
I went cheering with the police and firemen just after twelve when they were putting out lit fires. 
A really drunk guy took the giant bowl of noodle salad and started trying to feed everyone with it. He would walk up to people and put a spoon in their mouth, it was pretty hilarious. He also tried selling his scarf because he owed  some guy money so he would just casually ask everyone if they wanted to buy his scarf.  
Drunk buddy tried to shoot a firework holding it in his mouth. He tightened it too hard, the firework never flew and exploded right on top of him. He ended up with the face completely black from the powder and some small burns on his face. Two policemen were next to us when this happend, they told him it was the most stupid things that they had seen this year, and yes we were still in 2016. 
A guy I'd never met named Tony kept asking all the female party goers if they knew what his name was spelled backwards. Then would slur out " y not" my wife thought it was funny and creepy at the same time.  
This one girl dropped a slice of pizza on the floor. She then proceeded to rinse it off in the sink, and then ate it... 
She made SO MANY new bffs. And tried to start an orgy 
I vomited so hard that I've burst/damaged a load of blood vessels in my face. Also the punchbag at the back of my mouth is swollen from the vomit so it feels like I have something stuck in my throat. I think I was probably the drunkest person at our party... 
Coming home from the party last night, we stopped for pizza. The super drunk guy in front of us told us he paid for our pizza. He made a big deal out of it, but then fumbled the machine and almost forgot his card and dropped his pizza box on the floor. We asked the cashier if he had actually paid for our pizza, and she double checked and said "he... didn't even pay for his own pizza." We paid for his pizza.  
He is 17. He tried to kiss my friends drunk Mom. In front of the buzzed dad.  he did it.  
A friend of mine was extremely drunk and saw this guy walking his dog. My friend started petting the dog and when the owner asked him to stop he started petting the man instead.  
After osu lost he was throwing stuff around on the front porch (it was his house). He chucked a big cooler into the air and it bounced at a really weird angle to land perfectly to cover up one of our friends heads. Everyone at the party and a bunch of passerby all collectively cheered 
I yelled merry christmas instead of happy new year :( 
My wife of 7 years around 2am drunkingly told me she loved me. I told her I loved her back and she responded with "you do?" As if I said it for the first time.  It's how she said it that was funny, almost like after all these years she never knew I loved her.  It's one of those you would need to be there for it moments.  
I think I was the drunkest person at the party.  Aaaaaaaaand I kissed my ex. Like a fucking moron. 
Dude asked a girl out for the evening. Kissed her at midnight and told her how happy he was she came out with him. Then extremely drunk him took a different girl -one he had just met- into the hotel bathroom, everyone noticed, and proceeded to do things with her that entirely pissed off first girl. When he came out of the bathroom, his first action was to hit on another girl (me).   Everyone was pissed at drunk dude for the amount of drama he brought to the night. And he wasn't hot, at all, just a douche. 
A lot of people don't realize this, but during wars and other significant military campaigns countries capture one another's records. Much of this tends to be banal bureaucratic stuff, but in the case of governments that are meticulous record keepers, there are sometimes volumes of damning information about war crimes.  The US National Archives has a Rebel Archives, captured from the CSA during the Civil War. It contains descriptions of the treatment of prisoners of war, some of which are gruesome.  Union medical officer logs are no better. 
Kamera aka Laboratory 12, the Soviet assassination laboratory. Reading through some of the ways they've killed you it becomes clear that the number one thing keeping most people safe is their mundanity.  Like the amount of people poisoned in broad daylight without them even realizing it is crazy, it's indefensible even if you knew it were coming.   One of the more interesting ones was a man who knew he was targeted so he holed himself up in a hotel with guards. The assassins sprayed a poisonous substance on the lamp shade with like a tube.  When the man turned his lamp on hours later the substance evaporated due to the heat and killed everyone in the room  Another was radioactive rat poison. The target went to the hospital knowing he had been poisoned, and he was treated for common rat poison, which is what he had been poisoned by. He then died as the symptoms of his radiation poisoning had been masked by the symptoms of the rat poisoning 
The audio recordings of the final sermon at Jonestown. I think the worst bit isn't the people cheering at the idea of their own deaths, it's the children crying as they're being force-fed the cyanide - and then the eerie silence when they stop crying. FBI declassified the tapes a while ago, they're easy to find online. Haunting stuff though, can't shake it from my brain.  ETA: People keep asking if it was classified. It was, by the FBI. They wouldn't release the tapes until they were officially declassified, despite petitions in court from surviving relatives etc., the info is all there if you wanna search for it.  
Aren't the JFK files suppose to be declassified this October?  
On January 3, 1961, a United States B-52 bomber went into a tailspin and broke up mid-air, accidentally dropping two Mark-39 hydrogen bombs over Goldsboro North Carolina. One of the bombs worked exactly as intended, it's parachute deployed and it's triggers activated, armed and ready to detonate on impact, 3 of the 4 safety switches failed, a single low-voltage switch prevented two 4 megaton nuclear explosions. 
You can read the speech that was written for the President, in the event that the Apollo 11 crew were stranded or died on the Moon. It's creepy and horrifying to think about. 
The remaining JFK assassination documents are going to be released to the public in October 2017 so that will be pretty crazy. 
Reading all of these posts, from around the world, I can't help but think about how the internet is going to change the way in which we all live/are governed. Twenty (hell ten) years ago, most of us would have never known the details behind these operations. We may not even know about them.   How will our ability to share previously unknown information change the way things happen in the future? Will we see less of these horrible undercover things, because those conducting know there is a good chance the rest of the world will find out? 
In the 1960's during the time period where the Canadian government was trying to wipe out aboriginal beliefs, they were abducting children from their homes and giving them up for adoption in the United States and other countries.   The Canadian government was also putting these children into Residential schools where they would beat and sexually assault these children to try and "beat the Indian" out of them. The government was very Anti-Aboriginal for a long time. 
Woah... It just occurred to me. Someone already thought of this:  Underwear - tighty whities.  
I don't have a contribution really, but this thread made me realize how silly and ridiculous the term "walkie talkie" is, and how we've all just kinda accepted it.   
All of this sounds like something Tom Haverford would say.  
AIDs would definitely have been called Booty Cooties 
You know those those thong type shoes you put on your feet when going to the beach? Haha, guy would probably call them something stupid like "Flip Flops" or something. Ha.  wait a minute.. 
Grand Theft Auto would be Stealy Wheely Auto-Mobiley. 
I'm a cobbler. I fix shoes, cut keys, engrave dog tags wedding rings, hell I'll engrave your poop if you want me to. I chose my vocation because, well they had a vacancy and I needed a job. But now I love it. 
Well, it's not exciting, but I'm an Audiologist and never had to worry about finding work. Also have worked in 3 countries (so far).  
Speech-Language Pathologist. I personally work in an elementary school, but in the field you can work with people from birth through old age with a HUGE variety of disorders: articulation, language, stroke, swallowing, autism, traumatic brain injury, fluency, voice, and lot more! Or you can go into research. It's such a huge field that you'll definitely find a niche you love, and speech pathologists are hard to find these days, so you'll definitely find a job.  
I own an ice cream shop and leave work everyday covered in chocolate and caramel. It's a pretty sweet job. 
I'm a CPA working in public practice at a regional firm. I do a little bit of everything on the client service side - audit, tax, process consulting, etc. Would love to chat.  
My title is Chief Metallurgist and Heat Treat Manager.   Big title and I get to do cool stuff and go to many cool places (China, South Korea, Poland, Scotland, Mexico, Canada, and many various USA states and cities).   Metallurgy is just solid chemistry really. Throw in heat treat and I get to manipulate materials to achieve the properties I want. Marry this with manufacturing and holy cow..... Job security. We are lacking in metallurgists due to outsourcing and lack of interest but it's actually really cool. I get to play with neat toys, solve everyone else's problems and essentially act as an alchemist.   I've never been without a job. I've always had a pay raise. Never settle for one company; move around; grow your salary.   I've jumped from automotive industry to industrial gearing and love it. Both are rewarding but both have pros and cons as any sector does.   I would HIGHLY recommend this avenue as a career. I don't see a lot of people going into this field.   AMA [serious only] 
I am a Registered Nurse.  I got into the field quite accidentally, when I started nannying for a family whose daughter had prematurity-related health problems and a feeding tube. I had to learn CPR, and give crushed medications, and it was a natural progression.  I have spent 2 years in Cardiac, 3 years in Postpartum(Mom/Baby) and a year in Labor&Delivery. It is beyond fantastic.

Any redditors with a career in politics... but not as a politician? I am 2 years into my BA in PoliSci and very interested in a career as a political analyst, but have yet to come across someone with inside experience. 
I'm a full time baseball umpire. I mostly work high school or adult league games. I'll sometimes work a semi-pro game. I got into it because I was able to start at 13 doing little league games and a paying job at 13 is something any kid will take. 
I'm a teacher. I don't have a traditional BS in education, so I was certified through an alternative program (TNTP, which is quite similar to Teach for America). I did have to have a Bachelor's to enroll in the program.  As for being a teacher, it's great! Yeah, I have all kids of bullshit to deal with (Common Core, administrative bullshit, etc), but it's an awesome way to work in my craft (music) and feel like I'm making a difference. And, while I'm busy when school is in session, I have time to freelance after school quite a bit.   If anyone wants advice on becoming a teacher, especially a music teacher or a career-switcher/nontraditionally certified teacher, please feel free to ask me!  
I am a network engineer for ATT mobility. I chose the mobility field because I saw handheld computing as a solid industry that isn't going anywhere.  
I make gaming-themed YouTube videos (mostly Minecraft) for a living, and do some speedrun livestreaming on the side.  I have an abnormal love for Minecraft which makes the job a pleasure most of the time, and I love the freedom of self-employment. However, it's more of a job than a lot of people would assume. Obviously it's not something easy to get into, but I can still answer some questions if people have them. 
I'm a psychology researcher with plans to study to become a therapist after my social psychology PhD. I also volunteer as a crisis counsellor and earn money on the side by working as a research assistant for a professor at my university. I get paid to learn about things I find fascinating and fucking love it. AMAA? 
Active duty Navy here.  I have training in a few different specialties, but my primary job is dental assisting. Didn't really choose it, the navy was just more or less trying to fill a quota when they stuck me with the job. Assisting dentists all day isn't half bad. It's the military aspect of it all that can be debilitating sometimes. But I've been a few places, seen some cool things, and met very awesome people. Plus, it's steady income. 
I thought job fairs were for companies looking to hire 
Use a piece of the answer in quotes as your query. 
Add "forum" to the search.   This will bring up people who are writing about the problem or issue you are searching for of just about any product out there. 
Putting a / between first and last name for a person will search for the names together  E.g, searching John Smith Podiatrist will give you podiatrists with both the names like John Wilson or Fred Smith,  Searching John/Smith will only bring up John Smiths  Hope this helps :)  
Three words: GOOGLE. ADVANCED. SEARCH.  You can find pages with an exact phrase, omit certain words, look up numbers, file types, and all on the domain it's on. Seriously, you don't even need to be good at phrasing things, just put in what you need and you'll probably end up finding it. 
Google stuff the old way. Search for the potential title of the article that would have the information you need, rather than just asking a question. Search for "Cherries bad for dogs" vs "can my dog eat cherries?"  Doing this helps you find the answers, not just more people with the same question. 
Add "Reddit" to the end of the search and there's most likely a thread about whatever you're looking for 
Key words only. Don't ask full questions, just enter the main words. Good tip is to keep it as concise as possible 
#1 Protip of all time * Dont be lazy, just do the search.  
I think this may be something more serious/different than what most the Redditors up til now have said!  The commanders of the special forces don't support those in the coup. Which means not all the military is joining in.  This could get much uglier than a "return to secularism" that many are advocating, especially if the military is split on its support. 
I don't know much about Turkish politics but apparently the Turkish military has a standing order to overthrow the government if it becomes too Islamic. 
Pro Tip: Don't trust partial video clips claiming one side wiping out another.  This PR tactic was used to great effect during the Libya civil war as well as during the Venezuela coup against Chavez with very little editing needed.  Took a long time to get uncut versions of videos that gave you context. 
I'm living in Ankara.1-2 hours ago i was looking the news for these incidents. And suddenly all mosques around neighbourhood(later i learnt that all Ankara) beginning to calling prayer . And these call is the same prayer when somebody dies. And After he finished calling prayer ,he began to read an anouncement which R.T.Erdogan invites puplic to the squares to stand out the Army. And while  anouncements and ezans were still made there was a huge exposion.It was far more scarier than a very good horror movie.And now; there are still F16's flying around and explosions occasionally.I wonder what kind of a Turkiye i will encounter tomorrow. It is so disturbing being in Ankara now.. 
"There are decades when nothing happens. There are weeks where decades happen"  -Vladimir Lenin 
Erdongen is so maniacally against protest but is urging people to protest this. What a hypocrite. 
I love CNN's live stream  "The coup is over"  "Soldiers entering CNN's studios in Turkey, it may not be that clear cut" 
Urges his supporters to go on the streets and fight, while he's safely on a plane and seeking asylum in Germany. Typical Erdogan. 
Welp, he's saying he's going to neuter the military.  Welcome to authoritarian goverment, Turkey. 
While principally not a fan of coup d'etats, it's been increasingly hard to not kinda want one in Turkey.   Though that feels awful to say.   I hope it'll pass as bloodless as possible and cool heads will soon prevail. 
Erdogan calling people to the streets, wow what an absolute mongoloid.   There are tanks and helicopters out there. The civilians are fine where they are. 
For those wishing Erdogan would be a little less authoritarian, I don't think this will end well. When Turkey gained its independence, Mustafa Ataturk viewed the military as a way to keep the politicians in check, and that seems to be the basis for what happened tonight. Some in the military must have felt that Erdogan was overstepping his bounds, becoming too authoritarian and too sectarian for what was demanded of him, and so in response, I expect Erdogan to come down with an iron fist and be even more authoritarian than ever.  
Has the Coup really been repelled or is it propaganda?  
Gulen this, Gulen that, cleanse this and that. Erdogan has become delusional, paranoid, and worst of all, dangerous. Turkey is in a 100x worse position now compared to 24 hours ago. 
Why does nearly every "Hey, Turkish guy from Istanbul here, coup failed!" comment come from new accounts?   
So Erdogan is denied re-entry at Istanbul, denied refuge in Germany, asks UK, then turns around and hovers south for a couple of hours, then zooms right into Istanbul in the face of a millitary coup and starts talking trash about the millitary?  Something doesn't add up 
This whole thing looks more and more like a deadly ruse. Erdogan is flying into the airport, how could he do that if he had any uncertainty on whether he'd be shot down or taken prisoner. He'll land and look like a fearless conquerer. This is too real to be a game, but it's too silly to not be one...  
Idk why people are saying this is over, it does not look that way. I am still seeing new video of gunfire and smoke coming from Ankara. 
* coup was staged at 22:00 pm. not 05:00 am while nobody could respond. * junta did not kill the internet. * junta was at max 2500 soldiers * majority of the armed forces watched as erdogan called people to streets against the junta. * erdogan's whereabouts were known but he wasn't touched. * none of the mp's got arrested. * a single unit of 8 soldiers with a chopper tried tv channel hopping in an effort to halt gov't propoganda while there are at least 50 national tv channels. * religious personel was waiting ready to call people to streets with prayers in their mosques.      does this smell cheesy or what? 
Sky News have just inadvertently aired civilians being gunned down on the bridge  
Is no one else actually looking at the live thread?  The coup is failing.  Everybody saying this is good, it isn't.  If this fails, Turkey will truly be fucked. 
So glad I was not born nor live in Middle Eastern countries. 
So ultimately, Erdogan won't mind the results of this night that much, huh? He's still in power, and he can use these events to effectively place himself into a position of full dictatorship, if he wasn't there already.   I imagine he'll go full Stalin on his army for a while.   I guess ultimately, everybody loses. The army loses, Turkey loses, the world loses. It would almost seem like this will end Turkey's long tradition of the military stepping in to fix when yet another government fucks over the country.  
This coup was so unorthodox and sloppily done you have to suspect Erdogan was behind it. Coups are bloodbaths. When the first waves of a few hundred people came out in to the streets, in a proper coup they'd all be slaughtered like lamb at your local butcher. Nobody else would step outside. The military would have known exactly where the president was and executed him on sight. The power companies siezed and utilities shut down. Supply chains run through the military to make the people dependent & subserviant to them. A coup doesn't need the entire military in reality, it just needs a few thousand well rehearshed elite and commited soldiers. This has the potential to happen in any country, America too. 
Askreddit again with the breaking news.  I guess /news is pretty much irrelevant now. 
Turkey is part of NATO, will this require other NATO countries to protect the 'current' government by taking actions against the military group? 
Turks have betrayed Ata Turk. Turks have backed an Islamic government over what the father of Turks had laid the ground works for.   Turks who have the most freedom out of any Muslim nation, have spoken loud and clear. They do not want secular governments anymore.  
97 - sarcastic, grungy, smoking more cigarettes, more clique-y and edgy   07 - petty, attention starved, overwhelmed, but much nicer   17 - under so many layers of irony and memes they dont even know who they are anymore or care. there's no point in being creative or devolving a personality, anything you could think of has already been done.   
Devices and helicopter parenting, which doesn't mean parents who are intensely concerned about their children's futures, but parents who never leave their damn kids alone. 
my dad taught middle school from 1968-2004, when he retired i asked him what changes he saw in students from the beginning of his teaching career to the end. he answered; "the kids never changed. a teenager is always a teenager. the parents however, changed dramatically.  they used to respect teachers and side with us in disciplinary matters, but now they think their kids are perfect and we are wrong.  glad i'm getting out before it gets worse." 
1997 - "You won't always have a calculator with you everywhere you go in life!"  2017 - "Before beginning the test, every student must disable the multi-function calculator that goes with them everywhere in life." 
Going to sound like an old man here, but when I was in high school in '97 we had a system where various teachers aides would photocopy all of the notes, answer keys, homeworks, etc. and put into an unused locker.  My whole class - even the future valedictorian - used that locker.  I'd imagine cheating efforts have advanced since then. 
The 2017 students don't seem so... Alive  **EDIT** This was a very shit Daft Punk joke that has now sparked debate about student life and satisfaction 
1997: Colorful hair and piercings   2007: no Colorful hair, lots of tattoos  2017: Colorful hair and tattoos  (I teach in college)  Oh the other difference was 1997: No one talked about being gay, 2007: students came out to me privately in my office, 2017: Students talk about being gay in class  
'97 - "Quit passing notes" '07 - "Quit texting" '17 - "Are you seriously watching Netflix right now?" 
Senior Pranks in 1997 were outlandish and acceptable. Senior Pranks in 2007 were less common and more basic. In 2017 Senior Pranks are illegal. 
'97 - (Little regard to terrorism) '07 - "Remember 9/11?" '17 - "Can you explain what 9/11 was? I wasn't born yet."  As a history teacher it's been interesting and difficult trying to instill the gravity of events to people who weren't even born at the time. I imagine it was a similarly strange scenario for teachers who taught during the attack on Pearl Harbor or the assassination of JFK. Strange to have major life events turn to just another historical story for kids within a few short years. At the same time, it gives me motivation to keep teaching with the same passion as if the events just happened so kids continue to understand its importance. 
Not exactly what you're looking for, but I have a story to share.  My father graduated high school in the mid 60s. After graduation, he and a few friends rented a sailboat and went from the Carolina coast to the bahamas. Young, free, healthy men spent a few days sailing, a week on the beach, and sailed home.   When I graduated, shortly after 9/11, I tried to repeat this trip with a few of my friends. No one would rent their sailboat to a couple 18 year olds. I guess societal trust has changed. We finally find one through a friend of my father and set sail for the bahamas. 2 days in and we see a helicopter,  then a coast Guard vessel, then we're boarded by us government guys with guns who say "alright, boys, what is it today, you moving guns or drugs?"  After searching the boat for hours (and it's a tiny boat) and finding nothing, we are let go, but instructed to turn around and sail home under threat of arrest if we continued south.  Yeah, so I guess things have changed a bit  
The whole be cool stay in school thing seemed to work I'm not a teacher but I used to volunteer as a middle school basketball coach. Kids take school more seriously than when I was a kid. Which is a great thing. 
I can't say with 100% confidence, but I bet kids weren't dabbing on teachers every day in 1997 & 2007.  
Mom is a teacher for generally 3 to 5 year olds, I got this:  Kids are certainly more abstract thinkers than they used to be. This was a project they did about foods starting with 'P'  97: Pineapple, Pickles. '07: Pecan, Peanut, Potatoes, Pears. '17: Purple lollipops, Pigs in a blanket, Pepperoni Pizza  They're more likely to tell stories and negotiate. One kid roughly explained the concept of double jeopardy--You can't get in trouble for the same thing twice--to a teacher he was having a conversation with. One kid said that he wasn't hitting his classmate, but "the wind pushed him hand when he was running".   If they have a question that you "can't" (sometimes this means "won't") answer, they'll ask you to use your phone or the computer to find the answer. It seems like they're aware that information is very close at hand and no question doesn't have an answer. They don't take "Just because" or "No reason" at face value anymore. 
Am I the only one who's currently a student and not relating to the descriptions the teachers are giving about today's students? Like my classmates are incredibly rude and lazy. Not diligent and polite.  
A lot of these are just things you'd ask a genie, not a foundation.  I'd have them pour water on my enemy's face 15 minutes after he falls asleep. Every time. 
Someone asks them a question any time they take a bite or sip of something. 
have to work for the make a curse foundation having to inflict all of this and ensure it all works 
As soon as they fall asleep at night they will be startled awake by a loud scream from inside their home and only they will be able to hear it.  
Get the biggest boner in the most awkward and humiliating situations and only get a half boner when they actually want one. 
All critical emails, mail and other indirect correspondence simply wouldn't reach their intended recipients. Mundane stuff would go through as usual though so rather than being able to identify the curse, the target would merely feel alone and ignored in the world. 
Their internet connection will disconnect at random. Also when they are going to watch a video, their connection will be slowed so the video stops to buffer often. 
Make everything in their life slightly too _____.  For example, maybe they'd go to a restaurant that's slightly too far away from their house, only to be waited by a slightly too chatty (and therefore slightly too slow) waitress. Their meal would be slightly too salty, or perhaps slightly too bland. It would cost slightly too much, and be slightly too cold. I think you get the idea (In fact, I think I explained slightly too much). 
Speaking as someone who has been battling a cold for a week, I would inflict the curse of the nose whistle. Once an hour, the noise would spontaneously resolve, only to start again 30 seconds later.  
Random people would come up to them while they are around coworkers/family/people who matter and say things like:   "Wasn't that orgy wild?  Hope to see you at the next one!"  "Hey, what is that herpes medicine that you use called?"  "Where are your seats for the Nickleback concert?"  
An itch down at the bone that moves through their body in varying intensities.  It can never be scratched properly and it can't be adjusted for. Just a constant itch ranging from inconvenience to straight up agony  
Replace all of their sugar with salt... I am a simple man   
Show them what would have happened if they said 'yes' all those years ago... 
I'd remove their brain / mouth filter. Everything they think will be spoken aloud.  
Every time they introduce themselves people mishear their name and call them a slightly wrong name. If they spell it out people add extra/incorrect vowels for no reason. 'Grant Smith' 'So that's Gareth Smythe, right?'  
I'd send a pack of fleas to everyone that stops in the middle of a corridor when they know there are other people walking through it 
every time they google somthing important, it rickrolls them and deletes browser history 
Every time they walk through a doorway, glitter falls on them.  
Profuse sweating from every single pore, especially when other people are looking at them. 
No matter what the temperature of the area they are sleeping in is, they will always be too hot. The pillow will never have a cold side either 
Every time they take their FIRST drink of a beverage it will be all dust in their mouth and they have to swallow it to be able to drink any liquid. If they keep spitting it out they will not get any liquid to quench the dryness in their mouth. Once they swallow the dust, the drink will work until it is empty. If they refill the drink, it again produces a mouthful of dust that needs to be swallowed first. 
To fall deeply in love with someone that won't love them back.  
Functioning hair follicles on the inside of their eyelids. 
They'd have a persistent, rock-hard erection that never goes away... until they try to relieve it.   They'd experience immediate flaccidity any time they try to have sex or masturbate, thus depriving them of any sexual pleasure or release.  As soon as they give up trying... BOOM! Boner time again. 
They can't round the tv volume up to multiples of 10 or 5  
B.O that they cannot wash or perfume away. They will stink everywhere they go. 
They miss anything they throw or drop, every time.   Even if all they do is drop something an inch above a table it flies to the edge and drops to the floor.  
Replace their IV drip with LSD, turn off the lights, play sounds of children crying.  
Every bowel movement should be excruciatingly painful, but should alternate between liquid stools and constipation.  
Opposite co-ordination. Every time they want to make a left turn whilst driving, they turn right. They wanna grab something on a shelf? Their arm moves down instead. They also read signs mirrored too, so if a sign says left to them, it means right. 
They are given a pie. They cannot eat anything else or drink anything other than water until the pie is completely eaten. They don't have to eat the pie in one sitting, but it is the only food they are allowed to eat until it is gone.  The pie is made from green (IE not ready to eat at all) strawberries and has no sugar added.  Also, if they don't finish the pie in one sitting, the people at Make-A-Curse will discreetly replace the pie with a more-complete pie every now and then, so the curse continues on forever. 
Spoilers. Just... spoilers. They will never enjoy an new movie ever again 
For them to suddenly have a undying fetish that would make normal relationships impossible. Like Paraphilic infantilism or Necrophelia etc 
10 thousand octopuses all over their house and car  
Insomnia, it would take them at least 2 hours to fall asleep. 
Since everyone else is doing curses instead of single acts I'll follow suit...   I'm a robotics guy. So my enemy would be too (if I have one?) whenever they supply voltage to something it's either 10 times more to 10 times less than they think it is.   The amount of magic blue smoke they will release...  
Pretending that I'm not driving a 2005 Toyota Corolla.  
Apparently doing crazy shit on ambien cause I don't remember being up at 8 am.... 
Pretending like my 1.0 VW polo is actually a 2.0 gti  
I have a lumpy cam so i have to bring the rpm's up so she won't stall when cold....sorry. 
I mean I didn't invest in this excessively loud exhaust system for no reason, amirite? 
Probably a mating call for other riced out 95 Civics. 
My car is just really loud when I start it.   And when I drive it.  And when it's in park.  It's loud all the time 
Trying to get my cheap motorcycle to start without it shitting out on me. Once I can rev it all the way I know it's safe to put in gear. 
lol 8am? I would LOVE it if people around here only did it at 8am. Try 2am at the 24-hour fitness across the street. Oh and thumping that bass, that has to be done too. God forbid these braindead morons realize they are in the middle of a residential area and people are trying to sleep. I have fantasies about tracking down where they live, waiting until they go to sleep, and waking their ass up with a bunch of stupid, meaningless noise. Or completely destroying their precious vehicle.  I really fucking hate you if you're one of these people. 
Sitting in a room with four kittens who are obsessed with the zipper on my hoodie. 
Carbureted engine.  Doesn't start easy in the cold, she'll stall.  You fancy pants fuel injection users always trying to keep a man down. 
I'm trying to get my truck started and it won't unless I pump extra gas into it 
What you're hearing is actually the sound of Mustangs at their local cars and coffee.  
I was dating this girl that was a little dysfunctional due to being sexually abused by her grandpa and nobody knew about it. I noticed some red flags and got her to open up and tell me about it. After we broke up, I told her mom she should stop inviting grandpa over to Thanksgiving dinners due to the sexual abuse. The mom called me a liar, but after asking the other daughters/cousins about it they confirmed it was true and that they had all been molested too.   After word got back to grandma, she said, "I'll take care of it".  Fast forward a week and grandpa is dead. Apparently Grandpa had a lot of serious medications he was taking and grandma messed with the dosage, which killed him. His death was ruled natural cause and nothing ever happened to grandma. 
Turned left into my sister's driveway at 3 am. A guy on a Harley was doing 60 mph in a 30, with no headlight. My half ton pickup left 4 feet of skid marks from being pushed back by the force. I still remember seeing him do mid air somersaults this was 1976 
I've posted  this before in more detail but the truncated version is when i was 16 years old I hit an 87 year old man after he ran stop sign.  I was with him holding his hand when he died on the sidewalk.  He had a heart attack.  They weren't able to determine if he had the heart attack before the accident which would explain why he blew through the stop sign or if he had one as a result.  His family was very gracious and I am very grateful for them.  His son called me the day after it happened and told me his mom had died 6 months prior, his dad had been very depressed and while they were sad he died this way they were happy to think their parents were reunited.   
When I was 18 I was working the night shift in a nursing home as an aid. Part of my job was to turn the paralyzed patients every two hours to make sure they didn't get bed sores etc. This one particular resident had late stage Parkinson's diseases and her muscles and joints were stiff and brittle and she was catatonic. As I was flipping her from one side to another, I applied light pressure to her leg to move her back a bit and this snapped her femur. Given her age and health the doctors decided that surgery was dangerous and she would have to heal on its own, if at all. Because of this we could no longer flip her, which resulted in bed sores. She eventually went septic from those bedsores and died of septic shock. I always felt so bad about that.  
7ish am on a Sunday morning. I'm heading to work in a small town at the age of 15 or 16. Come over a crest on a hill and have no time to react. T-bone someone making an illegal u-turn in a driveway. All I remember is veering off to the right and damaging someone's stone wall after the hit, crawling out of the wreckage out of breath and stumbling to see if the other person was okay. Their vehicle spun multiple times and landed in a ditch facing away, but driver side visible from where I originally was. Driver wasn't there..move along the vehicle and check the other side.. Driver is hanging out of the passenger side window with a steady stream of blood from their skull. Bottom line for me is that I ask and implore everyone, please use your seatbelt.. 
2 years ago.   My sister was working at a dealership. Her husband and I were spending the day together until it was time to pick up sis from work. He had been drinking tall-boys all day, so when it came time to get his gal I took the keys and said I'm driving. He was mad enough that he refused to go with me. When I came back with my sister he was no where to be found, but it was common for him to go on walks to calm himself down so we didn't think much of it. 8am the next morning, State Police were banging on the door. They told us he was struck and killed by a train while he was sleeping on the tracks. 
My wife and I were both very sick with the flu. My father watched our two small children and even come to sit with me in the hospital. The day after I got out of the hospital he got the flu and died a couple days later.   I still feel guilty knowing that he didn't have to sit with my children, or that he didn't have to sit by my bedside, but he did. It helps knowing that he loved me so much that he was willing to put his life at risk to be with me.   I just never imagined that the flu could have been so serious to hospitalized, much less kill someone. I hold myself responsible and I feel guilty for getting him sick.  
A guy attacked me at 3 a.m. while I was walking to work. I tried to choke him long enough to render him unconscious. And I did. He never woke up. He was a firefighter, a husband, and a father. I know it was self-defense. It still bothers me sometimes, nearly ten years later. 
I was gaming when one of my best friends messaged me asking to talk if I was free.  Since he usually asked this of me just to talk about random stuff, I didn't think too much of it and just planned to reply back to him after I was done with my gaming session.  A couple of hours later I finally replied back to him, but he didn't reply back which I thought was weird but was probably just him being busy.  He never replied again.  I found out the next day at school that he had committed suicide around the same time that I was gaming.  I can't help but think that I could've talked him out of it if I had replied to him immediately.  To this day I still feel guilty about it, and I've resolved to never let a friend down like that again.....too bad I didn't have that thinking sooner. 
When i was younger playing xbox whilst at my grandparents house i had left the room to go to the bathroom, leaving my wired controller on the floor. I suddenly hear a thud and decided to finish my business before seeing where it had came from.  Whilst cleaning up i heard a scream from my grandma and was told to stay in the bathroom. And so i did.  Found out that my grandfather had accidently stood on my controller and fell over the wire, cracking his skull open on the table and was announced dead at the scene when the ambulance arrived.  I am now extra cautious with where i leave items, encouraging my younger brother and sister to clear up their mess once theyre done.   
I was driving a semi a small car pulled in front of me and slammed their breaks i couldnt stop in time my truck wound up on top of their car i was the only survivor of the vehicles involved  
Loan officer for a local credit union.  I ordered a repo on a guy's car; totally justified.  A week later, he gets off at a bus stop about midnight, and starts walking home.  A car hits him, hit & run.  He's found literally dead in a ditch the next morning.  I didn't kill him, but if I hadn't ordered the repo, he wouldn't have died.   
I was working in a nursing home as a volunteer. He was a painter, he told me to bring him oil paints, canvas and thinner, and he would paint something for me.  The next week when I had to return I was excited to see what he'd painted, but he was no longer there. The nurses told me that "they" came to pick him up.  I think he drank the thinner at night. 
When I was 4 and visiting Japan, I opened back door of a car in Japan to the sidewalk but a motorcyclist driving in that space between the curb and road slammed into it. Blood everywhere. I don't remember the exact aftermath since I was so young, but everybody was screaming and I just sat there not understanding exactly what was happening until my mom ran off the scene and into the building in tears.   *Thanks for the kind words, everyone. I don't blame it on anyone, even myself, as it was just a really unfortunate circumstance. As for the thing regarding my parents as discussed below, don't worry about that either. They're out of my life, but honestly while I do believe my parents did some really crap shit to me, I don't wanna be angry at them. I'm here now and by myself, and I think the best course of action is just to put them and this ugly event out of my head.   Unless it's to tell you curious folks. Thanks for the kind words and reassurance :) 
So I'm a mental health worker who has recently had a patient kill them selves, they sadly aren't my first and won't be my last. I followed protocol and didn't do anything medically wrong but will always feel personally responsible for them. There were signs I missed, lies I believed, and things I do differently in hindsight. Some of the families put cases against the hospital but I've been cleared of any wrong doing. Unfortunately when you have the riskiest cases then you can't win all the time. That doesn't stop me feeling incredibly sad when it happens and imagine the family grieving for a lost son/brother/ father.  i will always remember their names and have planted a tree in each of their honour. I strive to become a better nurse each time 
I was driving my girlfriend and I back to town from a day by the water. We were on the highway and she leaned over to kiss me, next thing I knew we were going off the road and then the car was rolling. It just happened.. I had a few scrapes but her seatbelt wasn't on properly and she died there.. in my arms on the the side of the road. Never thought this could happen to me.  
When i was 4 Years old, my mother was roughly 3-4 months pregnant              one day I was supposedly crying and throwing a tantrum over a toy or something,my mother tried to comfort me by cradling me in her arms and take me to to my room which was up the stairs but i cried and kicked so much that she lost her balance and fell down the the stairs, i was unhurt and mother recovered without any lasting injuries    but my sibling died. 
I was a fairly new driver. I was sitting in the parking lot texting someone on my phone. It took a few seconds to send the message.  I pulled out of the parking lot and immediately came to a roundabout. It was a slow day, barely any cars around. A car pulled up moments after me, but since I beat him by a second or two, he had to wait while I went past him in the roundabout.  Nearly the second after I passed him, a big truck slammed into his rear end. And he was going fast. Real fast. Probably 45 to 50 mph.  They both died. The best they could figure, the elderly driver of the truck passed out for some reason.  If I had waited to text my friend until I got home, that man would still be alive. If I had waited for my friend to reply before leaving the parking lot, that man would be alive.  I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
Throwaway account.  5 years ago I was staying the night at my boyfriend's (we were both still living with our parents).  We started messing around, both getting really into it, as usual. He came once, and seemed to be breathing more heavily than usual, which I attributed to me (and felt good about it, naturally). He then suggested that we take a breather, but I was all worked up and insisted that we go again immediately.  During it, his breathing got heavier, and he collapsed. I panicked and called in his parents, and we rushed him to hospital. Turns out he had an undiagnosed heart condition. He didn't make it. The doctors all said that it was probably the sex that got his heart-rate too high, but that I shouldn't blame myself (yeah, right).  I don't think I'll ever get over it, honestly. If I hadn't pushed to go again, he'd probably still be here. 
Deployed in Afghanistan. Urban area.   I got into programming to kill the time. Had an Arduino set complete with everything I would need to make tons of little gadgets. Got pretty good at it too (going to school for it when I get out). When it came time to go home, I didn't have room to take the kit with me, so I threw it out. Keep in mind, locals work on this base, and in my time there, at least three had been kicked out for ties with the Taliban.   Within an hour of tossing the kit, it had been taken.   Didn't think anything of it, probably some other soldier thought it was cool and took it. Big base, anything could happen. About three weeks after we left, an IED went off outside the gate. No NATO casualties, but about 20 civilians died in the blast. EOD reported that it was a "strangely sophisticated" bomb. They used my kit.  My negligence gave them the means to kill 20 innocent people. I've never told anyone in the world about this, and it haunts me to this day.  
"I met someone and she opened my eyes," said my husband three weeks after our son was born. I'm still bleeding from that stab wound. 
A couple of years ago I got really really sick and moved back to my parents' house for a couple months. My roommate asked me if some friends of ours  (his very long-time friends) could stay in my room for a few days because they were temporarily homeless. They had like 4 kids and the kids had to stay somewhere else.  It was Christmastime and these people were pretty poor and weren't going to be able to afford presents for the kids. My parents were actually going to give them a couple hundred bucks to help with presents. I came back to the house a week or two after they came and stayed only to discover they had stolen my MacBook, another laptop, a kindle, a set of gaming headphones, and my external hard drive (like 15 years worth of pictures stored on there). They also stole my roommate's college ring. I'm still mad and it's going on three years later. You don't steal from friends. Especially ones who are saving your homeless necks.  
I was in a band with some friends in high school.  I wrote all the songs we played.  They kicked me out and said they didn't like my music anymore and wanted to go another direction.  I later found out they had booked a show and played my songs they said they hated.  I felt pretty crummy after hearing that. 
I invited all my high school "friends" to my birthday party and none of them showed up. Luckily I had my 2 close friends from outside of school show up and still have a good time. Went back to school that Monday and instead of sitting at their table I took a chance and sat with this girl I had a crush on, we dated throughout highschool and then some so it worked out. 
 Best friend of many years tried to break up me and my then- boyfriend by fabricating evidence he was cheating on me.  Never figured out if it was her being possessive of me or if she wanted to date him.      Edit - it has become apparent this wording was misleading and I apparently distressed some people.  Then- boyfriend because we've since gotten engaged,  not because we've since broken up.  Thank you to all the kind people out there congratulating :) 
Was friends with a guy since middle school. We were inseparable. I helped him with his depression, got him to move out of his parents house, supported him when he was emotionally wrecked, etc.   But the moment I lost my job and became depressed, he wasn't there for me. Stopped talking to me, hanging out with me, answering my messages. Asked him why he was ignoring me and he said I was being too sad.  
My sister had a destination wedding and I was one of the bridesmaid. So after a year of planning and saving up money (we live in North America and her wedding was in South America), I was super stoked for this new chapter in her life and a fun vacation too. So leading up to the days of the wedding, my sister was okay to me (just the usual way she is to me). Day of the wedding, her husband had to come to me and tell me that she doesn't want me to be her bridesmaid. Then two days after, I got kicked out of her husbands parents vacation home because 'they didn't want the situation to get worse between us'. Of course her husband had to tell me that too. Not once has she spoken to me about it, gave me no reasons whatsoever.. nothing. It's just funny because she's seven years older than me and always claims how mature and cool she is, yet she can't even talk to me and tell me what the hell happened.  
"I'm so sorry honey, I don't know who could be spreading those rumors. They're sick and they don't know you at all."  Rumors had been spread that I, an awkward nerdy girl who'd never done more than hold hands, was not only sleeping with the whooole school, male and female, but also that I was pregnant! Yay! News to me, right??   My best friends swore they'd defend me and when they found out who it was they'd make them regret it.  Then I went down to the lowest floor of the high school (foreshadowing much?) and walked up behind my best friend and noticed she was talking about... Me? About what a slut I am? That she'd never be friends with me? The girl she was talking to started frantically signaling to cut off her convo but GUEEESS WHAT too late.   I switched schools halfway through that year and never looked back. 
My best friend and my husband.  Married 7 years.    Refinanced dream home in October.   Booked 'bucket list' vacation two weeks later.    A week after THAT, he came home and told me we were getting a divorce.   He then walked out the door and never looked back.  No notice.   No, "honey, I am growing unhappy".    We never fought and I thought we had an awesome life.  But that wasnt the "stabbed in the back" part.     Look, people grow unhappy and get divorced.   Shit happens, right?  Except that besides blindsiding and abandoning me and our child,  he went around to all of our friends and family playing the victim of how he was unloved and unappreciated.    He also neglected to mention in his tale of woe about his side piece.  Would have taken a bullet for the man.    Didnt know he was holding the gun. 
2nd grade I had this crazy abusive teacher who would sharpen pencils to throw them at students and smack us on the head with textbooks. One day after talking to my parents about this issue they told me to run to the principle's office next time this happened. About 2 weeks later she got crazy because one kid fell asleep in class she started chunking pencils at us and one stuck me right in the shoulder (wasn't deep but it stuck) so I ran to the principle. Long story short they never believed me and she was able to keep her job. Worst part is the counselors would come down regularly and talk to us about this issue but didn't believe anybody in class since the teacher would suck up to them when they walked in.   I did find out though that a couple years later one kid's father was a FBI agent and truly wanted to investigate and set up a camera inside the classroom to record some evidence. She ended up serving some jail time after he went straight to court 
My little sister literally stabbed my back with a pencil when we were young, does that count?  
I just found out two of my closest friends have been cat-fishing me with pictures of an Israeli supermodel for the past couple weeks, so that was pretty cool of them.  
My friend of nearly 25 years happily ended our friendship over a few thousand bucks he owed me.   Hey Bill, if you are reading this, go sit on an AIDS needle.  
I learned my "friends" weren't actually my friends during an acid trip. I was already having a bad trip and they fucked me up even more by telling me things like how I would never be able to have a real relationship and that I'd fucked my brain up for life. Needless to say, I spent the next 20hrs trying to hold myself together while those thoughts kept racing through my mind. I'm still not me 
In college, I was involved with the theatre department. I had never gotten over this one ex of mine, and one of my closest friends broke up with his gf to get with the girl right when she and I started talking again. He then wrote a play about it, set it in my apartment, got my room mate (another extremely close friend) to direct it, and performed it in front of the entire department. The play included my family's personal history, drug use, conversion to a different religion, and entire pages of conversation we'd had in real life thrown word for word onto the page. When I said how shitty the whole situation was, the vast majority of my friends essentially gaslit me and acted like I was being unreasonable.  
My (ex) best friend of 5 years stole my boyfriend. She's gorgeous and lively, very outgoing. I'm a more than slightly chubby redhead who plays video games and reads all day.   We met through my BFF, he was tall and sort of decent looking, worked on a farm and seemed like a really good guy. I have a massive soft spot for farmers.    So, he and I hit it off and spend almost all of our free time together and were texting constantly when we weren't together. A few months later we get into an argument and he pretty much lays it out there, he had only been dating me so he could be close to my BFF. I was too fat for him, and he had been fucking her since pretty much right after we started dating.   Called BFF. She confirmed his story, and said she was only doing it because she knew he would hurt me and wanted to make him like her so she could hurt him back.   He was my first serious boyfriend in years, and I wouldn't even consider dating for nearly another year after that.  
Reading the first 10 answers made me realise I have good friends...  Thanks OP. 
I picked up the rocket launcher and my friend thought he should have it more, so he meleed me in the back and took it. Then proceeded to miss all his shots.  
I was playing risk and a bit into the game me and my friend kinda teamed up with me to take out someone else. After a While it was my friends again and he redeemed his cards to place twenty something troops on our border (He had Europe and some of Asia, I had Africa and South America) and attacked me. He kicked my ass 
Getting hacked. I work in IT, and have to convince at least one person every week that some tiny change or inconvenience on their company computer or phone does NOT mean you were hacked.   Forgetting your email password because you're too good to write it down does NOT mean you were hacked.   Receiving that spam email about penis enlargement does NOT mean you were hacked.   Skype cutting in and out during a conference call due to poor connection does NOT mean you were getting hacked.  Just be smart, and if you don't know what something is-- don't click on it. 
When something bad happens at work. Look, I get it, shit happens. Servers go down, bad code gets pushed, some moron allows log files to be written to backup server drives, whatever. But I swear to you, the minute something happens (trust me, the guys who need to work on it already know) one dude will come running in screaming his head off. "This is all fucked up we need it fixed NOW we can't do anything with this being down."   Okay, yeah. Look dude, chill the fuck out. We get it. We're working on it. It will be up when it's up. You freaking out and losing your shit and having a fit isn't going to make anything happen any sooner. Likely, it will make the situation worse. So just chill out. It takes a lot for me to get legitimately upset or angry, so maybe I'm biased, but I swear some people get off at the fact that they can act like children at work. Drives me insane. Get out of the office and go count to ten. 
Kids sports. I coached kids soccer for 7 year olds and there would be parents screaming at their kids during the game and you'd have to ask them to quiet down. It's just a game, people  
Gluten-free diets  Some people can't eat gluten.   Some people can, but mistakenly believe that avoiding it will help them lose weight.   The nice thing about the latter group is that restaurants are now more likely to provide gluten-free options for those who actually need them.  
Video games causing kids to become violent. It doesn't happen. Period. No research has ever concluded anything even close to that. In fact, some research actually suggests that kids playing video games is a good outlet for them, and opens all kinds of doors socially.   On a related note, parents who bitch about violent games for their kids. "GTA scared little Timmy so much I am calling for a boycott!"   Oh yeah? Well it's rated M for a reason you twat waffle, so maybe educate yourself before you buy your kid whatever game they fucking ask for! Good grief ignorant parents are the fucking worst.  
Nuclear reactors. They don't explode like a nuclear bomb. 
I don't know about everyone, but I wish the robin who spends 18 hours out of every day launching himself at my daughter's bedroom window, would calm the fuck down about his reflection and cut that shit out. 
Folks who get pissed at long lines at places you know are going to have a long line. Like the DMV, the Post Office, or Doctors office. You knew it was going to take awhile. Bring a fucking book or use that magical mobile device to entertain yourself silly! 
I am the most valuable part of my life. If the money is lost, the girl leaves, the house burns down..I am the one who can rebuild and re-accomplish it all. I've done it before when I was scared and new.  Also, exercise. Keep all your shit calm and collected.  
A lot of people in the film industry are sure getting their panties in a twist about Netflix 
What phone other people use.  Seriously, why do you even care?  Platform advocacy in general is just stupid.  Nintendo vs. Sega was a fun battle for middle school, but so many people just don't seem to grow out of it. 
Currently sitting in an airport waiting to board a flight, and every time there's been an announcement saying that our flight is going to be delayed a little longer, the lady in front of me yells at the flight attendants, from the comfort of her own seat....    Like I understand that you're frustrated about it but your yelling doesn't help the plane get to the gate faster!!! 
I used to referee kids basketball games from under 8s to under 16s quite a few years ago and my god some parents need to calm the fuck down   I've had parents abuse me for making calls they don't agree with, abuse their child for missing a shot or making a mistake, abuse other spectators who they don't agree with etc.   There's this one incident which sticks out in my mind, where a kid who was literally playing under 12s so he would have been 10 or 11 caused a turnover ending in an opposition goal and his father made the coach sub him off and then proceeded to scream at him, which ended up in the poor kid tearing up   Yes sport is competitive and its great to be passionate but when it's a kids game, some people just don't know where to draw the line. Calm the fuck down and enjoy the sport, you're there for your child to have fun and learn to work in a team, it's not an NBA competition    TL:DR parents need to calm the fuck down when it comes to their children playing sport  
Getting on a plane.   We've all bought tickets. We've all reserved seats. We're all getting on this plane (unless you're flying United - topical) so why queue or push or add to the already stressful experience of making it onto a flight on time by turning an otherwise civilised experience into some kind of aviation-based Hunger Games?!  
Well in Ireland we are having great weather , peaks for 22 degrees a day(very unusual for Ireland) All I see all day on social media is sun this and sun that. Irish people need to calm the fuck down. Or in Irish terms 'calm de feck down wouldya'  Edit - to avoid some peoples confusion , I am in fact Irish 
When the plane lands. Everybody stands up gets their luggage and stand still for 15 min whilst they deploy the stairs.   Whilst I chill and continue watching netflix downloads.   Also when "boarding the plane xyz" is called. Everybody crowds to it, and proceeding to wait 40 min or so in a line with hand luggage.   Whilst I chill and continue to watch Netflix downloads sitting down, 10ft away from the queue and being the last one.   CALM FOCK DOWN 
I'm an Android guy, an Android enthusiast if you will.. the whole debate about iPhone vs Android really needs to die. Both are good options and both have pros and cons. 
That Elvis person all the young kids are so into now. The way he moves his hips, that just shouldn't be shown on TV. It's obscene! 
Millennial's work ethic. I work with quite a few millenials and it seems to me the only reason they work less than baby boomers is because they use technology to their advantage. 
Avocado toast and $4 coffees. Apparently it's killing the American dream. 
Millennials.  I keep seeing articles about how they're unbelievably lazy and have a disproportionate sense of entitlement.     I'm sure *some* do, but that's not reason enough to get hysterical about the entire generation. 
Fidget spinners. People get so fucking angry over them it's incredible. Some guy the other day said a fidget spinners app was the downfall of society or something. 
"OMG, the world is violent compared to how it used to be."  Its always been violent. If anything, its less violent.   With that said, we should never settle for something we can improve. Let's keep working to make the world a better place, but maintain perspective while doing it. 
Hating stuff because it got popular.  "Twenty One Pilots is TERRIBLE! Emo trash!"  "The new Star Wars movie has NO REDEEMING QUALITIES! Sheep!"  "*insert video game here HAS THE WORST FANBASE! So cringe!"  We get it, you like being an isolated hipster who only enjoys fringe shit. Go back to your corner where nobody can hear you scoffing under your breath.  "Hipsters are the WORST, amiright!? Who do they think they are?" 
Call of Duty WWII having female characters in the French Resistance faction. It's not because of SJWs they added them, but because there were in fact women in the French Resistance  
Today is the last day for the Seniors at my high school and everyone is acting like all of these seniors are about to die and they will never be able to talk to them again. I just showed up to school 10 minutes ago and I have already seen more tears than the day after 2 girls committed suicide in the same week. 
Making every tragedy an opportunity for showing *just how much you care*.  Yes bombings are sad, yes ISIS are assholes, but putting a flag on your profile picture ain't gonna do shit, and doesn't make you a good person.  
The recent health craze going on.   Don't get me wrong, I'm all for healthier eating, getting more exercise and seeing a healthier population (especially with kids), but almost everything is okay in moderation. A chocolate brownie doesn't need to be substituted for a dark cocoa powdered, spinach-banana, flax seed "brownie." 
A master chef told me this in culinary school: "you can always stop cooking." Take it off the burner or out of the oven if you need to. Surprisingly helpful tip 
Learn cooking techniques instead of recipes.  Don't approach recipes like they're magic spells in the Harry Potter universe. If you wiggle your nose wrong or put in a spec to much of some seasoning you're not going to end up with a completely different dish.  Alton Brown does an incredible job of teaching a cooking technique and then showing you a recipe that applies that technique. If you learn a process instead of a rote recipe you will know how to cook dozens of dishes, and it's really the only way to develop skills in the kitchen. 
Chop with the rear part of the blade, not the tip, in a rolling motion.  
Control your heat. Control everything, but mostly your heat. 
Keep it simple.  Something with 3-4 ingredients that go really well together is better than something with 12 ingredients that clash with each other. 
pastry chef here, not my best tip but the only one I can think of this early on my day off...flouring pans for cakes is a step not to be skipped but when it comes to chocolate cakes, it looks awful so for dark cakes, I use cocoa powder instead. 
Learn to brown things. So many people are content with their ability to not burn things that a lot of food that could be GREAT turns out tasting no better than if they had boiled it. 
If you have to keep adding salt, try adding some citric acid instead 
Heat will remain in your food after turning off the stove and it will continue to cook, so pay attention to your timing. e.g. when you want to add cheese to your omelette, cheese should melt in a plate with heat of the eggs, otherwise you will have over dried omelette, same as overcooked pasta.  
Not a food tip but a cooking tip.... a falling knife has no handle. If you drop a knife, get the hell out of the way and let it hit the floor. Washing it is easy enough. Try to catch it and you could be visiting the emergency room. 
If something burns slightly, throw BBQ sauce on it and call it "Smoked".  If something that's supposed to be smooth comes out chunky, call it "Homestyle". 
Mise en place, which is French for "cut and measure your shit out ahead of time". Saves so much stress.  
Timers. I always forget I have something going on the stove while I'm cutting something across the kitchen. Timers save lives.  
You can use the stem of broccoli. Just peel, slice and fry it in the pan, it's delicious. 
If you're worried about calories, just eat a smaller portion rather than substituting "healthier" ingredients.  Especially when baking. 
The only recipe that should have only one clove of garlic in it is a recipe for one clove of garlic. Two MINIMUM people. 
Not a chef, just italian. Now ,at last, i can rant on how to cook pasta.  For the love of what's holy wait for the water to reach boiling point before dumping the pasta in it, and remember to salt the water. Nobody likes eating starch glue.  Furthermore when making spaghetti try to use a proper pot, it shouldn't be necessary to break the spaghetti in half in order to cook them. 
Not a chef, but cooking is my hobby. Number one rule in my book is follow a recipe exactly at least once before fucking around with it. I've seen too many people get angry or frustrated because they decided to substitute X for Y, and then the dish turns out badly. Try the recipe first, then decide if there's too much garlic, or if cinnamon would taste better to you than nutmeg.  If you hate peeling garlic, take as many cloves as you need, toss them in a bowl, cover with another bowl, and shake the hell out of it. The peels get knocked off.   Also, fuck margarine. Just use butter. 
Don't be afraid to experiment. Every successful new recipe or derivation was at one point an experiment. 
Seasoning is paramount. I didn't realize this until I got to know my GF's family. Most people way underseason their food or only use the basic salt, pepper, garlic powder etc. You think baked chicken is bland? You're not seasoning it enough. Olive oil, salt, pepper, rosemary, thyme, garlic powder, and SMOTHERED in Paprika. Delicioso. 
Salt your food. It's amazing how much better things taste with just a little salt.  
Not a chef really by trade, but learned this while I worked as one: take a small hand towel and either loop it through a belt loop or between your waist and your belt so it hangs over your leg.  As you move around, then, you always have something to wipe your hands/your instruments on and you don't need to go out of your way to do it! 
A knife is not a wedge. It's a knife.  If you're pushing down to split your food in half, you're **doing it wrong**.  Who's supposed to be cutting the food here -- you, or the knife? Exactly. You're the brains, the knife is the muscle. So stop leaning into your knife trying to part the bread sea, and start *slicing*.  Seriously, if your knife is sharp enough, dragging the blade's length across whatever you want to cut should be plenty to get through it. The weight of the blade is all you need. 
Applied for a Guitar Tech job at guitar center. Went through three levels of interviews. Right during the last one, this fucking dude, goes through all my paperwork and is like "you got the job, we're gonna start you off in sales." And I was like "I didn't apply for sales, I've interviewed the last three weeks for the Guitar Tech position." An he just said, "I know." And had this shitty stupid smile on his dumb face. And that's when I realized, they probably don't care for their employees there.  
One place my wife interviewed asked her if she had any kids or planned on getting pregnant soon.  Both questions are illegal to ask during an interview.  
If they dodge the question when you ask about hours.  
If to move forward in the hiring process you have to pay them for anything 
I interviewed at a company years ago where the interviewer asked me if I ever thought it was okay to just drop a former employer in favor of working for him the next day.  I said no because I do believe in the courtesy of a notice and not burning bridges whenever possible.  He got irritated with me and ended the interview.  I consider that a dodged bullet because any company that celebrates a lack of courtesy and professionalism is one that will extend that lack of respect to me. 
When they mention the high turnover rate several times during the interview.  
If the interviewer cancels and forgets to tell you.  I once drove an hour each way just to learn that my future boss took the day off. Not a sick day. She had booked a vacation months ago and didn't bother clearing her schedule (or checking it when scheduling my interview).  That job ended up being very short-lived and traumatic. She was fired like a month after I quit. 
In science:  "We work hard".  "Professor Y has high expectations".  "I don't believe in vacation". - actually heard this one on an interview once.  
I had an interview at Tops where the interviewer talked for 5 minutes about how her honeymoon begins at the end of that workday.  I got the job, technically because she said she would contact me when she got back about when I could start working.  Years of unemployment had finally ended! I couldn't wait!  2 weeks and 4 days later I called to ask about the job only to be told "I don't remember you and I don't remember any interview."  I was devastated.  A year more with no job and I began the rotation of searching again and got an interview. 8 to 10 years of cashier experience gets you an interview but never a job.  I went in to the second interview thinking it might be someone new. It wasn't. What she said when she saw me made me see red:  "Oh I remember you!"   
If they show you large commission numbers from a few years ago.  Hotels.com did this, but what they didn't say was the large checks were from a year ago and they changed their commission structure since then an those checks are no longer obtainable. 
Hostile interviewers.  I had an interview years ago, where they had a good cop, bad cop routine going.  The good cop asked me about my hobbies, and seemed interested.  The bad cop, scuffed and rolled his eyes. 
While waiting in the lobby for my interviewer to come out, a man flung the work area door open as he was screaming and literally sobbing about the place being worse than hell. It was like a red flag factory exploded in my face.  
Mine was going for a corporate job that required travel ~40% of the time, which to me didn't sound so bad.  I interviewed separately over a day with like 8 people on the team.  I'd say about 4-5 of them had negative things to say about the travel aspect.  So that was a red flag for me. 
Sometimes you just get a vibe in a place that it is way too serious and I don't mean serious in a good way but instead that everyone is walking on eggshells type of serious.  I get skeptical of places where everyone constantly praises the boss/CEO/founder and constantly mentions how ultimately they make the decisions or things like that.  That just sounds like a place run by an iron fist.   
When the person interviewing you is the person whose job you'll be taking, and they're quitting because the job sucks.  This comment is oddly specific, but I'm currently interviewing candidates to take over my job. It's a real ethical dilemma, encouraging someone to take the job I'm leaving due to dissatisfaction, but I tell myself that they may enjoy it better than I have. 
Posted this before but my roommate once was asked to do a trial run as a waitress since she had no experience. Sure that's cool. It was for Valentine's Day lunch, surely she will be shadowing and letting drinks and what not. Nope. They put her out there solo for a 5 hour shift THEN ASKED HER TO COME BACK THAT NIGHT TO WORK A DOUBLE. She never got paid for it and never returned.  
I once went to a four hour job interview that was 4 different 50-60 minutes sessions each with a different group of people. Every single group asked me the same damn questions, while repeatedly warning me how busy the department was all year round.  It raised a red flag. If you're so fucking busy all the time, then why don't you get more efficient and interview me all at once!!! I got the job and learned that this was pretty typical. They were always "busy" because they were inefficient. In reality, they really didn't have to be so busy all the time. I often did extra work to fill my time because I did things much more quickly than the previous person to do my job. 
One that I've experienced- they asked me to start immediately.  "When can you start"?  "Tomorrow!"  "How about right now, we're way behind."  *Thanks for joining the crew of the Titanic!  Watch your step, she's listing about twenty degrees to starboard, but a finer luxury liner has never sailed the seas.*   
When they ask how much I'd like to get paid, I say $11 an hour, they chuckle and counter with minimum wage. Why'd you bother asking in the first place, Sam's Club? 
If the interviewer seems stressed or rushed, that's your first sign.  
I had an interview where the guy said "we - we work hard here. I'd like to say we play hard, too, but.. we work hard here".  Then, later on when I asked about what happened to the predecessor "he left. Unfortunately, he took on a little too much, became unhappy and left. He's taking some time off before he decides whether he wants to stay in IT or not."  So you overworked a guy to the point where he decided he needed a new career? 
When they ask you what your five year plan (or similar) is, then mock  you for having goals that they think are too ambitious.   I once told an interviewer that I'm interested in being a professor and he responded with "You? A professor? Ha!".  I did not take the job. 
They wanted me to explain my tardiness stats from high school.  I'm in my thirties. 
I once interviewed for a company that said they'll be holding onto my passport and my university degrees as long as I work there.   While I had heard of such instances, I also knew it's against the law. 
If they say, "It's like a family here", they mean "the drama is unbelievable and yes, it gets very personal". 
Had an interview with a store owner once when I was in high school.  Guy threw a pad of paper across the table at me and told me to list out my values.    The values of an 18 year-old.  Applying for a job as a cashier at a sporting goods store.  Uhhh, what?  Jotted some stuff down and he then proceeded to tell me why all my values were wrong.    "Family is great, but God is greater.  God should be top of your list."  "School is only good if you get to work in your field."  "Work ethic? I'm just going to assume you don't know what that is."  "You definitely don't know what love is, so don't list your girlfriend anywhere in your values."  He then told me that I'd be less than minimum wage as a Trainee for as long as he saw fit to call me that and how that was completely and totally legit.  Promptly Noped the fuck outta there.   
"We work hard and play hard" means "we expect you to work unreasonable hours and becoming a functional alcoholic is really the only way to cope with it" 
If they say that over time is expected. That just means they are under staffed and you will be putting a lot many hours you are not getting paid for. 
Baker here, on my first day I was given a potted tree, I was told to plant it, if I was still baking when it got big enough to hang myself off, I should, because this is not the job you want for the rest of your life.  
"You'll be required to work overtime when appropriate"  OK, that's fine. So is it a week on, week off system?  "No. You'll need to work overtime when we need you"  Right, but you'll give me notice in advance.?  "No. If we need you to work overtime you have to stay"  I told them there and then to keep their job. I'm desperate but not that desperate. 
When the mournful eyed Filipina janitor bumps into you as you walk towards the restroom, slipping into your pocket a hastily scrawled note that says "you leave, is no good for you here".   
When the interviewer's eyes have the cold, lifeless look of someone who's slowly dying on the inside.    You look into their eyes and see that all their hope and ambition is lost.  They've come to accept their meaningless existence and know they will die a lonely death, looking back on a life full of regret.    If your interviewer gives you a vibe like that, don't take the job.  
This is a GREAT question and I'd just like to say that so many interviewers forget that interviews are a two-way street. Sure, I need a job, but they also need a good worker, which I am. I'm also old enough to recognize a bad fit.   
Group interviews. Seriously what a dumb idea. I think Walmart and a few others do this 
In all seriousness, check the bathroom for one-ply toilet paper. If they don't care about your ass, they don't care about your ass.  I've worked several places when I was younger and all the bad places fit this rule.  
"Must be a self-starter" = We won't train you.  "Fast-paced environment" = We will overwork you.  "Must be able to multitask" = We fired three people and want you to do all their jobs.  
They mention their employees must wear "many hats".  
They had a bed...   Like. In the middle of their cube-farm, they owned, and encouraged employees to use, a bed.   Someone was sleeping in the bed as I was getting my tour of the space. 
I had an interviewer that was interested in hiring me and when I asked if we could go around the office and meet his team, he didn't want to.  Huge red flag, didn't take the job. 
Not subtle at all - I went for an interview for a job that I was already doing with 5 years experience, with excellent reviews and even a recommendation from my current employer. It was a panel interview and as soon as I walked in one of the interviewers walked out to the parking lot. He comes back and goes "how do you plan to work this job with two kids still in car seats?" I told him he was asking an illegal question and was being straight up sexist and inappropriate. I knew right then that I wasn't taking the job.  
If you can you assess the coffee situation while moving through the office for interview.. Powdered creamer? Run. Liquid creamer in numerous flavors? Work there till death or retirement. 
If the interviewer(s) aren't personable.  If they aren't smiling or talking to me on standard conversational level, it's probably a crappy place to work.   
When they interviewers are too informal. I generally try to be professional until I see them get a little less formal. This one interview the two people kept texting each other on their apple watches and giggling. Then after every response would turn my answer into a weakness.  I wasn't offered the job but I wouldn't have taken it abyway 
People are way too excited about working there and are totally high on the company Kool Aid. Working there is the best thing EVER according to everyone you talk to. There's nothing they love more than slaving away for company XYZ.  They're either full of shit and lying to you and cannot be trusted about anything -OR- they're truly high on the Kool Aid and you're going to be expected to similarly partake if you ever want to fit in. 
- "We wear many hats" - Asking to interview you at odd times - 3pm or later on a Friday, 8am on a Monday, etc. If they want you to interview at those times, pretty much means you will be working at those times (earlier than 8am) or late on Fridays).  - Can work with unknown or vague requirements = Chaos - "We don't have a lot of processes here" = Chaos - Work hard/play hard: You will be working a lot of hours here and you will be expected to go to happy hours several times a week. Also, many of your coworkers will be alcoholics. - Asking stupid questions like, "If you were a tree..."  - Making fun of you, in any shape or form -- mocking your past experiences, your degree, etc. Keep an eye out for this! I've had it happen to me very subtly and openly. :( - Asking you to do some sort of mock up work for them.  
Because we don't have to fight mutant insects here. And generally the COL is cheaper. 
Because I only have to read about "Florida Man", and not expirence it live. 
I can think of a couple:  (MUCH) fewer bugs (exception: mosquitoes)  Four seasons   
Because Zombies are slower in 4 feet of snow...   That, and snowmobiles. 
No tornadoes, large earthquakes, devastating hurricanes, poisonous reptiles, alligators, crocodiles, bear attacks, oppressive heat. it's a good trade off for having to wear a scarf occasionally. 
Because it reminds me that I'm alive. Being hot just makes me suicidal.  
When you're uncomfortably cold, you can always throw on an extra layer to get warm.  When you're uncomfortably hot, there are only so many layers you can remove before you're still uncomfortably hot.  And heat makes me much more prone to irritability, depression, and lethargy.  That's why I moved out of Houston and into Pennsylvania. 
I lived in Costa Rica for a few years and a lack of seasons REALLY bothers me.  I love the place but I cannot describe the comfort it brings me to see lush spring turn to radiant summer turn to contemplative fall turn to hallowed winter.  Seeing time pass like that helps me value the moment I'm in and gives perspective to where I want to go.  when I go walking in winter, when I feel the cold bite at me and the wind push against me I am reminded of how alive I am.  It is not a feeling you get from 65-70 degree weather with no clouds and no wind.  I feel like I'm in a vacuum, that I'm part of a vacuum as well.  In cold and windy weather I feel nature flow around ME.  And the wife snuggling is hard to beat bruh, especially when you make your own cocoa and have a fire going. 
Because I got laid off the same STUPID year that I met the most amazing woman who lives in STUPID Fairbanks, in STUPID Alaska.    When we were living apart we were trying to figure out who would quit their job that they loved and move to the other person's city and my STUPID employer decided to go out of STUPID business.  I moved in with the love of my STUPID life in STUPIDVILLE and the air HURTS MY STUPID FACE.  STUPID. 
The cold keeps the riff raff out.    I've lived in Wisconsin and Florida, and it's amazing how different the people are.  A lot of Florida residents aren't from florida, they're transplants, so you just don't get the same "down home" feeling that you do with the people in Wisconsin.  Most people in Wisconsin were born and raised here, and it feels like they are just a lot more wholesome (don't hate me florida!) 
Vermonter here. 1) How would I know my state cares if it didn't try to kill me with weather? 2) I run naturally hot and dealing with cold is much easier than heat. 3) I live near a college town so I enjoy the effect cold weather has on newly arrived warm place people.  
Because, after global warming your cities will be under water and the air won't hurt my face anymore 
The air doesn't really hurt my entire face, just my nose. I don't really know what factory produces the smell, but every morning I'm blasted with the smell of offal. If you've ever butchered an animal, like deer, you'd know what smell I'm talking about. 
I don't like heat thats more than 25 celcius. its uncomfortable, sweaty, itchy, it makes doing exercise less desirable, it makes going shopping more uncomfortable. it's just pretty shit. 
Fewer bugs/pests and things that can kill me.  Here in Minnesota we also have great schools and access to healthcare.  You just gotta have some good indoor hobbies and winter isn't so bad. 
Because I don't like the idea of air conditioning having to be a necessity. 
Born n raised in Los Angeles, met "a boy from queens" three weeks before he was moving back to New York. Fell crazy in love and moved a couple months later. Been here seven winters. Have an insanely awesome job (low stress, good pay and benefits). Started a family. His parents are nearby and help out a lot with raising our two little boys.   So I'm used to weather that hurts the face now. Having seasons makes you appreciate the good weather days. The same weather every day got monotonous growing up.  
My husband found a pantry moth that had died stuck to the inside of his straw. After he'd already been drinking from it for a while. 
I had jaw surgery so I was (am still) numb from my bottom lip to my chin. This made it somewhat difficult to drink from a glass so I used straws for a while. Then I ran out of my box of straws so I decided that was the last straw and learned to drink like a normal person again.  
One of the Senior VP's of my company told me: "A gentleman never drinks through a straw," so I haven't used one since 
Serious answer: That video of that turtle with a straw stuck in his bleeding nose.  Funny answer: I dunno.  
The realization that it is impossible to look like a badass when drinking with a straw. 
When it broke the camels back.  That was my only camel. 
The first time I ever went to bar I was drinking from a straw. This drunk guy walked up to me, took my straw out, threw it on the ground and said: "straws are for bitches!"  Haven't used a straw since  
Fear of repeated straw usage giving me a bad case of "old lady mouth."  
It was after watching Stupid, Crazy, Love. That scene has always stuck with me. That and Shopping at Gap. 
I had one go up my nose on a date once. Sprite turned into cherry sprite and the date ended in shame and blood. 
I've gotta tell you, I still hear screaming, fireworks, and car horns blaring outside. I'm north of the stadium by quite a bit. Everyone here in Chicago is going crazy. The rain finally stopped too so everyone and their dogs is outside. Go Cubs! 
2016 is hands down the weirdest year of all time.... 
This is something I'm gonna tell the grandkids about.  "Grandpa, where were you when the Cubs broke the curse?"  "Shitposting on reddit." 
I live in Logan Swuare and I swear I stepped onto my stoop and it sounds like the purge out there, please send help. 
Anyone see Kris Bryant's face when he was fielding the ball for the final out? That was hilarious.  
Naturally, it just took some rain to end a 108 year drought.  
And I thought Leo winning his Oscar took too long.   Maybe 2016 truly *is* marking the end of the world.  
On a scale 1-completely burned down what's the status of Chicago right now? 
Ok everybody, fess up and start doing all the things you've ever said you would do,   "once the Cubs win the World Series" 
I found myself jumping out of my chair shouting in celebration, then realized I'd never cared about baseball or any baseball team ever and not sure why I was so excited about a team I'd never even watched play a game.  Still a great finish though.   
Bill Murray must be dying with happiness right now. 
Living in downtown Chicago, I got my windows open and the city is exploding in cheers and car horns.  It's electric. This seriously feels like a dream. 
As a Chicago Cubs fan as of about 1am GMT, I have never been happier. 
Lifetime Red Sox fan here. I remember the feeling back in 2004. The feeling of the curse vanishing. It gets weird there. The tragedy had become part of our identity for so long and for a while we didn't know, as fans, who we were any more. But guess what Cubs fans, you're fucking winners now. Get used to it. 
As a natural born Chicagoan in the Cleveland area, I got a resounding "Go fuck yourself!" when I cheered out the window. Honestly, it made it even better. 
This is where you suddenly find out that 75% of your facebook friends have been life long Cubs fans.  
So many people posting no one will see that I like Shirley Temples from Applebee's. 
Man, Leonardo DiCaprio won an Oscar, The Cubs won the world series. What is this world coming to? 
My grandmother is 93 years old, she has been rooting for the cubs since she was old enough to speak, she's told us about how growing up in the dust bowl the best days of her life were those spent listening to the game on the radio, I cannot express how happy I am she got to witness this victory in her life time 
What if they won because on Tuesday the world is going to end and god wanted them to win one before everything ends 
Literally the last batter, best and closest game I've watched in forever. 
First Brexit, now this. Pretty sure that spells out a Trump presidency if we're going by the laws of 3 for huge unexpected results. 
A lot of non-baseball fans might not realize this, but there's a certain significance to tonight's game winning, drought breaking Cubs team.  The man who is the president of the Cubs, was the GM of the Red Sox in 2004 when they beat their own 86 year championship drought.  Epstein sure knows how to build teams. I'm fairly certain no single team management person on this entire planet right now AND in history can say they've helped break nearly 200 years combined of championship droughts.  There'll be stuff written about him for years to come. Accolades, anecdotes, not to mention intense studying of his team building strategies. The man might very well now be one of the most legendary figures in baseball, if not all of sports when it comes to management at least. 
The first time my SO and I slept together I woke up during the night to use the bathroom. I came back in the room and she farted one of the loudest farts I've ever heard. I started laughing like crazy and she almost woke up. Almost. We've been together for seven years.  
I know her secret Twitter handle.  But she might know my secret reddit account (this one) so perhaps it's a wash. 
He claims he doesn't love the new cat his parents adopted. Claims she always just sleeps in his room for some reason.   Motherfucker loves that cat so much. 
My ex, and the cheating. She thinks I found out when I looked at her phone, but I new about two months earlier when she sent me a pic of herself watching Netflix in bed. I don't think she realized that the dude's face was 100% visible reflected in the laptop. After that it was a matter of me being in denial and trying to fix things. 
I knew for a year and a half about my engagement ring and never told him until after he proposed. He was not so good at hiding. 
Everybody likes snacks, right? Some of us like chips, others like fruit, or yogurt. Well, my wife likes croutons. Frozen croutons to be exact and she tries to hide it like an alcoholic hides bottles of vodka. Where does she hide the croutons? In the freezer. At first I'd put them in the pantry when we get home from the grocery store, but they'd always end up in the freezer. I'd be like, "Uh, hon, what's up with the croutons in the freezer?" and she'd act like she had no idea what I was talking about. Now here's the thing, I've tried them and now I'm addicted to them too. So now I openly eat cold croutons out of the freezer as a snack, and she tells me what a weirdo I am while she eats half the bag with me. No idea why she's embarassed to admit what a genius she is for discovering such an awesome snack. BTW, the best kind is Chatham Village garlic and cheese flavor. 
My wife dropped my iPhone in a Port-A-Potty toilet.  Luckily it has been so used there was a large pile of shit which gently held the phone above the liquid.  She cleaned it off and gave it back to me.  A year later I upgraded and gave her my old phone.    She insisted on purchasing a new cover even though I had a high-end OtterBox.  I never understood why until one of the kids told on her. 
My ex made up a person and spoke to me as them. We met when we were quite young and were both pretty weird... I put it down to insecurity and wanting to look like she had cool friends (I was a little older). I never let on that I knew because it would have been super embarrassing for her and this was literally the start of the relationship.  She made up quite a few stories about this guy and I got a few emails from "him". She didn't realise that changing the name of the account didn't actually change the address, which was fully visible. 
She smokes when I'm not home, I know this because I always move the router to the window where the signals best, when I come home the router is in a different position away from the window, I put it back without her knowing and call her out for smoking, she has no idea how I keep finding out! 
His affair.  I knew for 3 weeks before he left (to look after his allegedly sick dad) and for 2 weeks after before I told him I knew. He said last week he's ended it and sees what he has missed but I know he's still sleeping and living with her whilst messaging me. Basically what he just did to me - I'm his wife, we were together 12 years. He just can't stop lying. He may be genuinely remorseful right now but I can't get past his deceit.  Update. - sorry if my comment was confusing and thank you for all the replies. I found out in December, he was cruel and miserable throughout and nearly ruined Xmas for the kids. I suggested he go visit his 'sick dad' at NY and slammed that door right behind him. Took time off work (I was main earner then) and rearranged my life to take care of the kids and get a job with flexible hours. I'm happier. Kids are doing well. He's the one struggling now. 
My (soon to be) ex-wife met another guy about a year and a half ago. She was so bad at hiding it that I thought she WANTED to get caught. Posting romantic stuff on her Instagram when we hadn't been romantic in a long time. Confronted her, lied even with solid evidence. A few months later stuff starts disappearing from the house, pretty obvious that she's moving out. Then we started to have no money every month(and I have a pretty okay job), realized she was stealing money basically by paying her bills twice a month with 3-4x the minimum payment and not paying mine. Let it go on for a bit and finally confronted her, she doesn't admit to it. I finally just pull my check from our joint account and she says she's leaving but is going to be homeless. The next day she had changed her facebook back to her maiden name and had a picture of her and the other guy at their new place. I don't know if this counts. 
She is breaking up with me tomorow, said she wants to talk, and it's not something we can talk about in texts. We are on the verge of a breakup for like two months now, feels bad. 
He spent a ton of money on bruins tickets this year. Whenever he got tickets to a match he claimed he got them for free through work but I know he paid for them. I don't really mind since he can spend his money how he wants, but it's funny to me that he thinks I wouldn't realize he's spending a few hundred bucks every time he goes to a game  
They don't love me anymore. But... ya know... finances and such. 
She had sex with my boss before we knew each other, before I had been hired into the company. I'm not mad about it or anything, everyone has a past but she carefully dances around ever coming into my work now and I'm careful not to bring him up. 
Can't we just have an anon mode so I can stop making throwaways? YEAH I KNOW YOU LOOK AT MY REDDIT FITE ME WHEN YOU COME HOME. 
My ex - his drinking. I could smell the alcohol on him. Excuses included:  - it's the coffee I had - it's the gum I chewed - it's my aftershave  - the guys were drinking, not me - I had to use a solvent today, I must have gotten some on me - etc  I gave up. I knew. Then he started coming home fall-down drunk. Gave him an ultimatum. Went through with it.   Typo fixed 
we were long distance when we first started dating.  The one time she came up to where I lived for 4 days, but I had to work during one of the days.  When I was gone she had to take a dump and clogged the toilet.  She couldn't get it to plunge and was freaking out so she went to the kitchen and got a fork and a plastic bag and dug the turds out of the bowl and threw everything in the dumpster out back.  She called her friend panicking and the friend thought it was hilarious.  Friend told me about it one night when the girl had left the room after we moved in together.  I find it funny but don't want to embarrass her!  
This is in the past, but still a good one.   Ended up finding out that my (now ex) girlfriend was cheating on me after hearing one of my parrots pick up, "Oh, God, yes, Jim!" In a rather scratchy sensual voice.   Turns out they've been having sex where I keep him while I went to work. Dumped her ass the next time I saw her and told her.  
When  he's about to fall asleep he's completely honest.  it was about 7 months in when he grabbed me and whispered into my ear "You're gonna be the mother of my children."   I told him and he was thoroughly embarrassed and he apologized.  however I neglected to tell him that pretty much every night he would tell me that he loved me starting a month in.    I don't mind and I'm not trying to rush things and neither of us have any plans to jump into that sort of stuff right away but it's nice to know 
"reddit what is the worst secret your so is hiding from you"  "she has sports tickets for my birthday"   what 
At night, once I go to bed, he binge watches Gossip girl.  
She is hiding baseball tickets for when my favorite team comes into town. She is waiting to give them to me on my birthday. 
Combination of her drinking and her cheating. I can tell by her behavior and the look in her eyes the second she drinks. Saw texts from another guy while she was passed out... Not really sure what to do. 
He has been hiding he's autistic from me for ten years. (Should clarify it's a long running on again off again thing between us but even when it's off we were still good friends) He suffered abusive therapy and because of it thinks hiding his autism is the most important thing. Except that's like trying to hide an elephant in a bathroom, and he's not always super high functioning. So it's always a weird charade of me pretending he's not autistic while busting my ass to gently handle that.   I have no idea how to talk to him about it. I know he has a formal diagnosis. He was so traumatized from institutional medical abuse in the name of therapy that even mentioning it or acknowledging it can cause him to have a meltdown. He thinks if I knew, I wouldn't love him anymore, but I've known for YEARS and I still love him. I like him just how he is, I just want things to be easier and less scary for him, and I don't know how to help most of the time because he won't admit the problem. 
I woke up in the middle of the night to my gf giving me a handy while i had been asleep.  I pretended to stay asleep through it and she never said anything to me about it since.  Was that some crazy Cosmo test to see if I'd say someone's name in my sleep or something?  
While me and my ex were dating she said that she had a driver's license, but I knew she didn't the whole time 
I know he already bought an engagement ring and that it's a pearl, not a diamond. But he's just awful at hiding gifts from me. Not physically, but he just asks me a ton of questions about what I want and then plays it off like I could never figure out why. And I already knew he had gotten a ring because he left mail out from Zales and suddenly had a zales rewards card in his wallet. And I figured out it was a pearl because a few weeks ago he went out to dinner with me and one of my girlfriends and she was talking about what engagement ring she wants and we went on about how neither of us wants a diamond. He got very serious and asked me if I like pearls and acted relieved when I said yes.  
She says she doesn't want children.  I know that she actually does want children, and that she's not capable of having them, due to stumbling upon some medical records. 
My now ex of 2 weeks was trying to hide her drug addiction from me. Was also cheating on me. Told her parents what was going on in an effort to get her the help she needs for her drug problem. She accused me of conspiring with them to ruin her life, told me she hated me and hopes I die, and accused me of abusing her throughout our relationship. I know it's just the drugs talking and that she still cares about me on some level, but that doesn't make things any easier. I still love her and care about her as a person, but all romantic attachment I had to her is gone. She's no longer the amazing woman I fell in love with. 
She really disliked my friends (or maybe thought they disliked her), which led to awkward hangouts with groups and eventually led me to uncontrollable anxiety when they were in the same room... Yeah, it was a bad feeling that was never addressed.   
She quit taking birth control. "Somehow we beat the odds" and ended up with a daughter. Probably did it to keep me from leaving.   That or the time she cut herself and said she was attacked. She did this to hide the fact she was seeing an ex.  
When I'm asleep, he grabs my boobs. I sleep top less and if he gets the opportunity, he takes a feel. I allow it because I enjoy it. I think it's funny. 
That's she's been cheating on me with the same person I've been cheating on her with.  
Gay relationship. My graphics card is dying and it makes it difficult to play ffxiv or overwatch without something catastrophic going on.  He bought me a GTX1080 and is waiting for our 9th anniversary in a few weeks to give it to me. He thinks I don't know, but he talks in his sleep. And when he talks in his sleep, it's almost like he's trying to rehearse the situation in his dream. It's absolutely adorable.  He's ratted himself out various times in the past the same way. I always act surprised. :) 
"What's the worse secret" top 9/10 top comments are adorable or sweet. 
That she started dating me because my parents had a lot of money and I was following down the path to also have a lot of money.   I saw her group chat with her mom, sisters and aunt about what a good situation she's in and how she'll never have to work, and that even if things go south she just has to stick around until my parents aren't around anymore.   I'm only with her until I finish school because I don't want to be alone in this time of my life.    
He had always said he hates to cuddle at night because it gets hot/ it's uncomfortable/I hog the blankets/ect. However,  when he thinks I'm asleep he'll scoot over and wrap his body around me. If I even make a move like I'm awake, he'll run back to his side and pretend it never happened. I think its freaking adorable. 
Throwaway because he is a redditor. He is becoming complacent and a bit lazy I guess, so (without even having to go behind his back) know about the several other girls he messages on almost a daily basis, and he is not always asking about the weather or their opinion on the Cuban missile crisis. We live together, and the secret I am keeping from him is a painting I am getting made of his family for his birthday. 
I was diagnosed with aspergers at the age of 11.  I feel like I'm part of a play where everyone has the script except me. 
You know that time you said something stupid and everyone looked at you like you grew a second head? Imagine feeling like that everytime you talk to someone.    Iama high functioning autist ama 
As an autistic person, what's being not autistic like? 
While I live a pretty normal life I have a lot of issues with sensory sensitivity. Like loud noises, bright lights, certain food tastes, smells and standing in crowds of people. These things make me feel a bit stressed out resulting in various issues like headaches and digestive problems.   While we're on the subject. Certain non-autistic people have the misconception that those of us on the spectrum would "lack empathy". That is simply *not* true. We often have a hard time to "read" people, but we certainly do not lack human empathy. That needed to be said.  
It's really, really lonely. To be desperate to go out and be with people but at the same time have no idea how to interact with them. Left out of every conversation. Completely ignored.  The benefits are basically being able to concentrate on anything and really excel at it. Also not falling apart in an emergency, because the emotions of the situation don't really come into play. 
Unusualsoup, you have just made me a really happy lady. ( I just created an account to respond to you, I read threads and have never felt the need to respond) I am a 25 year old nanny to an autistic 5 year old, I can read him faster than anyone else can. I've learnt to adapt to his needs, and with therapy and a specialist and lots of coaching, he is a very verbal child now. The stares and rude comments from strangers are very upsetting. But thankfully he is oblivious to them for now.  He loves routine, and used to be very obsessive about every little thing in his daily life. He has really come out of his shell in the last two years. But he is very selective of who can be around him.   It is so nice and refreshing to see such a nice person on the internet and know that my cute little 5 year old has the chance to one day be comfortable to talk to strangers. Thank you SO much for giving me a little hope on a rough day. All the best to you!   
My brother is autistic. I can't tell you what it's like from his perspective, but it doesn't take long to figure out that a lot of people have zero sympathy for someone that isn't neurotypical. 
Women would ride down the street on their bikes and give off that Doppler effect.   weeeeeEEEEEE-OOOOOOOOooooooo.    
There would be no discernible recordings of Elvis or The Beatles performing live. 
Men would probably be way less embarrassed by random visible boners 
This library would not be nearly as quiet as I want it to be 
I'm imagining cute little earmuffs that girls could wear on our vaginas to keep our whistles discreet when out in public. The muff muffs. 
Mulan probably would have been found out *way* quicker than previously. 
It would certainly have taken a lot more work for me to stay closeted as a lesbian... 
One Direction concerts would sound even more shrill and high-pitched than usual.  
There's an awful rape whistle joke somewhere in this... 
Archer would have to seriously question whether he had tinnitus or just dropping more panties 
A theater showing 50 Shades of Gray would sound like a giant flock of rabid owls. 
Teens outside of the UK would also have confusing feelings about tea 
My wife would continue to be silent in the bedroom 
If we're going there, then that means in this same world anytime a man gets an erection the "BOOOOINNNNNGGGGG" sound effect plays. 
I think it was /r/offmychest, but it might have been /r/confession. A mom posted about how she'd fantasized for years about spit-roasting her son and eating him- and how she eventually planned to tell him all about this when he was of age. Because apparently, being 18 makes the idea a whole lot more reasonable? 
Not too long ago a guy posted on r/relationships that he was born without an arm, the problem was that he then found pictures of him when he was a baby and had both arms at his parents house, I don't remember how did that end up  
Someone posted a confession about how they pee in their sink because they're tall and it's easier. Given a few days half of Reddit was pissing in their own sinks and posting about it. 
There was someone who posted about a way to give a spoon a cool rainbow color too it. The instructions on how to do this were to take duct tape and wrap it around the handle 4-6 times then heat the metal end up with a lighter "bigger the flame the better" for 2-4 minutes, then run it under a faucet with cold water at full blast.  Obviously this seems sketchy, but someone decided they wanted to try it. Someone replied to the post a few days later and was warning people not to try it as his friend tried it and now "he has no fucking eyes." Long story short heating up the spoon causes the metal and tape to expand and putting it under cold water causes the metal and tape to contract really fast which causes the spoon to explode.  
The /u/darylprat incident was a fucking tragedy for everyone involved.   Check out his post history for the full story but TL;DR this guy was clearly very mentally ill and stalking a girl who makes videos for IGN. He made a lot of posts on /r/legaladvice and /r/relationships asking for help on how best to get in contact with her even though she had banned him on all social media platforms. He was absolutely obsessed with this girl and judging by his post history, he may have committed suicide after this whole thing. 
The Boston bombing debacle. Side note: that is now used as a case study for computing ethics.  
There was this thread about a girl who ended up going to Europe with two men she never met. Seemed like they lured her into a trap basically, and she never posted on reddit since that last post. I forgot the details...if anyone has the link please post. 
Remember that time we found that hitman and the subreddit they made for assignments? 
That time Reddit investigated the Boston bombing and got 99.7% of the information wrong.  
The guy that disappeared forever after posting a pic of a landmine and saying he was going to smash it open 
As someone who joined Reddit 4-ish months ago, it is appallingly interesting to learn about these horrific incidents in Reddit's past. 
A woman posted about her sexual assault, with a photo of her bruised face. **"I was sexually assaulted in the early evening while wearing jeans and a t-shirt in a "safe" residential neighbourhood in Toronto. This is what he did to my face. Only rapists cause rape."**  People started going through her post history to play reddit detective and accused her of faking it. She was a makeup artist and had once made a post about rape culture... so naturally these people assumed she made up a fake assault to prove her point.  It was real, she posted a video of her wetting a cloth and wiping at the bruise, and spoke with the guy that started the witch hunt and even he was like "guys she's legit".   It was just an ugly, ugly thing all around and definitely a less-remembered dark reddit moment.  
I don't remember the exact details, but on some tinfoil hat sub, someone posted a picture of a daycare near their house that they thought was a secret operation. People called, drove by, somewhere in Utah.  It might not apply as its smaller scale, but a bunch of people harassed a daycare. 
No one seems to remember the last little kid reddit "treated", the one that made videos with his toy dinosaurs. He got super excited at his hundreds of thousands of views and subscribers, made videos celebrating. Then reddit got bored, quit watching, unsubbed and the kid got sad, started making videos apologizing even when he didn't do anything wrong. 
Didn't see it mentioned so here it is. Also, I'm not sure it counts in this thread.    So about a year ago, there was a thread in r/relationships. A woman posted, claiming that she found a camera hidden under her kitchen sink. It was her husband's, and in the gallery of the camera, she found that he had taken a photo of all of her belongings. But not just one photo, two photos.    It was quite a popular thread and people were creating and ruling out theories. It wasn't likely for insurance reasons, or any other ones suggested. Another one was, "Maybe he wants to know what you like but he doesn't want you to be worried" but why would he hide it? People asked her to stay in touch, but she never responded nor started another thread. She didn't post anything on her account anymore, either.   I've always wondered what happened to her. If anyone can find the thread, that'd be great.  
Beautiful female corpses sub. As a whole.  EDIT 3: There was also this one sub, really fucking weird, /r/jizzycarts . The title is not what it seems mind you (NSFW) 
The Ellen Pao debacle   The Boston bomber witch hunt   The ask a rapist thread.    
I don't know, but how about we have just a little kisses? Everyone will believe that that's all that we did. 
Not really history, but moreso something currently happening. Honestly I think we'd all rather forget /r/incels.  (I'm on mobile, sorry for bad formatting.) 
There used to be a subreddit for "sexy abortions"...  
Our beloved unidan, sucks cause i really enjoyed his knowledge. 
Nothing, there's nothing that we like to forget about, we love to rehash and regurgitate every little thing endlessly.    
Boston marathon bomber ring a bell?  We did it Reddit! WE FUCK UP SO BAD! 
The popularity and continued popularity around the broken arms guy. It was weird, probably fake, let's just let it go so I can start showing people this website again 
How that weasel, Alexis Ohanian, forced Victoria Jackson out of her job as coordinator for the high profile AMAs because he wanted to hob-nob with the celebrities.  How Hoffman and Ohanian are considered the saviors of Reddit for coming back after the Ellen Pao fiasco is beyond me.  Reddit only took off after those 2 clowns sold their stake in Reddit and left.  How did their new post-Reddit ventures fair?  Yeah, that's what I thought. 
Nonchalance about their own personal health or safety.   If you see someone start drinking more or smoking out of the blue, it might be an escape from psychological pain.   If they aren't showering as much, ignoring people, staying in bed a lot, eating less. These are all signs that they don't have the energy or aren't happy.   Many symptoms you'd see on someone with the flu are things you'd see on someone whose depressed.  
Switches in behaviour.  A friend was so tired, lackluster one moment and flipping out over something trivial the next. Later on, she said she couldn't talk about what really mattered, so she focused on little stupid things (e.g. The bus being late) and got super angry about it. It was always something out of her control, something she could get angry at without blaming herself for it. 
Are they really caring, and seem to fix everyone else's problems? That's because they gave up trying to fix their own.  Do they hate receiving gifts or say they don't want anything for Christmas/birthdays, but give everyone else gifts like there's no tomorrow? That's because they don't want anyone spending money on their pointless existence, and they don't have any real need for money other than bare essentials.  Are they a walking doormat? That's because they don't give a fuck about what happens to them, and they give negative fucks about making a decision for someone else (i.e, if you ask them what they want to do as a group, and they insist that someone else decides, whether by saying "I don't know," or "I'm good either way"), because they would hate to let their pointless desires influence someone else's day and/or mood. 
If someone overreacts to something small and blows it way out of proportion, it's usually a sign that they are very unhappy about something else but either don't know it or are incapable of fixing it.  
Getting upset or unable to handle a fairly simple task, particularly if you know them and know they're not just incompetent. Big problems people keep to themselves often show in the small stuff.  
Run down, sick all the time, snapping over things that might seem little 
They use Reddit for hours a day as a temporary reprieve from the bottomless pit of despair that is their life.  
Superficial dialog about off-topic things. Avoiding talking about how they feel or sharing personal details of their life. 
This was mentioned on the show Sherlock but I've found it to be largely true in real life. There is a good chance that they are depressed if the person is smiling when they know people can see them, but look sad when they think they are alone. 
I'm unhappy because I'm becoming increasingly aware of the enormous flaws in my personality, work ethic, and character that are preventing me from making the most out of this life. There's nothing worse than realizing you've been given so many opportunities and advantages, and squandered them all. 
Sleeping a lot is a very good indicator of someone who's very lonely and unhappy with life. 
Reading this thread has taught me I am extremely miserable. 
They look away - staring out the window or at an object in the room.  Their attention is elsewhere - internal, sullen and withdrawn. 
Speaking as an unhappy person: if they laugh at everything. Anything that can make me happy, even for a second, I will reach for it and try to hold onto it as hard and as long as I can. This isn't always a direct indicator; some people are just easily amused. But, I've seen it and done it enough times to keep it in mind.  
they seems that they do not care about things that they used to care about 
Nothing. Like, doing nothing, spending your time with nothing, being up late because "nothing."  I stay up late often. What do I do when I stay up late? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. And for some reason, I can't not do nothing. 
I've spent a lot of time 'looking for happiness' and I did a lot of stuff that made me feel better for a bit but eventually I always ended up right back at the start. It's just the natural cycle of life for some of us. So many highs yet so many lows. It's OK to be unhappy and lost, many of my accomplishments in life were a direct result from me feeling like crap. Just own it, keep going. Time will pass one way or another.  
Instant smile when someone talks to them, its just a show  
Well, here goes...  I know that I'm unhappy because I can't remember the base line of happiness. I can't remember where things went tits up, but what I do know is things seem like they haven't been easily manageable in years.  I used to think that it was so easy to be happy, it came naturally to me. Then something happened, and I can't quite put my finger on it. I lately have just chalked it up to being an adult and realizing that the things I'm supposed to do in life, have kids, own things, have a great job mean absolutely nothing to me. And the things I used to be so proud of made me look childish or immature.  I will say this, my ability to joke about everything and generally brush most things off has been a great set of armor for so many years. But to be honest it has tarnished and rusted from countless years of dealing with life. If anyone knows a good upgrade, it would be greatly appreciated. I'm not sure if I accurately answered the question, but I assume my point was made.   
Complaining all the time, about just about everything. They can't be happy on the *outside* because they're not happy on the *inside*.   
Always acting upbeat. Seriously, that upbeat person that never gets in a bad mood is secretly miserable. I promise.  
Whenever I'm feeling depressed I always joke more about depression. I'd rather people think I'm a dick who doesn't understand depression than think I actually have it. 
# tl;dr  You are secretly unhappy if:  * You do not smile enough, or smile too much * You don't go out, or go out too often * You sleep too much, or not enough * You are self-deprecating, or deprecating towards others * You drive a Chevy Cobalt  Guys...  
TIL I'm probably a more unhappy person than I originally thought I was.  
I was listening to the 9/11 episode of Last Podcast on the Left, and they played a bunch of really heartwrenching audio clips, but by far the creepiest was just a bunch of high pitched siren/alarm-like noises. It was explained that all firefighters wear these alarms that go off if said firefighter is motionless for like 30 seconds or more aka. They are dead/unconscious. So yeah, it was basically listening to dozens of dead firefighters. It is super haunting to listen to and still sticks with me. 
Any black box recording where a plane is crashing and the pilots slowly realise they are going to die with all the passagers on board.   www.planecrashinfo.com/lastwords.htm  It's very chilling.  
It was audio tape, not film: When I first started working with nuclear submarine programs in the 90s, we had to go to "training" (really just a presentation) about the Sub Safe program, which is an extraordinary QA program enforced for nuclear subs. They played audio of the USS SCORPION sinking and breaking up as a result of an equipment failure. I don't remember the exact number, but the entire crew perished. 
PSA: If you are ever in a situation where someone is threatening to harm you unless you come with them, don't go with them. No matter what they do to you in that moment, there is no way it will be worse than what they will do if they get you alone where they want you. You're a lot more likely to survive getting stabbed during the kidnapping itself than you are to survive once they've taken you. 
Police found thousands photos in Rodney Alcala's (serial killer/rapist) home following his arrest. Some were of his confirmed victims. Eventually, they released about 200 of the photos to the public, hoping the women and children in the photos would be recognized.  I find some of those photos quite haunting.  Also, Alcala once won the dating show and that's not found footage at all but totally creepy when you watch and know he's a serial killer.  
I'm going to go with the man they found alive in a sunken tugboat 3 days after it capsized. 
There were those photos of the guy that went out in the bush and ended up dying (they made that movie about it) he was living in a bus?   Chris McCandless - those photos always creeped me the fuck out. (Its late so i'm not going to look at them before I sleep)  
I'm not sure what you mean by verified, but I remember an incident from Northern Ohio back in the 90s. Someone found a video camera lying in the middle of a pasture. When they checked the recording, they found very creepy B&W footage that included someone who looked dead. Where the footage came from and how it got there was a mystery.  A few weeks later it came out that the footage was from a video shoot from the band Nine Inch Nails, which was a new and up and coming band from Northern Ohio at the time. They had suspended the camera from a helium balloon, trying to get an overhead shot, and the balloon broke away and disappeared. At some point it must have landed in that pasture.  So it wasn't a dead person after all, just creepy footage from a creepy band.   
I love reading the comments but I don't have the balls to go to any of the links... 
I was dating this girl that was a little dysfunctional due to being sexually abused by her grandpa and nobody knew about it. I noticed some red flags and got her to open up and tell me about it. After we broke up, I told her mom she should stop inviting grandpa over to Thanksgiving dinners due to the sexual abuse. The mom called me a liar, but after asking the other daughters/cousins about it they confirmed it was true and that they had all been molested too.   After word got back to grandma, she said, "I'll take care of it".  Fast forward a week and grandpa is dead. Apparently Grandpa had a lot of serious medications he was taking and grandma messed with the dosage, which killed him. His death was ruled natural cause and nothing ever happened to grandma. 
Turned left into my sister's driveway at 3 am. A guy on a Harley was doing 60 mph in a 30, with no headlight. My half ton pickup left 4 feet of skid marks from being pushed back by the force. I still remember seeing him do mid air somersaults this was 1976 
I've posted  this before in more detail but the truncated version is when i was 16 years old I hit an 87 year old man after he ran stop sign.  I was with him holding his hand when he died on the sidewalk.  He had a heart attack.  They weren't able to determine if he had the heart attack before the accident which would explain why he blew through the stop sign or if he had one as a result.  His family was very gracious and I am very grateful for them.  His son called me the day after it happened and told me his mom had died 6 months prior, his dad had been very depressed and while they were sad he died this way they were happy to think their parents were reunited.   
When I was 18 I was working the night shift in a nursing home as an aid. Part of my job was to turn the paralyzed patients every two hours to make sure they didn't get bed sores etc. This one particular resident had late stage Parkinson's diseases and her muscles and joints were stiff and brittle and she was catatonic. As I was flipping her from one side to another, I applied light pressure to her leg to move her back a bit and this snapped her femur. Given her age and health the doctors decided that surgery was dangerous and she would have to heal on its own, if at all. Because of this we could no longer flip her, which resulted in bed sores. She eventually went septic from those bedsores and died of septic shock. I always felt so bad about that.  
7ish am on a Sunday morning. I'm heading to work in a small town at the age of 15 or 16. Come over a crest on a hill and have no time to react. T-bone someone making an illegal u-turn in a driveway. All I remember is veering off to the right and damaging someone's stone wall after the hit, crawling out of the wreckage out of breath and stumbling to see if the other person was okay. Their vehicle spun multiple times and landed in a ditch facing away, but driver side visible from where I originally was. Driver wasn't there..move along the vehicle and check the other side.. Driver is hanging out of the passenger side window with a steady stream of blood from their skull. Bottom line for me is that I ask and implore everyone, please use your seatbelt.. 
2 years ago.   My sister was working at a dealership. Her husband and I were spending the day together until it was time to pick up sis from work. He had been drinking tall-boys all day, so when it came time to get his gal I took the keys and said I'm driving. He was mad enough that he refused to go with me. When I came back with my sister he was no where to be found, but it was common for him to go on walks to calm himself down so we didn't think much of it. 8am the next morning, State Police were banging on the door. They told us he was struck and killed by a train while he was sleeping on the tracks. 
My wife and I were both very sick with the flu. My father watched our two small children and even come to sit with me in the hospital. The day after I got out of the hospital he got the flu and died a couple days later.   I still feel guilty knowing that he didn't have to sit with my children, or that he didn't have to sit by my bedside, but he did. It helps knowing that he loved me so much that he was willing to put his life at risk to be with me.   I just never imagined that the flu could have been so serious to hospitalized, much less kill someone. I hold myself responsible and I feel guilty for getting him sick.  
A guy attacked me at 3 a.m. while I was walking to work. I tried to choke him long enough to render him unconscious. And I did. He never woke up. He was a firefighter, a husband, and a father. I know it was self-defense. It still bothers me sometimes, nearly ten years later. 
I was gaming when one of my best friends messaged me asking to talk if I was free.  Since he usually asked this of me just to talk about random stuff, I didn't think too much of it and just planned to reply back to him after I was done with my gaming session.  A couple of hours later I finally replied back to him, but he didn't reply back which I thought was weird but was probably just him being busy.  He never replied again.  I found out the next day at school that he had committed suicide around the same time that I was gaming.  I can't help but think that I could've talked him out of it if I had replied to him immediately.  To this day I still feel guilty about it, and I've resolved to never let a friend down like that again.....too bad I didn't have that thinking sooner. 
When i was younger playing xbox whilst at my grandparents house i had left the room to go to the bathroom, leaving my wired controller on the floor. I suddenly hear a thud and decided to finish my business before seeing where it had came from.  Whilst cleaning up i heard a scream from my grandma and was told to stay in the bathroom. And so i did.  Found out that my grandfather had accidently stood on my controller and fell over the wire, cracking his skull open on the table and was announced dead at the scene when the ambulance arrived.  I am now extra cautious with where i leave items, encouraging my younger brother and sister to clear up their mess once theyre done.   
I was driving a semi a small car pulled in front of me and slammed their breaks i couldnt stop in time my truck wound up on top of their car i was the only survivor of the vehicles involved  
Loan officer for a local credit union.  I ordered a repo on a guy's car; totally justified.  A week later, he gets off at a bus stop about midnight, and starts walking home.  A car hits him, hit & run.  He's found literally dead in a ditch the next morning.  I didn't kill him, but if I hadn't ordered the repo, he wouldn't have died.   
I was working in a nursing home as a volunteer. He was a painter, he told me to bring him oil paints, canvas and thinner, and he would paint something for me.  The next week when I had to return I was excited to see what he'd painted, but he was no longer there. The nurses told me that "they" came to pick him up.  I think he drank the thinner at night. 
When I was 4 and visiting Japan, I opened back door of a car in Japan to the sidewalk but a motorcyclist driving in that space between the curb and road slammed into it. Blood everywhere. I don't remember the exact aftermath since I was so young, but everybody was screaming and I just sat there not understanding exactly what was happening until my mom ran off the scene and into the building in tears.   *Thanks for the kind words, everyone. I don't blame it on anyone, even myself, as it was just a really unfortunate circumstance. As for the thing regarding my parents as discussed below, don't worry about that either. They're out of my life, but honestly while I do believe my parents did some really crap shit to me, I don't wanna be angry at them. I'm here now and by myself, and I think the best course of action is just to put them and this ugly event out of my head.   Unless it's to tell you curious folks. Thanks for the kind words and reassurance :) 
So I'm a mental health worker who has recently had a patient kill them selves, they sadly aren't my first and won't be my last. I followed protocol and didn't do anything medically wrong but will always feel personally responsible for them. There were signs I missed, lies I believed, and things I do differently in hindsight. Some of the families put cases against the hospital but I've been cleared of any wrong doing. Unfortunately when you have the riskiest cases then you can't win all the time. That doesn't stop me feeling incredibly sad when it happens and imagine the family grieving for a lost son/brother/ father.  i will always remember their names and have planted a tree in each of their honour. I strive to become a better nurse each time 
I was driving my girlfriend and I back to town from a day by the water. We were on the highway and she leaned over to kiss me, next thing I knew we were going off the road and then the car was rolling. It just happened.. I had a few scrapes but her seatbelt wasn't on properly and she died there.. in my arms on the the side of the road. Never thought this could happen to me.  
When i was 4 Years old, my mother was roughly 3-4 months pregnant              one day I was supposedly crying and throwing a tantrum over a toy or something,my mother tried to comfort me by cradling me in her arms and take me to to my room which was up the stairs but i cried and kicked so much that she lost her balance and fell down the the stairs, i was unhurt and mother recovered without any lasting injuries    but my sibling died. 
I was a fairly new driver. I was sitting in the parking lot texting someone on my phone. It took a few seconds to send the message.  I pulled out of the parking lot and immediately came to a roundabout. It was a slow day, barely any cars around. A car pulled up moments after me, but since I beat him by a second or two, he had to wait while I went past him in the roundabout.  Nearly the second after I passed him, a big truck slammed into his rear end. And he was going fast. Real fast. Probably 45 to 50 mph.  They both died. The best they could figure, the elderly driver of the truck passed out for some reason.  If I had waited to text my friend until I got home, that man would still be alive. If I had waited for my friend to reply before leaving the parking lot, that man would be alive.  I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
Throwaway account.  5 years ago I was staying the night at my boyfriend's (we were both still living with our parents).  We started messing around, both getting really into it, as usual. He came once, and seemed to be breathing more heavily than usual, which I attributed to me (and felt good about it, naturally). He then suggested that we take a breather, but I was all worked up and insisted that we go again immediately.  During it, his breathing got heavier, and he collapsed. I panicked and called in his parents, and we rushed him to hospital. Turns out he had an undiagnosed heart condition. He didn't make it. The doctors all said that it was probably the sex that got his heart-rate too high, but that I shouldn't blame myself (yeah, right).  I don't think I'll ever get over it, honestly. If I hadn't pushed to go again, he'd probably still be here. 
Deployed in Afghanistan. Urban area.   I got into programming to kill the time. Had an Arduino set complete with everything I would need to make tons of little gadgets. Got pretty good at it too (going to school for it when I get out). When it came time to go home, I didn't have room to take the kit with me, so I threw it out. Keep in mind, locals work on this base, and in my time there, at least three had been kicked out for ties with the Taliban.   Within an hour of tossing the kit, it had been taken.   Didn't think anything of it, probably some other soldier thought it was cool and took it. Big base, anything could happen. About three weeks after we left, an IED went off outside the gate. No NATO casualties, but about 20 civilians died in the blast. EOD reported that it was a "strangely sophisticated" bomb. They used my kit.  My negligence gave them the means to kill 20 innocent people. I've never told anyone in the world about this, and it haunts me to this day.

I stopped a 25 year old Asian male from entering the east executive entrance of the White House. He had slit his wrists and neck prior to his arrival, but not deep enough to hit major blood vessels. He told me that he was a secret agent working for J Edgar Hoover and that he was 60 years old. He said he had important information to pass to president Obama. I ended up having to detain him, stop the bleeding and then involuntarily commit him. Turned out to be a local college kid, going through some mental health issues. I've field interviewed hundreds of White House "callers" but this kid took the cake.  
From a post I made a few weeks ago...   I was called out to negotiate with a 17 year old female who had barricaded herself in a bathroom with multiple knives and scissors (she'd done it right too, SWAT ended up going through the sheetrock wall). She wouldn't talk with me at all but had multiple graphic conversations with her mother, who committed suicide 3 years earlier, and her dad, who's serving lots of years in prison for sexually abusing her. When SWAT pulled her out she had completed multiple circumcisions on herself with the scissors, completely cut her nipples off, and had sodomized herself multiple times with multiple steak knives. The kicker was, she was talking the whole time and her tone or volume never changed. The pain never bothered her. Or, more likely, she never felt it. The human mind is scary as fuck.  
Im not a cop but my dad just recently shared these stories with me. My grandfather was a cop in a small town in the 60's-70's.  Late at night it was common for officers to pull over vehicles driving through town, especially if they didnt recognize them.  He pulls over a bus load of people.  He walks through and asks them where they are headed, yada yada.  They were headed to California, it was Charles Manson and his group.  Another story.  Same grandfather, same stop a car passing through protocol.  Asked the driver where he was headed, BS'd for a while and told the guy to have a nice evening.  Few towns over guy gets pulled over again, shoots and kills the cop.  Apparently he was doing this as he drove along, get pulled over and shoot the cop.  When they questioned him he said he had been pulled over by my grandfather, but he was such a nice guy he didnt kill him, but he did have the gun sitting in his lap. 
One night at about 1130, this guy jumps off of a bridge into a bay. On the way down, he hits a guard rail and loses both forearms and the top of his head. One set of officers found his arms and set them aside. I was on the dive team, so we go collect his remains. While we check on his condition, we notice the brain is missing. This was me flipping up his scalp and taking a peek inside to find nothing there. It's very strange to look for something very important and not find it. Anyway, we bag him up and get him on the boat. Our supervisor tells us we have to at least look for his brains.  Gross. So we dive and look around, but the only thing we find is a piece of skull. And we had decided if we did find it, none of us wanted to grab it.   
 My cousin is a cop and he responded to a call on Valentine's Day night. A 12 year old girl called in to say her mother had blown her brains out in the living room. I guess her and her brother were getting ready for dinner and the mom just shot herself.  He said the creepy thing about it was dinner all set up, drinks on the table and suddenly she shot herself. Kids were sitting outside when he arrived, to this day I can't imagine Valentine's Day for them. But I know that is something that stuck with him seeing that.  
My department sends an officer to all rescue calls if one is available. We got a call late one night to "assist rescue" at a townhouse complex for a "woman hemorrhaging." We didnt show up until rescue had already left with the patient. So we let ourselves into the residence and eventually found the bathroom, which was COVERED in blood. Blood on the walls, all over the toilet, everywhere. CRAZY amount of blood. Rescue hadnt mentioned anything suspicious on the radio, so this was surprising. We were preparing to leave when one of the younger officers noticed bloody footprints leading to the front door...and then across the parking lot...to a dumpster. We gathered at the dumpster, lifted up the top, and lit up the interior with our flashlights. Same officer extended his baton, reached into the dumpster with it, and brought out a bloody plastic grocery bag....with a dead baby in it. True story.  
It was a stormy night on the Oregon Coast.  A lady was driving drunk and ran into the back of a parked school bus.  When she did, her car caught on fire, but she was able to escape.  When I found her slowly walking down a side street, I was telling her to stop and turn around.  When she turned around, her lower jaw was gone, and she was totally dazed.  Her tongue was sticking straight out the top of her neck, and she was trying to talk.  She ended up surviving but needed tons of plastic surgery.   
My dad was on the freeway, and saw a guy in a big truck (it may have been a mail carrier?) that was swerving and driving crazy. He pulled him over, and the driver's hands were shaky and covered in blood. It turns out he had a prostitute in the back of his truck that he had killed not long before.  
I once went to a two fatality car crash. The cars had collided head on in a 55mph zone.   One of the drivers had left the house suicidal, and it was surmised that he picked a car out at random and went straight into it.   I had spoken with that man several weeks prior and seeing his skeleton in the burned up car was a little creepy.   I won't describe the rest of the scene, but the worst part of it is...  This was Christmas Day. Not a merry Christmas at all.  
Man this was probably 2010, 2011... I was really new.  Call came I'm as an "unknown problem", basically the 911 was so fucked up, even dispatch didn't know what to call it. Turned it this guy had just murdered his step father and then walked to his grand parents house to kill them as well.  He stabbed his grandmother through the eye with a Rambo style bowey knife, one that had the compass in the pommel of the handle.   He missed her brain by about an eighth of an inch, so she did not die. Instead she came running out of the house when we got there, knife sticking out of her fucking eye, and the compass was spinning around because she was moving. My brain literally went "that's not real" and I went past her, along with several other cops, before the sergeant was like "what in the actual fuck are you guys doing?"  She survived. We caught the guy in a stroke of pure luck. Elderly woman with a massive hunting knife for an eye, definitely the creepiest thing I can remember seeing. 
Not a cop, but a correctional officer in Texas. One time a guy slit the forearm side of his elbows (where it bends). He laid there in a big puddle of his own blood. I was one of the responders that day.  I'll never forget it. As soon as you entered the cell, the smell just hit you. Blood has a strong metallic smell, which I never realized before. He'd been laying there awhile, so the blood had coagulated which again, I did not expect. As we lifted the barely conscious guy out of the blood, the blood fell off his body in chunks, like Jello.  It was pretty disturbing because I didn't expect any of it nor was I able to mentally prepare for it. We're not really medically trained, so all of it was completely surprising to me.   
Are we accepting "Not me but a cop I know" stories?  My cousin is on in a major city, apparently 911 got a call from a 6 year old claiming **VEHEMENTLY** that there was a zombie outside of his house on the street.  So a patrol car swings around to see what's up.  Turns out a tweaker on meth gouged out his own eyes, had blood dripping down from the empty sockets, and was stumbling around blindly with his hands stretched out in front of him.  Goddamn, turns out the kid was telling the truth! 
Got a call that someone wasnt answering their Phone or the doorbell. We got to the house and noticed that every window was blinded by either curtains or pieces of paper. We rang the doorbell and yelled through the letterbox but there was no answer. We opened the door and got inside. In the house it looked like someone just had lunch. There was bread on the table and juice or milk in the glasses. Childrens toys scattered all around. Then I saw a note that gave me the chills. It was a suicide note. As the door was locked from the inside, the person had to be in the house. We checked room by room and my heartbeat was at 300% when I checked the bathroom. Preparing myself for slit wrists or throats I opened the door slowly, but there was nothing. Finally one more room left which was the attic. We walked slowly up the stairs and we found the resident there, hanging from a beam. I will never forget the adrenaline I had, the scene in the livingroom or the resident I found.  
We responded to a burglary alarm at a mortuary and found that one of the rear doors was left open.  Policy now dictates that the entire building needs to be cleared (searched) to confirm that it was a false alarm (which most are).  It's the middle of the night and totally dark.  We use flashlights and never turn on lights.  We walk into one of the rooms and see a body on a table.  It appeared that it was waiting to be processed (possibly embalmed) by the mortician.  It smelled like a mildly decomposing body.  Suddenly I see a shadow to my right and I shine my light there and find nothing out of the ordinary.  I immediately smell a really strong whiff of perfume blow by me.  The search was completed more expiditiously than normal after that...nothing was found. 
From my post 8 months ago:  Got a call for a missing child, got to the home to find the mother highly distressed, and not sure what to do. I called in everyone to first search the home and property. I decided to search the backyard since it was a large wooded lot with no visible fence. After about 10 minutes I found the boy, he was caught on an old chain link fence in the woods that was blocked by a bunch of trees, so you couldn't see it from the house. He had basically gotten strangled to death on the fence, he must have been climbing on it, fell, and got his hooded sweatshirt caught on it.   The worst part for me was having to call it in on the radio, knowing the mother might hear it inside from one of the other officers radio.   
I got a call that there was an abandoned truck on the highway. I was only a mile or two away, so I headed there. It was in the middle of these curves, with a mountain wall on one side, and a drop off to a creek on the other side. It was dark, probably around midnight. I pull up and there it is. An old 50's pickup truck. Light blue. Sitting there. I have no backup. I have no idea where the driver is. I walk up, gun out, inhaling the strong alcohol vapors. No one to be found. I call for a tow truck. Meanwhile I have to wait, in the dark, in the middle of blind curves, with no idea where the driver is or why he left it. My adrenaline was at an all time high for sure. 
My mom was a patrolman at the time and rolled up on a guy fucking a pumpkin on someone's front porch. It was one of those huge ones like 3 foot diameter. Guy was apparently too into it to notice her and her partner roll up him.  (Unrelated) A year later she got a call for a suspicious person and so she's walking around in the woods behind a neighborhood and heard someone sneaking around so she hid behind a tree and tripped the person. It was a guy in full ninja regalia carrying a wooden box with shuriken, poison darts, throwing knives, and a picture of one of the girls in that neighborhood.  She also found a butterfly knife in a hooker's pussy...well it moreso fell out when she was being frisked.   
Not a cop, but worked with an animal control officer who had to go with the cops into a house of an old lady that no one had heard from in a while.   She had passed away quite a few days before, and left behind two large dogs. The dogs were hungry, so by the time they got there, the dogs had eaten most of her. 
Not a cop, but work within a school district and have heard some pretty unfortunate stories about reported abuse. Any time a child says their dad/coach/aunt/cousin/sibling/pastor touched their peepee/whoha/cookie/flower/weewee/dingdong it's creepy. Worst are the ones that mention it to a grown-up but don't know the real word so teacher thinks the "flower" the kid mentions is an actual flower. Moral of the story - penis, vagina, testicles, labia, clitoris, breasts... Get comfortable with the real words and teach them to your kids.  
A guy was at a park masturbating at around 10pm at night, and I was the first to respond...  Called another unit to help me, saying he was resisting arrest, (which he was...)... and I made the other unit arrest him... we wore gloves.  Thankgod. 
Not a cop,  But my college friend told me he walked in on an od'd crack head that had microwaved her own newborn daughter. 
Some sort of inter-dimensional being must have put that cocaine in the center console.  Or maybe the dude's truck roamed around at night trying to get high off human drugs.  Who knows?    Certainly not the man driving, who the truck was registered to, and who had a history of controlled substance arrests. 
Was at a restaurant with my uncle and cousins from far away.  First time visiting with them in years.  At the end of the dinner one of my cousins snuck off and paid for everyone as a nice gesture.  My uncle got irate yelling and complained that he wanted to pay his share because, and I shit you not, he has a movie ticket points Visa card and he was close to getting a free movie.  He argued and told off our cousin loudly in the restaurant over a few free movie points.  He would not drop it until he got our cousin to apologise to him for costing him movie points.  I don't think those cousins are going to fly down again any time soon. 
Not so much a tantrum but just an incredible rage incident.  I watched as a woman exiting an Einstein Bros Bagels looked into her bag and - in anger over some error in her order - perfectly frisbee'd an all grain bagel across the length of the store, over sitting customers, and beaned the cashier perfectly on the head.  Her aim was so impressive that none of us, including the cashier, could do anything but stare in silenced awe. 
My mother-in-law doesn't handle stress very well, she tends to start lashing out at people and starting fights for no reason.  On the morning of my son's 1st birthday party she started to lose it as we were running around getting everything ready before the guests arrived. She first cornered my wife and started freaking out over the thermostat and some other unrelated pointless crap, then found me and started a fight over the garage door (it needed oiling and I hadn't done it because I was busy setting up the party). Volume of the voice steadily increasing.  My wife marches up to her and actually sent her to her room to calm down, and she did it! She stayed up there for an hour while my wife and I finished putting up decorations. It is a memory I will cherish forever. 
I was a kid in a mall when I was able to shop by myself and saw a lady blow a fuse at some guy behind the counter.  Calling him names and what not just losing her shit.  He just puts up the palm of his hand and says, "Mam, I believe you are too irrational to deal with."  And then just pivots 180 degrees not facing her and ignores her.  Waits for her to leave and when she does, he just proceeds to say to the next person, "May I help you?"  Like nothing even happened.  I learned a lot from that guy in 1.5 mins. 
Had a patient family member that was super picky, constantly calling the nurses station, constantly coming out of the room to complain.   She was upset because she ordered a guest tray, wanted a cheeseburger, and it hadn't come up yet.   Another patient coded next door. So basically, patient was literally dying. All of us nurses left crazy lady to go to the code, and the lady went batshit, yelling YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT MY CHEESEBURGER! We ignored her lol.  
The parking garage near my work is a frustrating place. The monthly customers have a parking pass that lifts the gate to get in and to get out. The thing is, the pass and their sensor dont work. You have to creep up to where you think the sweet spot might be, wave your pass around, reverse and try again, curse a bunch, endure people behind you honking despite them going through the same thing..... frustrating.   Not surprisingly, I witnessed a grown man throw the most excellent temper tantrum I've ever seen. The gate wouldnt go up, and he just started screaming in his car and smashing on the horn, straight out of a movie. The worst part is is that the gate always seems to go up right when you reach peak rage. So he's yellin' away, and then the gate is just like "Alright, man. I'll open. Jeez." 
Some poor kid was taking too long at the ticket booth and a father began to get upset. Like, shouting and yelling at the top of his lungs upset. He then pulled his young son closer and said "See that kid? That's why you're going to be an attorney and he'll still be working here" - the poor son was super embarrassed and tried telling his dad it's okay, not a big deal, etc.  He apparently got rounded up by security later on and made an even bigger fuss and his wife went back to the ticket booth and outright called the kid a pussy for "telling" on the dad. Real classy family. 
When I was in high school, my boyfriend was planning on joining me and my friends for an indie movie night at my house. Boyfriend called me up to say that he couldn't make it because he had to watch his siblings, and I overheard his dad screaming, stomping and yelling at the top of his lungs. He kept calling me a 'stupid little whore' and a 'fucking waste of time'.   I should mention that I was 14. Who calls a 14 year old girl that?!  I ended up calling the police on him twice later; once when he punched his son in the face and another when he followed my mom and brother home. He wanted to 'teach her a lesson', we found out.   I don't wish pain on anyone, but if he died in a car fire I'd probably do a little dance.  
Back when I worked at 7-11 a woman came in for coffee, and i was out of decaf. so i offered to make her a fresh pot and she said that it wasn't good enough and she was already late, threw the cup on the ground and stomped out.  people, what a bunch of bastards. 
I used to work at McDonald's. One time a guy came through the drive thru and ordered chicken nuggets. We gave him his food and he drives off. A few min later, he comes in to the store and runs up to the counter ranting about how we forgot his BBQ sauce. My manager meets him at the counter, apologizes profusely and him some BBQ sauce packets (extra too, maybe 6-7 packets). He proceeds to throw them at her and the rest of us workers behind the counter. We all had BBQ sauce splattered on our uniforms, on the walls, equipment etc. After he ran out of ammunition, he ran out of the store and drove away like a coward.  I was 15 then and I pretty much lost my faith in humanity. 
I told a grown woman she could not pet my service dog while he was working. She got herself so worked up she started shouting, and told me that if I didn't want people to pet my dog I shouldn't bring him into the grocery store. I expect this sort of behavior from young children, and I also expect their parents to keep them under control. 
I worked the front desk at a hotel a few years ago.  A guest came to check in around 10pm and asked if he could get a room with 2 beds (he booked 1 bed).  I told him we were sold out of rooms with 2 beds.  Before I could offer him anything else, he took the bowl of apples we had at the desk and threw it against the wall.  Then he took his OWN laptop, threw it on the ground and started kicking it around the lobby.  Security came out promptly and told him he needed to leave, which obviously prompted more screaming and kicking.  Needless to say, he didn't stay at the hotel that night. 
When I worked at mcdonalds I was scheduled for an early morning shifts. This guy ordered a steak, egg, and cheese which wasn't something we batched cooked. The next three people behind him all ordered batched cooked items and got them before him. The guy proceeds to scream and shout and then get in my face. I tried explaining why but he was just screaming over me. The cook came out to try and explain hoping the guy would back down. We couldn't find our manager anywhere to try and get help.... His co workers slowly inched towards the door until they were far enough to just run. In the end he demanded a refund which the cook side fine please get in line and wait (ya he actually made the guy get back in line for the refund) as the guy is getting to the register his food was ready and he took it and left with no refund. Then the manager came out trying to figure out what was going on.... 
i work in retail, and i saw one woman literally flip her full cart over and walk out after her coupons wouldn't go through  it was actually extremely impressive now that i think about it, it must've had $150 of groceries at least 
Just landed in Orlando, picked up my bag and it was SHREDDED. I knew it was a cheap bag, just went to customer service to get a trash bag to hold my clothes so I could get to the hotel. Middle aged lady in front of me is going nuclear that the little ID tag was missing from her bag. No other damage. She'd had 2 connections, but that CSR better shit that tag right fucking now, how dare he lose the picture of her dog, rant goes past 5 min. I tap her on the shoulder and ask if this is really what sher spent money to go on vacation to do, held up my fucked up bag with shit falling out of it and said some off us have real problems. She stomped off without another word, I apologized to CSR for shitty people and asked for a trash bag. CSR hooked me up with a free Samsonite because of it.  *edit words 
I was recently driving on a small country road when I saw a traffic jam in the distance. I drove my motorcycle ahead of the traffic untill I saw two ladies facing each other in their cars. Both tried to pass each other, but neither wanted to make enough room for each other to make that possible. They could just drive forward and it would be over, but no, they just refused to pass each other and decided to just sit there and create chaos on this small road because they didn't want to drive on the small patch of gravel...         
I think it has to be when the ancient super market across the way was closing, because a new store had been built a mile away. They had this huge "everything must go sale."  I was scavenging for closeouts, as was everyone else.   At the checkout, a 60-something woman, was angry that "YOU PEOPLE"  didn't have what she wanted.  Then she proceeded to tell the cashier (in her 40's) she was "happy she was losing her job and she hoped she would become homeless." At somepoint she also called the cashier a "nincompoop."  The manager asked her to leave and she went on an incomprehensible tirade.  I just hope that old lady never walked into the new store because, the entire staff of the old store worked there too... and I strongly suspect they will remember her. 
Dude I was standing behind in line at the grocery store got pissed at the cashier for charging him by the pound for grapes. He was adamant that the listed price was for the bunch and was making a huge scene and getting nasty with the cashier. He asked me to come with him so he can show me (was within viewing distance from the register and I just wanted the line to move). We walked over to the grapes and he showed me the label and said "what does that say?" looking all proud. I pointed at the small text under the price and said "per pound." He got even more pissed and checked out talking shit the whole way through and left.     
A woman who was in her late twenties/early thirties, dressed in a business suit, who was literally screaming in the face of a poor security guard at Heathrow after having her half-finished juice box taken away and disposed of. 
The woman in the cubical across from me literally every day.  Examples:  Her new puppy wont sit quietly beside her for 2 hours at her kids baseball game.  The person who just called her wasn't 100% sure what they wanted and she has to work a bit with them find out.  Someone kindly asked for a response on the same day with multiple apologies for the short notice.  Her mother went to Vegas without her  (she's 35).  I got a review and she didn't. (I repeatedly explained that I arranged the review so I could make sure I was doing my job well as it was a new position to me).  All of the above and so many more all result in phone slamming, needing a smoke, swearing and omg usually crying in the ladies room.  We are a department of 2 so I get to pick up the slack. 
Disney World. Every single time I've been there.    Obscenely high prices. Crowds of some of the rudest people you will ever be shoved into. Mix in a healthy dose of heat / humidity / afternoon showers.   I have seen grown men and women snap in 17 different languages. 
Once had dinner at a restaurant with a group of people who'd been partying all day. Just after the meal was served, one guy cracked it about something and upturned the whole table. Food spilt, plates destroyed, dresses ruined, and he walks off down the road. To make matters worse, we all had to chip in to pay for the smashed plates and un-eaten meals. What a great end to fun day.  
I work as a lifeguard at a waterpark over the summer and some days can get REALLY warm. I once had a lady who was seriously angrily complaining to me that it was too warm outside, like somehow it was my fault that there was a heatwave that day.  
A little old lady in an unbridled rage absolutely red in the face screaming at a teenage Baskin Robbins employee, because she wanted $0.10 off a $0.99 ice cream cone. The deal was only available on Sundays and it was Thursday.   She made us wait in line behind her while she argued over a dime. The cashier couldn't do anything because the register was electronic and wouldn't apply the discount.  I was about to pay the lady in loose change to move along, but someone stepped in to assist us off to the side. We were in and out in a few minutes, and the irate octogenarian was still raging when I left. 
I had a grown adult roommate who was mad because her parents (who gave her $1000 a month *in addition to* paying her rent, phone, car, and grocery bills) would not give her an additional $600 a month.  Meanwhile, I'm a grad student who makes $10,000 a year and have been supporting myself since I was 19.  She was sobbing when I came home, and I was very worried and asked her what was wrong.  She had been crying for half an hour, and finally told me the story and asked me for support, saying, "It's just not fair that I have to live like this, am I right?"  I responded, "I literally cannot relate to you" and walked out of the apartment because I wanted to smack a bitch. 
Someone opened a window on the bus and some guy went nuts, stood up and slammed it shut and starting giving everybody a lecture how this guy should consider everyone else. We of course all english told him to stfu and opened the window again. 
Watched a woman at a rental car counter have a nuclear meltdown because the employee couldn't rent her a car since her license was expired. Her rationale was that even though it was expired, the license still showed who she was. 
In the office I work in, there is a bin behind my desk/pod, whatever you want to call it. Its been there a long time and people use it to put their tissues in when they come out of the toilet.  Someone moved it to a different position, and there was a banterous discussion for 5 minutes about how it doesnt matter where it is. During this, the woman who sits on my table who is normally quiet yanked off her headset, launched it at the guy sitting next to her (thankfully not me), stomped over to the bin, took it back to its normal position (we have many bins in quite a small office it really wasnt a big deal) and then proceeded to scream at us till she went red in the face about how we are being childish.  EDIT- having read this its a little bit underwhelming but I took the time to write it so fuck it  
The ex wife screaming "I fucking hate you and I hope you fucking die of cancer." that time I accidentally threw away an apple.  Damn, I love being single.  
We were in a shoe store where a woman was trying on multiple pairs of shoes. The salesman kept bringing her pair after pair to try on. (It was a challenge for him because the lady was obese and could barely see the shoes on her feet.)  Finally, he said, "I've shown you practically every style shoe in your size that we have in stock. Do you like *any* of them?"  She grabbed a high heel from one pair and threw it at him, hitting the salesman in the chest. She yelled, "I wouldn't buy shoes in this store if you paid me!" - and stormed out the door. 
Driving up to my first day of high school, someone pulled up next to my father and tried to fight him for (driving recklessly) and even yelled at me, a 14 year old kid, for being a part of it.  
My best friend's husband and father of her child pitches the biggest fits over the smallest things (she cooks, he wants junk food instead; she asks him to hold the baby so she can answer the door). I love her dearly, but his behavior has caused me to distance myself quite a bit lately. 
My great grandma faced this issue.  My great grandfather was "missing: presumed dead" in World War 1.  They held a memorial for him, then she met and started dating someone else.   In 1919, he just wanders back in at the back door of the house (with a withered left arm and a wound stripe).    Great grandma split up with the new guy and carried on with my great grandfather, who ended up dying of appendicitis during the second world war.   
My dad died when he was 45 from a heart attack. My mom was 42. My mom started dating about two years after his death.    Before she died at 56 years old, 14 years after my dad died, she said if he were to come back she would choose him in a heartbeat. She even had dreams of him walking through the door all those years later.  No one in her eyes measured up to him.  
My dad died and left my mum behind at age 40 something. She's currently with one of his work friends after their relationship grew out of the grieving. I'm happy for her. Shes happy. But she would choose my dad every time. I feel for the guy because she's still grieving 3 years later. All her fb posts are about him and remembering him and photos of him. I assume he's understanding, but I still feel.for him.  
I wasn't married but might as well have been. We were together for 6 years and wanted marriage, just too young and waiting til we were ready for it. Then she was in a car accident. 4 years have passed, I've since had a couple relationships, more loves, and my life is generally happy, but nothing compares to her. If she were to come back right now, I'd choose her in a heartbeat.  
I couldn't imagine losing my wife she leaves for work soon, I'm gonna go hug her in the shower with my clothes on now. 
My dad's friend happily married had kids but wife dies fairly young. The kids are fairly young so he decided to raise the kids by himself. Years go by and he manages well kids grow up turn out smart and get married. He never married anyone for the shear love he had for his wife. However at age 50, he realizes that life gets lonely after the kids are all grown up and getting married so he married a widow and they are happy. They both have infinite love for their previous SOs but they are happy with each other aswell.  I guess, it's really a matter of whether or not it works as well as it did before.  
My mother has been widowed twice and I have a recurring dream that my dad comes back to life and I have to explain to him all that's happened since his death and mum's remarriage. I fucking hate that dream. 
My fiance died at 22. If he were to come back now, several decades later, I think we'd be strangers to each other. I am a very different person now.  If he turned out like his siblings, I wouldn't even want a relationship with him, honestly.  
I'm a widower dating a widow.  It hurts even to read this question.  EDIT (7 hours later because of some of the absurd things I've seen in my inbox):  To those who are replying with "so who would you choose," or "what's your answer," or the like, you obviously aren't understanding it at all.  Which is not surprising; it's one of those things that you just can't understand unless you've been through it.    But there is no answer to the question.  It doesn't exist.  As someone else pointed out, it's as if someone had asked a parent with one dead child and one living child which one they'd rather have.  It's a completely nonsensical question. 
Boyfriend died about a year and a half ago at 18. Would I take him back if he were to come back right now? Absolutely, no hesitation. In 30 years? I don't know. We might have ended up growing into two completely different people and it wouldnt have worked out anyway. I like to think it would, but that's just my morbid wishful thinking.   I really miss you Brandon. Hope you're doing ok wherever you are.  
I lost my husband a couple years ago after 20 years. I could never remarry.  
This reminds me of what Betty White once said on Larry King. Her husband (Allen Ludden) had died of stomach cancer and she was asked whether she would remarry, to which she said "Once you've had the best, who needs the rest?" 
I'm the fiance who has had constant suicidal idealization and attempts since childhood (currently 26). I'm always looking yet another reason to live, and all these heartfelt comments really struck a cord with me. I know I'm not the intended audience, but thank you. 
I'd be more curious as to which partner they'd want to be buried next to. 
My husband committed suicide after we'd been married a little over a year and our baby was six months old. I am still furious. I am single and not looking but if he came back now, I'd tell him to take a hike. If he came back 10 or 20 years from now, I might have forgiven him.  
My grandfather was killed in WWll. My grandmother didn't remarry until her four children were all grown up, almost 20 years later. Her second husband wasn't the sort of husband I imagined my grandfather would have been, but he wasn't the worst husband either. When my Nan was in a residential care home suffering from dementia, she only ever spoke about my grandfather (by this time my step-grandfather was a little senile and, thankfully, never noticed she wasn't talking about him).  I often wondered, if there is a heaven, what was going to happen when she was reunited with my grandfather? 
A little different answer, but someone posted about how when your partner dies, you can be at the height of your relationship and that will never be resolved.   My ex husband decided when our daughter was a baby to start transitioning into a woman. It was due to a lot of factors, but I ended up moving away and we got divorced. In my head I feel like he died because that person doesn't exist anymore, but I'm still sharing custody of someone who looks and thinks and jokes like my ex husband.   I haven't been able to really date anyone seriously, really. But when I do, I'll be faced with my 'dead partner' and my new one every day.  
This exact thing happens in the Netflix show, Glitch. It's worth a watch, there's only one season at the moment but it explores an interesting concept. 
not quite answering the OP, but a friend of my Dads had a wife and a mistress - inevitably they found out about each other and ended up running off together, leaving him on his jack jones.  There is a moral to that story but i am not sure what it is 
You guys should check out Glitch (TV series)   The dead come back from their graves, and one of the main characters has this scenario happen to him 
I never meant to cause harm. Please don't hurt me. 
That's about the time that you convert to Mormonism and get your own TLC show, Zombie Sister Wives.  
It's a little early in the night to be asking serious questions like this....  
as a kid i always worried what would happen when my gran got to heaven and her first husband (my Grandad) and her second would be there. I was rooting for my Grandad.  Then i realised that there is no heaven. 
Gangs murdering people who flash their headlights as part of a 'gang initiation' 
Rainbow parties. There was a big hubbub in the news a few years back about teens having get togethers where the girls would wear different colored lipstick and go around blowing all the guys until their wangs were rainbow colored. There is not a single confirmed case of this ever happening even once. 
Dangerous trends that bored and paranoid stay at home moms spread around like syringes in ball pits. Maybe it's happened once, but that's not something worth spreading around the internet like as if some international super villain syndicate is banding together to drop syringes into all of the ball pits around the country. 
I used to work at a computer tech support firm. Held the job full time for 3 years, back to back calls...  My confession...    Our customers weren't nearly as technically illiterate/ rude as me and my colleagues made them out to be. Actually, 99% of our customers were kind and just wanted help.   I guess 'exaggerated stories of the call center' just made for good smoke break conversation; its like a right of passage in the phone support world.  We sometimes received a rude customer, but chances were that they had just been worn down from an earlier call with an inexperienced employee. Rarely did we get the entitled prick, and when we did, he/she was always pretty easily taken care of. 
I hear more people complain about other people saying "new year new me", than I've ever heard someone say "new year new me."  
A cashier giving someone a weird look because of an item they bought or commenting on items they're buying together.  Never worked as a cashier but I'm pretty sure they don't care what you buy and 'Hi how are you, find everything you were looking for?' is code for 'hurry and pay for your shit then get out' 
The "war" on Christmas. Pretty much everyone loves Christmas and celebrates it in North America, or at the very least, tolerate it.  
Baby boomers like my parents getting all angry because they think that everyone is offended by something they are doing.  No one cares that you say 'Merry Christmas', no one is offended by your flag, and no one cares if you believe in god.  They are constantly pushing back against this perceived oppression.  It doesn't exist.  Stop telling me to 'share if you aren't ashamed to say Merry Christmas'. 
All I'm saying is that when I stopped going on subreddits and watching videos talking about social justice warriors, after a month I completely forgot about them. I'm sure once in a blue moon you'll run into one without looking for them, but otherwise they barely exist to me. 
Claiming that the POTUS will hijack democracy and stay president when their 2nd term is over.  Some claimed that dubya would do this. Similar claims about Obama. If Trump manages a 2nd term, most likely someone will claim the same about him. 
Hooking up with someone and getting a card that says "Welcome to the world of AIDS". I'm pretty sure these stories were presented by pastors at church to promote abstinence. I mean, if you have HIV or AIDS and don't disclose it to a sexual partner I'm pretty sure that's a felony.  
"Ugh, I got a raise and now I'm in a different tax bracket so I make less"   Nice humblebrag, moron. That's not how taxation works in the US.    
People getting Taco Bell shits. Smh y'all just got weak stomachs... 
Not being allowed to say "Merry Christmas" anymore. So often this is used as an anti-pc argument and though I'm sure it has happened in a couple of customer service environments, it's way overblown.   
I've read stories about people (women) yelling at men for holding the door open for them.  I don't know if that's *never* happened, but where I am I'm willing to bet it's never happened.  I'm a woman, and I hold doors open for everyone. Most people I know do. It's common courtesy.  
Its like 10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife.   NEVER HAS ONE PERSON ACCUMULATED THAT MANY SPOONS. 
Your gay marriage corrupting my kids and turning them into sexual deviants who are okay with marrying a horse and other terrible, terrible stuff.    
I'm always wondering why the people most afraid of terrorism are the ones who live way out where the buses don't go and almost certainly don't regularly spend time with people who don't look an awful lot like themselves. 
The mythical welfare queen in front of them in line at the grocery store buying $700 in steak with food stamps before getting in their brand new Escalade.  Like, welfare fraud exists but it is so statistically small/infrequent that it's extremely unlike that people see it anywhere near as much as they claim to.  
I worked as a tower hand for a construction company.  I used to take of my lanyard and move between booms(500-600feet up.)  I also would slide down the outside legs untethered because it was faster than climbing down the ladder.  I cringe when I think about that there was zero chance of survival if I fell.   
Timeshare presentation. I now know what hell is like. 8 hours of my life I'll never get back.   And of course the "free trip" was impossible to get. "We will call you on Monday sometime in the next two months, then you need to fly out on Tuesday and come back Wednesday."  
Back in the days before soft contact lenses you were supposed to clean them with hydrogen peroxide and then use a special neutralizer tablet afterwards.    I forgot to use the neutralizer before I put my contacts in.  Hydrogen peroxide in your eye HURTS! 
I went down in the pantry of my grandma's house and ate 45 year old peaches from a jar. did you know the human body is capable of shitting peaches in roughly the same consistency they were consumed? Me either. 
Asking a woman when her baby is due.  Doesn't really need a story. It went as imagined. 
I don't drink Southern Comfort anymore, I don't remember why and that's part of the reason. 
Elementary school age. During the 80s. My great uncle gave my dad a jug of homemade wine. He put it right next to the apple juice. I got lit up despite insisting that this apple juice tasted weird. Went off to school.  I'm never drinking wine again.  
Loaning money to a friend.  Lost the money and the friend. Not a very good deal  
Every man eventually learns the lesson that muscle rub should never be used to treat a groin pull or similarly place ailment.  
103 temperature, sicker than a dog from the flu and constipated. I was miserable. I took 4 "fiber" pills in the morning and had hallucination fits for the next 4-5 hours. Desperately trying to get some sleep, I took an ambian sleeping pill (extra strength).   Woke up 9 hours later not constipated anymore and having to do a shit-load of laundry. 
Hmmm i wonder what's inside the medicine capsules? What if i just eat that directly instead of swallowing the pill? (Empties onto tongue and promptly gag) 
Just came back from a three-week backpacking trip with FIVE other people. Trip was just originally just three others (my bf, brother and cousin), but two friends wanted to join. Jesus Christ. You gotta keep those trips intimate. And preferably, with family. The two add-ons didn't want to do any of the same stuff we did, couldn't keep up, didn't want to try any local food, complained about walking, only packed flip-flops, commented after thirty minutes at the Louvre that it was "just a buncha paintings", etc. etc. etc. Worst mistake. The original squad all chanted "never again" at least fifty times each the entire trip. So yeah. Never again.  
Had a Baconator for lunch and dinner three days in a row. I was working long shifts and there was a Wendy's across the parking lot from where I was.  After I finished dinner on day three, my body says:  **YOU MUST SHIT NOW!**  I shit my pants running to the bathroom. Had to clean up, and head back to work with no underwear.   0/10, though I occasionally went to work commando on hot days after this.  
Cave exploring.    The serious kind - with lights, helmets, and occasional crawling.       Fascinating while you're doing it,  but scary as hell in hindsight.    Ample opportunities to get seriously injured or worse,  in the last place in the world you'd want to be rescued from.     
What I wish was a "never again" story?  Masturbating after forgetting to wear gloves while making spicy salsa from scratch.  Current count: 3 times. I am an idiot. 
was younger and way more stupid.    got the chance to score meth and decided to get some to see what the hoopla is all about. Loaded all .3g that i bought and chased the white dragon.     Spent the next 22 hours alternating between jerking off and being on all fours all around my house trying to find meth crumbs behing the fridge that must've mysteriously gotten there while i brought the baggie from the front door straight to my room.   Shit's nasty mane. 
I was reading the tea tree oil is anti-bacterial. I wanted to use it around my eyes since I recently had a tiny put painful infection in my eyelash gland.   I DID NOT read that it has to be diluted.   I was beat red around the eyes.. the burning would not stop, dish soap and icing helped. It looked like I just got hit in both eyes.    Fuck you tea tree oil.  
My boyfriend's father gave us two bags of smoked venison sausages his friend made. We froze one and left the other in the fridge. I guess because it was smoked I couldn't tell when it spoiled, so one day I have some, and not 20 minutes later I almost crap my pants. I ran to bathroom, and while I'm pooping out my soul I just start vomiting into the sink, which was luckily right next to the toilet. I spent the whole day in there spewing smoked vomit and poo, and I haven't eaten anything smoked or venison since. 
I trusted a fart once.. Horrifically shat my pants.. Never again.  
I was taking a trip to London and saw it was so much cheaper to start my flights in Dallas (5 hours away). So I drove there, left my car, and took my trip. Everything went awesome. I figured I could get back to Dallas after sleeping on the plane and just drive home which was a dumb idea and I eventually gave up and got a hotel I left while it was still dark, driving through Oklahoma, and I saw a storm in the distance. Of course I got stuck in that storm in the middle of nowhere. I couldn't pull over, and there wasn't any place to stop, so I had to power through till I hit the next town. It was raining and hailing so hard I couldn't see, my car would occasionally lose traction, and the radio informed me there was a tornado watch in an area near me. It was one of the most terrifying experiences I've been through. I made it to the next town and got myself a victory McGriddle and swore I would always pay the extra money to fly out of the smaller airport near my home town. 
Long story short I made a batch of pot brownies with a good ounce of weed. I was a freshman in high school, and had no idea what I was doing. I ate a brownie and felt noting so I decided they were weak and ate the whole batch. Needless to say, that night I was moonwalking with Michael.  No seriously, I was so stoned. I was on the ground and I could literally feel my thoughts (does that make sense? Idk) and I couldn't move. I didn't even know if I was breathing. I was high for what seemed like the next 2 days  
I let my husband convince me to get pregnant.   NEVER. AGAIN  I mean, I love my daughter. But being pregnant was terrible. 
I walked up an escalator that was going down cause I was too impatient to go down then up again turned around to look at my mum. Fell. Had 4 holes in my leg. Only realised cause my leg felt wet(blood was trickling down it). Now I don't walk on escalators and am terrified walking on broken escalators that aren't moving  
Started smoking for like a month this year. At first I thought I liked it. But then I realised it was a temporary effect, which just left a terrible taste in my mouth. Sports and singing also became harder. So I dropped it immediately. Never again. 
Second post in this thread.  The blazing wing challenge at Buffalo Wild Wings.   I decided to order the hottest hot wings B-dubs has to prove to my friend that I could eat more than him. I think we each started with 6 or so. He bitched out after two wings, I had already finished mine. It was painfully hot.  To add insult to injury I decided to finish my friend's wings so I could talk a bunch of shit to him while I did it. The others in our group were cheering me on and I powered through it. The burning didn't leave my mouth until I got home.   It's true what they say about "shitting fire" after eating food that hot. The following day was spent on the toilet. Cheap beer and mega hot sauce explosion of fire out of my ass. It hurt so much I didn't know that kind of pain was even possible.   I still really like hot sauce though.  
Once I hooked up with a girl who claimed to be actively practicing a number of pagan rituals and religions, and also was somehow Buddhist. Ended up being nuttier than a squirrel turd, tried to put a curse on me and stuff like that. Never again! As silly as it might be I will always ask someone prior to sex if they claim to be or have at any point considered themselves to be "spiritual" beyond your basic belief in God.  
I will never again attempt to enter a friends with benefits arrangement. My heart can't take it. I'm in my 40s and lied to myself for a long time about how I enjoyed it. Better to learn the lesson late than never, I guess.  
I know you are hurting right now, but things will get better. 
"I can't believe how expensive this is. Nice box though." 
"I always loved how she looked with that pearl necklace." 
"I wish you hadn't brought the children. How are we supposed to explain this?" 
"Who's the stiff one?"  "Quicker we gets this thing over the quicker we can go and eat."  "Damn that's a big box."  "Praying ain't gonna make it hurt any less."  "Don't just lay there like a cold dead fish."   
My parents met because my dad went up to my mom, grabbed her ass, and said "last night was fun..." - turns out my (party animal) aunt had been at a party and boned my dad the night before. My (extremely prim and proper) mother was mortified and ran away. My dad saw my aunt again later and was like "what was THAT this morning?" and my aunt had to explain. He later saw my mom and apologized and about 5 years later they ran into each other again and he made sure he knew which one she was when they started talking.   Dad and aunt now hate each other.  
My wife's identical twin sister is the most annoying person ever.  Funny, after identical twin my iPhone suggested the rest of the sentence.  
I was talking to a twin and I asked her out to a movie date, she brought her twin and when we were chatting after the movie I realised I liked the other one's personality better and dated her. It was a little awkward after that 
I actually dated an identical triplet. Thankfully they all had very different styles and kept different hair colors, so I never got my girlfriend confused with her 2 sisters. I'd be a liar if I said the thought of a foursome with 3 different variations of my girlfriend never crossed my mind.  
It's not as confusing or tempting as anyone may  think. They look the same ( my parents still mix them up after 10 years) but different personalities. Fun fact, my brother ended up with her twin anyways! 
Girl twin here! Just on the other side of things, I can't tell you how difficult it was to find someone who wasn't completely infatuated and intrigued by my twin and I. Almost all of my relationships, my SO would somehow get in touch with my sister and ask for nudes. It's always been extremely hard on me, and I have a lot of self esteem issues in result. To cope with it, I just get out of the situation and remind myself some people are just the way they are, and that means there will be someone who is good enough to see and want my identity only.  
I briefly dated a twin and she once said to me "so if you didn't know me at all, but you knew my sister instead you'd be going out with her not me right?" The truth is yes obviously I was physically attracted to both of them since they were identical, and you cope with it by knowing the person you're dating on a deeper level, obviously more than just thinking about her looks and body. At least for me that was it. 
My buddies father has an identical twin, his mother has an identical twin, and they are married to each other... both guys to both girls. Its really fucking weird.   **edit**   damn that comment blew up, so many questions, ill tackle a few;  - only one set had kids (my friend and his sister) so no idea if they would look alike if they both had kids  -his aunt/uncle hooked up at the wedding of the first two... - yes they go to twin conventions - didn't know them well enough to ask the swap question - they lived 3 doors down from each other in a cookie cutter development, with the same layout (this really weirded me out) - 
Dated a girl who has an identical twin, Weirdest thing that happened was when i came to pick her up at her place, i thought she was the one who answered the door, called her babe and leaned in for a kiss, she shoved her hand to my chest and said "Woah! i'm not chelsea". It was goddamn awkward after that. Told my SO what happened and she laughed her ass off. 
I dated a girl with an identical twin sophomore year of college.  It was hard to tell them apart (even for their parents) - they even dressed alike and ate the same type of food and listened to identical music.  The attraction was there equally. But the girl I was dating said, "Think of us as 2 dishes of identical ice cream - you can stick your spoon into one, but not both." 
I dated a twin, I never messed them up which was good, but there was this one time my girlfriend asked me if I wanted to play a game, I said sure.  She showed me a bunch of old pictures of her and her twin sister and asked me to figure out which she was.   I'm thinking, fuck I better know, this is probably a test, but I ended up getting really lucky because she seemed to almost always be the one in pink or the one on the left lol.   I asked her if she could tell, and she said no, she just memorized where she was, if it was her first time seeing them, she never would have been able to guess correctly each time.  Idk what kind of chance she thought I had or if she just wanted me to suffer, luckily I was pretty good at the game lol 
I'm a woman married to a female twin. Her and her sister do look a lot alike in the face and body wise, but have always had extremely different styles. It's easy to tell them apart because my wife has long, curly natural hair and her twin keeps hers short, plus it's dyed and straightened.   The most confusion is when we are together. Not because of the way they look, but because they also happen to have a very similar voice. If we are all hanging out, my wife and I, her sister and the husband, whenever one of the girls says babe my brother-in-law and I both look.   Upon first meeting them, I actually saw the twin I'm not married to first. I thought she was cute, but didn't get gay vibes so imagine my delight when there was a single, gay replica. Nowadays, they are both still very attractive, but of course my wife is more beautiful to me because I'm in love with not only her looks, but her soul, her personality, and all her little quirks.  
My best friend (a dude) had a twin sister that I always had the hots for, but I couldn't bring myself to ask her out because she looked too much like him. It was hot-kward. 
Currently dating a twin who lives with his twin brother. I'm not attracted to his brother and I'm not really sure why, they're very similar in personality and interests. His brother's girlfriend however, has been weird/jealous about me dating her boyfriend's twin from the start.  
I dated a twin when I was younger. She presented herself much differently than her sister, so it wasn't usually a problem. My gf had long dark hair and dressed like a hippie; her twin had short red hair and dressed a little girlier. Both were gorgeous, but I was much, much, much more attracted to my gf than her sister, so I was never conflicted.  Anyway, one night my "gf" comes out to meet me. It's dark. She's wearing a hoodie. I put my hands on her hips and go in for the "hello" smooch, and she just dies laughing. "I'm not XXX, dumbass," my gf's twin says. We got along well, so there was no drama, just laughs (including from my gf and her twin's bf).  
This is very similar to the "which one of us is Hikaru game" 
To all of the people saying that the other twin was a jerk, let me shed some light.  Sometimes guys will be standoffish to their brother or friend's significant other so that they aren't perceived as being competition for said mate. Probably doubly so for twins where attractiveness is equal. It's just a way of keeping a relationship out of the way of friendship or family.  
How do you cope? They are identical. Just pretend you're fucking the sister. Done.   
Not quite the same but my girlfriend looks exactly like her mom from the back. Not attracted to her but have definitely called her babe a few times. Super awakened.  
I used to date a girl with a twin, like both of them were 10/10. the threesome question was always on my mind and one day I got drunk enough to ask. If you don't ask you don't get, turns out she was down for it and her twin was an all around great guy. 
Got a call on my phone from an unknown number - I was at my laptop, so I typed the number into Google and hit enter (this was years ago before Google started futzing phone # searches), and when it didn't load immediately, I went ahead and answered it.   Turned out to be a tech from work who needed help accessing one of my systems. I walked him through it, then turned back to my laptop.  The top hit on google for his phone# was a craigslist ad for gay erotic massage. And it wasn't a wrong number - it had a couple months of ad history and even though there were no face pics, his unusually hairy arms and a small tattoo were easy to identify.   I kept that story to myself for a few years, only relating it after I left the company. I told the story at a bar with some old co-workers, not knowing that this guy's wife was friends with one of them.   Anyway... my bad.  
Bit of a twist  I caught my exes ( there was two, two separate times) escorting on backpage.  Ive been single since the second time. I dont trust my judgment  
Two wives of clients knew about me because their husbands flat-out told them, under the sad misapprehension that once they were divorced, we'd be free to have an (unpaid) relationship. The first time, I was flattered, conflicted, and saddened. The second time, I was pissed off. You threw your happy homelife away because you just /hoped/ some college girl was going to ride off into the sunset with you?   Now I only do 2 hour maximum sessions, because I've found that clients who book overnights or full-day sessions are the most likely to lose their grasp on the reality of the situation. Somehow, sleeping next to someone is more intimate than fucking them, and it makes these men confused. 
At this strip club I worked at one of the dancers had a daddy that came in legit almost every day he actually was good looking and charming. His wife saw his car in the lot and pulled in and tore past the bouncers and ran into the VIP area. They were back there it came to seconds of them getting caught. She didn't get her tip that day so he tripled it the next time out of guilt.  
When I was pro-domming, I had a great client--one of my favorites. He was this older guy, worked in construction, who liked to be dressed up like a pretty girl and humiliated. This is an incredibly common fetish and easy money.  For his 60th birthday, he decided he wanted to try getting pegged. That wasn't something I'd do for just anyone, but we had good rapport and the idea delighted me so I went ahead and made him my bitch for the evening. He loved it, we had a great talk afterwards about how liberated it made him feel. How, as he got older, he wanted to try new things, and how he wished his wife could understand and be adventurous with him. This is not an unusual conversation.  What IS unusual is that the guy apparently told his wife. I got a nasty email telling me to stay the hell away from "her man." I never responded and never heard from him again. I hope they made it. 
Friend of mine is a male sex worker  & massage therapist who mostly sees other males.   It's not uncommon to have sessions with married and ::cough:: "straight" guys.   One lady found out about her husband seeing my friend (I don't know how) and came down to this place screaming and carrying on, banging on the door, claiming he enticed this guy into homosexuality, etc.   oooookay, lady.      The next day they found someone spray painted  FAGOT (their spelling not mine), SLUT and some bible verse about homosexuality on the front door of warehouse space.   The thing is, my friend didn't live there, just rented the out the space by the hour for these sessions.     
Not a girl, but about a year ago one of the guys I was seeing paid extra to film a meeting with his phone. Apparently he had never told his wife he was into guys, and he had definitely not told her he was banging one. About a week after our meet I got a text from his number saying it was his wife and to never contact him again. Never did learn if they worked it out or not but I'm guessing it didn't go well  
Had a super tall Jewish fellow who was a regular.  Super sweet guy;  he was he kind of guy who would bring me food or run errands for me..bring me soup and Gatorade when I was sick.. sometimes just see a movie.  Anywho, his wife called from his number and politely asked who I was.  I just said I worked for Marriott hotels and wanted to see if she would be interested in a free, all expense paid vacation package, which she immediately hung up (I'm not very creative).  I guess she either figured it out or googled my number.. I haven't heard from him in over a year.  It sucks, clients can sometimes turn into your best friends, regardless in the nature of the work. 
Well I was 16, and stupid on drugs so it didn't occur to me what I was doing was bad. but... the police caught us and while my dad came to pick me up from the hotel I passed by the SO and his kids yelling at him while hes in handcuffs. 
Nice try to get the usernames of all 'Escort girls of reddit'. 
Not me, but a friend had been having an affair with a married guy for 9ish month. He said he was leaving his wife, but always came up with an excuse not to do it. Then one day, my friend was staying at his house when the wife showed up early from a business trip. She walked in and pulled a gun, aiming at her husband.  This broke out into a huge fight/scramble where I guess the guy tried to tackle her. He failed to pull her down but managed to knock the gun out of her hands. So my friend ran and picked it up and turned to see them screaming and trying to tear each other apart.   When the woman saw she had the gun she turned and begged my friend to shoot her husband; saying he was a cheating bastard, etc. My friend just stood there (bare assed) holding it. She said she was tempted, but very quickly chose to walk out, grabbing her clothes on the way. She threw the gun in a dumpster outside their place and drove off, never seeing either of them again.  
Hi! Escort here!  I have definitely gotten a few calls/emails from SOs.  Some very angry, some eerily calm.  Once, a lady was very relieved that I was a pro, and it wasn't an emotional affair 
I worked as a masseuse for a bit. I was never caught per se but I had a good client who came in a few times and he even paid to hang out outside of the establishment. We were friendly and all of our relations were purely business related which he was fine with but one day I got an angry text from a girlfriend/wife/etc threatening to kick my ass. I noped right on out and blocked his number. Never heard from him again 
Happened to one of my close friends but in an ironic twist.   So she caught her fiance doing the dirty deed with an escort in their own room. Here's the ironic twist. The escort is my friend's best friend and my close friend is also an escort who decided to retire a little while before their marriage.  
Level 8 mage here.  Was paid to escort some Orc lady through a flooded settlement.  She hurt her ankle but it turned out she used to be a shaman  
My best friend is a sugar baby & a dominatrix. She had an issue with a client who's live in girlfriend found my friend's number in his phone. She called yelling, screaming, cursing, etc. My friend laughed it off, saying first of all I don't know who you are, second why are you mad at me, and third- I'm not the only gal.   Sad note-   A few months later the dude started bragging about how he was molesting the girlfriend's 14 year old daughter in Disneyland. Friend called the crazy GF and she did nothing. Friend called the police & CPS, but it turned into them interviewing her about her life choices vs a kid being abused.  
There was a children's clothing store in my home town called "Dumpster Baby". They must have thought they were being clever. They closed down after a month and reopened with a new name. 
There was a Chuck E Cheese type place in Lima, OH called the Squirty Worm. 
Local law firm is "Allen, Allen, Allen, & Allen"  Gets a little redundant. 
I once drove through a rough town in England and there were two newsagents next to each other. The original one was called The Shop. The one next door that was built later is called "The other shop" 
"Vic's Chainsaw Repair and Video Rental". Not dumb. Just a weird combination of business.  
I've once drove past a van on the highway in the Netherlands that said "Jens Beenhakker - Rolstoelverkoop". That loosely translates to "John Legchopper - Wheelchair vendor". I nearly caused an accident laughing about it. 
A restaurant called Jerk King.  I laugh every time I pass by it 
In my hometown there's a driving school called "Rape". Rape is a quite common last name in that area and they just called their school after their name. 
There's a gym down the road called Gym'll Fix It.   It's a play on a British TV show called Jim'll Fix It, where celebrity host Jimmy Saville made kid's wishes come true. Unfortunately, shortly after his death a few years ago he was outed as a hugely prolific paedophile, who'd abused hundreds of children over the decades. The name of the gym would be quite funny if it now didn't have all sorts of nasty connotations associated with it.  
There's a design company here that's called "Unicum." There's also a company called "Pussi" that makes cat food. Their slogan is "As good as it looks."  
Kum n Go. Pretty common gas station in Iowa. They sell hats. 
Bich N'ga.  I think it's some kind of Asian restaurant. I've seen them in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana.  
Feedler Roofing Company......cmon guys....Feedler on the Roof was right there for ya 
A shop local to me was called "Fergies". I asked inside one day why they were called that. Turns out the previous shop used to have a big sign up saying "Fruit and vegetables" and the new owner just made whatever word he could from the letters. 
Saw a cleaning van with two peoples last names then cleaners with a K.. it was something like this:  Kertzman &   Kleinberg   Kleaners  The van was white. 
'A All Animal Control'....  It's either not grammatically correct, or just dumb sounding.  
There's a sewage company close to me called "turd busters"  
I visited Chicago once and there was a watch repair place called "Jewel Restore".  It took me a minute. I don't think I've ever been more miffed in my life. 
No sure if it's dumb, but there's a Nemo Sushi in Plano Tx 
In Budapest there is an Irish pub called Publin. It's so simple yet so genius and while I acknowledged the fact that is the opposite of what this question asked, it was an opportunity for me to report my find.  
Literally any Barbershop or beauty salon found in a strip mall. They're all puns...and the worst kind...hair puns. 
I used to live near a shop in North London called 'Sale of Scarves and Showpieces.'  As far as I could tell it sold box files and ugly porcelain figurines of ladies.  
Seafood restaurant here called Dirty Dicks. Their slogan is also "I got my crabs from Dirty Dicks.  
A cafe near my house is called The Rustic Aristocrat. Cant stand the name. 
There is a liquor store here that's called "Best Beer" 
Have you guys seen that store Tuesday Morning? What is even the reasoning there? 
Microwave nachos. Chips salsa cheese. Power level 8 for 1:15ish so the cheese melts but the chips retain crispness  
Same as my go to broke meal. A glass of water and a nap. 
Shredded cheese sprinkled on crackers then microwaved. Top with hot sauce and either avocado or jalapenos.  Lazy, crappy nachos. 
Microwave an egg in a coffee cup....or fuck it peanut butter on a spoon 
4 slices of peanut butter toast. That shit is fucking good 
Most of these aren't nearly lazy enough. If I have to use the stove and cook something, it's already too much effort.  
Microwave a hot pocket (bacon egg and cheese) for 2 minutes. Go sit on the couch. Forget about the hot pocket in the microwave. Go to bed hungry 4 hours later. Wake up. Open the microwave to heat up yesterday's coffee. See hot pocket. Scoot it over and put coffee next to it. Heat both up. Cry. Go to work.  
I either:    Slice red peppers and dip them into a sauce, usually soyaki.    Or I heat up Dino-nuggets in the oven. I'm convinced chicken tastes best when in the shape of a dinosaur. 
A hot dog. Might even pop it in the microwave for 20 seconds if I'm feeling ambitious.  
Microwave a hot dog and wrap it in a warm corn tortilla. Tastes a bit like poverty, but still delicious. 
A horribly basic PBJ sandwhich. If there's no bread, I'll gladly just stick the spoon in both jars. 
Kinda lazy: grilled cheese  Lazy: ramen  Super lazy: cereal  Super duper lazy: order food  Super duper uper lazy: order food and willing to pay my roommate to meet the delivery guy (I live in an apt where it's one big building and unless you have the electronic key, you can't get in. So for delivery you actually have to go down 5 flights of stairs and meet them in the parking lot)   Edit (typo): There was no way to buzz in. It was university housing. You had to literally meet people down there. And it was like big bang theory, the elevator almost never worked. And I didn't give my roommate like $20 bucks. It was most like a drink or a cookie or something small AND this happened like 3 times in the past 2 years. Because I had just finished finals and literally wasn't leaving my bed  Edit 2: yes I know ordering food isn't homemade. But it is my ultimate lazy meal, so it counts in my book.  
I call it fake garlic pasta. Basically what you do is you make your pasta and melt some butter on it then dump a shit ton of garlic. Powder on top . Yes I am a college student 
Lately it's been baked potatoes. You heat the oven, throw in some potatoes, wait an hour and then boom. Done.   Sure you can step up the flavor/effort a bit and do things like coat it in olive oil/salt and a million toppings or make some awesome twice baked potatoes. But as far as lazy filling meals go, there's not much easier.  
My Dad invented something we call "Stuff". Brown off a pound of ground beef, season it to your liking, mash in half a bag cooked tater tots, mix in a couple handfuls of cheese, Serve in tortillas with salsa. It's ethereal. Like a culinary, white trash magic trick. 
When I'm lazy and am going to "cook dinner," it's spaghetti. Brown ground beef. Dump a jar of Prego sauce into the meat. Boil water. Add noodles. Done.   It takes very little time, and is "homemade" in that I warmed up each of the 3 ingredients, then put them together.   
Beans on toast.   (Edit : Heinz beans, original. From the UK).  
Kraft Mac and Cheese with cayenne and black pepper. 
Ramen. Then again, that's the only the thing I have to eat because my budget is very limited in college.  
Pound of hamburger,  box of mac and cheese and a can of Rotel=Bachelor Chow 
1) Aglio e Olio. Pasta, olive oil, a pinch of chili flakes and garlic - takes 20 minutes tops to cook, tastes great.   2) Scrambled eggs and a Bratwurst.  
It may not sound "lazy" but steak. Honestly all it needs is a bit of salt and pepper, and cook it for 3ish minutes each side on a cast iron skillet.  
Mexican  cereal.  pour salsa over chips.   eat with spoon  
A small bowl of Stove Top stuffing with some dried fruit and nuts added (raisins/pecans, cranberries/walnuts, cherries/almonds), made in the microwave.   A measuring cup, a spoon, and bowl to eat out of and about three minutes to dinner. 
Fry up a couple spoonfuls of fresh pico de gallo in an omelet pan until the oil starts to separate from it.  Add a couple beaten eggs; cook like a regular omelet.  Add shredded cheese and chopped cilantro, fold and serve.  Intense flavor, almost no work. 
Doritos dipped in whatever salad dressing I have. Bleu cheese, ranch, honey mustard...yeah that sort of thing.  
Mom let my hair grow into a typical 90s mullet. I was nine.  
I wore my frosted tips, with my button down Hawaiian shirts unbuttoned so you could see my wifebeater undershirt.   
I once wore my clothes backwards to a middle school dance because of Kriss Kross.  Yikes.   
I had a shirt with flames on it. Thought I was the most badass mofo my middle school had ever seen. 
Way too much hair gel. My hair was like a rock. This was 7th grade, circa 01-02.  
Hypercolor T-shirts  In theory, it was neat that parts of the shirt changed color with heat.  In reality, you always looked like you were sweating horrifically. 
Top to bottom, circa 1989  Mullet  Torn Guns N Roses tee shirt  Acid washed jeans  White high top sneakers 
I'm a woman.. as a teen in South Florida we all had this phase where we wore men's boxers hanging out of our pants. Even more embarrassing was a Winnie the Pooh phase somewhere in the middle of that, and also people were drinking regular beverages from baby bottles..for some unknown reason it was a thing. Embarrassingly, I did all of those things.  
I used to wanna be a scene kid, except I couldn't really afford all that type of stuff, so instead my best and I decided we were going to be 'new breed scene'. We literally dressed the same as we normally did but attempted our best scene kid hair, which was really just bands swooshed over our foreheads. MySpace angles and awful eyeliner, foundation so pale. I cringe when I remember. Also tried the whole ~gansta gurl~ phase. So much cringe.  
I used to wear two different styles of converse at the same time, most often it was orange on one foot and purple on the other.  
When I was in middle school, I had just seen The Matrix and Hackers. I was very interested in computers and was friends with the goths and punks. I learned about Cyberpunk from the infamous Jargon File, and decided to 'go' cyberpunk.  My mom worked at the mall, so I spent summers there. I shopped at various stores to buy things like cargo pants, boots, and shirts with weird materials and grew my hair out. Ordered a few linux and hacker tees. Started wearing welding goggles and carrying my laptop everywhere.  Got back to middle school and told this girl that I had a crush on 'You might be punk but I'm **Cyber**Punk!  Needless to say, it didn't go over very well. 
I had a rats tail. Spiked hair, shaved sidelines and a single long tail off of the back. It lasted through a lot of high school.  Also fluorescent shirts and pants. Like brilliant blues and yellows and greens with a lot of white. I don't regret the fluorescent at all though. I would wear that now. 
Jeans under my dresses. Not even skinny ones I'm talking bootcut  
wasn't a trend but i intentionally wore very contrasting colours together like pink and green. 
Feathers with stripes on it in your hair.   Glasses rims with no lenses.   The hot topic shirts with cute little cartoons on it that day some dumb shit like "I mustache you a question".  
When I was younger my mom would patch up my jeans and use this glue pen thing to draw pokemon on them.  
Those early 2000s jeans with around 5 chains on each leg. 
I used to wear cat ears, in elementary school. Not sure if that was an actual trend but it was definitely cringeworthy. 
Lots of black.  Band shirts.  Long hair    FYI, still the same, except everything fits better, and I cut my hair. 
Long keychain hangin out my pocket.     I still use them, just that I now tuck the chain in. I **hate** losing my keys. Whenever they are not chained to my trousers they fuck off. I think I must have offended the Queen of the Key Pixies when I was younger.     I can be in a house by myself, put my keys in the middle of the table, leave the room, count to ten, walk back in.....keys are gone.  
Tucking tracksuit pants into your socks.  This was before chavs, when there were two types of kids... Goths and Townies.  
80's...the so called "French Roll", you folded over the cuffs of your acid wash baggy jeans super tight and then rolled them up a few times for a taper so suffocating your feet would go numb. Very "cool" to wear a knit pastel sweater without an undershirt as well. Major cringe..... As a bonus, my hair style was called "The Side Spike", combed off to the side...one line of spiked hair along the hairline, COOL! Please down vote to oblivion, I feel so much shame. 
Cargo shorts and graphic tees... Except I'm also still wearing them currently. I can't help that I like comfort and the ability to store a great many things in my pockets.  
Bodysuits, the kind with snap-crotch  Also, "standing room only" jeans 
Leaving your shopping cart in a parking space because you're too lazy to lug your fat ass to the nearest cart station. 
Proposing at a wedding without the Bride and Groom's permission. Even then it's still iffy.  
Buying a patent not to use it, but in order to keep others from using it. (Not sure if illegal, but definitely a dick move). 
When someone on the subway takes up the seat next to them for their bag while loudly playing shitty music from a speaker. 
Using a public restroom and pissing all over toilet. Or leaving a massive shit and not flushing. 
Parking on the street in front of a house exactly in the middle so that nobody can park in front or behind you. 
Taking a parking spot that someone else had been waiting for.  
Persuading your Grandfather to remove your brother from his will so that all will be left to you. 
Saw Wonder Woman a week ago and not one, not two, but three God damn people brought babies in.  Two of them went off when the volume got loud.  Please people, leave em at home. 
treating minimum wage workers with minimum respect (for no reason other than they're working minimum wage) 
Trading away all my sheep then calling monopoly on sheep 
Filing for custody of your dog during a divorce then putting it down for no medical reason. 
Sticking your gum under the table at restaurants or bars. So nasty to catch a knee on that. 
Not re racking your weights/gym equipment.  Nothing annoys me more than having to go hunting for that extra clip or matching dumbbell. Or when you see someone finish their set and just leave the area without returning the item.   Scum 
Weaponizing custody of the children in a divorce.    
Neglecting your pets. I know in some cases there are animal abuse laws, but the amount of bullshit some people get away with doing to their cute fluffers that just want to give love is terrible 
Sitting right next to the people already there in an almost empty movie theater. 
Being that one person in a group project that contributes nothing and still tries to act like they did for the grade. 
Using the turn lane/off ramp to bypass a line of traffic before cutting back in. 
Tailgating. It may actually be illegal in some places, idk, but nobody really does anything about it. Either way, it's fucking obnoxious. Whenever it happens I just pull over and let that fuckstick drive ahead of me. 
When you call shotgun but someone else says challenge or some other BS. Bitch, I called it first. Live with it. 
Not taking your rubbish with you after a movie or similar event. Music festivals are particularly bad.  The kids working at the cinema are on minimum wage or less, don't make their life shittier because you are too lazy to take your shit to the bin that you pass on the way out. 
Telling your SO that you want to move out but stay a couple but secretly you fuck his brother, your coworker, Jim from Colosseum of Comics, your drug dealer, and your friend who went into the Marine Corps when he came back on holiday all in the span of a month while still kissing my lips and telling me you love me and picking out names for the kids we will never have   ps Lenny I know you browse Reddit and if I ever find you I'm going to break your arms  
Those parking spots with signs on them for "x parking only"? Only the handicapped ones are legally enforceable. The ones for expectant mothers and the like? You can park there and you're in the clear from a legal standpoint.      Kind of a real dick move, which is why I don't do it myself, but it's possible. 
For men, I'd say approaching a urinal immediately next to one that's currently occupied, when there are several other free urinals readily available WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS, LET ME URINATE IN PEACE YOU INCONSIDERATE FUCK. 
Going to a restaurant 10 minutes before they close.   I guarantee every employee is saying a silent "fuck you." 
How about treating anyone who serves you (Waiters, Waitresses, Store employee's etc.) poorly because you believe you're better than them. 
Buying the rights to life-saving pharmaceuticals, then jacking the prices up. 
not sure if this applies, but the MLM industry... most folks that get into it earn little to nothing (or negative returns, even)... 
Letting your kids fuck everything up in a public place and not cleaning up.  
Pay day loans with 1000%+ interest  Never been desperate enough (thankfully), but it is so shitty to lure people into a vicious cycle of debt 
Recording unknowing strangers in public because you think they're weird or funny.   My friend and I were having an interesting discussion in a fast food place. Of course my friend started talking excitedly during the discussion. Then, suddenly, he went completely quiet in the middle of a sentence and started looking at his phone. I thought it was weird, then he explained he wanted to leave the place. When we got outside he explained the girls behind us had start listening in and using their phone to record him on Snapchat. Fuck people who do that. We're allowed to fucking exist in a public space.  The discussion was also related to LGBT stuff, so double "don't fucking do that shit" there. 
Not cleaning up your dog's shit when it shits anywhere other than your own yard. 
Linking /r/thathappened on literally every fucking thread where someone said they did something, even if I was totally believable. You can say you went to subway for lunch and people will immediately call bullshit just because they can. 
People sitting in front of me pulling their airplane seats as far back as they possibly can while I'm eating with my tray down. That shit's not fun. 
Not turning off your bright lights for oncoming traffic. 
Bidding one dollar over the last person on the price is right.  
Asking any woman how far along she is on her pregnancy if you don't know her or she hasn't told you if she is pregnant. 
"I just wish I was fucking dead".   Overheard by complete chance while wandering the corridors during a free period. Turned right back around and took the long route so I wouldn't have to walk past the classroom. It was a bit of a broken pedestal moment for me, but I never told anyone else about it.    The teacher who said it was one of our most beloved History teachers, who we later found out had been stopped from committing suicide at least twice by one of the Deputy Heads (who'd been friends with him since their university days) in the past. Not stopped as in "talked things out and convinced him it wasn't the best way to deal with his problems", but as in "physically picked up and dragged away from the window". He (the Deputy Head) was quite intimidating as a teacher, but we gained a lot of respect for him after learning that. 
"How dare you write that, you're practically emotionally handicapped! It's psychopathic!"  Said to me at 12 not even half a year after my mom died. She made us write an essay about our home life (which in retrospect was a fucked up excuse to snoop into my situation) and didn't like how I used humor to cope so she pulled me out of the class to yell at me for 5 minutes for not being sad enough. I don't even remember what I wrote besides cracking some jokes about my dad's outfits. 
Age of 9, lost my father in a horrific accident. I returned to school a few days later and after attendance was taken the teacher said to me in front of the class "The class got together and sent flowers to your father's funeral, I paid your share so make sure you bring in $2 tommorow as I need to be paid back". She then went on with the lessons.  
Not really the worst but once in high school my teacher legitimately asked the blind girl in our class why she wasn't going up to check her grade on the grade sheet.  
My 8th grade science teacher would pick on this one girl in the front row. One time he was going to make a joke about her breath being so bad he could see it. Instead he said " I can see your breasts" to a 14 year old girl 
This wasn't said directly to me but... In middle school I had a teacher grab me from the lunch table and drag me to the principals office.  After grilling me for awhile and telling me I know what I did, they finally revealed to me that the teacher stated she witnessed me suggestively sucking my thumb while staring at a female friend of mine.    I was just biting my nail.    
My HS gov teacher told me I was faking an autoimmune illness and that I'd never make it anywhere with my laziness. She was trash. 
My science teacher in 7th grade called a Mexican kid in my class a fence hopper once during the middle of class.  
"Not all Mexicans are from Mexico. Some are from El Salvador." - BCOM professor 
not the worst ever, but it really fucked with me. "there are literally millions of other cute little Chinese girls just like you that are much better than you and can replace you" 
Okay I have one. When I was in elementary, I got confused at lunch time and threw my food out early and wandered outside for recess. (alone)  Realizing my mistake and having no idea what to do, I went back inside and told a lunch lady and asked what I should do.  She dragged me by the arm to the center of the lunch room with a live mic and informed EVERYONE of my mistake and how no one should do what I did because it was a bad bad thing. She told everyone I was going to get EXPELLED.  I was sobbing at that point. I kept asking her what expelled meant but she didn't answer me. All I knew was that it was a bad thing. I never told my mom until years later.  And no. I didn't get actually expelled.  
When I was about 9 our teacher asked the class what we wanted to be when we grew up. One kid said he wanted to be a bin-man (a garbage man, for US readers?). The teacher went into a rant, saying that jobs like these were for the lowest, most unintelligent people in society, and that he should aspire to be better than that. Finally she asked why he wanted to be a bin-man anyway. "Because my dad's one", said the kid, by now in tears.  
"You are incompetent, terrible, boy who has no decency and will never amount to anything in your life, I'll be surprised if you're even capable of finishing this year, let alone school!"   Very damaging to 9 year old me  
Wood shop teacher telling an Asian kid he doesn't really need to wear a face shield on the lathe.  You know, because of the eyes.  He meant it as a joke but  even at 15 we all kind of hushed and looked at each other like 'dude did he just fuckin say that?'    
Chemistry teacher that got annoyed easily with my class specifically: "alright fuck this, you're all going to fail this exam." People in my class would never shut up, and it was the last week of school so he was just done with us.  
When I was a senior in high school I had a teacher tell me that if I wanted to kill myself I had to "follow the highway, not cross it," while making cutting motions.  
Male teacher was talking about the dress code to me and a friend of mine during lunch. He stated he doesn't like "seeing a bunch of fatties in short shorts" but then gestured towards a thin girl in short shorts walking up the step and said "but that.. That I don't mind" 
1st day on the job teacher walks in as the new CAD teacher and his names on the board, it looks like you'd pronounce it Ass Man. He announces right away that it's not and that you will be thrown out of his class if you call him that. He does roll and gets to a French African name that looks like it might be pronounced for a gay slur starting with F. Does not use better judgement and uses that slur as a last name.  "It's pronounced fajjay Assman" kid obviously had to deal with this problem his whole life and was not keen on the mix up.  New teacher blows up, And is hollering at this 16 year old whose not backing down. Takes a bit but they both disappear. Teacher was never seen in the building again.  This was 1st period, 1st day of school.  
When I was 12 my teacher said my knitting had too many errors in it (it had 4) and ripped it to shreds. I was supposed to start all over again but excused myself and went to the bathroom where I cried for the rest of the lesson. 
"just because I'm on a diet doesn't mean I can't look at the menu"  - priest in a Catholic high school, after he was caught looking down a girl's shirt 
When I was in high school, a gym teacher came up to me one day towards the end of class when everyone was just kind of freely shooting basketballs and hanging out on the bleachers. I was standing by myself, and walked up and asked me something about the neighboring town. He said,  "Did you know that in Olney, they used to hang niggers with velvet?"  And then just walked away.  It was the only time he ever talked to me. I'm white and he was a black guy, maybe 6'8. I think he was in the NBA for one season or something. Everyone loved him so I guess he was just messing with me, but he got me pretty good.  
Mrs. Nudell, my 3rd grade math teacher. 1986.  I missed 2 weeks of school due to a horrible case of chickenpox and fell behind with whatever it was that we were working on.  A month after I came back to school, I was still struggling with math, but was too young and scared to ask for help.  We had a test that I failed.  So, Mrs. Fucking Nudell brought my 3rd grade self up to the front of the classroom and shamed me.  She told the entire classroom that "Buffywho will NEVER succeed in math."  I ended up crying and going to the nurse with a "stomach ache."  I'll never forget how awful she was to me, and I struggled with math for the rest of the time that I was in school.      
My 4th grade music teacher told us to shut the fuck up. She got fired.  
A teacher told the story of when he was working at a girls' summer camp: The showers had broken down and he had to go fix it for the girls who were mid shower. They had the girls put their faces to the walls for some reason. "Naked bums all along the walls." He told it as if it was a funny anecdote. I was creeped the fuck out and can't imagine how the girls who were going to said camp felt about the story. 
"It's impossible to rape a male.  If he gets a boner, he wanted it."  From a middle school government teacher. 
In tryouts for the school's annual Christmas play, the teacher directing the production denied the most talented and well-suited student the part of playing the "Virgin Mary" because the girl was black.  The teacher said the play would be criticized if a black girl were allowed to play the Virgin because "everyone knows that Mary was white - as God intended." 
One day in a history class my professor (who is at least 80 years old) was talking about bed fellows in Victorian England, and was saying how common it was for men to sleep together. He used himself as an example and said that he used to sleep with his grandfather all the time as a child. After he said that, though, he looked at the ground and said to himself, audibly, "I still wonder to this day if he molested me..." Then he looked back at us, shrugged, and said, "Oh well, too late to know for sure now!" It was fascinating to see someone overcome deep-seated trauma so quickly.  
One of my college professor straight up said one day "From my experience, African American students tend to drop my class the most. It's probably too hard for them. Any of you notice how we haven't seen that one black chick who used to sit in the front row for weeks now?"  Guy was immediately shot down when the "black chick" raised her hand from the back row saying she'd been here the whole time; she just moved to the back row cuz that's where her boyfriend was sitting.  
In (UK) year 11 (age 15/16). An English (literature) teacher once told my class: "Polar bears almost exclusively eat penguins".   I was not good at literature but I was good at science subjects and I was not this teachers favourite pupil. So when she said this I quite quickly argued back saying that she was wrong. She protested and I explained that polar bears live in that artic ocean and, while there are various species of penguin, none of them live in the northern hemisphere. This was an open argument during class and she offered to Google the answer. So she did and when I was proven correct by the Internet, she sent me out the class.  
"Now, gentlemen, *(uncomfortable pause, Under breath: Oh, right, they let girls in now.)* and Ladies."   Good save, teach.  Good save.    
"Your son is retarded" - Mrs. George, to my mom...right in front of me. Fuck you, bitch. I'm no genius, but I'm by no means unintelligent.  Turns out you were a lazy piece of shit unworthy of the title 'teacher'.  Luckily for me, Mrs. Galbraith was your total opposite. That woman was an angel. Wherever you are, Mrs. Galbraith, I love you. You are a fantastic teacher and a fantastic person. 
My theatre teacher in high school told me I was too fat to act unless I played the fat idiot sidekick, would never be in a musical, and that I wouldn't make it in the world of theatre. About a year later her husband cast me in a musical and one other show because he really liked me.   All of her comments for the 4 years I was in high school really fucked me up and made me rethink wanting to do theatre which is one of my only passions. I'm glad I stuck with it and continued on through my senior year even though she was still awful to me. 
I am a teachers aid. A student said to me last week that I'm like his dad, never around to help and when I am I'm useless.   I responded with "you're making me realise why he left".   Disclaimer: I have a good relationship with this student and this kind of humour is appreciated by him.  
Biology teacher told a white girl who liked tanning beds "If you get any darker they will make you sit at the back of the bus." 
I had my middle school English teacher scream at me: "You don't HAVE to do anything, all anyone HAS to do is DIE!"   It was after I asked if we needed to color our posters.  
I had a tax teacher in college point out the kid who was bound to a wheelchair and had an aid who would take notes for him and say that he wouldn't get far in life because of his disability. And that was just the way his life would be. And the teacher knew this because 'his mother was also bound to a wheelchair as well'.     This made me so angry, sure he's going to have a tough time but no teacher has the right to tell a student what they can an cannot accomplish in life. That teacher was a dick, I told our coordinator and wrote it on our end of year evaluations. Im not sure if he returned to be honest.   
My brother abused me as a child it started around third or fourth grade and when I was in fourth grade he held a pocket knife my dad had given him up to my neck I told my class about it because I was scared.  My teacher took me to the hallway and told me "Don't say those things or you'll be taken away from your family." I never mentioned the abuse to anyone again until 7th grade because of the warning this teacher gave me. It only got worse after the knife incident.... 
When I was in 6th grade the second election for Bush Jr was coming around and they were teaching us about political parties and being a kid I asked which political party I belonged to because as a kid with no prior knowledge I wanted to know if I had one. My teacher then proceeded to tell the class that EVERYONE. EVERYONE IS and MUST be a Republican or will burn in the fiery pits of hell with the dirty no morals having Democrats.   Turns out you don't go to hell for not being a republican 
Not sure I'd call him a teacher, but during a class on religion, (let's be honest, Christianity) we were once delivered the line "cancer is the result of sin".    
In Primary School I had a math teacher who would openly praise the GDR to her students and saying how much better it was when the wall was still up. Basically indoctrinating cold war propaganda into 7 and 8 year old children. Only when I reached high school it finally hit me what the fuck she was doing. Actually disgusting. 
I had an English teacher back in high school make a comment while we were studying our poetry section of the class:  "I hate poetry, I hope poets all burn in their own poetic Hell." 
In my leadership class at university:  "If you don't believe in god, what's stopping you from going around murdering and raping everybody?" 
Probably the chemistry teacher in high school who consistently called me fat in front of the class.  This was particularly fucked because I was freakishly thin, and there was a well known rumor I was anorexic. 
"They really need to start enforcing the dress code. It's getting really distracting." 
I love right outside of Flint and have Detroit water. It's interesting driving around because you'll see apartment complexes with giant banners saying "WE HAVE DETROIT WATER" in a larger font than the actual name of the apartment complex. 
I get free water bottles and recycle every one. I drink them all the time and even keep a case in my car so I can just grab one and keep on drinking water on the road (I drive a lot). You could say my life has improved though it's a mild inconvenience to have to empty out a ton of crushed water bottles from my car into the recycling bin every week. 
Travel to Flint for work from time to time. They are starting to replace some of the pipes. However, the cost to do it right is astronomically high. The state doesn't have the funds or the budget to do it. They are currently appealing to the federal government for funding. I still bring my own water.   Another fun Flint story. We had a few members from a hospital come to train with us. One of the people brought homemade cookies. They looked and smelled incredible. Nobody touched them. They sat on the break room table where something like that would be gone within 10 minutes. Even though we knew she lived in a city that was still on Detroit lines (Detroit City Water is some of the best tasting and cleanest water in the country) we couldn't get over the whole Flint water thing.  
Still won't drink the water. Sent a test to Davison, Mi and it came back okay to drink, but not gonna risk that.  Showering is fine.    
Sorry for my ignorance, but can't the people file a class action law suit or something? I'm no college boy, but I'm fairly certain us Americans are good at suing the shit out of people. 
I guess I'm looking at it from a UK standpoint, being such a small country this would make headline news everywhere for a while. And then you'd have all the national and EU agencies lining up to sanction the company (as all our water companies are private) to kingdom come if they didn't fix it.   I can't really quantify a country the size of the US and all the layers of bureaucracy that comes with your Federal system.  
So honest question.   Lead pipes were pretty much never used by the 1920's. A lot of people here are saying a big part of the problem is with the lines into the residence.  Does that mean that Flint continued to use lead pipes long after the rest of the country stopped using them, or that most of the houses are 100+ years old.  When you demolish a house to build new you would shut off the water and replace that line (especially if it was decades old lead).  
Live an hour from flint, half hour north of detroit.  All the pipes are fucked. Flint has it the worst BY FAR.  I had a sink hole open up a few miles from me.  It was a serious mess.  (Google fraser mi sink hole)  giant pipes packed full of sewage.  As in human waste.  However, there are *billions* of gallons of human waste dumping into the great lakes at an alarming rate.  I live not far from lake st clair, which is a connective lake between erie and huron.  In the last 30 years, almost all summer, ever summer, all the beaches are closed due to e coli poisoning. Everytime i walk along it, theres just pollution and dead fish everywhere.  There are also old oil lines that could go and cause major damage under lake superior (or maybe in the straigh5s)  but no one gives a shit.  Thats our drinking water!!!  It holds 20% of the fresh water in the world!  
I'll probably get buried since I'm here so late. From a suburb, roughly 40 minutes away, one of my friends just bought a house for super cheap in downtown. It's weird to see the water handout stations so close to my comfortable suburban midwest neighborhood. Lots of rumors that the Michigan AG is announcing new charges tomorrow. Hopefully things can get better down there.  
Wait, so the US has shitty electricity and STILL has cities without clean water. How is this possible when it's one of the largest and most developed economies in the world? 
What is with the current drought of [serious] tags in /r/askreddit? 
Not from Flint, but near the Detroit area. There was a loss of pressure from a power failure that resulted in bacterial contamination of our water supply. The city issued a warning telling us to boil all tap water for at least one minute before consumption. They closed down the drinking fountains at my high school as well. 
Would boiling water/using a pur or Brita water filter make the water decent? 
Wait is that still going on? I figured they fixed it and no one said anything. 
Like general affection, even with hugs and compliments I'm pretty reserved unless our relationship is clearly drawn out and we both know that nothing is being implied 
Not me, but my little sister started dressing as the stereotypical butch lesbian when she went off to college. Said that it made things a little easier.  I'm still not sure how to respond. 
Trying to politely decline their advances. Sometimes I have to be rude just for them to get the point.   
Asking a question or giving them a compliment.   But the worst thing is when I've walked back to my car alone and in the dark. I'd been out that day and was wearing cute and kind of revealing clothes. A guy followed me from the train station to where I'd parked (about 10 minutes), and when I got in my car he started to yell at me for leading him on. We hadn't spoken, but we'd made eye contact a couple of times on the hour long train ride, which seemed to be enough for him.  I didn't think that the phrase "leading someone along" was so literal, but okay.  
Let's just say I don't eat bananas in public anymore.  
If I have to pick something off the ground I bend my legs and squat down to do it so it doesn't look like I'm showing off my ass, even though it'd be a lot easier to just bend down. 
I've stopped using voice chat in dota because as soon as my team finds out I'm a girl, they start saying all kinds of creepy shit. 
Today, apparently, I shouldn't have carried a nightstand down the street. It was a little awkward but not heavy at all, and some dude came up to me and tried to take it from my hands, unasked. I held onto it and told him, "no thanks." He kept pulling on it. I had to ask him to let go. When I said "Jesus Christ" he went on, "oh, like it was such a bad thing." Yes, dude, that was *absolutely* a bad way to try to help someone out. You don't take something from someone's hands unbidden if you actually want to help them. Frankly, you *pulling* a medium-large object from my grasp makes me think you're trying to steal from me or con me. 
Mentioning that I have a girlfriend, weirdly enough. You know how saying you have a boyfriend is normally pretty good for making guys go away? Well, saying you have a girlfriend just leads to a bunch of gross questions and offers of "if you're ever looking for a threesome, hit me up" (gag). Like what, does this guy think I'll go home and excitedly tell my gal pal, "Guess what? I met a guy at a bar, and, you won't believe this, he wants to have SEX with BOTH of us!! What a rare and exciting offer, we need to take him up on this!"  
Not accepting any favor from a man. No rides. No coffees. Avoid avoid. It sucks.  
there was that time when i was eleven and i started needing a training bra and my teacher gave me a weird talk about keeping bra straps hidden at all times? i didn't even know how to properly adjust the straps so they wouldnt slide and i really didn't need Mr. N's bra strap advice as an impressionable eleven year old 
whenever I'm talking with a guy I'm always super conscious about not mentioning too soon/too late that I have a significant other. Too soon and its 'geeze bitch god I  was just making conversation!!!!' and too late and it's 'geeze bitch way to lead me on!!!!'. Thankfully since becoming engaged, this is less and less of a problem as my ring sort of speaks for itself on its own without my input. :) 
I'm quite fat and face none of the issues you gals do. Bonus, maybe?! I get to be nice and talkative and be invisible. 
I'm thinking more in terms of social media, but I've found if a guy messages me and I send back so much as a polite 'hello' that guy will never leave me alone. Every couple months he'll pop up trying to start a conversation, usually being rude or lewd, long after I've stopped messaging him. Last time it happened the guy had been trying this for a while and right now I'm 7 months pregnant and in a serious relationship and I just went off on him. It's so sad that it has to come to that. And I know it's just a few delusional, ridiculous guys that do this but Jesus...what on Earth makes them think this behavior is ever going to get them anywhere? 
Showing any kind of concern for a guy. Like if you have a guy friend that looks sad and you try to be a good friend and comfort them that's seen as flirting somehow. (plus most of the stuff everyone else posted)  
When I was 13, my dad warned me against talking one-on-one with guys. He said that exclusivity could be interpreted as flirting. So yeah, that I guess.  
I don't ask random men for directions anymore.   One time I was taking the greyhound bus for the first time by myself. Asked a random guy where the line for where I wanted to go was. He didn't know but he was also looking for the same line. We agreed to look together (why not?) and ended up sitting next to each other and chatting.   2 hours into the 5 hour bus ride he says he's "tired" and then falls asleep. Wraps his arm around me while he's "asleep" and then starts kissing my neck. I was so uneasy and scared in that moment bc I didn't know how he'd react to me pushing him off and I didn't want to make a scene. Also the seats were all full, half with actual sleeping people so switching wasn't really an option. I was leaning almost fully into the aisle to get away from him.   Eventually he "woke up" and THEN asked if I had a boyfriend and wanted to date him. I promptly turned him down and listened to music for the next 3 awkward as hell hours  
So what I've gathered from the two threads is that neither side can be friendly to the other out of fear of misunderstandings thus leading to a positive feedback loop 
In addition to what others have mentioned, I've had to deliberately force myself to stop squeeing or smiling at puppies being walked by single men who aren't obviously gay, because of the frequency with which interest in the puppy gets interpreted as interest in the human. 
During my pre-pubescent years I had a lot of male and female friends and I found it easy to talk to both genders because I treated both the same way--as if they were full people deserving of my interest and attention during a conversation. During the teenage years I realized that more and more of my male friends started dropping off because they assumed that my friendship meant that I was really in love with them. In early adulthood I became apprehensive to even start friendships with men and as a mid-20s adult I am apprehensive to even hold deep conversations with men lest they expect something in return. Sure, I'll do small talk and am friendly but I won't ever let you know me or try to get to know you unless I know for SURE that you're not one of *those* guys who thinks that women are incapable of holding an engaged conversation unless they crave the D.  
Not female, but I've noticed one.  Bananas.  Women don't peel it and then slip its length into their mouth.  They break it off in small chunks.    Guys, otoh, just gobble down on that thing... 
Went to a bar with partner and friends.  Wasn't standing next to partner while talking.  Immediately started getting hit on by strangers.  Attached myself to partner for the rest of the night. 
I don't change anything, if a guy interprets my friendliness or outfit as flirting that's his problem and I'll keep on being nice and wearing what I like   But generally I'm the one hitting on the guys I'm interested in so there's no room for guys I'm not into to step in  There was that one time some guys tried to steal me from my date when he went to the bathroom and I was like "I'm drunk, I'm not going with you lol"   Im generally friendly to everyone who seems nice but I have heard from my friends that I give off a dominant and intimidating vibe when I'm out, so maybe I'm just scaring them off  
Along the same lines of all these--making new guy friends. I have a lot in common with guys, but almost every guy I've befriended has asked me out at some point, and after I decline (as nicely as possible) they don't want to be my friend anymore.   So I've come to assume that guys don't want girl friends. They want *girlfriends*. And so my boyfriend is basically my only friend. Being a pretty, boyish girl is a lonely life.  
Not itching my boob in front of guys, even though it's really itchy. 
I used to always try and talk to my guy friends and get to know them. I just wanted to be there for them to listen to them vent and genuinely take an interest in what they're saying and give my best advice. They confided in me and I cared about them. 9 times out of 10 the guy would think I wanted more and would try to and take it to the next level and then we'd end up having to stop being friends and it sucked.   Now I don't do that and try my hardest to ignore guy friends that want to talk about their feelings or give them a more generic answer instead of going in depth. Which I feel really bad about when they "need someone to talk to" and I'm the one they reach out to, but I feel like it's better for the both of us.  
Late to the party, but I once offered to do my male friends dishes while at a party at his house. The mother of his 3 week old child was super pissed he invited me and two other friends over, and when I offered to do the dishes bc he kept mentioning how disgusting they were, she almost punched me in the face.   After that I stoned and drunkenly walked to another friends house to sleep. These friends had their band friends from another state coming over to crash, and most of us were sitting on the porch. I commented to the one guy as he was walking inside, "wow! Your pillow looks so comfortable!". Everyone proceeded to tell me how slutty and awful that sounded. Like what the fuck??? I genuinely just wanted to know where this fluffy pillow came from, and help my friends with a newborn get their house cleaned up.   I just don't speak to any of these people anymore :/ 
Move to Dingle, Ireland. Set up berry stand. Call it Dingleberries.

Looking at these answers I should have made it harder... 
Join a multiplayer team game that uses voice chat on Xbox Live, and call my character "Dingle Berry".  Then be fairly bad at the game, so that people start saying "Dingleberry is a fucktard"; "GET GUD Dingleberry"; "Dingleberry I fucked your mom last night" and so on.  I'd take notes of who said it each time I got paid.  When I had enough money, I'd buy Microsoft, and then permaban everyone that had abused me.

Well aside from the classic zero response to the ask for volunteers, my favorite would have to be when the audience member in question got scared/frustrated and threw the cloth I had had her hold at me and run away.  
Was at a magic show on a date last year, the magician asked for a volunteer and a little girl no more than five runs up on stage  "Hi there little girl, I'm [insert magician name], what's your name?"  "Katherine, but my friends call me Katie"  "Oh, can I call you Katie?"  "No"   Then she ran back into the audience, only trick done was embarrassing the magician  
This is a bit off topic, but I feel that it belongs here. My father is the son of a relatively well known magician, and thus knows a lot of the tricks of the trade. One day he was with some friends at a place with a magician who went from table to table. When he reached my father, my dad challenged him to a somewhat duel, saying he could figure out any of his tricks.   The man agrees, and begins doing a mind reading trick, where he acuratly described every tiny aspect of my father's childhood bedroom. My dad, of course is blown away, as he had no clue how this man knew any of these things.   The magician saw his face, laughed, and walked away saying, your dad and I are old friends, I stayed with them last week in your room. I recognized you from the pictures still up in your room. 
Finally a question I can answer!  "Please hold out your hand and take this card"  Guy holds out his hand.  "No the other one."  Guy takes arm out of his jacket pocket to reveal a stump where his hand used to be. 
I was at a dinner for a family member and there was a magician walking around doing tricks for all the tables. When he got to my table he did a few tricks and ended up talking to us for a bit and found out that I knew some magic tricks. He asked if I would want to do a trick for him and I said, "Sure, shuffle the deck and while you do, think of any card you want. Stop shuffling whenever you want to." He shuffled a few times and said he was thinking of a card. I told him to tell us what it was and that whatever card it was it would be the 15th card in the deck. He looked at me like he knew I was bullshitting him, which I totally was, but he went along with it and said his card and counted out to the 15th card. It was his card. I was dumbfounded but didn't show it and the look on his face was priceless.  
I was at a fakir show and he chose me to do a trick with broken glass.  The setup: There was broken glass all over the floor, he would lie down on his stomach and I would step down on to his back from a stool.  Unfortunately, I was drunk and absolutely unable to stand unassisted on a stool. So while he was getting ready to lie down, I stumbled off directly into the broken glass with my bare feet (they were bare because I was about to stand on the fakir).  The audience gasped! And I looked down in wonder at my totally not bleeding feet before announcing loudly: "Don't worry, guys, it's just plastic." 
One time a magician trick required three volunteers to give up something amd so the magician suggested wedding rings. At the end he joked "Take the most expensive one". The first guy picked a ring, the second guy picked a ring, and then the third guy said "this remaining ring isn't mine". The first guy actually took back the most expensive one. 
Not a magician, was the audience member. I was about 9 and the magician called me up to the stage. He had a mesh bag of lemons and a $20 bill.   He told me to sign the bill and he would make it appear in one of the lemons. I reached into the bag and tried to grab one from the middle, but it was sewn in a way so that all the other lemons in the bag were in their own compartment and I could only physically grab one lemon.  I looked him in the face, and into his microphone, I loudly asked, "Why can I only grab this lemon?"  He quickly finished the trick and ushered me off stage as quickly as possible. 
How a about a science trick instead?  My daughter was watching a liquid nitrogen demonstration at the science center, and the demonstrator asked if any of the kids in the audience had a penny he could borrow.  My daughter, who compulsively collects small objects, had apparently found a penny at some point in the day - so volunteered it with a level of enthusiasm only available to preschool-aged children.  She sat smiling away, *sooooo* happy she could help out, so happy that her compulsion was useful instead of a nuisance for once.  And then the demonstrator froze and shattered her hard-won penny treasure, right before her eyes.  The look of shock and betrayal on my daughter's face was one of the most raw examples of human emotion I've ever seen. We tried to make it better, but all the pennies her grandparents and I had between us couldn't make it right.  My wife still keeps a broken piece of that penny in her purse as a memento. 
I once saw a hypnotist get soaked with water by a guy he thought he hypnotized. Halfway through the show the guy grabs his water bottle, places his thumb across the hole, and squeezed all of the water onto the back of the hypnotist and just kept laughing. He was thrown out of the Ren Faire.  
Was at a magic show in Vegas and my 10 year old cousin got called up to assist. He had to zip the magician into a tent from the outside, afterwards he stood in front waiting for something to happen. Well, the magician snuck out of the tent, in a furry bear suit and came up behind my cousin. He then proceeded to LITERALLY scare the piss out of my cousin. Yup, he was so startled he peed his pants on stage. Needless to say, my entire party of 20+ family members got comped buffet passes.  
I was a spectator for this one.  Watching a street busker tell everyone he's going to make a balloon animal for someone and asks for a volunteer.  All the little kids are jumping up and down and he picks a little girl.  He tells her and everyone that she's going to get a balloon dog.  Then he hands her a deflated balloon and tells her she has to make it herself.  Then he turns his back on her and goes into his patter talking to the audience and not watching her.  It is clear from his patter that she is not supposed to be able to make a balloon dog.  Nevertheless, without pause she inflates the balloon and makes a dog.  Audience is cracking up until he turns around and realizes she did it.  She could have been a plant, but the trick stalled out at that point and he just moved on from there- never saw how it was supposed to end.  So I think it was unplanned. 
Well, I'm not a magician, but my 9-year-old self thought I was, and I'm not sure if this fits the question but here I go.    I was participating in a talent show and I decided to do a magic act with a girl helping me. She was the "volunteer," but she knew how it was going to go anyways. My trick was to toss a quarter into the crowd and it would magically appear in her hands (she already had one). I thought the quarter wouldn't make a sound, but it did and some people scrambled to pick it up. After that awkward pause, she showed her quarter. I thought everyone would say "WOAH!" No one did of course. Very awkward experience.  Afterwards I did the little "my thumb is coming off my finger" trick to redeem myself.  
I was in Vegas and watched a street magician ask a group of 3 incredibly shithammered drunk girls if he could perform a magic trick. One of the girls screams "Sure! Lemme just-" and immediately throws up in her friend's purse.  
Well, this might sound strange. I was told it was magic night at the club by a couple of my female friends. I thought it sounded cool. They insisted that I wouldn't want to go. I told them I would, and said I practice a little bit at home. They looked intrigued, and so they brought me.  Before the main show started, they were looking for volunteers, so I put my hand up. He said, "Dude, it's probably not for you." I told him, "I have always wanted to get involved, so please pick me." So he did.  I got brought out to the middle of the stage, and sat down on the chair. From here I noticed that the crowd was mostly women. That's when the music hit, and I looked over my shoulder to see what was happening behind me. There was a half naked fireman coming out.  Turns out it was Magic Mike night. It was full of male strippers. So... I just played it cool. 
In the audience for a stage hypnotist.  My friend was called up, along with a random woman.  Hypnotist did his routine and told her my friend was her boyfriend and that he had cheated on her.  Before the hypnotist could stop her, she slapped my friend across the face, hard.  Hard enough to make him stumble and nearly fall over, and he's a stocky guy close to 200lbs.  They moved on to the next part of the act very quickly, and my friend was sent back to the audience with a massive red mark on his face. 
Audience member at a hypnotist comedy show here:  A lady was brought on stage and hypnotized and convinced that a handful of napkins were $100 bills.  She was told that people would try to steal them, so she should hide them in the best place possible.  I think the hypnotist expected to get a laugh with people stuffing them in their bra or underwear.  Not this lady, though.  She took her shirt off, exposed her breasts to a room full of about 100 people, tucked the napkins under her tits, then pulled her bra back down.  I've studied up a bit on hypnotism, and I learned that most people won't do things that are out of character under hypnotism.  For instance, you can't convince someone to murder if they're not a murderer or smoke a cigarette if they're not a smoker.  So I'd guess this woman had no problem taking her tits out on stage.  But it happened. 
I'm not a magician, but I do remember the time a magician came to our school when I was in Kindergarten as part of a big assembly of some sorts.  I was called up and he had a bunch of rings with me and a few other kids having two rings each. He said that if we rubbed the rings hard enough together, they would magically interlink with each other.  I couldn't get it to work until I noticed there were clips on it. The magician walked over and noticed I was having troubles and tried to help me. He had the microphone in his one hand, and it was close enough that when I asked what the clips on the rings were for, it could be heard all over the gym.  I don't remember what happened next except I was rushed off the gym floor back into the bleachers. 
I've had a volunteer, when asked to pick an even number pick 11- in complete seriousness. I even asked her if she wanted to to change "you can think of another EVEN number if you want", but she was adamant with number 11. I just looked at the audience and smiled the smile you put on when you know you're screwed.  
We're at an outdoor mall gathered around two street magicians.  It was time to do some sword swallowing so they ask for a volunteer and randomly happened to pick my cousin (she was in her late 20's at the time.)  She walks up and is asked by the man of magic to make sure that the sword is real.  She gives it an inquisitive look, inspecting it from top to bottom, and then immediately starts smashing it on the ground as if she was trying to slay a concrete monster.  The magic man rapidly snatches the sword from her, which is now clearly damaged with a collection of jagged edges.  He's hesitant.  Doesn't really know how to respond, but being the showman he is, proceeds to swallow the sword as promised.  People cheer while I ponder whether he is bleeding internally.  When I asked her wtf she was thinking, she replied "I proved it was real, didn't I?" 
The trick is never calling someone who is a real volunteer.  
Most serious magicians, of the sort that do like Vegas shows and such, use assistants planted in the audience to avoid this sort of thing.  Even if the trick works with a real audience member, you always risk getting that one asshat who tries to troll the magician by intentionally sabotaging the trick.  E: Also, it helps to have at least one person out there that knows to save you from an awkward moment by raising their hand if no one else does. 
So I was performing to these two young kids with their mom, and the mom went to get a drink. So I was performing for these two kids, probably around 8 years old or so. Anyways, I was just doing a simpler trick where they pick a card, I reveal a card, but it's not theirs, and then it "magically" changes into their card. So I did it, and neither said anything, then one of them started crying, which made the other start crying. Now they're just bawling their eyes out, and the mom comes back and she sees them and starts reeling into me like "what did you do?!?!" then she shuffled the kids away.  tl;dr oops 
This probably isn't the right place but how do you go to a magic show and just enjoy it without being called up on stage?  I've been called up every time and I hate being in front of people like that.  I tried looking away but obviously that makes the person focus on you more and then they pick you out of the crowd.  The next time I looked directly at him so he probably thought I WANTED to be picked.  It's a terrible problem I have. 
People don't bother me, I don't mind if someone cuts me off in traffic. I am pretty calm and typically, a non-panicy type of person.   However, I know for sure that on the inside I don't have **ANY** of my shit together. Its just that those around me count on me so having a stable mind and an overall content personality keeps them at ease. 
I have calves of steel and can hike up mountains with no leg fatigue 
I'm a big self doubter but I still try things anyway. And I usually succeed at things when I try. Feel the fear and do it anyway type shit.  
I have a very shitty memory for feelings, so I tend to get over things that make me unhappy very quickly. As a result, I'm naturally very happy-go-lucky, optimistic, and bounce back from setbacks quite easily. 
I look better wearing glasses. Kinda "egh" without them, though.    
I can ignore responsibility and the stress associated with it, at will....  
The fact that as a grown man, I treat kids with respect  and always behave around them like I would have wanted adults to be when I was little. 
I can fall asleep within 5 seconds of lying in bed. 
I'm currently 70lbs down from 263lbs, only 20 more to go :) 
I'm a very kind person. Even the people who don't like me say that. Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps me going. 
I don't know if I could pick one favorite thing. It's either my abs, my ten inch cock, or my impeccable ability of lying.  
I take time to consider all sides of every situation before responding / reacting.  
I had a brain tumor when I was 18. I wasn't expected to survive without major side effects like having one side of my body paralyzed.     I survived just fine. 20 years on and life is amazing. My favorite thing about myself is that I appreciate every small thing, every refreshing sip of water, every bit of food, every ray of sunshine warming my skin, every comfortable chair, every quiet morning in bed, every kiss from my dog, every little thing. I'm so happy to be alive.  
I'm a damn animal magnet. They fucking love me. I'm a natural and can read them. I don't try to make a cat come to me before he is ready and I don't try to force an excited dog to calm down. I do it their way, and they flock to me. Little kids and old people too. I don't even have kids but my wife tells me it's because I talk to them with sincere interest like they are little adults. And I do not speak to even the most elderly person with condescension like they are "cute."   Animals, children, and old people. They all love me and it all comes naturally. It's my favorite thing about me. 
My favorite thing about myself is also my least favorite thing...  I always put other people first. I consider their wants, needs, happiness light years before I'll think of my own. I would literally do anything for someone I care about - even if I don't know them well. It makes me feel good to see other people happy.   But - it is also my least favorite thing. I often end up hurting myself by putting others before me. I make decisions in my life that benefit other people but cause me harm - physical or emotional. I am taken advantage of quite frequently...and that sucks.   I love too easily and I sacrifice too readily...but I'm a kind person with good intentions and I can't say I'd rather be any other way. Even if it causes me harm - I'm glad for what I can do for those I love.  
My calves. Genetically blessed with large calves. It makes me feel good because a lot of guys have really small ones 
My motivation, drive, and willpower.  I'm the only person in my family to go to college and moved out of my house at 17 to do so. I'm studying Computer Science and Electrical Engineering and have a GPA decent enough to be part of the top of my class.  I've got my shit together and it feels great. When you're motivated, you can do a lot. 
I'm highly empathetic and in tune with other people's emotions. I can "feel" when something is wrong, when someone is being dishonest, or when someone wants to say something but can't. I sometimes feel uncomfortable that I can understand why people to really fucked up things (even though I don't agree with it), but I believe that it has a purpose. I just graduated and am beginning my first job as a therapist so I  believe my empathy is my purpose in this crazy world. 
I am not a talkative person. My friends know about it and tell me their secrets without forcing me to reveal mine. I know quite a bunch of things about my friends that other people in the group don't. 
I'm really motivated to get things that I want done.  From work to my personal life I've been able to set goals and work hard towards them.  Being driven in all my ventures increases the success of each as well.  Success at my job helps me afford my hobbies like funding custom rubber ducky porn, which then gives me more content for my montages and gifs. 
I used to be a very timid and insecure person, who never wanted to be pushed out of my comfort zone.  Now I continually push myself to do things that scare the crap out of me, or things that I don't think I can accomplish. It stresses me out like crazy, but every time I succeed in something, it makes me feel a little bit stronger. 
I like that I'm compassionate and not just for close friends and family. I recently saw a girl crying in the mall in passing and asked her what was wrong. She mentioned getting into an argument with her boyfriend and he left her there. I offered her cab money but she said he was on his way back. She probably thought I was crazy lol, but I mean you have to be having a pretty shitty day to be openly crying through the mall. I figured I could try and help. 
There's a bunch!  My best is my belief in myself. My first boyfriend whistled at a girl as we were crossing the street and I ignored him. He ran up to me and asked "what I was going to do about it?" I said "nothing, if you don't want to be with me, you can leave". We weren't together much longer than that for a multitude of reasons.  I'm nothing special looks-wise, and I've struggled with confidence issues in the past. But there's an untapped store of "nah, fuck that" in me that I love.   Other things I love include my mental and physical ability to adapt - within reason - and my ability to embrace a natural high. 
That im fairly smart but still manage to be the dumbest person in the world 
I seem to have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Learning new information is just so satisfying to me for some reason 
3 things as well actually:   -My skin is great. It stays blemish-free, rosy, and regulates itself with just the right amount of sebum to make it look dewy (but not oily) at all times. It's never temperamental; I don't really take care of it beyond using a basic cleanser and SPF-containing moisturizer  -I am always above average academically, partly due to Asian parents. I'm in med school currently; so, I'm proud of that, I guess?   -One of the cutest guys in my university HAD a crush on me before. We are now just best friends, and he is still popular with the girls, but he's glued to me for now, and I'm proud to have him :) 
I am proud to have never taken a drag off of a cigarette or done any illegal drugs. 
I can take an alarming amount of drugs without passing out  
Not someone with a favorite, but I'll tell you my least favorite:  I have an inferiority complex. And I'm not very good at it.  
Her current one, but they've been dating for years.  He's just a quiet, hard working guy that keeps to his own.  He likes comics, too, so he can't be all bad.  
My daughter is currently living with her boyfriend, and he's the nicest guy she's ever dated. He's 5 years older than her, and works for a bank as a programmer and software analyst. He's 27, and makes slightly more than I do at 55. He studies Philosophy, and wants to teach. He's unfailingly polite, and clearly adores my daughter. He stuck with her through a health crisis that lasted months. We just got back from a week in Orlando with the whole family and the boyfriend, and he was good company the whole time. He shares my terror of heights and wild rollercoasters, so he & I spent some time talking while the rest of the family rode coasters at Universal. The day we went to SeaWorld, he stayed behind and cleaned the condo, washed dishes, and did laundry. We have decided he's definitely son-in-law material.  Thank you for the Gold, Kind Person! My first Gold ever! 
I'm the daughter in question, but it is obvious that my current SO is my dad's favorite, and the reason why is very clear: he brought a BB8 robot when he first met my family at my college graduation, so that he could better connect with my autistic brother. Now, whenever we visit my family, my brother will talk to him for hours about interests he usually only shares with family. Most recently, my SO sat with him for 2 hours at a wedding reception just talking about Pokemon.  He's obviously an introvert, and can get overwhelmed by social situations, but at every turn he has made it clear that he cares about me, and that he sees caring for and being kind to my family as a natural extension of that. Also, he's a programmer, and my dad is a programmer, that helps. 
After my boyfriend met my dad for the first time, we drove him home and on the way there we stopped at a McDonald's. Both my dad and I are coffee drinkers, and my dad likes his exceptionally sweet. I always get a bit embarrassed when others see him pouring literally 15 sachets into a small cappucino cup, so I apologised to my boyfriend out of habit. My boyfriend responds with "he needs all that sugar because he's a sweet man!". Needless to say, my dad is very fond of him! 
Parents, make sure you get to know the boy rather than judging him on superficial impressions. My parents loved my football-player boyfriend who was gregarious and outgoing. They were chilly toward a later boyfriend who was nerdy, socially awkward and reserved. Turns out the football player talked trash about me on the school bus and tried to pressure me into sex before I was ready. The nerd married me and twenty years later we have two beautiful children and a wonderful life together.  
When my daughter was 4 or 5, she was wearing a Pisces shirt with the 2 fish on it kissing. I scooped her up fork-lift style and she started flopping around like a fish out of water. Her nickname Audrey-fish was born.   Fast-forward 11 years and she started dating a kid who was in her inner circle of friends. He was no looker, but he had a strong moral compass, was active in the school, sports, and scouts. He joined the cheer team for her. They became more and more serious, continuing to date while attending different colleges (2 hour drive). It was beginning to look like they might eventually marry. Then he broke it off.    His last name . . . Fish 
not father but elder brother. polite, well mannered, well read. makes my sister learn about things and they do very interesting things together.  he's moving away now and I feel bad cause it's hard coming across guys like this. 
I came here to learn more methods on how to impress my girl's dad. Only to see a bunch of people with kids below 10, people who are not dads and some guy who had a hot dog for dinner.    
I won over my wifes dad. He came home after the bar way back when my wife and i were 17 and 18. He gave the old thousand yard stare and "what are your intentions" etc. I said I was going to marry her. He yelled "no little punk like you has the balls to marry my daughter".   At the reception of our wedding 4 years later, I leaned to him and said "not bad for a little punk with no balls huh?".   He laughed and slapped me on the back. Been really good ever since.  
I'm the boyfriend that the girlfriends family seem to want to stay in touch with even after we've broken up.  So I guess i'm the favourite. 
Not a dad but a boyfriend, I had a girl's dad pull me to the side and gave me $100 and said "Your the first boy she has brought home that isn't a piece of shit good job." Dude was cool as fuck. I'd sleep over and wake up to him putting rainedx on my car and changing my windshield wipers. It was weird how much he wanted me to marry her.   He kicked her out when he found out she cheated on me. 
Not a dad but a daughter, my dad told me he loved my SO because he "looked at me as if I had hung the moon". He figured if a 21 year old guy could look at his daughter with such a mix of respect and pride that had an effect on him, then he was good enough. 
My daughter is still a teen and her boyfriends have not been serious yet.  I don't have a favorite, but my least-favorite is the one who was too intimidated to speak to me or my wife.  And, it bothered my daughter too, so it wasn't just us old parents being weird. 
My 4 year old daughter recently confessed, very shyly, that she has a crush on Link. She came to this conclusion after watching me play a lot of Breath of the Wild.        So I guess it's the whole "saving the world" thing that makes him stand out. 
My 6 year old daughter has informed me that she is going to marry a boy from her class. I told her we'll just have to wait and see. I even recorded her prediction to share with her later. Nice kid though. I hope I don't have to break his legs some day. 
The grotesque looser neckbeard that stalked her online since she was a teenager and convinced her to move 3500 miles away to some BFE backwoods town when she was 19.   He's an idiot and she's even more stupid for making such poor life choices, but I finally got my office, so winning. 
One time, my family and I had my daughter's boyfriend over for dinner, and he pretended that he did not know what a potato was. 
The most important thing you need to know is that "Dad" was once in your shoes (most likely).   We're all a bunch of damned hypocrites - we want our daughters to behave the exact opposite of how we once wanted our girlfriends to behave. And we want their boyfriends to do the exact opposite of what we did at their age.   my little girl is a toddler and I've already started the indoctrination process... she's not allowed to date until after college. Just ask her and she'll tell you. But O.M.G. - if karma is a real thing I am FUCKED... and she will be too.  
My daughter is 4 if she has a boyfriend I'm going to burn him at the stake.  
My step daughter usually has long distance relationships she makes online through games. I like her current girlfriend. She seems to always be there for her when she needs someone to chat with... 
Simple thing that I do when I have to meet a the parent of my girlfriend for the first time, ask her about them, dress decently (wearing your "I like big butts' T-shirt is probably not a good idea), be polite and respectful. That's about it 
I'm actually a teenage girl, but here are my suggestions:  Unless the dad is super protective, the mom's opinion will matter more  Actually talk to her parents  Hopefully if her parents are decent people they will just be happy their daughter is happy  If you are invited to dinner bring like a salad or side dish (parents like people being considerate), at least the first time  If you're girlfriend has dated before ask her what to expect. 
The great rebuilding. AKA you should have done this years ago...idiot.

Chapter 23: The Failure of an Adult and the Temptation of the Rope Part 5. 
32: Crippling insecurities and how they ruin everything. 
Filler chapter about spending the summer looking for a girlfriend and failing miserably  
Parents manipulating their children to depend on them more then they need to. 
I echo the managerial abuse! Some pretty shitty bosses out there will lord their power over their employees while talking down to them with outright disrespect in a way that nobody would tolerate unless their livelihood depended on it.  
Social isolation. It's also usually a precursor to worse forms of abuse  
Financial stuff Both my parents worked making similar money but my dad controlled it all. Mom would sneak to thrift stores with cash after work to buy us clothes, shoes, other essentials. If my dad found out he would fread out about how we were about to be homeless. I was under the impression we were gonna be on the streets anyday until I was 10 or so.  Combined my parents made close to 150k a year. We were never close to be homeless.   
When someone consistently undermines your interests and goals and mocks you for them. 
Rage driving. Intentionally driving fast/wrecklessly to frighten passengers. 
When parents tell their kids you all need more friends, but never allow them to hang out with such said people, then continuing to urge them to get more friends 
Making fun of one person in your group of friend constantly. Everyone talks about abuse from bf/gf or family, but rarely mentions that friends can do just as well.  
Children being asked to choose between their parents ot being asked to judge which parent is right in a quarrel.  
Controlling and manipulating someone through money. My step-grandpa made sure to put everything in his name after he married my grandma, including bills. He was so controlling that eventually she didn't know how to pay bills anymore since she was never aware of what was happening with their money. She could never leave him because if she did she wouldn't have anything to her name or even know how to take care of herself financially if she did. 
Keeping someone from going to sleep (the whole spectrum of just talking to them so they can't go to sleep to taking away blankets and physically keeping someone awake) 
Constantly undermining someone or second guessing someone. My mother does this on a regular basis about big, small or totally irrelevant stuff. At first I didn't think much of it but after a long time it started to make me not be able to make decisions properly because I was always told my decisions were wrong. It took a lot of time to come to the conclusion that even if my decisions are wrong, they're MY decisions and I'm learning from my own mistakes.  
When your manager keeps asking you to do "extra favors" on your own time (without pay), such as:  Picking up his dry cleaning on your way to work or getting the take-out lunch he ordered from a restaurant while you're on your own lunch break. 
Sabotaging birth control against a partner's will. If your s/o doesn't consent to having a baby, that's extremely abusive, whether it's poking holes in a condom or not taking birth control intentionally..  
I'd probably go with "institutional abuse". I used to work in various care settings and it happened all the time. I'm not referring to things like violence or shouting, I mean things like people asking "can I please have a cup of coffee?" only to be told "no, coffee time is at 3 o'clock"... or "can you please unlock this room so I can take a shower?" and then being told "no, I'm too busy right now". These may seem like minor things but they mean everything if you're being held somewhere 24 hours a day for an extended period of time.  It happens every day all over the world but it's something that's almost never talked about. 
Religious/Spiritual abuse. Yes, emotional, physical and/or sexual abuse are part of it this type of abuse. I am talking about a cultish / strict religious upbringing,that "fear of God" culture that steals faith or any spirituality from a person.  
A SO trying to dictate who you can and can't be friends with. 
Spending money on someone when it was not asked for  My stepmom is like this.  I did not ask her to buy m furniture.  She shows up at my apartment with a Rooms to go truck, knowing full well that I just bought new furniture.  She was livid by my "I didn't know you were going to do that" reaction  She still, to this day, holds it over my head.  I'm ungrateful because she spent thousands on new furniture that I never asked for.  People take her side because they don't know her behind closed doors.  
Extream pranking. Doing something distasteful and saying its a prank bro look at the camera  
Same sex abuse. Hetro couples abusing each other is known and actions are taken to stop it. Homosexual couples rarely get heard when their partner starts hitting them. 
Verbal abuse. Degrading and demeaning comments in passing. I'm sure everyone would agree it's abuse but this happens a lot more than is called out. 
Forcing kids to hug grown-ups even though they clearly don't want to.  
"tough love". a lot of the time it's just a flowery term for abusive behaviour. it's rarely positive. like.. intervention for an alcoholic would be positive tough love. but putting someone down constantly to 'toughen them up' is not ok. 
Financial abuse. It comes in many forms and is often mixed with emotional abuse. If you have a stay at home spouse your home environment, your lifestyle wouldn't be possible without their support. They are entitled to the standard of living made possible by their hard work just as much as yours.   Financial abuse includes things like, only letting them have enough gas money to run errands so you know they aren't doing anything outside the house behind your back.   Family court might be outdated, but the original premise of allimony was to stop one spouse from preventing the other from escaping an abusive relationship by forcing them into destitute poverty.   
Animal abuse, hardly anywhere in the world has jail time for killing or injuring an animal on purpose. There are people out there posting videos of them mutilating animals yet they will never be prosecuted for what the have done to a living animal.  
Emotional/Psychological abuse.  Been there, got out. Currently doing my college thesis project about it. 
Prescribing ADD/ADHD medications to children who don't actually suffer from these conditions.   These medications are potent and come with side effects and, according to some research, permanent consequences such as eye tremors and poor motor skills. These effects may be worth it for a child who truly needs the treatment and could not otherwise lead a normal life, but giving them to children because parents and teachers just don't want to deal with a "difficult" or energetic child is abusive.  I've seen a significant increase in family law cases involving these medications (one parent wants the meds, the other does not) and the described symptoms these kids are suffering is heartbreaking. 
Teacher making you hold it in until the lesson is over. Made me hate learning, and now all I care about is lifting /r/ForeverChest 
Becoming more recognized, but women physically abusing men is often glossed over.  
Not letting your partner have friends of the sex they are interested in 
"You'd be nothing without me." "If you break up with me, I'll kill myself." Constant negging, especially when it's female on male. More attention needs to be raised about both female on male abuse and emotional abuse, because they're both incredibly dangerous. 
Competence  It seems like everyone suffers from Impostor Syndrome but in reality a lot of people are good at their jobs and know it. 
SO is a psychologist.  Sadness. It's OK to feel sad, even for a couple days. Sometimes life sucks for whatever reason. There is no imperative to feel happy all the goddamn time. 
Question. I have a tendency to do this thing in high stress situations where it feels like my emotions turn off. Example. My SO struggles with depression and anxiety and she's come a very long way but whenever she has a break down and I'm attempting to comfort her...I don't feel bad for her or anything. Like I'm aware of how I should feel I guess but I just cannot. This isn't the only situation this occurs, just the freshest in my mind. It frustrates me after the fact but like all my emotions shut off. I used to feel sympathy during a breakdown and I love her to death so I feel guilty about it. We have talked about it but it seems like I can't make my self not shut down in the moment. 
This is very true with people with anxiety. But the idea that you are crazy or going crazy. A lot of people think that since they can't stop their thoughts and emotions that they must have all these terrible mental diseases and people will think they're crazy, if they don't already believe they are. I went through this, and almost everyone in my group counseling felt the same way in one degree or another. Always just remember that your thoughts and emotions during those moments are not you, and any decent person will understand and not judge you for them. 
Having to take care of a chronically sick person, child, parent, etc.  Wishing that they pass away. 
I'm guessing this is probably more widely known, but self-destructive thoughts/urges, like taking a step off a cliff when you're standing on it, known as 'The Call of the Void'. 
Any 'negative' emotion for that matter. It's absolutely ok to be jealous.     Sometimes, this leads to something called as meta worry. I worry that I am jealous of someone. I worry that I worry too much.  No emotion, by itself can be classified as negative or positive, since almost all emotions have got an evolutionary reason to exist. It's the intensity and the behavioral manifestations of emotions that make them adaptive or maladaptive. 
Intrusive thoughts (e.g. "I could totally kill this person right now," "I don't love my S.O. anymore," etc.). Not a psychologist, but I have OCD and in all of my research it's been astounding to realize that nearly everybody has these thoughts; the difference is, people without OCD can usually move past them. An OCD-wired brain is more likely to stay fixated on these thoughts, which is why we sometimes think we're the only people to experience these types of distressing thoughts.  If you have thoughts that don't seem like they're coming from your own brain - you aren't alone! It's how you react to them that counts. 
Is it normal to have conversations with a person who isn't there? I've done it since I was little. 
You are good enough.  Corporations make a lot more money from people with lower self-esteem and or low self-worth. So many companies are selling products or services that implicitly promise that whatever commodity you are going to buy from them will make it all better. Next time you see an ad, watch it more critically and see what are they really trying to convey? You are good enough.  
Question: Does anyone else constantly get that feeling that their work isn't just right, or is really bad, even when everyone thinks it's okay? Or the feeling that you need to perfect each sentence before moving on, constantly revising, deleting, and editing a single paragraph? 
I have a vivid imagination and make up scenarios (whole worlds in fact) in my head, even play them out sometimes.  I often wondered if it meant I was crazy, but it turns out almost everyone does it and it's normal - even healthy. 
Not a psychologist, but The Truman Show Delusion  A lot of people, in one way or another, feel like their lives are staged and those around them are acting to preserve their false reality. It is a form of delusion and narcissism  Sometimes, I do too... 
Social Worker here.  I'd have to say the feeling of having nobody to go to.  For some, this is a legitimate concern, as most of their friends/families/etc are enablers to bad behaviors that they are trying to fix, and they haven't re-established new friends yet.    What I usually tell them to do is make newer, healthier relationships.   
Most people think they have above average intelligence. 
My wife is currently on day 4 of a psychiatric stay at a hospital - I don't have much to add to the topic, but this thread is very helpful for me to read.   Thank you to everybody contributing.  
Psychologist here! But probably not the type of psychologist you meant, I study cognition.  It's totally normal to feel the position of your body parts in space. It's called proprioception and it's really important for how your brain plans out movements.   But most people don't really think about it. (Also you forgot the [serious] tag) 
Not a psychologist but the answer has to be intrusive thoughts.   
I have flashbacks to negative moments in my life. The worst day of my life was several years ago, and until recently (about six months ago) I had intense flashbacks to that moment. I would remember it in detail and it felt like I was there in that moment again. Is that normal? 
Not a psychologist, but one thing a LOT of people have (if not everyone, just some won't admit it) is Imposter Syndrome. This is the idea that no matter where you are in life in your career or what not, even if you're successful, you feel like you're a fraud who faked their way to where they are and everyone is going to call you out on it.  
Not a psychologist, but the daily realisation that your latent superpowers still haven't activated. 
I just picked up my paycheck back in high school, must have been 16/17 and a fairly new driver.   Officer pulled me over for not pulling completely into the road going from drive way to drive way (like I drove 10 feet on the wrong side, but there was no traffic.  Officer: "Can you afford a ticket as a new driver?" Dumbass me: "I did just pick up my paycheck"   It wasn't till afterwards that I thought more along the lines of having the demerit or points on my license is more than likely what he meant. Let me go with a warning. 
"Can you say your alphabet to J for me?"  "Which one of you dudes is Jay?" 
We were in a car park just off the motorway in a Toyota MR2. Police pulled in and got out their car. One of the officers put his hand on the bonnet (hood) of the MR2 and said "bonnet's a bit hot...been ragging it have we?". I replied "funny that mate, it's rear engine". The second officer found it hilarious, the first looked incredibly embarrassed. 
I was waiting to buy something at a store, but there was no one behind the cash register.  There was already a lady in line in front of me who seemed to have been waiting for a while. We rang the little bell a couple of times, but no one appeared.  After waiting some time, I joked "We should just steal this stuff, that will get their attention."  The lady in front of me responded by showing me her drycleaning bag: full of police uniforms.   So I said the first thing that came to mind: "You have to get your uniforms dry cleaned?? Does that get expensive?"  And we ended up having a cheerful conversation about dress codes and employee perks and the laundry facilities in different neighbourhood apartment buildings and the turnaround time of different neighbourhood drycleaners until the cashier finally showed up. 
Got pulled over on my motorcycle:   Cop: do you know why I pulled you over?  Me: cause I wasn't wearing my seatbelt?  He got a chuckle and I only got a warning, next cop didn't find it nearly as amusing  
Cop: Were you eating an apple while driving?  Me: Can't I eat while I drive?  Cop: No  Me: But I can smoke  Cop: Yes  Me: Then I was smoking the apple. 
I work nights so the cops will occasionally cruise through our parking lot in the middle of nowhere and just check things out. I was outside on my break smoking and playing Jetpack Joyride when they lowered their window.   "What are you doing here at this time of night?"   "My fucking job. What are you doing here at this time of night? "   "Our fucking jobs. Have a nice night"   "You too"   Montreal cops are nice, despite their silly pants.  
He asked me if I had a dead body in my back seat, I said "Oh! Totally. You wanna meet him? He's kinda shy".     He laughed. Told his partner "he said totally."       Took my license, sat in their car for a minute, then drove up next to me, handed me my cards from their window, and drove off.    I later realized that a coat and hat were on top of a mess in my backseat and actually could have looked like a dead body.  
He told me how much over the limit I was going and I said well you looked bored sitting there so I figured I'd give you something to do. Laughed and let me off the whole thing with a warning  
Cop pulled me and my friend over when we were both 17. Pretty sure he just saw a couple of teens in a car late at night and fogured we were up to no good. That being said we had a lot of weed in the car (in a bag). Cop comes over and is like "soooo you have anything illegal in the car?"  "Just my good looks" i reply. Cop laughs and lets us leave. My heart just about gave out it was beating so fast 
Pulled over for speeding and when the cop asked why I was pulled over I responded with "well if you don't know I'm sure as hell not gonna tell you"  I do have to admit this was a guy I knew as my dad was a firefighter and they shared the same station. 
Got pulled over and the cop asked me if I had any weapons in the car. I had a hacksaw sitting in the passenger footwell. He asked me why I had it and deadpan I said 'To cut up dead chicks.' This keep in mind was at like 3 am. He laughed as told me to go home 
I was flying back from Europe once - at the Brussels airport I bought a jar of mustard in duty free, they sealed it in the special bag.  Put it in my carry-on.  Get it through customs no problem.  Bringing it back through TSA in the US - at a major international airport it gets confiscated.  It is in a sealed jar, in a sealed bag, having clearly been bought at an airport and just brought through an international border - TSA guy confiscates it.  Told him to keep saving the country one jar of mustard at a time 
In college once thanked a cop for "not being a dickhead about it, you know, like most officers are" after getting ticketed. He wrote it all down and the judge repeated that to me when I fought the ticket in court. She was clearly amused and I got out of the ticket.  
Years ago, during a heavy drug fuelled bender at a London festival, I walked up to some policemen and said "Guess what I'm on!"; they smirked and told me to move on.  
Friend got pulled over doing about 20 over, we were college kids at the time. Officer walks over to the window does his normal "do you know why I pulled you over?" Routine and than turns to me when it's all done and asks "so should I give your friend here a ticket?", with a smile I said "yes sir, he most likely deserves it."  Cop laughed, smiled and walked away.  
My birthday three years ago.  I was crossing the street to my car and suddenly two squad cars pulled up, each with two officers in them for some reason. As I was unlocking my car, all four got out of their cars and approached me. One of them asked me to please stop and walk over to them. I did. Then he asked if I knew why they were stopping me, to which I replied "I'm assuming you are strippers."  "Excuse me?"  "Yes, you must be strippers. It's my birthday and four suspiciously good-looking police officers just stopped me for absolutely no reason."  Three laughed, one did not. I then had to wait for 10 minutes while he wrote me a warning for jaywalking.  
My brother and I, both underage, both VERY drunk, walking home with a dozen donuts and the remains of a six-pack when the cops saw us mostly stumbling along the main road.  They pulled around behind us, and scared the pants off us with the siren.  One cop got out of the car, and asked us where were were going.  We offered him our donuts.  He took our beer.   Joke was on him, it was Bud Light.  They left us to continue our own way home.  Don't think we'd get away with that today. 
Yelling at a cop for calling me 'jack sparrow' instead of 'captain jack sparrow'. Whilst heavily intoxicated and dressed as Captain Jack Sparrow. 
"Did you see the speed limit sign?"  "Yes'sir. I just didn't see you sitting behind it."    I'll never forget how hard he scrunched his face up trying not to laugh. 
Not me, but I was there for the smart ass remark.  When I was 18, a friend of mine and I stepped out of a restaurant to have a cigarette. We were in the parking lot smoking when a cop pulls up. We weren't doing anything illegal, so we kept doing what we were doing. He walks up to us and asks what we were doing. We tell him, but he doesn't believe us because "there were reports of cars getting broken into" (which I doubt). He decides to search us. We should have resisted but didn't know any better at the time. He pulls a brown paper bag out of my friend's pocket, and with a smirk on his face, he asks, "What am I going to find in here?"  My friend is straight faces and says, "It's the emancipation proclamation." To which the cop gives a "yeah right" face.  Turns out it actually WAS a copy of the emancipation proclamation. He had been to the history museum that day and got a tiny copy as a souvenir.  The cop didn't say anything, just handed back the bag and got in his car. 
was exiting the beer tent at a local summer festival.  There was 2 county Sherrifs guarding the entrance/exit at the time.  Drunk me walks up to one and say " To protect and serve, right?!"  he replies, "yessir"  again, drunk me says: "Well you can serve me by protecting this beer.  I'll be right back".   Then i set the beer on the ground near his feet while I went to use the port-a-john (bathroom).  I came back and my beer was still there, untouched.  Officer did his job. 
A party got busted when I was in college. A majority of the attendees were underage. The cocky campus policeman walked up and said "well well well, looks like we're going to be checking IDs and handing out underages tonight." Immediately after saying this, his 19 year old daughter walked out. I was sitting on the porch and said "still want those IDs?"  
Them:  You were driving 20 miles below the speed limit.  Me: Yes Them: Why? Me: A cop was following me.  
Got pulled up very for wearing headphones as a hands free device. Apparently doing that is illegal in PA, he said it was because then you can't hear sirens so I replied "then why can deaf people get drivers licenses?"  
I tried to call the police to report a crime but it was not an emergency. A guy was walking around my neighborhood, obviously casing houses. I called the police department after hours and couldn't get ahold of anyone. I passed a cop while driving and sped passed him so that he would pull me over. When he said "Do you know why I pulled you over?" I said "Yeah because I wanted you to so I could actually talk to an officer". He went and found the guy, and arrested him because he had a warrant out on him. 
I was riding my motorcycle away from the traffic lights at a speed allowed in the area. Admittedly my engine revved rather loud.  Police officer "I have stopped you for speeding" Me: " I wasn't speeding?" Police officer "I could tell by the sound of our engine you were speeding" Me " that's absurd, are you trying to tell me you can tell what speed something is going by the noise" Police officer "yes" Me: "ok, *pointed at plane flying overhead* what's speeds that going then"  No ticket, but he wasn't very amused.   
I offered the officer a doughnut from the box on my front seat when he pulled me over (due to a burned-out tail light).  He took 2, and gave me a "warning" to get it fixed a.s.a.p.. 
I was pulled over a few years ago while driving 90+ MPH on a highway where the speed limit was 55. Cop pulls me over, walks up to my window and asks for license, insurance and registration. After I hand over my information he asks if I knew how fast I was traveling. I responded with "I don't know... 90?". He then asks me if I knew what the speed limit on Woodhaven road was. I responded with "I don't know... Not 90..." The officer thanked me for my honesty and let me off with a warning. I feel like I was kind of being a smart ass because I was going to get a ticket anyway but turns out I was just being honest. 
The same year I got my licence (17), I noticed that a cop car that was driving around town had one of the front lights missing. So I turned around, and flashed my high beams at him and he pulled over. I then went out of my car, walked up to him and asked him if he knew his light was out. He got out to check and thanked me for letting him know.   Not really a big deal, but pulling a cop over because his light was out must give some badass points? 
I was leaving work late on a Friday night and got pulled over for a random breath test. The cop asked me if I'd been drinking and I said no. Asked where I'd been and I gave him the raised eyebrow and said work. Asked where I was that I was working so late so I just completely silently looked down at my uniform and name badge and back up at him with the "really?" face.  
16 years old, walking back to work from my lunch break, smoking a cigarette. Cop pulls up beside me, I walk up to his window. "Yes sir?" "You got a light?" Sure, pull out my Zippo, light his cigarette for him, brain telling me I'm underage and smoking so be cool, be cool, say something casual. So in my wisdom I say "I always light my bitches cigarettes." I immediately freeze, he just chuckles and drives off. 
My friend has a habit of being very dickish.... But technically right. It can come off as being a smart ass or asshole.  One time he was turning left on a Green arrow. The cop was turning right on red. My friend "cut him off" so the cop pulled him over.  And when he told my friend he cut him off my friend responded with, " I had a Green arrow."  The cop immediately said, "well I was turning right so I had the right of way."  Which my friend said, "well, if we both had the right of way the system kind of breaks down, doesn't it?"  The cop immediately realized he himself was wrong and issued a warning of "we'll make sure you are paying attention."    
I always call an officer by his name but always pronounce it a little wrong. The best one was when I called Officer Smith, Officer Sith. He kept telling me to pronounce it correctly and I happily obliged to Mr Sith. He was so fed up with my tiny bit of smartassery that he told me, and I quote, "You're really startin to piss me off son. Get the fuck out of here before I have a stroke" No ticket for speeding. For the record, this is something you really shouldn't do because this isn't meant to get out of anything but it sure as hell is fun. 
Was driving on the highway and my state has this "keep right except to pass" rules. Feeling adventurous and with no cars around me for a couple of miles (it was around 3 am) I kept driving in the left lane. Cop car is parked a couple of miles down the road and hits his lights as soon as I pass. Here is what happened...  Me: Hello Officer  Cop: License and registration.  *Hands information to cop*  Cop: Do you know why I pulled you over?  Me: Speeding?  Cop: You were driving in the left lane. You must stay in the right lane except to pass.  Me: I passed you didn't I?  Cop: What?  Me: Well I saw you parked a couple of miles ahead and I was heading toward you. So I technically passed you while in the left lane.  *Cop shoots angry glare and gives me a lecture on being a smartass*  He did give me a ticket for violating the rule, but I got that replaced with something less serious in court. I think he only have me the ticket out of spite. 
A cop asked me what was in my backpack and I said "that's where I keep my 4th, 5th, and 6th amendment rights" 
One time I was pulled over for speeding and my car smelled like weed. I had less than a gram so before he even searched my car I gave it over to him, as I always try to be cooperative and respectful. He searched the car anyways and found nothing else but was being a real dick, and eventually told me why don't you quit smoking pot and become a contributing member of society. Then asked where I was going and I told him I was on my way to my job tutoring inner city kids. Wasn't actually being a smart ass just it was nice to come up right after he said I was basically an asshole for smoking weed, and he seemed to respect that I did that and let me off with a warning for the speeding, but not before he made me throw my weed on the ground and grind it into the pavement with my foot.  
TL,DR; Just because a cop sees you doing something stupid doesn't mean they can do anything about it unless it is on some sort of record.  One time, I was doing 95 in a 45 and saw a cop turn around to come chase me. I quickly turned off the road to hide in a neighborhood. The officer found me and asked me what I was doing. I replied "stopped for a cigarette, I don't smoke in my car". He asked me why I was driving so fast and i replied "you know, I didn't get an opportunity to look at my speed. What did your radar say?" (there was no radar).    PSA: Don't be mean, but don't give anything away. 
"Which one of you two ass holes has your hand in his pocket of cash?!"  I said to the two cops who came over to my house when my ex husband was sitting in his car outside and my child was yet again refusing to go visit his abusive father for 50/50 custody.  They had previously jailed me for kidnapping for the same "offense".  My son was laying on the floor sobbing at the thought of going back to his dad's.  There were multiple court appointments to deal with this on-going strife.  They were there to take my kid to his dad's and I was having none of it because I was properly dealing with family court as ordered to do so by the judge.  They said, "No.  Nope.  None of us, ma'am.  We will tell your ex to go away.  Have a nice day."

This girl in college who was a sort of friend once drunkenly called me and left me a three-minute message confessing her crush on me. Then she did it again, but on the 2nd call, she tripped on something and started crying and eventually the recording was too long, so it stopped. 
A girl I knew in middle school stabbed two people with a pencil for talking about me behind my back. She was upset when I didn't thank her. 
I was her first kiss.  She was standing 5 feet away from me.  She puckered her lips like a duck, closed her eyes and blindly walked 5 feet to kiss me.  I could have met her half way....I didn't. 
When I finished my first date with my now wife, she was acting a bit awkward, well, more so than is usual for her.  She was smiling at me, touching my arm, but wouldn't do anything unless I brought it up because she was so shy.  Once I finished walking her back to her building, I asked "Do you mind if I kiss you?"  To which she said something between "Yes, please" and "uh-huh", kinda sounded like "Yuh hease".  Then, she went on her toes, was still too short, and kind of pressed her lips against my chin before turning beet red and started walking into her dorm.    Took me a second to process what happened before I started laughing, asked her to wait, and then leaned over a bit to give her an actual kiss.  Now she just throws a pillow at me whenever I bring it up at this point. 
There was a girl I used to know who always wanted to start a webcam chat. I didn't have a webcam, so she would just video call me so I could watch hers, except she wasn't really doing anything. It was just a stream of part of her face as she typed. Also, she'd get really offended if she video called me and I didn't accept, so I would usually just accept, minimize the window, and go on with whatever I was doing. 
A girl kept some of my hair in a box with photographs and illustrations of me about 2 weeks into our relationship.    My horror must have been embarrassing for her.   That was also the final week of our relationship. 
In high school a friend of a friend made me a build-a-bear that said " [my name] I love you, will you go out with me?" And presented it in front of our mutual friend groups. I was so shocked that I couldn't find the words to reply, so after a solid minute of stunned silence he trashed the bear, fled the school, and didn't come back that day-- still feel bad about it 10 years later :/ 
she told everyone that she was pregnant and it was mine.  she wasn't and knew she wasn't. 
Named her son after me (her military husband who was away on assignment was the father) 
She invited me for her birthday, but not her boyfriend. And she invited me an hour before anyone else 
Confess their interest in me in front of a crowd of people. I was embarrassed and not interested in them. But many people got angry at me for shutting her down. 
I broke up with a girl in year 7 at school after a 4 day relationship and she proceeded to tell the teacher and get them to tell me off for breaking up with her. They pulled me to one side and said 'I can see why you don't wanna be with her'  
She stalked me for several months in school...  I was walking to school one morning and got a text from her saying, "You look really good in that shirt." I looked around and couldn't find her ANYWHERE.  I replied, "Umm where are you?"  Her: "Don't worry about it"  
Back in high school I was partnered with this guy for a physics project. Really great guy, enjoyed his company a lot but wasn't interested in him romantically and he knew that.   We had to build a bridge out of some very lightweight wood that we had designed to be able to hold a certain amount or weight or something (can't quite remember the specifics of the project) and at the end we decided to cure the glue we'd used. He said he had it covered so I stayed in the other room texting or something while he put it in the oven.   20 minutes later the kitchen was smoking. Turns out he had put the bridge in with some chicken nuggets he was making us as a snack so i would stay longer and just hang out,  but he completely forgot about the bridge. The wood eventually caught on fire and we had to start the project from scratch. He was mortified. Best chicken nuggets I've ever had, though.  TL,DR: Try wood smoked chicken nuggets, they're delicious. 
I was dating this girl for like 1 month. We had a conversation about much we loved 'The Lion King'. It was playing in theaters at the time - Disney rereleased it in 3D (this is like 3 years ago). So we went to see it and had a great time. After the movie we bonded in our love for the character Scar.   The next weekend we made plans to hang out again. We were sitting in my basement and she told me she had a surprise for me. She sat on my lap with her back facing me and told me to lift up her shirt. I did, only to find that she went and got a fairly large tattoo of Scar from The Lion King. It was hideous. I was very freaked out. I knew it would make it harder to break up with her.     
Wrote me a long poem about the color of my beautiful brown eyes. My eyes are blue.  
I dated the most egocentric dude in all of New York. His dad is a famous musician, so he's lived a life of yes-men surrounding him and whatever toys he'd like... this has resulted in him believing without a shadow of a doubt that he is super talented at everything. Spoiler: he's not.     He knew I wasn't interested in him. I told him gently at first, then firmly, then flat out. I'm hanging out with my friends one night and he FaceTimes me... he had somehow clipped his phone onto his guitar really close to his face, and was live streaming his band practice at me singing directly into the guitar camera. It was a really bad angle, the music sounded terrible, his expression was just SO into himself, and I ended up ending the call after my friends got a good laugh because I felt such intense second hand embarrassment.  
In the 9th grade a guy who liked me wrote a note on a piece of paper and turned it into a paper airplane, which he then proceeded to throw at my head. It hit me in the eye. I had to go to the school nurse and wear an eye patch for part of the day. The answer was no. 
Second date, I went on a hike with a girl from work who was very into me, brought her a cup of coffee when I picked her up and brought subway sandwiches for lunch at the hiking destination. She had to pee a couple times while we were up there, which I didn't find weird at the time. Then she finally tells me "I had taco time last night and a coffee this morning before the coffee you got me, and my insides are CHURNING and I really have to go but I don't know what to do..." so I said hang on I'll ask someone for some TP, and I found some backpackers that graciously gave me a roll. She ran off in the woods and did her business while I watched her dog. Comes back and says "oh my god I've never been so embarrassed in my entire life," to which I responded "hey, shit happens." We are still together now two years later :) 
I had a girl let out a nervous fart the first time we showered together. She was extremely embarrassed and I was laughing my ass off.   Married her.  
Bought a motorbike to impress me (I was dating a biker at the time and I guess he thought it was the key to getting in my pants) needless to say it didn't work, he spent a ton of money on something he had no interest in. 
i have a couple:   messaged me repeatedly on every social media site possible and continued even when I'd open them and not answer. then tagged me in a meme that said "keep calm and love white girls"  asked to hang out with me repeatedly, I politely declined each time. after the like 4th time he offered to clean my house and cook for me while I napped just so he could be in the same vicinity as me.  went on a date with a guy on fourth of july once. the date went really well, and i let him come back to my apartment after. we were making out but i was on my period so kept stopping him trying to go any further, and eventually just flat out told him i was on my period. he said he didn't care because i was so hot and proceeded to rip my tampon out of my vagina. i asked him to leave after that.. 
I'm on the other end of this one.   I asked out one girl at work.  It was a dept. store, she worked clothing, I was in toys that night.    We were recovering the store late during the Christmas season, way after closing time.   I had NHL tickets, and had overheard she was a fan, so I invited her out for dinner and the game.  She laughed out loud in my face so hard she got the attention of all the other workers in the area.  I'm introverted by nature, and it took a lot of courage for me to even ask.  That laugh was harsh.  It crushed  my soul so hard.   
I was leaving class with this guy that was interested in me and I guess he decided he wanted to impress me. We were chatting a bit, then we get to the stairs and he stops mid conversation and just leaps down the full flight. He looked so pleased with himself at the bottom and just beamed up at me. It was a lil bit weird but I'm proud of him. 
He clogged my toilet the first time he came over. I had also just moved in and didn't have a plunger yet. 
After a cute date out to a mountain look out point late at night, we ate some pizza at a little restaurant on the way back home. That night during a hot make-out session in the back seat of his car, he loudly burped. It was a rather wet, especially disgusting burp, delivered straight into my mouth. 
I don't know if his intentions could be described as romantic.. He showed me the porn he watched on his phone. It was pokemon porn.  
Me and my SO were good friends before we got together. After we had been dating for a while he admitted that while we were friends he came in my conditioner when I let him use my shower.  
Oh this one poor guy wrote me a poem, but it was written in a sort of half-baked Shakespearean English... It was awful. I felt so bad for him, especially because I'm a super romantic English major who usually kills for that sort of thing, but it was just...bad... 
Dated me. And like, she was a lawyer and shit.  She could have done way better. 
Cool.   So I was in highschool, and there was a boy who had recently admitted he liked me.  We (him, myself, and our group of friends) were hanging around on the school field when the boys decided it was time for some tomfoolery.  They were running around on the field with a ball, playing some kind of rugby/soccer hybrid.    Guy with crush on me does big impressive sliding tackle, runs back to us with one of those movie-star big smiles.  Doesn't notice there's a perfect rip in his shirt for his nipple to be poking out.   To make matters worse, his surname* rhymed with "jugs", so I accidentally endowed him a new nickname as well.  We dated afterwards, because goofiness is endearing.  *thanks /u/historymaking101 for the typo correction :~) 
According to several friends of mine who are fairly close to my crush, he plans to serenade me with a love song he wrote himself. In public. I'm kind of looking forward to it... is that weird? 
The daughter of my babysitter took me down to the basement where we were alone and cornered me. She then asked me if I loved her. It really threw me off and I didn't answer her right away so she asked me again. And I realized she was really being serious and I just kind of stuttered. And she just asked again and started crying and she kept saying over and over " Do you love me", and I was young and confused and just said yes. She gasped with relief,  wiped her tears, smiled and hugged me and just then went back to being normal like that never happened.  
She "proposed" me on her knees with a bouquet of roses. I don't even like roses. 
I was once offered money to kiss my friends sister (only 1 year difference) because she liked me so much. Some mutual friends of ours also begged me to at a party in front of loads of people as well as her. NYE she rocked up at a different party and her and her brother both begged me to "give her a chance" in front of all my friends 
A guy once made me a tin foil lobster. Because we were in Maine. 
I once tweeted, "Who wants to hang out with me tonight, other than [roommate]?" A boy texted me the following thing:    "(sees tweet) * slowly raises hand *"   Didn't respond because that was weird. But we kept seeing each other and fell in love. We've been dating for over two years now, and I still make fun of him for it.

A real call I got once:  Me: "Tech Support, how can I help you?"  Them: "I'm not able to log into the website!"  Me: "Okay what message is it showing when you try to log in?"  Them: "SIR, I am NOT a computer person so I don't know."  Me: "Do you know which web browser you're using?"  Them: "I don't know what that is!"  Me: "Okay, when you want to go on the internet, do you click on a blue E, or a multicolored circle, or..."  Them: "SIR, I ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT I AM NOT A COMPUTER PERSON, YOU'RE REFUSING TO HELP ME SO I'M GOING TO HANG UP" 
ITT: people mixing up famous and common.   For what it's worth, I think it's 'putting descartes before the whores' 
Not doing simple maintenance on their vehicles in a timely way.  Or simple maintenance on their homes in a timely way.   Ignoring small tasks turn into big expenses pretty quick. 
Dirt.  Seriously, whoever said "dirt cheap" never had to buy good dirt. 
Pets in general, and winning those house redesign shows. 
Rugs  I moved in to an apartment with hardwood floors and needed a few rugs.  You can easily spend up to $1,000 on 3 large rugs. 
A former neighbor fainted at the grocery store, they called the ambulance, he initially refused it but the store manager "insisted" (his words, not sure of the specifics).  They took him to the hospital and it turned out he had low blood sugar, nothing more.  A few weeks later he got a $3200 bill for the ambulance ride that was probably a 15 minute trip.  His insurance considered the ambulance ride as "out of network" 
Unsecured debt. Many people would be blown away by how many thousands of dollars they are paying in interest on their credit cards if they carry a balance or have a personal loan. 
Pets.   Most people are aware of needing to buy food, maybe also consider shots. What they don't factor in is:  * Unexpected vet visits after they eat five pounds of garbage or lose a fight with a parked car * Apartment pet fees * Cost of replacing carpet/furniture * Kenneling them on trips 
Having acne.  Many clear-faced individuals with no genetic issues related to oily/acne-prone skin will assume that you just don't wash your face.  The reality is that those people will spend hundreds to thousands on different medications and skin products. Not to mention having a harder time during interviews and decreased employment opportunities (especially in the face-to-face service industry). 
Being poor.  You get worse interest rates and more NSF charges. You can't benefit from bulk or limited time opportunities.   You are always a day late and a dollar short. More fees.  You always have to do more with less. You have to decide between essentials which only erodes your stability.  Digging yourself out of a hole you are buried in doesn't make money, ever. 
Art supplies. That 6ml tube of paint could be $40.  
Phone contracts. Buying an an uncontracted, unlocked, or jailbroken phone might be a little more upfront, but paying $40 a month for two years adds up pretty fast.  
Dying. It's like $4k-15k all said and done between the casket, burial site, and ceremony. 
Fish tanks. No, gold fish can't live in bowls. Even a decent betta set up will cost $30-40 to get going. A *small* reef tank will cost you hundreds, if not *thousands* of dollars depending on the lights you choose and how much live rock you get. 
Windows. Not the  software, the shit you put on your walls. 
Eating out vs learning how to cook, for the price of 2 pizzas I can feed myself for 3 days with 3 meals a day without much problems. 
Suicide by train.    I've known families who had to sell their house to afford the bill that train companies sent them afterwards. 
Just opened a new convenience store with kitchen. $80,000 for ovens, over $50,000 for coffee brewing equipment. In all over $500,000 in equipment under-qualified teenagers use every day and will invariably break a year into opening... 
First class air.  Most people I talk to think it's "a little bit more than coach.". It's more like a giant fuckton more. 
Buying poor quality goods or clothing.  If you need to replace them very frequently it can end up costing more than if you'd bought something more expensive but higher quality. 
The development of new medication.  I think it was actually someone on Reddit who explained how it could take decades and ~~billions~~ *millions* of dollars before a new drug could be released to the public. 
A nice acoustic guitar.  A lot of people just assume, "Tons of people have guitars, it's made of wood, you can buy them for $50 online" and treat guitars carelessly.  I have a $1300 guitar and that's considered maybe low-mid-range and I'm constantly having to tell people to treat it as though it were a baby, not a table. 
Shooting guns, especially rifles.  It can cost me ~$12-15 a magazine for my AR, and I'll shoot ~5 of them when I go to the range.  That's only one gun, if I shoot anything else, it just costs more.  If I shoot my hunting rifle with good ammo, it's $2 a shot. 
Children. I have a friend who's wife wants to have kids but looking at their finances and knowing how much they make and have to pay in student loans and whatnot. There is no way 
Houses, especially if you factor in the amount of time you have to put into maintaining a house. 
Time.  Most people can only do one thing well at a time.  What you choose to do with that time effects everything about your life.  Using it well is extremely beneficial, but wasting it is incredibly costly. 
Takeout pizza.  I dusted off an old bread machine I have, made pizza dough, and started making homemade pizza. I ended up doing it often enough to make it worthwhile to get big Sam's Club sized supplies for it. Flour, cheese, sauce and pepperoni (Plus a few pennies worth of salt, sugar, yeast, oil and seasonings.)  My costs for a basic pepperoni and cheese pizza is between $0.90 and $1.25. Additional toppings can be anywhere from $0.50 to $3.00 depending on level of extravagance.    Poppa Johns is my only local pizza option and that is $14 if I pick it up, $18 with a delivery tip, but I might as well make it $20.  Takeout pizza is 10X the cost of homemade. Making it myself is actually kind of fun. 
Having your car towed and impounded. Legalized thievery. 
Those gaming channel videos.  I started doing them with my son for YouTube recently after he asked me one day to make a channel with him.  You need the camera, mic, lighting, and other hardware.    Then you need to invest time which is expensive currency to learn the video editing, sound editing, upload process, and search engine optimization.  Way more cost and work involved than I ever imagined! 
Buying a cup of coffee as opposed to making it yourself. 
A house. Why don't more of my generation move out of their parents? Decent houses dont cost 150k anymore. If youre on the market for a good updated house youre looking to spend atLEAST 300k 
FOOD.  Unless your eating Ramen noodles morning day and night, even buying from Costco etc and thinking your saving.  Food drains your pockets like nothing else.  
I cracked a rib and had a chest infection while also having whooping cough. Easily the worst time of my life. 
Run over by a truck. 19 broken bones, punctured lung and concussion were the major immediate injuries. It actually did not hurt at first, not even the first hour or 2 while the first responders were opening the car with the Jaws of Life. I passed out from lack of oxygen during extraction, thankfully.    But the morphine dose was not correct, or I did not process it normally, and I overdosed and went into respiratory arrest. The pain was so severe my son in law told me he could hear me screaming when he got off the elevator. They put me in a medically induced coma for several days.   I was on 3 dif pain meds for 6 months, and the first 4 months were Hell, pure Hell. Never ending pain, only dulled. 
When I had a kidney stone. Intense, sharp pains in my right side and back. All I could do was curl up in fetal position. 
Appendicits - in the middle of finals.  Went from ooh my stomach feels weird to  Ow if this doesnt feel better when im done with my practice test im going to the doctor to  I cant even rocus enough to read, better walk over now to   I can barely walk up the stairs at the health clinic.    Was in surgery that night. 
Infection  in right testicle.  Had to wait in ER for the doctor for  about 1 hour,  in  that time sitting on a wooden bench made it swell up to the size of my fist.  At the end  the pain was so intolerable  that i started to black out.  Once i was called in examed by a doctor  came in the senior doctor. "Is this the one that hurts?" he said while squeezing  it. No tears,  nothing, the pain  was something  i have never felt, i could only stare blankly and not say a word nor move.  Each time remembering that moment my balls shiver :(.  
Endometriosis. What's worse is that the pain changes every month or so, so I never know what to expect. Burning pain in my pelvis? I'll walk like I'm 90 for a day. Stabbing pain in my left ovary? Curl up for a few hours and hope that people think I'm passing a kidney stone. And what's even worse is that people think it's regular PMS... 
I was 10, I think. I was prone to ear infections. We were going to come home from a vacation at my grandparents' house. I told my mom my ear hurt, and she didn't believe me. She thought I was lying so we could stay longer. A few days later, the ear infection was bad enough that my jaw was swollen and sore. I couldn't chew because my jaw hurt so much from my ear infection. She believed me then, but that was the day we were leaving, so there was nothing to do until we got home. I later found out I had an ear infection in both ears, but I didn't feel the second one because the first one was a lot worse. I spent five hours on an airplane that day. 
I have something called Trigeminal Neuralgia. It is apparently the most excruciating chronic medical condition humans can have. The attacks are on the same pain level as your face literally being on fire.   So if something touches my face wrong, or I accidentally chew on the bad side of my mouth, or I get too cold, or sometimes for absolutely no reason, I get to have one of those lovely, face-fire attacks. It's called the suicide disease, and I get it...during a particularly bad episode, I ended up screaming at my husband to kill me.  
Gall bladder attack/gallstones attack.  It came on slowly and wasn't that bad but it just. wouldn't. stop.  After an hour I kept saying "if I could get a second to take a breath without pain, I'd be ok." Fortunately it ended after 4 hours and 2 weeks later the fucker was gone.  Fun extra: my wife didn't want me to upstage her. I had my gallstone attack on a weekend, got all the tests and had surgery set for 2 weeks. The following weekend, my wife had a gallstone attack that lasted all weekend. She was stubborn and didn't want to go to the ER. Monday we go to the hospital and she gets emergency surgery to get it out (gall stone was stuck, gallbladder full of infection, it was really bad). She has a week long hospital stay to make sure no infection spread and finally came home 2 days before my outpatient surgery. Moral of the story is (and she agreed to it): I drag her kicking and screaming to the ER if I feel like things are bad and she needs to go. 
I had a peri-rectal abscess. Its and infection that starts in your rectum and come out of your butt cheek. That in itself was painful. More painful than tearing my ACL.  Now the worst physical pain was getting it drained. They had to stick it with a small amount of Novocaine, prior to lancing it. The Novocaine injection was the worst pain i have ever felt. it literally felt like they were injecting hot lava into my already ridiculously painful abscess. Apparently what came out was a bloody milkshake, and there was a lot of it according to the doctor.  I actually had to get this done 2x, prior to getting the surgery for the permanent fix. I have to say, i don't wish that pain upon my worst enemy. 
After reading these comments I've come to the conclusion that I've never been in true immense pain. Time to move along... 
Circumcision. When I was 6-8 my mom decided to do that against my dad's wishes. She took me on a vacation and decided that it'd be a good time to get my penis snipped. I had the pleasure of a 2 day operation without anesthetic(one day procedure took longer due to the fact that I fought and struggled through it) where no less 8 people were holding me down. Then the joy of going back the second day for a "check up" that was them finishing the procedure.  Never forgot the pain.  Turns out Kenya's not the greatest place to get a circumcision.     
C-section recovery after the anesthetic wore off.    
Root canal,  not enough lidocaine. As soon as they hit the root with the drill this, I can only describe it as, white pain took over my entire being. I couldn't react and it felt like time stopped. It was only a fraction of a second luckily, the dentist realized it from my body flinching I guess.   Besides that a migraine in the back of my head after uh.. certain recreational partner activities, completely pounding, sharp, and destructive. Lasted for hours, Vicodin did nothing.  
Broken wrist and finger had me crying like a baby. I was only 10 at the time though.  
Canker sores on the uvula. Feel pulsating pain every time i breathe and the air dries it up, making it even more irritating. Swallowing is excruciating, especially food. And if a piece of food gets stuck there, you start considering starvation for a while. 
Fell down a flight of stairs and probably broke my tailbone. I'm stubborn (and dumb) and didn't see a doctor.     The following year was absolute *agony* every time I sat down, stood up, had sex, moved wrong etc 
Labor. Fucking labor. 32 hours of it, and it took forever for my cervix to dilate enough to get the epidural. And they used Pitocin to induce it (due to the cord being wrapped around my daughter's neck twice) so it was extra painful. 
Honestly, probably last year.  I was going through a treatment that made my white blood cell count drop. I don't fully understand the numbers but the lowest I recall them spouting off was ".05" whatever that means.   So they gave me a shot too boost my immune system.  They told me I'd be in severe pain for a few days. I thought I could tough it out.   I was wrong.   It simulated the bone marrow in my hips and lower back. The pain made me basically collapse. Couldn't breathe, brought tears to my eyes etc.   Apparently, it's what a woman feels when she's giving birth. The doctor told me it's rated at an 8/10 on a pain scale right underneath bear attack lol.   So yeah... Two-three days worth of contractions essentially, every two weeks, for six months.  
Ghost pains of shingles. Like a week after the rash had cleared, my skin would periodically feel like it was set on fire and wouldn't stop for up to an hour at a time.   
Tear gas. I was standing on some stairs to a building during a protest when the cops suddenly threw a tear gas grenade that landed right by the stairs. I had to run right through it to get away. Felt like having razors shoved into my eyes, throat, and nose.  
I know this says physical, but the pain from losing my dad unexpectedly was physical.   I literally had a broken heart. I was hospitalized for 3 days at one point.  
Probably having a foreign object inserted into my uterus through my cervix. I imagine that is the first inkling of what childbirth would feel like.  
Ever had stiches in you eyeball?  To pull the lens tight to flatten out the creases made from bad lasik?  I have. Nothing else even comes close.  Weeks of scratching every time you blink.  I can see out of the eye, but STILL need glasses!  Yea!  All that for next to nothing! 
Car crash at 140 km\hour...flipped my car 10 times, it was a huge pain... after that every bone in my body hurt 
Charley Horses in both calves, simultaneously, as soon as I woke up in the morning. 
I don't really know the terminology,but this one time my gums were swollen and i had massive pain in that area,I went to a dentist and she started fixing my teeth,the pain didnt go away.So the last thing she did was insert the needle like thingy in my mouth and touched the exact spot where the pain was coming from.She noticed me scream a little and the next thing she did was she jammed the needle and pulled upwards.She got some material stuck inbetween the teeth which was causing the pain,when she did the upwards pull i think that was the biggest pain I have ever endured,although it fixed whatever the problem was. 
Yeah.  Good luck.  Everyone will agree with this sentiment, and then fling their feces at any critical thoughts that don't agree with their pre conceived notions. 
Wait a minute, "Feel the Learn"? Really? While I'll agree wholeheartedly that the US education system (and likely education systems in basically every other country) need drastic overhauls, I find myself not wanting to side with someone who thinks "#FeelTheLearn" was a good  idea. 
Why is there a political underlining here? I think associating this with Bernie Sanders will diminish the importance of the message and turn off a lot of people who still follow the polar model of politics. This isn't a red vs. blue matter. Everyone needs to be educated, and associating this with Bernie Sanders might diminish the receptivity by Republicans or people who don't agree with him. 
Critical thinking isn't the problem. People on both sides think critically.  Bias is the problem. At some point we allowed our biases to outweigh reaching a tenable conclusion.   A lot of this has to do with the fact that so many people *are* thinking critically.   For example:  "A" realizes that "B's" argument is 90% sound, but the last 10% can't be proven/is arguable. So, "A" exploits the situation by arguing "A" is right while poking holes in "B's" 10% that cannot be proven. By doing this, both of them end up talking about two different things and both think they are "correct" since neither one of them concedes.  I'm not sure we can fix this sort of behavior.   
(I'm a senior in highschool) There is no creativity involved in any core class. It's all memorization. Some teachers are better than others but all I do is study info that I'll forget. Every highschool student can memorize pointless knowledge now but if you asked them to come up with their own conclusion philosophically they probably wouldn't even have the ability to think deeply enough. The ability to think abstractly is decreasing.  
You're fighting directly against modern culture. "Conspiracy theories" and that whole side of investigating things has become uncool and out-group behavior. People unironically use the "tinfoil hat" meme to scare off those who are saying things that make them uncomfortable. How do you even begin fighting back against that? Whole generations have been ruined by these attitudes that are only getting worse. People want their safe spaces in this increasingly chaotic world to make sense of things. Critical thinking is terrifying to people now because it means they have to face reality. Really, how do you fix that? 
One reason we don't have enough critical thinking is because we allow our teachers to be far too emotional with our children. Many students spend more time with their teachers than they do with their families. This should not be allowed but we do it because school is tuition free child care. Parents feel better when their child's teacher behaves like a surrogate. This leaves the bulk of a child's education up to the school and many schools are very opinionated. I agree we need more critical thinkers, but that would mean we need children to spend more time at home in order to prevent too much similar thought. Everyone's families is a bit different and that is what helps us to inject our society with varied thought.  
I'm currently a student in the International Baccalaureate diploma Program.   We have a class called Theory of Knowledge (ToK). It teaches us to question how we know the things we know and in the process helps develop our critical thinking and investigative skills. I am of the opinion that if this class was taught to all Juniors and Seniors across the US, provided they had some desire to learn, it would greatly benefit us as a society.  
The most educated are the least likely to think critically.  You can't *teach* critical thinking.   Education is orthodoxy for the programmed and groupthink.   Their research even proves this, but they are unable to *realize* this.     You want critical thinking?   You want to be able to think for yourself?   Meditate.  Remove yourself from your phone, constant engagement of communication, and  constant inundation information intake.  Become more self-aware, and see a *real* objective view of the world.     Ideally you do this when your brain is developing in childhood.  
The problem with schools is that it is treated very much like a business. The higher up business men don't want the younger generation to question them, only to blindly obey what they say for a paycheck and schools make sure children are shaped into that mold.  
The thing is as far as you say something controversal you get scrutinized and labeled by both sides. We need more open minds, but it's hard when everyone lives in his own bubble.  
I feel like great math teachers used to teach critical thinking in all aspects of class.  But over the years, the focus became more about getting the problem solved by memorizing an gimmicky algorithm instead of learning why and how different methods work.  current:teach distribution.  then teach "FOIL" method.  Then teach reteach distribution again when dealing with trinomials.  better idea:  teach distribution.  Show what that really means.  let students utilize their own critical thinking to realize they can do it for any system.  
It always sort of cracks me up a little when people start talking about teaching critical thinking.   It's a paradox. If you're teaching them anything, they're not really thinking for themselves.  The best you can do is leave people alone and hope people come to it on their own.   Schooling (which is usually where you hear people talking about "teaching critical thinking") usually actively discourages critical thinking by framing all the questions and leading people through a particular thought process.  
If you want more critical thinkers, we as a society need more focus on STEM as a whole. 
Noob here, why was he sentenced to death he seemed like a pretty cool dude 
Socrates died because he knew he was right. By running away, he would be telling the people of the future that he was just teaching others for personal gain. His death had a large impact on his student, Plato. Plato would later go on to teach Aristotle, who would then go on to tutor Alexander the Great. 
*There is only one good, knowledge, and one evil, ignorance.* 
We'll never really know how much of the Socrates we know was a a representation of the real man and how much was the main character in Plato's work.    
Stop fucking translating it as apology!! The Greek term apologia is closer translated to "defense." Socrates apologized for nothing and went out with two proverbial fingers straight up.  
If I remember correctly he was given many chances to take what he says back, or apologize or whatever, and be spared, but he kept true to his beliefs 
I think teaching philosophy can cause jumps in maturity and lead children and teen to take more interest in their future. This makes them more motivated to do well in school and is why I think teaching philosophy makes kids all around better students. 
Who knew that exposing kids to philosophy would help them show gains in recognizing arguments and understanding logic? 
I'm confused as to what they're comparing. They keep saying students from England vs disadvantaged students, but never specify who the disadvantaged kids are. I'm assuming they're from England as well, so do the England stats encapsulate the disadvantaged, or are they a completely separate category?  
I accidentally enrolled in a philosophy class this past term at my university. Except this wasn't just any philosophy class, it was a formal symbolic logic and the class was titled "Logic, Argumentation, and Order". I'm a geography/public policy major so this was so far out of my realm I almost died in that class.   HOWEVER: after pushing myself through the course, I was able to get a better grasp on my college-level math, and I really did gain insight as to how formal arguments should be set up! I'd agree with the statement 90%. Other philosophy classes are filled with kids who think they're poets haha 
In high school I always felt as though math taught you how to think, so it's interesting to see the correlation in the reverse.  
As someone who took a lot of philosophy while pursing my mathematics degree, I definitely agree the two subjects synergize well.  That being said I don't know how you explain Kant or Hobbes to children. Descartes maybe, but I can't see it going much further than that.    
I think doing 6 years of philosophy improved my analytical abilities when it comes to English/literature.  Writing style though . . . It wasn't the best training. 
Doesn't anything the makes you think improve you general intelligence including math and English.  
I'm only 15, but I find philosophy very interesting. Especially the afterlife and why we exist  
It seems like most of the articles posted in this sub are just attempts to justify someone's philosophy degree.  
Nearly everybody that I know who took philosophy classes in college agrees that you can BS your way through nearly every paper and get your degree. To add to that, in the intervening weeks between papers, a lot of these people did almost no work. There is no way that you can possibly be learning anything with this process. IMO, in an undergraduate setting, philosophy is a bizarre field of study. 
Teaching kids baseball also makes them smarter in math and English.  Teaching them how to play Magic: The Gathering will do it, too.  Also teaching them more math and English will help their math and English.  Did you know that just continually engaging a child's brain in literally any kind of critical thinking will help their math and English?  Make the right decision, skip on philosophy and go for something that's actually fun and/or practical.  Unless the child or parent is already a philosophy nerd, then go nuts and have fun. 
Manufacturing consent changed the way I see television news. 
Wait, so now it's totally cool to disseminate scholarly works from MIT to the public for free? 
I look forward to the day when we can collectively appreciate Chomskys work as historically important to philosophy and linguistics, and culturally important to the free thinking individual.    I understand many do. But I feel that at the moment we are stuck listening to reports of those who disagree with his work. And since the man is still alive it seems that much of the focus in discussing him is to knock him down a peg or remind people he wasnt always correct. 
Did anyone actually click on the link? Unless I'm missing something, this isn't a huge archive. It's just a slideshow with some photos of notes and covers of some books. Seems like everyone would rather just talk about his politics. 
I used to email Chomsky back and forth for a long time. He's a great person with a wonderful insightful that too many people ignore, regardless of where they are on the political spectrum. The more of his work that is out there, the better. 
Where is a good place to get started with Chomsky's political writings? I tried getting into Understanding Power some time ago but his style was very dry; I always felt maybe I just wasn't being introduced to the correct stuff for newcomers. 
I don't particularly like noam chomsky due to some disagreements on political opinion, but i do respect him. He can see through all the bullshit everyone is putting out there. I really wish i could be like him in the future. 
Chomsky is just one of those voices people need to listen to, regardless of ideology 
He's an amazingly smart man, especially in linguistics. He's not the god of politics that most college freshmen make him out to be when they first discover him, just like people think everything that comes out of Chuck Palianuck is gospel when they first read him. It's easy to get carried away, as both of them are really good at supporting their opinions and points and speak very eloquently. There's a ton to learn from them but learn the opposing points as well. 
I don't agree with Chomsky on a lot of his views but he is definitely an intellectual giant and I enjoy listening to him speak. I've watched him give talks twice which both left me questioning my own views.  That being said Chomsky might of contributed to a lot of different areas, but he rarely debates opposition in a public setting. When other intellectual giants from different schools of thought try to go one on one with him he recants and then tries to take a moral high ground of superiority. He offers a lot and definitely makes you think but as my PhD Econ instructor said "Chomsky makes great claims but unfortunately he delves into other academic fields which he is not accustomed too and rather then debate those giants, he panders to his acolytes. He is a man determined that he is right and won't be open to the idea of being wrong even in schools of thought he hasn't been groomed in." 
Great resource for students of polemic or rhetoric 
In his memoir Out Of Step: An Unquiet Life In The 20th Century, the political philosopher Sidney Hook had some tart things to say about Chomsky circa the Vietnam War era. Hook scored him on his support of the communist regimes in Hanoi, Cuba and China, and his wildly disproportionate damming of the U.S. government.   
I don't get why Reddit is so in love with Noam Chomsky. He is a cheap charlatan. 
Hold on, is it accurate that he is missing 90% of his neurons?  When I was taught this case I was taught that the water pushed the brain outwards against the edges of the skull and all the normal anatomy and a lot of volume was lost, but that a lot of the neurons survived in a more densely packed structure around the edge of the skull. Whether it's 90% volume missing or 90% neurons missing is a big deal to this question, and they are definitely not snonymous. 
This sort of thing illustrates why I shake my head when I hear people speak of "downloading our consciousness" or any other comparison of the brain to the computer.  Neurology is so dynamic and complex that we are nowhere near understanding it on that level. I don't think humanity ever will.  
The article doesn't address the possibility that the density of neurons in this man's brain is different than a normal brain. Most of the cells in the brain are glial cells and fat, which support neurons but are not thought to be directly involved in cognition.  By reducing their number, or volume, the number of neurons can remain roughly constant.  The implication that the brain was slowly compressed overtime beginning at the age of 14 when the brain was mostly formed supports this hypothesis. It won't be provable unless and until an autopsy is performed. 
As a philosophy major and scientist, I've always considered consciousness, merely as a sense of senses, an awareness of my senses. For example, I can "feel" that I am touching something.  
This makes me wonder. We often attribute humans special "human" characteristics to brain size. With information of this 10% brain man, I wonder if animals with brains 10% the size of mans can achieve the things this man does. And if not, what is keeping them from doing such things. 
It's interesting that they always state "the brain" when really that brain is the person. Your body is just a controller/tool that the person uses to survive. Am I the only one that thinks like that? 
The article claims the man acted normal yet states that he had an IQ of 75. The fact your IQ is almost 2 standard deviations below the average is itself an anomaly.  The article also claims the man was in almost all respects normal but we never get examples of his behavior compared with others to validate. 
I'm very into the transhumanist/life extension movement, and this kind of research has enormous potential. If we can identify the parts of brain responsible for "conjuring" consciousness, and how it functions, we suddenly open up many possibilities....brain a vat, brain transplants, maybe even mind uploading. Very cool! 
What exactly does this challenge? The title is unnecessarily metaphysical; It insinuates a normal functioning yet abnormally structured brain challenges the most basic premises of conscious (IE that it is a product of the physical mind).  That is certainly not the case.  If nothing else this is a beautiful example of the plasticity of the human mind, and it reinforces one of the most basic properties of that brain (namely the brains ability to adapt). 
This thread and the comments are not so much philosophically as much as scientifically-oriented. Can anyone discuss the philosophical implications? I really see none. 
I have a question, which I'm hoping someone more science-minded can shed some light on.  What does this mean for baby Jaxon?  If you don't remember, his case was all over the news maybe a year ago because despite developing in the womb with a very small brain, his parents refused to abort him.  A lot of people (myself included) demonized these parents for subjecting their son to a life of struggle.  Was that incorrect? 
Logic is a core part of philosophy and should be taught at least in high school, possibly sooner. We start kids in algebra as early as middle school. Predicate logic is very much like algebra and more relevant for life so it should be taught at the same age. Inductive reasoning is even more important in life.  These philosophical foundations should absolutely be taught much earlier than they currently are. 
Ethics ought to be a course that is required to graduate high school and get a degree in college. The latter used to be the case a long time ago.  A principles of reasoning course would go a long way toward high school students being able to determine what arguments are good and bad. 
Philosophy has to start from an agreed and proven first principle. Ungrounded speculation does not qualify. And that is what I fear we'd see given that children don't have the tools to address complex questions.   Children go through a series of developmental stages and throughout elementary and junior high they're stuck at the level called "concrete operations". Abstraction does occur, but it's not the norm. So instead of teaching the kids to think abstractly they will be taught either a procedure, or will confuse abstraction with fact. Better to teach kids according to their developmental capabilities rather than try to bring them along at an unreasonable pace. 
This may have already been talked about. But the problem with teaching kids to think for them selves and question their frameworks will lead most of them to hating the way the school system is currently set up.  Schools, "Here kids think for yourself better!"   Kids, "Why are we spending 8 hours a day at the age of 7 indoors, having information crammed into our brains, to pass tests that are not good indicators of intelligence or retained information just so the school can look better?"  School, "....on second though let me take back that free thinking." 
Holy crap. This is my first time in /r/philosophy and there are so many off-topic non-philosophical related posts on here confusing philosophy with personal opinions on stuff like education and religion.  Lots of this stuff reads like that "I am enlightened by my own atheism" copypasta meme. 
While I think this would be a good idea, there are much more pressing things that need to be taught before they complete school. Such as personal finance, basic accounting, the time value of money, rent vs buy, how to balance a check book, as well as all the types of bills you will have to pay and how to build a budget.    My highschool was considered ahead of the game and one of our classes spend 2 weeks on building a budget and balancing a check book. It needs to be multi year. We have too many people living pay check to pay check because they think they can afford a luxury simply because their bank account has a larger number than that items price.  
Haha, when I read the post title I didn't realize it was an article link and thought someone was asking /r/philosophy if philosophy should be taught as a core subject. I was like wow, what are you going to ask next, if /r/aww likes cute puppies? XD 
absolutely not they dont even teach kids how to do taxes, balance a check book, create and follow a budget why tf would they add a necessity for philosophy when they dont even teach kids the basics of living  
 No, even at university where departments have greater autonomy were being told to spin certain narratives and answers as correct, despite this undermining thought and moral discussion. Giving greater oversight on philosophy by allowing it to be taught at primary and secondary sounds an awful idea. 
I don't know if it would work. A majority of the people in my *grade 12* philosophy class last semester could barely grasp a lot of the concepts we were learning and (literally) *nobody* but a small group people really understood logic and logical fallacies.   However, a reason they might have not understood it is because they were introduced to this way of thinking so late in their academic careers, which in turn means maybe we actually should be taught philosophy at a younger age. Interesting.  
There is no question about it.   No pun intended.  Any subject that encourages children and adolescents to question the accepted truth, and grow their critical faculty will do a ton of service for this world.   We need more individuals. We need more pioneers. We need more challengers. We need more critics.  Or do we? ...  That's up to you. 
Yeah great, more bastardization of philosophy at the hands of casual students. How could that be dangerous?    "A little learning is a dangerous thing"  -Alexander Pope  
Yeah, I think it's very beneficial to students. I just wrapped up Junior year of high school and my theology/philosophy class exposed us to varying outlooks on our faith (Jesuit HS) and contemporary issues. If anything, it helped me definitively determine what I agreed or disagreed with and opened some actual discussion with my classmates. Now I'm no expert in the authors I've read, but exposure to them is good in itself.  If anyone's interested, the philosophers we read from were:   Aristotle  Emmanuel Kant  Jeremy Benthem   J.S. Mill  Louis Pojman  Karl Rahner  Judith Butler  Philipa Foot   Richard Gula  Our last tri consisted of a more relaxed curriculum where we discussed AI, racism, and wrote a paper proposing how we thought a philosopher would react or approach a contemporary issue today ex: Machiavelli on the Trump administration (something some of my friends did). 
ZMM is a great introduction to philosophy and mental illness. Pirsig (and Pheadrus) was a great man and his contribution, although small, will be sorely missed.  Rest in Peace. 
I always remember the beercan shim. It works just as well. 
Dying at 88, cannot be judged as unfair, but I am somehow very sad to know that the person, who with his books have challenged and inspired both my thoughts and actions, is no longer here to answer the questions he raised. But as an author he is immortal as he surely will continue to inspire new and old readers.  
Well shit. I had a teacher in high school give me their personal copy. It was an amazing read. 
Years ago my wife sent a copy of ZMM to him asking for an autograph as an anniversary present.  Apparently it went to the wrong publisher, and bounced around for 6 months.  He signed it and sent a letter explaining the delay.  I really appreciate him taking the time to sign it and write back.  One of my favorite possessions. He will be missed. 
Oh man  My dad asked me to start reading Zen a few months back. Im currently about 100 pages away from finishing it.  RIP. Robert was a great and intelligent man. 
Zen is one of the few books I've read multiple times throughout my life. At least one time through I remember feeling like the book had little to offer me but the remaining times the book has had a significant impact on the way I view the world around me. It is definitely the book that has had the most significant impact on my life and something I will read to my children when I get to that point of my life.  I'm actually most of the way through a read of Lila right now and was just wondering if Phaedrus was still alive somewhere and what he was contemplating these days. I gave up the first two times through Lila but glad I made it through this time. It is a fantastic book and maybe even better if less engaging that ZAMM. 
I wouldn't be a professional philosopher now if I hadn't read Pirsig when I was an undergrad.  I guess he might find that a little ironic, but I do strive to not be a philosophologist.  He'll be missed. 
Pirsig and my pap were friends when they served in Korea. He said that Pirsig was "an odd duck but a nice guy". My pap told me about going on walks with Pirsig and a few other guys. After they both returned home from Korea, Pirsig got in contact with my pap and asked him to go to Mexico with him. My pap found this somewhat humorous but had no intention of taking off south of the border with Pirsig. He said that Pirsig was kind of off. He told me about Pirsig and the book when I was in middle school and I would occasionally inquire about it throughout high school and early college until my pap's death because I thought it was a very neat and interesting story. 
Interesting book. Challenging me more than I was comfortable with. 
I feel a real sense of loss at this. This book was the most important book in my life for many years. I felt such an affinity for Pirsig and Phaedrus, his journey, his mental struggles. There are so many things in that book I think about frequently. I don't have any words for how sad this is. 
Ah man, Pirsig is such an intelligent, interesting mind.  His metaphysics of Quality provided an important framework for me to make some difficult personal decisions, in addition to influencing me to emphasize processes instead of goal setting, "journey over destination," if you will. Thanks Robert and RIP. 
We could all learn a lesson from this book. Motorcycle maintenance is like anything else unknown in our life. If we could just take a moment to stand back and break free from our preconceived misconceptions and really look at something from an objective point of view we might find there is nothing to fear and that anything is possible. 
Interesting book, I am never sure whether to recommend Zen as soft introduction into philosophy. The narrative style in pretty engaging, even if a bit convoluted at times, and has a strong payoff. One of the first full philosophical texts I actually finished, a decade and change ago.   All things pass into dust, I suppose. 
I read Lila before ZMM. I think I am the better for it, both touched me equally. I carry 2 books on my motorcycle trips with my dad (I have an 74 air head), ZMM and Walden (his recommendation). RIP 
I always see people talking shit about this book. Is it lite philosophy like The Alchemist that appeals to everyone or is it really great? Can someone recommend it to me? As for what I've read: Nausea, Most of Camus, Foucault and Hegel.  
Welp... RIP. I hear he had a rough life.  Buuuuut, I really hated that book. God I did and I do... I never understood what's the deal about it. For some weird reason, that is the only book that made me angry, mostly because of disappointment in it. I mean I've read some dry books and literature but that work of his just rubbed me the wrong way, and I don't know why, I really don't, it's absurd but funny to me.  Anyway, it's been a long time. I gotta give it a try again... Maybe my perspective has changed.   ---  *Ahem*, this a PERSONAL opinion, calm the fuck down everyone... everything's subjective. Forgive me for not liking this book... 
I have this book on my shelf. I found it lying on the street. Some one was throwing out all their books. The title caught my eye. I will read it. Soon. I have to finish the book im reading atm and then i will.  
ZMM taught me a lot about an uncle that died before I could meet him, and the horrors of ECT. Up there with One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in my mind as a paean against the often dodgy mental health treatments of the day.   Definitely worth a read, if you've never taken the time. 
ZMM was the first book read that h(g)ave me that "I know EXACTLY what you mean" feeling.  Before that moment I was a child.   
I can't ever get myself to finish this book. Once he got into the Chatauquas the writing just got really bland to me. 
My Dad has started this book a few dozen of times, but never finished it. I remember his was the pink copy, he only read it when he flew out on business.   Never got the chance to ask him if he recommended it, but based on all the reviews here, looks like I need to make a trip to the book  store.  
[Serious] Is this recommended to motorcyclists who work on motorcycles, or is this purely a Philosophical writing? I started reading it before but never finished. 
I read this book and it truly inspired me. God speed Mr.Pirsig. 
He was survived by his motorcycle, said to be in immaculate condition.  
I enjoyed it when I first read it. I read it again and thought it was mental masturbation. Get out of your head, man! 
I've given so many copies of Zen away. It's just so good, if someone asks to borrow it, I end up giving it to them and buying another. 
RIP. His book meant a lot to me growing up. The whole quality issue was puzzling, but now I realized what quality is; ability to serve the intended purpose.  
I have only read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, any suggestions for my next book? 
I will admit that I dont know the first thing about philosophy... but I know this book was gifted to me for my birthday a few years ago and it has just sat there on my bookshelf ever since. Is it good? Whats it actually about? 
Question, is it possible for race to be both biological *and* a social construct? 
Not to be overly blunt or cynical, but isn't this, like...pretty widely known? I wouldn't say it's a novel philosophical idea.  
He's not the one who needed to say that at all. This has been known for a long time. Race is a social construct all you have to do is literally look up that phrase in google and read the science  
So I woke up this morning, clocked into my work from home job, checked Reddit as I do every morning, and spent the next two hours watching this. Thanks Reddit.  
Is the tide finally turning? I am so sick of the nihilism meme. The fact that this got so many upvotes seem to indicate something. I hope that at least some of them found the time to watch this. 
Amazing difference between the upvotes on the post, and the amount and quality of discussion: everyone wants to say "thumbs-up, yes it sounds super interesting," no one actually has anything to say about it.  How many people have bookmarked this and plan to watch it "some time?" 
Don't have the time to dedicate to this right now (thanks work) but I want to just throw this question out there:  The guy on the far right mentions that we are not calculated like computers. Why is it he thinks this? As far as I'm concerned, every action that has come to pass has been a chain of events stretching to the very beginning of time that has been very calculated in an "if than" sense.  Free will plays into this as well. We're supposedly given options in life, but imo what we're really given is a bazillion years of previous events forming us to into a ball of cells right here and right now that is predetermined to commit to the rest of our lives in a path that is forced on us by the actions of everything from everywhere since the beginning of time.  Love this topic. Really wish I'd gone to college.. If for no other reason to debate others. 
Jordan Peterson is truly life changing and it's incredible privilege to listen to him. He influenced me to continue my studies in philosophy and even expand them to clinical psychology. 
Tangent topic   Is it somehow more meaningful when a professor discusses the meaning as opposed to somehow who isn't as educated?   This particular topic is open to anyone having the experience of living. I don't think any one person can have a more valid conjecture based on their level of education.   I see this sort of thing often and I think it's dangerous. It is the responsibility of each person to make sense of their human condition. This sort of idea that only intellectuals and the educationally indoctrinated being the only valid source of information regarding this topic will castrate our societal evolution.   Think for yourselves as far and as deep as you can.   
I hate this kind of talk to be honest, and it's not because I can't understand it. It's obvious that they have great command of the English language, but overall their ideas are very simplistic. Why not just use plain English? Pretty words may sound intelligent, but it doesn't make their arguments any more valid.  I X'd out after he said the chair speaks to you telling you to sit. 
Wonder how this would be if Terence Mackenna were also present 
Does the audio quality improve at some point? I am having some extreme difficulty understanding what it being said in the first 5 min of the video (where I stopped). 
Sorry this isn't an argument but can anyone point me to where I could find more talks like this? Thanks 
I don't like how the first guy conflates meaning with function. Saying that 'sitting' is the 'meaning of chairs' because you can rest your ass on one is, to me, like saying 'violence' is the meaning of trees because you can saw off a branch and beat someone to death with it.  Great talk all the same, but I was sort of turned off early on because of that. My understanding of 'meaning' is very specific. 
Protip: if you think there's a meaning to life, you're an arrogant human 
Any way to get this in audio format so I can listen on my commute? Those youtube-to-audio coverters don't allow such long videos. 
Is there a better quality audio version of this? The audio gives me a bit of a headache to listen to at the current quality. 
Surely this is like asking what is the meaning of rock? Seriously, surely to invoke meaning is to give something a purpose or to have been created. 
Asking other people what is the meaning of life is one the most pointless questions. Considering they have their own life and assign their own meaning to it. Ask yourself that question. Your answer is the only one that matters. 
Hmmm....two hours? Can someone do a ELI5 synopsis for each side. Maybe a paragraph each? 
You can be an idiot. (Or biased, or a hypocrite)  You can be wrong.  You can make a bad argument because you are an idiot.  But if I suggest your argument is wrong because you are an idiot then that's Ad Hominem. 
I'm glad the video goes a bit into the *tu quoque* version of this fallacy. I've been seeing such appeals to hypocrisy becoming more and more common on Reddit.   A person not acting in 100% accordance with the conclusion of their argument does not mean that their argument is invalid. 
It's best not to insult others when you can help it, but I find it annoying how many people think any insult is an ad hominem. If I refute your argument and then scold you for your ignorance that isn't an ad hominem just because I personally insulted you. The insult wasn't the basis of my argument. 
Sometimes "ad hominem", while not good logic, functions as an excellent heuristics.  While it may be the case that I can't logically say your argument is bad because you are not an expert on what you are talking about, it's still reasonable to not take your arguments on that subject seriously.  
There's only so long you can call your opponents racists, sexists and bigots without addressing their ideas until someone like Trump comes along.   We liberals need to take a long, hard look in the mirror.   
what if the person IS a complete idiot... should we have to logically argue every fucking thing that comes out of this idiot's face?  no.  if he is indeed a complete idiot, then we can use this as a valid reason to NEVER LISTEN TO ANOTHER WORD.  several examples come to mind, but Rudy Giuliani fits the bill nicely. 
What's the difference between an Ad Hominem argument, and a scarecrow argument? 
How does this work with an appeal to authority?  9 out of 10 doctors agree that ...  , then an ad hominem of doctors used to reccomend certain brands of cigarettes. 
I have seen a number of these videos now with them pretending to write out words... Why do they do this? And how do they do this? Why not just present the animations 
So in my experience when it comes to political discussions, I get accused of ad hominem attacks often but I never actually say them. I say "you are misinformed because you listen to bad news sources." The person dismisses me because they think i'm calling them inherently stupid which is not the case. I find this coming often from the republican/conservative side. "You are racist for saying a lot of mexicans are rapists" Then people dismiss it as an ad hominem attack but don't look at how saying something like that conveys a certain message without any type of empirical evidence. The entire trump candidacy worked on this principle - writing off every criticism as an Ad Hominem when they actually weren't. 
When a leader makes all the decisions, and you have no say in these decisions, is it then not a given to criticise the leader? Criticising their  policies achieves nothing, and is divisive, while critisizing the person is polarising, and achieves a greater change.   This is why political campaigns rely so heavily on ad hominem attacks, because fallacy or not, it achieves results.  Ad Hominem is only a fallacy if it is ineffective in winning an argument. 
In addition to some of the caveats already mentioned: There is another fallacy called appeal to authority. Which states that simply arguing that X is true because some authority figure says so is not sound. However a linked caveat here is that yes, sometimes a person's authority on a subject can be logically used to substantiate what essentially amounts to neccesary faith in that authority's expertise.  So now when debating a subject with a person who asserts his own supposed authority on a subject as a supplementation to his argument in otherwise logical fashion (that is to say he is not using his expertise to make logical connections, he is using it to establish premises or esoteric facts that you would otherwise have no ability to verify) then you can assert, if you have evidence for it "you are an idiot and so I reject your supposed authority on this subject."  That's perfectly logical. People will call it an ad hominem when you say it in this context but they're wrong.  
And to sum it all up its hard to win a argument with a smart person. Impossible to win an argument with a incompetent one 
Didn't have time to read all comments, but could someone answer me this: are feminist arguments that disregard or invalidate other person's opinion based on their gender, race, ethnicity etc. subject to ad hominem? For example the accusations of "splaining?"    
It's pretty cool how the top upvoted posts in this subreddit are about the importance and usefulness and greatness and importance etc of philosophy... but actual philosophy gets moderate to no interest.   Easier to pretend. 
While I appreciate his larger point, many philosophies and concepts are arcane to most people e.g. I don't think everyone needs to learn the difference between ontological, teleological and cosmological arguments.  That said, I ABSOLUTELY believe everyone should be taught: Correlation does not equal causation The most common Logical fallacies e.g. Ad hominem arguments  By simply understanding these topics, I think people will be less likely to say something stupid because they'll understand why it's stupid. 
I have actually been preaching this for years now. It's not a problem solely with public education.  I fear that the curriculum steers clear of philosophy because of the challenges it poses to religion, nationalism, etc.  Maybe that's a conspiracy theory, but it wouldn't surprise me.  There is far more philosophy offers than simply teaching kids "critical thinking and honest reflection."  It allows you to view the world through different lenses, building empathy and softening the certainty, one of the main ingredients of dogma.  There are features of philosophy that no other subjects in schools touch that I think could be a catalyst for deep systemic changes to the way we think and behave. 
Math, and almost any of the sciences, can teach critical thinking and problem solving. I'm not familiar with the education of Ireland, but in my NY school [not representative of all NY schools, just mine], we were taught proofs and the why's. We were never expected to memorize. We had to be independent and problem solve. We had see and understand the logic and reasoning behind everything.   The only problem with this approach is: the pace was slower than everyone else. But when standardized tests came around the corner, most of my school flunked because we didn't cover much of the topics expected on the exams. But 4 years later, people from other schools, that were taught memorization, forgot all the math formulas. While my skills were rusty in memory, I was able to derive them because the logic stuck with me.  
**I tried to apply for just Philosophy at a University today. Its impossible, everything clearly stated that they only have 'Doctorate's of Philosophy within "these given fields"' (Science, math etc)** - All of them were about developing a thesis and providing supporting evidence within that field of study. *Yet a course in "critical thinking and logic"* - no longer exists. Debate is frowned upon and new ways of thinking are rebellious. If this is what Education has come to, no wonder the average person just believes what they are told on television. Is philosophy so dangerous that its become labelled "political Science" or has it become hammered into submission by idealism? 
This issue is not resolved with "philosophy" in general. The question is what kind of philosophy we should teach. We first need to reject the paradigm of nominalism and Cartesianism before philosophy will be of any help.  
I'm surprised to learn Ireland has a post-truth society too. Was under the impression it was an American cultural thing. 
Cool video. Proof is for math, people! In science we deal in evidence and degrees of certainty, never absolute proofs or absolute facts. 
As someone whose research is at least reasonably informed by philosophy of science, I was so torn by all the signs I just saw at the Boston march.  Like, I appreciate your enthusiastic rejection of anti-intellectualism, but science is not some unbiased machine for generating proven absolute Truth. 
Philosophy is not a science, but some philosophers happen to also be mathematicians and scientists and take a scientific approach to philosophy. Not sure I like the two things being conflated. 
There's a lot of so called science base information with only explanations, theories, upon theories that show no evidence or experiments and have to be taken on face value by so called authorities.   People have forgotten how science really works and the difference between science the community and the application of the scientific method 
If aliens were watching they'd be laughing at the pathetic human race..A race of bipedals that have to gather in thousands to convince one person about obvious logic. 
Except most "science" these days is funded by special interests. Even public grants, due to regulatory capture, are only producing evidence to fit a narrative. So when the soda industry pays for studies showing that drinking coke is fine, and the dietitian and nutritionist training programs are sponsored by coke, what happens?  
It's interesting to me that so many people, mostly left leaning people, see the belief in God and knowledge through science as two separate things that cannot exist in the same person's mind. As a believer in God, I absolutely love science! It is amazing in so many ways. However, people seem to be letting science become their religion, and religion always leads to dark places. Do hate or attack people who fear science. That is the quickest way to turn them away! 
If I'm a computer simulation and the person playing my character is reading this right now, you suck at playing this game. 
Would be curious to know if there are any studies about how being exposed to things like this that make you question your reality (this video, The Truman Show, The Matrix, etc) from a young age can impact your reality and your take on life. I remember having a moment as a 6 or 7 year old because I wasn't sure if I was dreaming and how long I had been dreaming for, and maybe years had passed in this dream and I would wake up and have to live it all over again.  
Seems like whoever or whatever is controlling my sensory inputs would want a more exciting experiment than this. 
Does anyone know what service this video is made my. That's a computer generated hand that traces clipart shapes. Any idea what company offers this service? 
I love the discussions surrounding Philosophy, but am only an amateur in these discussions as I've never had any formal philosophy education. When watching this video I feel invigorated yet confused and unsettled.. I don't think I enjoy this feeling of uneasiness.. knowing that what I know is not true knowledge.  I am curious about one thing: For those genuinely studying philosophy and who are heavily involved in this world, does this knowledge (or feeling of lack of knowledge) impair your ability to live life normally and comfortably?   your answers will probably determine whether or not I will delve deeper in the world of Philosophy lol 
doesn't this eventually boils down to trusting/not trusting the brain? Since it is ***THE*** source for our conscience? 
I know that I do not know. Boom. Knowledge proven. 
How do you know this video is lame? By watching it.  The dream argument is stupid. Lucid dreamers can easily tell whether they are dreaming by simple exercises such as staring at an object or trying to read text. 
Does anyone else think that this "living in a computer" idea boils down to if you believe in a god? Not saying they are the same, simply that because of the what the word "simulation" implies. That we are living in something created beyond us. It could be interpreted as a world created for our existence. Or a world created with purpose. A part of me also argues that the word "simulation" in the eyes of those like Elon Musk are no different of the word "life" in the eyes of say... myself. Thoughts? 
This is a natural conclusion to come to for most people, right? I've essentially had this exact or similar *intuitive* thoughts when I was younger.  Just asking because parts of my social circle fairly terrible when it comes to discussion on this matter. 
It's possible someone asked this, but let's say for a minute we are brains in a vat, or our reality is being generated by some evil genius, or even that the universe began 5 minutes ago and all of our memories are false... does it matter? Of course, for those with bad lives or those going through difficult times, it may be considered bad that someone or something is forcing this reality upon you, but personally I don't think it matters. If you are out of control of a situation (or are merely under the belief you're in control), then all that matters is that you are experiencing something, and that you exist in some way and have the ability to experience it. Especially if you put purpose to the experience (or believe you're putting purpose to it). Of course, there's nothing wrong with asking questions, and it does get the juices flowing in the noggin  
how is knowledge of this "fake" reality any less knowledge than knowledge of the "real" reality? 
After an experience has occurred, is there any difference between remembering the experience, or dreaming about the experience, or simply imagining the experience (which never happened). Or trying to imagine an experience that has happened yet?  What is it about the past tense that makes an experience more "real" ? 
Managed to watch until 0:48. And I'm an open type. If you can't know, why does she know. 
The obvious exception, of course, is in the case of a refutation of a person who claims not to be biased. 
This makes me think of the Big Short, when Steve Carrell's character is at Standard and Poor and the ratings person asks him "wouldn't you benefit from us making this chage?" (i.e. "aren't you biased here?"). And he answers "just because I'm biased, doesn't mean I'm wrong"  Of course, he was right 
Of course bias in of itself doesn't indicate wrong/right. But it is certainly a good reason to be suspicious of their claims.  
Everyone is biased.  And the truth is the truth whether it comes from a biased person, a bad person, is something good or bad, whether you like it or not.   In the post truth world I am seeing a lot of rejection of truth on grounds like oh they are biased or that's an unpleasant truth so I reject it.   The truth is the truth no matter what. If it's debatable or subjective then it's not a truth.  
People aren't wrong for being biased.  If they were, everyone would be wrong because everyone is biased at some level.  The OP put "They're biased so they're wrong" in quotes.  I've never heard anyone say that or even heard of anyone saying that. 
This is ludicrous. It's akin to saying that it's fallacious to assume that a broken clock is wrong because it is, in fact, right twice each day.  It's also a straw man, come to think of it: nobody is saying that it's impossible for biased journalists to be correct. Rather, what they're saying is that biased journalists are often full of shit and frequently lie. There's a difference. 
All that matters is the evidence, not the biases of the person giving the argument.  Besides, *everyone* is biased one way or the other. 
However there may be a correlation between bias and fallacious arguments   Since the motives are clearly beyond 'seeking the ultimate truth' about the matter and more in the realm of 'seeking a truth consistent with my current interests'  Obviously correlation doesn't imply causation for ALL CASES ALL THE TIME but IME it's MORE LIKELY to happen in some or even many cases  
I've been subscribed to r/philosophy for a while now....  Too bad this sophomoric crap gets action. 
Bias suggests a lack of consideration for facts that would disqualify the statements being made.  The real fallacy is calling someone biased because you disagree with them. 
What I would give to be able to forward this post to my entire High School... 
A ton of fallacies are just perfectly reasonable inferences taken ever so slightly further than they can support themselves.   "They're biased so the things they are saying are wrong" is fallacious.   "They're biased so the things they are saying are unreliable" is not.  
I'm reminded of criticism for hypocrisy. Hypocrisy may be a poor character trait, but it may be better than the alternative. Merely imagine a murderer who speaks against murder: am I to believe it'd be better if he spoke in favor of murder?! 
1. It depends on whether the bias is relevant to the claims being made.  2. That's fine, but we should only conclusively dismiss something if it can be demonstrated to be wrong. And that requires knowing more than just whether a source is biased.  But that's consistent with what you're saying. 
What matters is if your source is biased. The main complaint currently is that the news is biased, and quite frequently the news will express opinions in which they cite themselves. 
They are biased, which makes me suspicious. This leads to looking for errors or the bad things that the bias didn't care for or look at. Which might turn people off or believe the biased is wrong.  *This is where I'm Most interested, because if the biased person or group isn't wrong, Why are they biased? Are believed to be wrong because they are biased regardless of facts? Hmmm...   
Information is never right or wrong.  It is useful or useless.  in this sense even a biased opinion is useful...but bias reduces it's usefulness.    
Well, the proper way to approach someone with a heavily biased argument (assuming it's invalid) is first to dismantle the argument logically and factually, then proceed to bring attention to the likely reason why they would even assume its validity in the first place, namely their bias. It makes an intellectually honest opponent reflect, and it makes any witnesses do the same and become less likely to accept, at face value, future arguments that stroke their affinities in a similar manner. 
1) The link gives a 404 error  2) Don't call it the bias fallacy, call it an ad hominem attack  3) Anybody supposedly reinventing and renaming the most basic forms of fallacies used in an argument is probably being an attention seeking ass  (see.... ad hominem) 
No shit. But it does mean they are likely to omit or mislead wherever and whenever possible. So although it is not a guarantee they are wrong it is very likely they are manipulating you. 
"They're biased so they *might* be wrong!"  Being biased should raise the suspicion of inaccuracy. The more biased the source, the more vigilant one should be when reviewing it. 
True but they have a vested interest to twist facts deceptively so makes sense to take what they say with a grain of salt  
It certainly means that they are wrong more often than someone who isn't biased. Because the fact that they are biased clouds the judgment, clouds their objectivity. And therefore they are not a reliable source.  
What it does is make your confidence in what is being stated by the biased party lower, because it's nearly impossible to separate the effect of the bias from the the conclusion, as it calls into question how every step the argument was developed, from inception to data gathering to data analysis. So while a biased party may be correct, it becomes much harder to determine the validity of the statements of any biased party. 
Wow, this thread is rife with nonsense. Debate and philosophy are different things. Please stop conflating them. Also, there is no such thing as "the bias fallacy". Perception of bias is covered by ad hominem attacks. Bias fallacy is something this guy made up and that people (supposition here) are latching onto because they've been accused of bias before. Does being biased make you wrong? No. Does being biased make bias fallacy a thing? Also, no. 
But it certainly means you're narrow minded therefore increasing the likelihood of being wrong  
Why the fuck does this have so many upvotes?  It's not the "bias fallacy", calling their character into question is just a simple ad hominem...  What the hell is going on in here? 
Being biased does not automatically mean being wrong, no.  Being biased does, however, raise the probability of incomplete research, inaccurate analysis and incorrect conclusions.  Thus if an opponent is biased is a very good indicator that you should examine their sources and research as you are likely to find the research to be of poor quality and/or misrepresented. 
They're not wrong, but they're still biased. They are going to skew their answer in a way that is favorable to their own viewpoint.  
A good rule of thumb is to believe sources if they do one of these two things:: it making a claim that others also attest to, or making a claim that would fit against its narrative.    For example, if Breitbart argues something that would go against their narrative, such as that science has proven human caused global warming, it would be logical to trust them. If the New York times were to claim now that global warming were false, it would again be logical to accept them.  
I think one the major issues with biased sources isn't that they're lying, it's that they're withholding the other side of the story, or the facts that don't fit their agenda. This, I think, is more damaging overall. They can tell the truth in everything they say, yet still manage to misrepresent the true narrative. 
I think you can infer bias from falsehood, but not the other way around. For example I can say Tom Brady is the best QB ever, and that's not false even though I'm biased. But you can infer bias from a comment like Julian Edelman is the best WR in the league.   Also it's a specific form of ad hominem more than anything. 
but we can infer credibility. news organizations are worthless without credibility. 
I've been In philosophy class. Most people don't care or don't get it. It's an acquired taste I've come to believe 
I hate the "there is no wrong answer" open forum type philosophy my HS taught, rather than teaching you how to think logically and scrutinize an argument. Instead it's more like "Are we free?" and then a bunch of 16 year olds complaining they can't do what they want.  
Philosophy is mandatory in the last year of high school in France. I'm not sure it makes a better society. Some of the exam topics (the format is hand-written essay, no document allowed, 3 hours. And you'd better cover all possible answers to get a decent grade):  2016: - Is working less living better? - Does one have to demonstrate to know? - Do we always know what we desire? - Why do we have an interest to study history? - Are our moral convictions based on experience? - Is desire by nature limited? - To be just, is it enough to follow the law? - Can we always justify our beliefs?  2015: - Does a work of art always have a meaning? - Does politics escape the duty to be truthful? - Does the individual conscience only reflect the society to which one belongs? - Do artists give something to understand? - Is respecting all living beings a moral duty? - Am I what my past has made me?  For those who don't like essays, there is always the choice to comment a text.     
Yeah! And all of our kings should be philosophers too! 
Except you'd have to change the basic school structure so Americans could understand logic first, then philosophy. 
Do you have a transcript for this video? Not interested in sitting through that robot voice. 
I think a critical thinking class would be better.  In high school we should be teaching kids the basic skills they need to survive: how to balance a budget, manage credit, prepare a meal, maintain a vehicle, use birth control, change a diaper, apply for a job, take care of their body, etc.  We should also be teaching them skills that will help them find a job later in life.  Let's bring back typing classes and teach students data entry.  Let's require them learn how to be an engineer, electrician, welder, or machinist.    Philosophy is awesome, but it's a luxury.  We have too many people who don't know how to take care of themselves.  We have too many people who are easily duped by politicians.  And we have too many people that graduate from college with nothing to put on their resume but an arts degree. 
Sorry but there is no practical application to philosophy in terms of production. Math, science and History do.  
Highschool teaches kids how to do as their told and not question anything.  Teachers want students to say the same answer and to be one.  There is no thought process in school, it's just a bunch of mindless thinking and pure memorization with no building of true knowledge and comprehension.  A highschool kid would fail philosophy so I'm not sure how you would teach it on a highschool level since it's barely teaching as it is.  They say the same script for years and years.   
Depends what type of philosophy. Seeing the state some universities are in, I really don't think you guys need your high schools churning out little Marxists. 
I was under the impression philosophy was taught at high-schools?  I'm from Portugal and had mandatory philosophy from 7th grade to 10th. 11th and 12th had psychology, regardless if you were specifying in sciences or literature or arts 
While my school didn't specifically have a philosophy class, they were focused on teacher critical thinking, how to write critical essays, how to "decode" paragraphs to get the main point the authors trying to make.  Considering they only have like a .3% drop out rated think it works out well.   Not everyone likes philosophy, and I could see something like epistemology to be "triggering" in this day and age, causing kids to have an internal crisis lol. 
Super intelligence? Even if AI only equalled human intelligence, that would rock our world. You'd basically have a new race of people that can use electricity instead of food, don't get old or sick, can do a wider range of work, physically overpower us, build copies of themselves faster than we can reproduce, etc. Even if AI never got any further, we'd be hopelessly displaced. 
I think it's an expansion on the"God exists in the fringes" philosophy. For instance; gods of Olympus existed on a mountain.. Till we could climb mountains. Then they existed on clouds, till we built flying machines. Then in the stars, till we went to space.  As our perceptions increase and our relative intelligence, our ideals and imaginations expand along with them.  Like with AI and my biggest hang up about it: How will AI exist as something we will understand when unlike us it won't have biological imperatives? And if we build analogues of those for it, will it be an artificial intelligence? Or merely a digital facsimile of a human? And is that what will make it a threat? Because it will just be another human, but far more efficient?  Could we imagine the ideas of a sentient intelligence not driven by biological imperatives like us? 
You can tell a lot of the speakers disagree with each other because they all look a little uncomfortable. Except Elon, he's the only one that seem like he's at home. Early on when he would publicly speak he always seemed nervous, I wonder if now he's just used to public speaking or if he takes Xanax     
The inherent nature of a technological singularity is so profoundly unpredictable it is almost pointless to hypothesise it's outcome.  Consideration must be placed on the possibility of the singularity as having already occured, and our experience on this planet is a direct result of this  
What exactly is "artificial general intelligence" supposed to be? A machine that has similar or greater intelligence than us? 
I don't know about this to be honest. Does this actually qualify as philosophy? Some of the panelists are definitely not philosophers, and pretty much everything said is speculation/not related to philosophy.  
My question is as we approach human levels of AI at what point does it become unethical to terminate a consciousness that we have created? And as AI comes to understand or become self conscious, at what point does it rebel at the idea of termination? Because as we do with current software and technology it becomes outdated and needs to be upgraded, even things that were once considered cutting edge.. When will it become a moral dilemma to discard our creations? 
Ya this is the shit, I wish Elon and ray kurzwell would have talked incessantly, I liked everyone else equally as well, but I really respect those two and their ability to be everywhere mentally and constantly challenge your thought processes. That is what true self-mastery is made of, and it's what great leadership is made of for the same reasons. 
Good for her I say. Prisons should be about teaching people how to go back into society and contribute to it, and maybe Ethics classes are good for people in finding moral paths that will help them succeed to a maximum in society. 
Great, now we'll have relativist felons. Parole boards will get dragged into a swamp of meta-ethics. Gangs will split into Aretaic thugs who rep the virtue of Hellenic Masculinity, a hard-assed Kantian Mafia that does NOT make exceptions, and oily Utilitarian opportunists.   Seriously, though - one should not overestimate the transformative power of content-knowledge. Just learning ethics doesn't make you a good person and a lot of people who study it just wind up confused. The efficacy of such classes is an empirical question, however, I am not sure what strong prima facie presumption there is in favor of thinking that ethics courses will save secular souls.   
On pretty much any other sub-reddit, this thread would've been mobbed with comments about liberal bleeding hearts. It's good to have at least one place were things can be discussed in depth and rationally. 
He should probably "warm up" with some medium security prisoners and gain some experience before trying to school maximum security prisoners. I dont think a somewhat sheltered professor can just jump into that enviroment and get things done.  Or maybe go to a supermax and have a go at some real psychos one on one 
So higher education is available for free to inmates?  I'm all ethics classes to be offered for free to inmates right after anyone who hasn't broken any laws gets higher education for free. 
Im surprised no one on this thread has made the point that metaphysical questions fall outside the reach of physical sciences and mathematics. Such question will never be "scientifically" explained because it cant be scientifically explained.   
I don't think it will ever be solved. The corollary is "what is death?". There is no chemical change in composition when people die, making it difficult to measure the absence or presence of life.  
People like whoever this guy, just got to realize we aren't gods. We can never truly know something. We can claim to think we know something however based on educated observation and inferences, and even some guesses. 
Maybe I am incredibly dumb asking this, but I am incredibly dumb regardless so here we go: How do we know it was on february 15 if that calendar or any calendar did not exist back in those good old days? 
The historical context is that people sentenced to "death" in Athens by popular acclaim were expected to flee into exile until their supporters could work the politics back to their side and get another acclamation loosening or reversing the first one.  Socrates considered this hypocritical and corrupt.  Perhaps taking his own life too lightly in order to "teach a lesson" to his society, he decided it would be moral to abide the letter of their decision and let them accept the consequences of it.  Dying an agonizing death just to shame a mob was perhaps ethically flippant.    The polis repented their decision in his case, but kept behaving in similar ways right up to the self-inflicted death of Athenian democracy. 
Time to put down the phones and read *Apology*,  *Symposium*, & *Phaedo* 
Can anyone recommend a book on Socrates? I know that he wrote nothing himself and that most of his thoughts are transmitted through Plato and Zenophon (? or something).. Is there a good book that merges these two viewpoints and presents Socrates as a more 3-D person? 
If I'm not mistaken he was killed by the proponents of rhetoric. This is to argue to the appeals of ethos pathos and logos. (ethics, emotions, and logic) any good politician nowadays has balanced rhetoric...  Socrates believed in learning the truth. Facts are facts. Rhetoric can't make something a fact.  What a wierd thing to die for. But I think rhetorically you can support that the death penalty was too much. Which I find ironic.  But you can also factually prove that the death penalty was wrong here.  Politicians today in the US use more of a rhetorical method than a Socratic one. This is why people love town halls! 
One of the things that has always fascinated me about his death beyond the Olympian-tribute he requested at his trial was the concept of his intentional demise in an era where dying for the self wasn't really a thing. The city-state/honor was more of an important concept than dying for a personal belief or ideal.  
Isn't there a theory that Socrates wasn't a real person and was just a stand-in/example/character created by Plato? 
I worked at a aquarium store for a number of years and we had a cuttlefish that would recognize and get excited to see certain staff members and would flash certain patterns when begging for food. It was like a underwater puppy that inks the tank instead of shitting the carpet. 
Why should there be any necessary connection between being smart and being long-lived?  There are plenty of dim-witted organisms (like tortoises) that live longer than us smart-asses. 
Cephalopods, to me, are a perfect example of how unprepared we are to receive an extraterrestrial intelligence (cetaceans being another). Not that I expect to be visited by, or for us to encounter an extraterrestrial intelligence anytime soon. I've done some basic research on cephalopods, and they're both fascinating, and undeniably intelligent. They're able to communicate, and camouflage themselves by changing their appearance, but we have no real means of communicating with them. If we were to encounter another intelligent life form, I imagine it will be as baffling as these creatures, likely far more so. Until we're able to understand the life of a dolphin or a cuttlefish we're woefully unprepared to receive an extraterrestrial intelligence. 
Yet the standards on what we can do to cephalopods is the same as for all other non-listed  invertebrates.  
If there is an ethical argument to be made for genetically modifying something to live longer I would like to hear the case for octopuses because it would be fascinating to see what they could do with more time. Of course people will say it could also spell our doom. 
It's a really interesting question, but only rhetorically. Life span is what it is; intelligence can't directly influence that. A more testable question is "how does something so short-lived become so smart?" But that's a science question not a philosophy question.   I hold a Cambridge masters in philosophy but now find science more interesting.  
Jesus Christ mods, why you have to nuke the damn thread?  
they are just biding their time until they become the next thing to crawl out of the sea and dominate Earth.  won't be long now. 
Hopefully right now they're congregating at the bottom of the ocean to emerge as the great Cthulhu and rule us all for one hundred thousand years.  
Mortality is designed to stop individuals which don't reproduce from competing for resources with those which do.  Intelligence has next to nothing to do with it.  Even in Humans you can have an IQ pushing 200 and you'll likely die younger if you don't have kids. 
To be given its "proper place" (let's grant that this *is* at the heart of UK education), we need good philosophy teachers.   Where are the thousands that are required going to come from?  Teaching philosophy badly might be worse than none at all. 
Rhetoric and Logic (beginners level at least) is probably even more important. Polite discussion where valid arguments are used to defend your opinion is very hard to find these days. These things should be mandatory regardless the discipline you are learning.  
The fact that schools teach religion but not philosophy is something that always baffled me. 
Teaching scepticism would be good.  Especially what is claimed or asserted during the rest of philosophy class. 
As someone with a Ph.D. in Philosophy who has been searching for a full time teaching position for the past 15 years....Yes, and not just in the U.K. Here in the U.S., most teaching spots are filled on a single class contract basis,  you are paid per class taught, no benefits.  You can work full time (4 classes per semester) and barely make 18,000 usd/year and still have no health insurance.  Lovely. What's even sadder is that many universities are eliminating their philosophy departments altogether and teaching the few required classes through other departments. Logic is treated as a math course; Ethics is taught through the Drama department (Plato's dialogues); Intro is treated as a literature/freshman writing course. 
A lot of what was previously classified as philosophy now falls under the fields of science, economics, maths, religious studies etc. The definition is a narrower. That said, teaching rhetoric and logic should probably be mandated at a high school level. Fallacies everywhere! (Hah) 
There are a number of problems with the education our youngsters receive. But this is one of the big ones for me.  
IB is great that way, the subject Theory of Knowledge kind off covers philosophy and helps with critical thinking! 
Education in general needs to become more adaptable to introverted students. Many studies show that introverts produce better work in a shorter tine frame when working on their own, and yet schools continue to push group tasks onto everyone. 
Which philosophy?  Nihilism - Nazis  Utilitarianism - communism  Enlightenment - democracy and imperialism/colonialism  Or maybe cultural Marxism? 
Philosophy is a touchy topic. For it to be taught here in the U.S., one would need a doctoral degree in philosophy to even teach it. I don't see how it would be taught in a K-12 education here in the states or even anywhere else. I'm not even sure if students at an early age would even appreciate the subject, it would be only a select few if anything.  
For anyone interested in the life of Bertrand Russell, there is a fantastic comic book called 'Logicomix: An epic search for truth' that details his early life and some of his main pursuits in philosophy. I would highly recommend it.  
Could somebody add a tl dr for people like me who don't really understand ?  
The four F's of biological survival: 1. Feed 2. Fight 3. Flee 4. Reproduce 
I find this line of thinking a bit cynical. Nowhere is any positive virtue mentioned. I think love, for instance, is one of the most, if not the most powerful drivers in all of human life.  
Always hard to read these sorts of declarative treatises on human psychology - pretty much the most abstract, difficult to define phenomenon in the known world - without suspecting that they're dangerously simplistic. The resistance to that mathematical perception of human behavior is what gave the postmodernists their potency; Russell's epistemic certitude in proposing a formula of human psychology reads as almost laughably dated in the 21st century. 
ahh clickbait book title before we coined the term.  "And you won't believe number three!" 
Interesting read, but he's clearly wrong: some human behavior is the result of habit, and while the habit may have been *formed* during a period where a person desired something, the habits can persist long after the desire has waned.  And other things are one's body taking over; trying to hold your breath until you die is not likely to work, regardless of how much you desire to die.  Similarly, newborn babies breathe even though they have no measurable thoughts or desires of any kind.  I suppose you can argue such instinctual behaviors are not "you" behaving that way, but it's clearly an action of a human body, and thus "human behavior."  Aristotle was much closer with "Thus every action must be due to one or other of seven causes: chance, nature, compulsion, habit, reasoning, anger, or appetite."  
I think he is close but a little off.   There are many things that don't fit into these categories.  Why do we shut our eyes when we look into the sun?  Try these 4 reasons why we do everything: Access something/activity Escape something aversive Access attention Self-stimulation/sensory input 
You may have had your own reasons for doing this, but this excerpt is in bad need of quotation marks to keep track of who is speaking. 
IMHO Plato asks all the right questions and gives more or less coherent view of his principles. The means of achieving a state of affairs that he believes to be just should be examined very carefully though. I would argue that huge portion of text dealing with how one regime turns into another and most other parts dealing with moment to moment practical application of Plato's principles are just filled with bad psychology and bad sociology. 
I am literally reading The Republic right now for my political philosophy class and I'm just finishing the part on how a Timocracy turns into an oligarchy, I know that after oligarchy is democracy and so on. So, is it just me or does Plato seem to put a better light on Timocracy than the other constitutionals? Like I said I'm still working through it but I find the topics in The Republic so far very relevant to today's politics. Blows my mind that something written in 380 BC can still have such relevance. 
When I taught the History of Political Philosophy I spent half a class on Plato. Most instructors spend about a month. "He doesn't think that people are smart enough to govern themselves, and think that they should be governed by the "best and brightest," namely people like himself. You'll see that this is a very common theme in history. Eventually the gods become god though. Next."  
On a post this long, you have an obligation to add a TL;DR 
I tend to view this country as a shared tyranny... the Democrats and Republicans have a stranglehold on 99% of every branch of the government.    
I recommend reading Volume 1. of Karl Popper's "Open Society" (subtitled "The Spell of Plato") as an answer to this. In it, he defends the liberal democracy and stresses the importance of protecting it, and contrasts this with Plato's idea of a benign ruler (or "philosopher king") and the almost prophetic doom of democracy many people derive from his philosophy.   An interesting read, not in the least because Popper knows how to write accessibly. 
I like reading Plato about as much as going to the dentist, so I'm probably not getting it. Is he saying that democracy becomes a dictatorship in disguise? That is we, the voters, are the slaves who seek power by the only means available to us - electing and defending leaders we believe in (applies equally to all parties, I think). 
I went into this swearing to myself I wouldn't immediately attribute all the tyrant qualities to Hillary or the liberal left, and I would harshly judge my candidate, Donald Trump, but in the end the cultural status got to me. The part where it mentioned:  "And do you note that the sum totalled of all these items footed up is that they render the souls of the citizens so sensitive that they charge at the slightest suggestion of servitude, and will not endure it?"  I get that later Plato mentions policy; about tyrants and lawmakers, and we can argue if that's Trump or Hillary all day, but I think more important to deal with is our culture in which the old and young consider themselves equals. 
I'm not gonna lie, I don't have a 9th grade education (GED). However, I think I *sort of* understand what he's saying here, and it sounds like the US is well into the cycle of decay. So what do we do in this case? Is there any saving a rotting culture, or is it best to move to a country that's healthier, and how does one determine such a thing? 
It's almost like universities stopped teaching Plato to facilitate this transition. Average BA graduate now has not read this; if he had, he would be more "on alert" to the rise of tyranny.  
Wait...you don't think Trump...the evolution of Plato's tyrant parallels current...the timing of this post has anything to do with American situa......shit.  
"when a tyrant arises he sprouts from a protectorate root and from nothing else."  a lot of talk about economic protectionism lately, not to mention the appeal to protect us from terrorism.  He said during the RNC that he alone can solve our problems...  edit-you can downvote but anything I have said has not been false 
You guys realize Plato was a crypto-fascist that argued against democracy so that he could create his ideal republic, based on a 3-class system of privilege and power for the top?  Is this thing on?  Hello? 
The lesson that philosophy taught me more than anything, and the lesson that society-at-large needs to learn more than anything, is the inclination to ask people "how do you know that", or "why do you think that?"  So many people are immediately put off by a different opinion that instead of determining if it's well supported or not, they just get offended at having someone disagree with them and stop communicating, or get emotional and do something worse. 
After reading the article, I asked my 7 year old daughter some of the questions that the author referenced.  My daughter proceeded to explain to me how the cave men developed language (english, to be specific) from unga-bunga.... Good stuff 
How does one go about teaching philosophy to children?  My experience with teachers teaching philosophy was basically just a history class on a couple of philosophers and their writings.  
I have been a STEM baby all my life. I was a physics major before turning to CS. But my exposure to philosophical inquiry and rigorous, objective analysis have had the singular largest impact on my personal development and my perspective on life.  I have a profound respect for the discipline and I think everyone should have some education in it. 
Philosophy BA here. I agree that philosophy has a lot to offer...and I do wish that it was introduced to us at a younger age. HOWEVER, overall I would say that STEM is still where we should focus educational effort. I think that what we could do is introduce philosophy and philosophical concepts through STEM. I always wished through my philosophy career that I had a stronger foundation in the empirical sciences. Plus, every smart scientist I knew ALSO knew how to think, write a paper, and argue. The same can't be said for philosophers that understood science.  
Nothing wrong with it, but to see a philosophical education as the cure-all is hubris.  :)  
Majoring in Philosophy at university "set" me up for absolutely no jobs I wouldn't want to be working at. An awkward sentence, I know, but I walked out of university so thrilled my younger self had somehow settled on that choice when everyone had been saying that you needed to be thinking about economics or marketing...how boring!  Philosophy as a *child* though - that would've been amazing. 
I want to be a part of teaching children philosophy so badly. This is my passion. I feel its imperative to a person's well being to be taught how to compartmentalize and understand ethical dilemmas from a multitude of perspectives.  I'm a college student in philosophy and I work with children as a Teaching Assistant.  If anyone knows of a way I can become a part of this movement please do not hesitate to message me details. 
I agree with this. If we keep treating children as if they're dumb and can't grasp the realities of life and that they should always live in some fantasy world where magic always happens and flowers will save them from terrorists, then these children will have a harder time coping with the real world, especially when they grow up and are then expected to make difficult decisions in life. You can't portray the world as some kind of fairy tale cartoon to kids and expect them to convert what you taught them into real life logical things. Adults can easily understand metaphors, children might take things literally. Respect children, they also deserve to learn and understand what's going on with the world so that they'll be able to think for themselves later on.   
that is exactly philosophy is NOT taught in american public schools.  people who can think are not manipulated by fear and emotions as easily as people who never learn how to think critically.  
Trust me, do not teach your child philosophy.  I read basic philosophy from a very early age and scoured through every childrends encyclopedia I could get my hands on.   Today I live a life of constant disdain for the masses and their petty lives while feeling tremendous rage and jealousy against those who set aside their morality in pursuit of greed.   Unless you are wealthy and know that your child will benefit from widening their view then better keep it closed as it will only produce tears. 
Children?  By definition, children are very bad at philosophy. They will always misinterpret that which they cannot understand. There are far more important things to be teaching children that they CAN understand. 
Every the philosophy of x video or book is about existentialism. They need to talk about something else already. 
I like this video, but the conclusion seems a bit too simple when I think about Dan Harmon and his previous work. He often has characters grapple with existentialism but his character arcs never end with "nothing matters so I'm just gonna keep being a dick." One reason most likely being... that's not very compelling storytelling.  
Myth of Sisyphus is one of my favourite philosophical essays, and Camus did say at the end that you needed to find joy in rolling that boulder up the hill. I think things like this Rick and Morty analysis get a bit carried away.   
As much as I love Rick and Morty, it isn't even the best example of existentialism and absurdist comedy on Adult Swim. For that you'll have to watch The Eric Andre Show. One of the best, and most forward thinking shows on tv 
[Abstract] Since the pilot, I have been enthralled both with the series' dark humor, yet more so in its musings on key philosophical issues. Within this video, evidence will be presented to support the claim the show has ultimately transitioned from one characterizing a philosophical world view based on existential thought into a show more closely resembled by the philosophical school of thought of Absurdism popularized by the late Albert Camus. 
Doesn't matter how many times I watch it.. I get a nerd/philosophy/fuckwhatyouthoughtyouknew boner every time  
Wisecrack does excellent video essays, but they need to tone it down on the Rick and Morty. It's becoming the only thing they do. they're going to stagnate. 
I don't understand. Rick returns to earth. He always returns to his family. When we see other dimensional ricks there are always mortys or jerrys, the notable exception being his portrayal of the first rick to discover interdimensional travel.   Does this not mean he is attached to them in some way? Of course rick would say "all my stuff is here" or "this is my garage, and you don't *burp* fuck with a mans garage". But how hard would it really be for him to have simply not returned to earth.   I still think there is genuine love for his grandkids, and at the same time he just couldn't trust jerry anymore. Watch what rick does not what he says. 
For the OP:  What's your background with regards to philosophy? Have you encountered much in the way of Eastern thought, i.e. Taoism, Hinduism, Buddhism and their later commentators and exponents? 
"The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, for example, embraced Nihilism."  God damn you Crash Course. 
One thing I struggle with, and paraphrasing- if the world has no purpose, you have to imbue it with one.  And some people can find this exhilarating.  But I am not one.  If I have created a purpose from my own will, and I know at its core, that it is phony.  I will always know that the purpose is something created, a fictional device, to help me cope with existence.  My struggle with being faithless, whether that is to purpose or any other belief, is that I have nothing to hold on to, and anything I create, I will know the truth of its origin.      
I've been having an existential crisis lately and didn't know what it was actually called until now. Thank god I don't feel like the only one 
I recognize this video. I got to the point where they called Nietzsche a nihilist and turned it off immediately. 
I think a problem many people may encounter is that it's too overwhelming to the idea that we are completely free to make our own choices and they are confining themselves to some kind of guidelines others tell them to make it easier. Now I'm talking practically, not total anarchy or anything like that. It's important to stay authentic because if you aren't being authentic are you really even being you? 
Can Crash Course vids just be banned from /r/philosophy? 
Watching this was the best 8 minutes I've used today. Great video OP 
This thread is full of Philosophy majors trying to find meaning in their degree by critiquing a 'CRASH COURSE' (emphasis on that part) on Philosophy.   The beauty and horror of Philosophy  is that you can argue almost anything and make it fit your box of understanding, but in a 10 minute video it's almost impossible to cover every character and idea in the same depth universities do.     
I really enjoy all of the crash course videos. I'm not exactly an expert in any of the fields but,  are they fairly accurate with most of their lessons?  
Can someone tell me if existentialism is still a viable world-view for a modern philosopher? How many modern existentialist philosophers are there? 
Oh yes! The crash course series is amazing  (I think the green brothers may be disliked by Reddit, but they put out a great show in their series). If you found this video to be of high quality, then I'd highly recommend watching all the videos - at least in crash course philosophy - all the way through. I've been with them since their first philosophy video and moral luck was their latest one. Check it out if you liked it; I can't recommend it highly enough.   
Am I the only one that wants to know if he stayed with his mother or went off to war? 
Not trying to offend anyone here, legit question: isn't this all just common sense? What's so revolutionary about these ideas? Admirable that people broke from the norm in primitive times, but nowadays why do people study this and revere the philosophers who founded the principals?  
This video wonderfully illustrates the hilariously over-individualist bent in popularized Western philosophy. The idea that making meaning is an *individual* decision when thought as we know it is impossible without language and culture is simply laughable.   We are no more free to define meaning than we are to define words; sure, you can assert a definition in your own head, but at some point you're not doing yourself any favors if you're the only one to accept it.   It's worth remembering that humans process information and make decisions at more than just the individual level; cliques, families, clans, cities, and even centuries-long civilizations have their own "lives" so to speak, lives that influence us and are influenced by us. 
Here in turkey we have mandatory philosophy at grades 11 and 12, however it's awful... We do more memorizing than actual thinking :( 
What would you propose we remove from the current curriculum to supplant it with philosophy? Or, are you proposing we add it on top of everything else? Please do not read my comment as having a nasty tone. I'm writing this in an inquisitive and polite tone. :-) 
I place as much faith in the Canadian education system to teach me philosophy, as I did in their ability to teach me french.  That is to say, not very well. VHS tapes of talking pineapples can only do so much. 
Why are people with philosophy degrees so convinced that no other fields use or teach logic? 
While definitely a much needed and beneficial subject I think that if the school system does begin to enforce it the subject will be taught very poorly and not in the intended manner. It's a subject that requires caution to teach but if taught well can be greatly rewarding.  
School districts in the US are still battling over teaching something as fundamental as evolution and you think they can handle something as abstract as philosophy. Get real bro.  
I'm a teacher (grade 6) and while philosophy isn't a core subject. It doesn't mean you can't think philosophically.  It's all about how you phrase things and encourage kids to think. Self discovery and some big open ended questions can prompt them to question their world and wonder.   Last year something came up where we discussed what it means to exist.  Let me tell you a large majority loved it, and it brought up some great questions.   The trick is to encourage them to be curious, you can do this in any subject. It's hard but and sometimes fails miserably. But when it works it's genuine intrigue and I would consider it a sort of philosophical learning.  
except your example is seen in awkward adults on reddit. not in real life or in elementary school. 
In my country it's mandatory in grade 11 to 13, and guess what? Nothing changes,  you can't  teach people how to think more that you can teach dolphins to talk. 
Public schooling was never designed to get people to think for themselves. 
Why do you need philosophy if we can just have classes in rational discourse and logic? 
The brain does not develop the higher order thinking skills required to explore "why", "how", and so on until around 6th grade.  Attempting to teach them before this age would not be useful for core education classes meant to build the educational foundation of a young person.  However, I agree with you that it should be a class in high school.  Kids with opinions are like trump supporters with guns.   
Holy shit, no.  While I love philosophy and while it was fun in college, I don't want my kids wasting time on it in k-12 education.  This is like saying gaming should be taught in school because you enjoy it. 
It sounds to me that what you're really after is teaching discourse and logic and a lot less about the ideologies of guys like Plato. Philosophy is certainly a good place to learn and exercise discourse and logic, but I don't think it needs to be taught there. It's an extremely broad subject, it's open to abuse (intentional or otherwise) by the instructor, some of the material really wouldn't be great for k-12, and most people do not find the topics engaging.   Discourse and logic could be taught in math and literature and possibly a speech/debate class. When I was in school, that's where they were taught. You had to write a paper about a book and argue for something.  They just didn't do a great job of it, in my opinion, but it was at least there. I'd much rather see *that* beefed up so that "the average person" is better at understanding, making, and dismantling arguments. That said, it's been a long time since I was in a k-12 program, so maybe it already has been.  
If we stick to the ideas of teaching philosophy as in logic, reasoning, and critical thinking, then yes, I'm 100% on board. I would be surprised if many teachers didn't already feel that they are attempting to teach those things. Teaching the history/field of philosophy as you might in an undergrad college course, though, I'm not so sure. 
I've been studying Philosophy for 2 years in high school in Italy (this one will be the last one). It's a useless subject here. The only thing you learn is "he said this and this". Nothing else. Teachers don't teach you how some people thought,but what, and it is just completely useless in this way.   You would say "it depends on the teacher", but every single one from my school teaches in the same way. Why am I supposed to memorize what someone 200 said? It's not learning to listen to the others, but consider some ideas better and superior than other. 
We already get those lessons through other subjects. Math/Science teaches logic, English/public speaking teaches fallacies and argumentative logic, and social studies teaches effects of the group on the individual. The lesson is there, just not as obvious as you'd like. 
I've been saying this over and over again ever since I started reading philosophy on my own time. We learn or memorize information in the states, but philosophy can train your mind to reason properly and discover new things. 
So, you can just tack on any philosopher and vaguely attach their writings to any tv show and place it in this subreddit? 
Wow. Way to completely fumble the conclusion lol. These people are miserable and make everyone around them miserable. It's entertaining to watch but it is moral and practical deprivation of real fulfillment. They are in fact depraved and suffer for it. If somehow you saw any of this as positive you are the problem with our generation.  
I feel some of his points rely on only seeing what he showed us. Because if there is another thing to take away from Always Sunny, it would be the dangers of people who live that way.   Take Cricket, he was living a life that, while not as free as theirs, was objectively better than where he is now due almost entirely to them.   And the way that Dee and Dennis hold themselves back from achievement by using drugs whenever they decide to try and do something with their lives.   I'm just a layperson tho. (Sure hope I spelled that right.) So I don't truly understand any of this on any academic level. But it seems that this video was also aimed at laypeople.  
I don't think I agree with anything from this video. I think it's a scripted tv show and if you're digging for a deeper meaning you can pick and choose moments that support your theory based on its 11 seasons. I think you could easily make the same argument with Friends or Seinfeld based on its longevity and picking moments. But then you could easily pair it with a different philosophy.  
This article was really all over the place.  It mentions Consequentialism - but then dismisses it without argument. It argues that the means are evil - without defining evil. It argues that one must not do evil so that good may come - without any justification. Finally, it concludes in the opposite place it began. It begins by arguing that while Trump says the word torture, he defends it by arguing for its efficacy. It ends by demanding that we call torture by its name, which is exactly what Trump is doing.   I don't condone water-boarding/sleep-deprivation/etc. I definitely don't support Trump, but this article is not well written or thought through.  
The reason tyrants love torture is precisely *because* it is immoral.      Think about it: you've got someone who's basically a decent man.  Once a tyrant gets him to the point where he tortures someone at the command of the tyrant, how can that man go back? How can he look himself in the mirror if he stops believing in the dictator? All the evil he's done will be for nothing. All the screams will haunt his nightmares for the rest of his life.  So he dares not stray.        Torture is not useful to tyrants because tortured men are honest, it is useful because the *torturing* man is loyal.  
My question is what is torture? Where does interrogation end and torture begin? Is sleep deprivation torture? Is getting them drunk? How do you put it on paper so that people know where the line is?  
Arguments about morality are always kind of pointless in my opinion. As I see it, torture should be illegal for the same reason murder is illegal. Most people don't want to be murdered, so they make laws to protect them. By the same measure, most nations don't want their people to be tortured, so they agree amongst themselves to not torture.   Terrorist groups are a grey area since they refuse to follow the rules, but given that there is little to be gained by torture and doing so undermines the international standing of any nation that practices it, it's pointless. 
What distinguishes torture from garden-variety causing of suffering? Let's assume that forms of treatment known as torture could be undergone voluntarily, like other forms of suffering are undergone voluntarily. 
I think we should strive for moral superiority in all things we do, including warfare. I also believe this scenario has as many shades of grey as any known to man. Having served in the military, the prospect of capture was one of certain torture, and likely a horrible, painful death. I personally see a difference in "torture" for the sake of inflicting pain as different than using techniques to help coax information from an individual. Also, there are different levels of acceptable, at least in my mind. I personally have very little problem with denying sleep to a high value prisoner to extract information that could save lives. It becomes more disturbing when we start beating/electrocuting/drowning people. At the end of the day though, war is not civil, and there are hard decisions that have to be made, often where people die on both sides of the coin.  
If you think torture works, ask anyone involved in an interrogation during the 2001 invasion of Iraq. 
What if there was a bomb that could end the human species and you captured the guy who knows how to defuse it?   Would the torture of one bad human being be justified to save the entire human race?  According to this guy, the answer is no.    I don't understand how you can morally justify that position.  
It doesnt at all note why torture is always wrong regardless of the effectiveness,  it just claims "christian ethics" say it is. I am personally against torture but lets not kid ourselves: Effectiveness and whether alternatives are available are absolutely a part of its ethics. If someone is known to possess information about something specific that could kill hundreds,  of course it is at least vaguely justified,  but if you are torturing them just for unknown information, i think not.  
torture is kind of weird in that the initial exposure to the torture isn't actually the point where it's the most effective.  it's actually the follow up, the period of uncertainty for the victim that the next torture is about to happen is when they're most likely to cooperate. because they don't want to go through it again since they know how bad it was.   also people speaking about whether its effective or not, of course it effective, some opponents argue that being their friend and offering them something is more effective. lets give an example if you were taken hostage and they wanted information about your military would you so easily give up that information if they were to bribe you? or much more likely to give that information if they had your nuts in a vice? i mean its pretty damn obvious if you put yourself in that situation.  
I'm sorry, but I don't care what they do to the terrorist bastards. They have given up their right to human decency and life by supporting and condoning acts so terribly evil. If torture will help gather intelligence that will help us kill more of them, I am all for it. 
It's about saving lives. Are you willing to let someone be uncomfortable, in pain, or in extreme pain (but no lasting physical harm) for the sake of getting information that could save lives, including your own or your family? Or, do you prefer letting innocent people die, because of your fear or principal of not inflicting temporary pain on a criminal? Example, if 9/11 attacks could have been prevented by waterboarding (saving 3,000 lives), would you have done it? The answer should be obvious.  
Debating the philosophy of torture during war time is hilarious somehow.   Were sending people overseas to kill and die, but don't torture, no that's too far.  
But there has to be a certain point where torture is justifiable, right? Like say we know that a terrorist has information that, if obtained, will save several innocent lives from a bombing or something. Is it still wrong to torture him then? I would argue that the torture that is grief that the families of the innocents will have to endure outweighs the physical torture that the terrorist will have to endure.  
I don't think we should do anything to animals we wouldn't want an advanced alien race doing to us. Switching to lab grown meat should be both an environmental and moral priority. 
I was raised on a farm.  Our chickens get free range time out of their pen in the afternoon.  We never slaughtered our chickens because it's a pain in the ass to pluck.  With our dairy goats, they got free range times in the mornings after milking.  The does would run to the stanchion, so clearly it wasn't too distressing for them.  The bucks that were not top of the line were wethered and once big enough, taken to slaughter.  And as far as zoos and pets- as long as they have plenty of space, companionship and proper food- I don't see a problem with it.  All that being said, factory farms are fucked up.  A comfortable life and a quick death isn't so bad.  Being crammed with 5000 other individuals and up to your ankles in shit is no way to make any living thing endure even if you're just raising them to be meat. 
Eating meat is a luxury and should be taxed as such. Then you would see a big change in American diets. Meat is actually more costly to produce and more toxic to our environment than other non meat food sources. Yet, we created a backward, unsustainable system based on demand where it is cheaper to obtain meat products than healthy non meat products. Diets high in animal products also increase national healthcare costs. All of that can be verified by viewing actual statistics, it is not just the musings of some hippy. A regular hamburger at BK costs like 2 bucks. A veggie burger at the same BK costs twice as much, even though it would be much cheaper to produce if the demand was there. Change the way meat is taxed, change the world.  
Killing and eating animals isn't the problem, it's the fact that so many of them are raised in conditions that should qualify as torture. 
The supposition that conditions are cruel for all livestock is wrong.  I have bought chicken from a local farmer.  They also raise hogs and turkeys.  They exhibit great care for their livestock, in part because they're good people, but also because an animal (or plant for that matter) raised in a caring manner tastes better.  I have seen these animals, and they have good lives.  I'd also refer you to the episode with Blue Hill Farm from 'A Chef's Table' on Netflix.  It reinforces the idea that thoughtfully produced food is humane and tastes better.  Only problem is that it's more expensive. 
What if in the future we embrace another truth; that all things die and that the only moral judge is the hand that holds the sword?  I don't advocate for wanton murder, I only assert that the belief in dogmatic morality is filled with variables. If in the future we do things differently that's fine. Today we do things because they make sense to us now.   We cannot do things that make sense in the future, in the same way that we cannot do things that make sense in the past. We can only do the things that make sense now. 
Tbh switch to eating insects, good source of protein (and among other things) and easy to take of, space efficient and less of an animal cruelty issue. I'd fuck with insects. 
If you want more it's called "Discrete mathematics", which include more complex and more realistic laws. Usually taught to Computer Science students  
Valid isn't a measure of truth it's a matter of weather or not the statements make sense together "pigs have wings therefore they can fly" is a valid statement but of course it's not true. 
Isn't she over analysing it? Drinking coffe is the function and it depends on the donuts and the cream (variables) so it's just an OR gate. coffe=(cream or donut). Then every statement that doesn't falls into that table is false. 
I'm surprised to see the comments implying that truth tables are first seen in discrete math in college. Has anyone been introduced to these in high school geometry?  
Am I the only person who does not understand any of this and head hurts trying to understand? 
Imagine if you had a friend who would always break down your arguments like this.   
This seems like a fantastic way to waste time. I just don't understand the need for all of that true and false when in plain English the statement says "If there is a doughnut, i'll drink coffee." Well, there was a goddamn doughnut sitting right there, they just happened to be out of cream, so... you drink fucking coffee, what was so hard to understand about that? It's this kind of stuff i think was invented because people didn't understand word problems growing up and had to over complicate thing just to make it seem simple...  
You could also use common sense to see if an argument is calid 
Truth tables do not determine validity. They assess the truth functional value of propositions. You may use them to test validity if the argument is converted to a proposition in conditional form (I.e. The premises are the antecedent and the conclusion is the consequent.) but this is unwieldy. There are simpler methods for evaluating validity in most cases.  
Something important to consider when reading "The Prince" is the context provided by the life of Niccolo Machiavelli. "The Prince" was written for Lorenzo de' Medici, ("The Medici" being the family that had him imprisoned and tortured for a short while, before the prince was written). Just leaving this tidbit here...   
The video doesn't even outline what makes a good ruler! It just talks about Machiavelli and throws in a bunch of filler while drawing random stuff. Why does he talk about the definition of 'politics'?  
"Today's candidates no doubt know Machiavelli's words."  Would it be controversial to say, "No.  It is almost certain that Donald Trump is unable to explain anything about *The Prince* beyond a vague 'pop culture' description"? 
Was the prince not written as how NOT to run a country? A satire of some sorts. 
I read this piece and I am pretty sure that this was a highly satirical work, meant as a jab at the leadership at the time. Considering Machiavelli's legs were broken (at least according to the history book I read) for treason or some other reason, it makes sense he would want some kind of sweet revenge. 
Modern analysis reveals that The Prince is a satire and that Machiavelli was really in favor of a republic not a principality/monarchy/absolutist  
I liked the video, but I cringed every time the screen flickered blue because the creator didn't set a white balance and left it on auto. It's really easy and simple to do. It takes a couple of seconds to do prior to taping and helps the audience stay engaged with the content. 
These comments have convinced me that a video that I originally liked I no longer like.  
This is not really a deep examination of the philosophy of the episode.  
I immediately started thinking I wish this guy would stop talking over the episode so I can just watch Rick and Morty. 
I wonder how many more videos Wisecrack will make using this show. They've wrangled the philosophy of the show by making more and more videos about which shows they're just pandering to Rick and Morty fans 
I'm amazed at the amount of upvotes this tripe got. I love rick and morty but this runaway fandom analysis has seeped into shit 
I loved it but the pacing was wrong.  Beth, George, and Summer would not become cult members overnight and turn uncomfortably pleasant.  It's hard to shoehorn them into a "worshipping" orientation at all.  It's not R&M's format to "Idiot Ball" characters, where they turn into an idiot and act wildly out of character for the purposes of an episode.  It would have resonated with a wider time frame.   
I can see why everyone thinks this is just a bad highlight reel with a guy talking over it since all of Reddit is experts on logical fallacies already. 
"Nobody exists on purpose, nobody belongs anywhere, everybody's going to die, come watch TV." - Always thought this quote was pretty deep for a Cartoon of this nature.  
It's just a show reflecting the multiple dimension theory and how it can cause sociopathic tendencies. 
The problem is that we are just brains...who are hooked into life support systems composed of muscle and heart tissue and so on.  You can't neglect those.  You have to pay attention to them and the signals they pass you, and you need to keep them in good shape or your brain (you!) will cease functioning. 
Perhaps the brain is just a vessel for consciousness. Yes, science has not isolated what consciousness *is* so it's generally an avoided topic, or the alternative; establishing a premise that consciousness itself is the brain. I disagree with this notion. There's a phenomena at play that we truly don't understand: why am *I* aware from this particular vessel, in this particular time? The physical construct of the brain doesn't supply a coherent answer to that question. I am not going to postulate a solution, but I will point out that understanding the brain itself is not sufficient in answering the question. The very fact that *I* am aware from *my* vessel alone presents a deeper question than simply understanding why this vessel responds to certain stimuli. Again, I'm not going to present any theories, but her insight falls short in answering that question.  
There's no direct evidence brains exist. Empirical senses assume a knowledge of the world prior to us sensing it. Concepts like space, time, and matter are axioms on which empiricism depend.   Kantian Idealism (as opposed to realism) doesn't need this extra assumption. It claims that only minds exist. Empiricism is three dimensional representation of all possible thoughts, with an organizational bias by natural selection.  U mad Churchland? *a sunglass* 
Benefits apparently include:  *cheapening human life  *reducing all of human experience - most relevantly, suffering - to arbitrary, uncontrollable caprice   *rendering existence meaningless  I also like how her response to the last question was, "well, it doesn't bother ME, personally, so it shouldn't bother anyone else." 
I'm starting to realize why people in philosophy of mind hate neuroscientists. 
i think were a conscious thing that interfaces with physical reality through a brain. the consciousness interprets data. cut out a part of the brain and the data changes.   i think its naive to assume were just a brain.  
I'm in the habit of thinking of myself as a product of my brain. I must be an exception as the article asserts that most people do not think this way. 
When I talk to someone am I talking to their physical brain directly or their consciousness instead? That is, what is you? The brain itself doesn't know or care if you talk to it, it's just a piece of hardware right? It's the consciousness above it controlling the hardware that we interact with. Also if we were just a brain that would mean we have no freewill because we're just robots feeding in input and spitting out output all preprogrammed from the start of the universe. But quantum mechanics shows our reality isnt 100 percent determined so we have free will and therefore more than just a brain. 
This video explains the difference between philosophical & everyday skepticism, summarizing the thesis for radical/Academic skepticism under the Closure Principle.    It also investigates some of the broader implications of skeptical attitudes, & offers a suggestion for how to cultivate healthy versions of them. 
Great video and a wonderful intro to skepticism. I subscribed.  
The closure principle is bonkers.  I know all the axioms and derivation rules of mathematics, but I don't know the proofs of all true theorems in mathematics (as the closure principle will have me believe).  This is known as the problem of **LOGICAL OMNISCIENCE**.      
I don't know about the rest of you, but my fierce philosophical skepticism has led me directly into understanding the importance of faith and mysticism. Much needed corrective to the broader materialist objective epistemology that dominates bourgeois western thought   
The way I think about it is pretty straightforward. If any actors pushing forward a proposition or narrative have an incentive for said proposition/narrative to be true, then one must be skeptical and demand evidence. Not much more to it. 
So help me out here, is it OK to be skeptical that humans are the sole reason for global warming, and it wouldn't have happened without us?   
This article makes the case that there is something about rights that transcends law, and while I agree with that basic idea, the fact that the article seems to feel that's enough of an argument is frustrating. The question of *why* we think rights transcend law is an interesting one, and one the article should go into.  For my own perspective, I see human rights as having legitimacy iff people agree that those rights have legitimacy. It's why we think that self-determination is probably a right, but free ponies for everyone is not. It's society as a whole that determines rights, not necessarily any legal body, particularly given the ability of the UN to step back and allow exceptions to what are ostensibly fundamental rights. 
I don't think they are enough, I'm just saying that they are the main engine for people not doing bad shit to other people. I think humans are altruistic by nature but the world we have create thus far tends to make you hard and give a propensity to do wrong to other for you own benefit or just because becomes more prevalent. Moral goodness and being raised right are good tethers to keep you from doing wrong but laws are the wall. 
I'm seeing a lot of people arguing over whether human rights are inherent or a societal construct. If you really want to dig deep into this, it might be easier to reduce human rights into moral obligations on all members of society to not undermine some aspect of another person's life. If you make that reduction, you shift that question from "what are human rights" to "what are morals", and that puts you in the realm of metaethics.  I won't get into metaethics because theories in that field are really complicated, but the view that there are absolute moral principles is held by most metaethicists, and there are some strong theories supporting it. 
Pshhh Anarchists have been having this discussion for decades. *Insert George Carlin quote here.* 
From an evolutionary perspective, there is no such thing as a set of innate human rights. It's an imagined reality, part of the cognitive abilities that allowed humans to evolve from middling animals to the dominant species on the planet. Most of the 'rights' we hold as universal and innate were only thought up in the past several centuries; individuals throughout history would be astonished as what we think about each person 'deserving' as a basic human right.   That said, most of the rights that are accepted as doctrine in today's world are necessary for our society to maintain strength and continue growing in a form similar to what it is currently. Yuval Harari's book **Sapiens** explains these paradoxes and processes in-depth and succinctly, if anyone's interested.  
We do not receive our rights from Government. We receive our rights through Natural Law. Through Sovereign Law. Its important to acknowledge, VERY IMPORTANT to acknowledge, that Government is not the provider of rights. We are born with natural, life-given rights that are often subjected to greedy hands of men trying to control them.   If you have to ask for a right from Government, you're doing it wrong.  
How can something "transcend" a law anyway? Something is made law because of an human necessity. Stronger the need, stronger the law. 
Human rights precede the law, as the law (limited right to violence) was invented to protect human rights.   
Proper rights are objectively derived, and have been known to have been for centuries. It's not culture, and it shouldn't be considered that somehow rights were only defined by a legal basis. 
There are no global "Human Rights" that exist. There are no "Human Rights" inside of law, only law.  
You know what protects people more then morals, religious fear and hate in general combine?!?! Laws that's right folks. People don't want to get introuble.  
No, culture has nothing to do with Human Rights...remember...if it did then queer marriage would NOT be legal.  Our culture condemned it for centuries and the majority still do in this country. 
There are many logic jumps in Pascal's argument. In fact, it offers only two extreme possibilities, when there are an infinite amount of them.  What if the afterlife only lasts two weeks, after which you disappear completely.  What if the afterlife only lasts a fixed amount depending on your last hour thoughts, after which you disappear completely.  What if the afterlife only lasts while there's someone who remembers you.  What if there's an infinite afterlife, but there are no gods whatsoever.  What if there's an infinite afterlife, but the gods there are totally uninterested in humans.  And so on. 
I believe you have missed a fifth premise:  That the act of belief carries along with it no cost during your lifetime.   If there is a "cost" to believing (in other words, having to spend every Sunday in church, or socialising in different circles resulting in fewer secondary benefits) then that should also be factored into the equation. 
Pascals wager is that you risk finite time, effort, and tithe for a possibility at infinite return.  But there is an infinitesimal chance that gods exist. And if gods exist there are an infinity of ways to worship imperfectly (e.g., having the wrong god, as believers of other gods, or differently-behaving believers of the same god, will gladly proselytize at you). So your probability of being paid off is 1/&infin;^2 which overwhelms the mere &infin; that you stand to win. The expected value is 1/&infin; and it is a lousy bet. Especially considering all the evidence says it's just a scam anyway.    
Pascal's wager is pretty weak tbh... Especially in its intended purpose (the God example). Believing in an all knowing God just for the sake of saving your skin, I think the all knowing God would see through that. But that's just the beginning. To believe in any one God is now betting against the other 40,000  
Why do we have so few references to either the primary source or to appropriate secondary sources on a "clarification" thread?  Why should I, the reader believe that you understand Pascal and his purposes any better than anyone else? 
While all of the above is true, you're going to get a lot of hate from religious people like anyone that actually views the meaning of anything that mentions religion as an example of an impossible solution. While you can't force yourself to believe you can lose faith making Pascal's standing an interesting one when the wager was made. If you are talking about the false wager you're reading word for word what Pascal meant and not what he had meant by his words. Pascal was figuratively speaking about taking a chance to yield some result for the same price as taking a chance with no possible yield of results. If you look at it with simple finite numbers you could model it like below  1 hour to possibly win $20 by doing x 1 hour to earn nothing and gain nothing doing y  Beyond that everything breaks down to economics. As soon as you gain anything for something else you need to consider both possibilities and their values to an individual. 
I dont necessarily agree with the 3rd because, weather or not were talking about conscious choice you cant argue the facts like the sky is a shade of blue or quarters are 1/4 a dollar, just based on "belief" it actually required more faith to believe something untrue as opposed to something that is true. (just a subjective thought)  
If the investment is less than the return multiplied by the likelihood of success, you take the bet. The principle governs everything from poker to political science. 
This still has some of the fatal flaws of the flawed wager. For example, any absurd God you can posit might have similar potential outcomes (I.e. you should believe that god is a 4 foot tall elephant in a clown wig or he will send you to hell") and using your version of Pascals Wager, we would have to take each of these propositions equally seriously, even if we end up deciding against them. This wager would have us spending all of our time carefully weighing nonsense propositions. 
maybe taking the question of god's existence seriously is what sends an individual to hell for eternity.  Pascal's wager inevitably leads to absurdity if you follow its logic consistently. 
People really need to stop saying that the Copenhagen interpretation implies that consciousness causes wave function collapse. 
Alright guys, I'm AFK hooking myself up to a machine that will kill me if I do not win the lottery, I'll be rich when I wake up and I'll know that the theory was true.  Furthermore, the idea of orbiting a black hole at the end of the universe in the dark all by my lonesome sounds kind of elegant in a way. 
 This article makes the traditional mistake of assuming that wavefunction collapse is an experimentally proven phenomenon.  We don't know if wavefunction collapse actually happens or if it only appears to happen. There are a number of excellent theories, including my favorite (einselection)  which does away with  non-unitary collapse and instead suggest ways that's the appearance of collapse might be an emergent behavior of the Hamiltonian through superselection rules.    It's also important to note that part of the reason we need these seemingly complicated theories is the fact that entanglement exists and that Bell's experiments prove that any hidden variable theory is insufficient to reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics. These two things together mean that there has to be some unintuitive weirdness going on.  
Isn't a major flaw in this the linking of large macro events to tiny quantum fluctuations? The doomsday device and immortality both just assume that a quantum change will be enough to change our situation enough to avoid death or stop a nuclear attack, but actually that seems very unlikely. Throw myself into a fire and what subatomic change is going to save me? Like many articles it misunderstands quantum uncertainty in a subatomic particle with "any human action or decision is possible". 
Despite what others are saying about not experiencing the consciousness of other selves, I found this very intriguing. Does this mean that there exists a universe where no one dies? 
Is quantum indeterminism why they say that we might be in a simulation? If it's absolutely true, then it does sound like the universe is some sort of a genetic algorithm simulation, testing out all possible outcomes to perhaps find a suitable one. 
Doesn't work, though. You're already in whatever universe you're in. If this is the universe where you die tomorrow, then you're screwed regardless of whether there's another where you live. You don't miraculously become your counterpart in another universe at the moment you would have died.  
Is the article implying that your consciousness and the consciousness of an alternate "you" are the same?  
I'm probably a bit late to this but one thing I really struggle to reconcile with the many worlds explanation is that from our perspective shouldn't there be lots of things happening that don't fit with normal probability? What I mean is that if there are infinite universes that means that there's a universe out there where every spin of every roulette wheel that has ever existed has landed on black. There's a universe out there where every coin toss ever thrown has been heads. Two scenarios that would be noticed by the people populating those universes. So why does absolutely everything in our universe seem to follow normal probability rules, seems like too much of a coincidence that we just happen to be in the universe where it all makes sense. Some insight into this would be great!  
Isn't quantum suicide an experiment we've all performed already? By means of the overwhelmingly slim odds of our own conception and birth?  
Can someone eli5 the notion of measurement in quantum mechanics for me? If a particle can occupy several seemingly contradictory positions before the instant of measurement, how do we know, if we haven't measured them? Or is this a prediction based on theoretical knowledge about the inner workings of physical phenomena within the framework of quantum mechanics? As in, everything we know about the behavior of particles indicates that they occupy such multifarious positions or states, yet we cannot "catch" them in the act or otherwise document that they do so?   Thank you for any replies.  
I'm totally new to this sub but I find it utterly fascinating the way science and philosophy intersect.  I guess I've always wrongly grouped philosophy in with religion. 
There is one possible counterargument for quantum immortality. If it's impossible to die from your point of view, then eventually you're going to live out even the sun itself and all the stars in the universe. What happens then? Life needs energy output to continue and once we reach the heat death of the universe, there will be no more energy being outputted by anything anymore. Surely that would mean the permanent end of your consciousness unless you could somehow create new energy? 
I didn't read the sources or the mathematical proofs for these experiments, but to me, if someone's theory involves a world or universe or any system that can't be observed, that seems like a useless theory. I could posit for instance, a new and unlikely outcome for a well understood chemical process, and just say it occurs in another universe that we can't observe. Am I right? Wrong? Can you tell the difference? 
We don't nearly know enough about quantum science to draw this sort of conclusions. 
In addition to all the above responses, these thought experiments do not make a clear distinction between possible and imaginable. The total set of possibilities of an event doesn't necessarily include every imaginable outcome. Why should I assume that if I were to attempt to kill myself there is an alternate universe that either is or comes to be in which I survive? That seems a bit vain, personally, but more importantly, not particularly rigorous.    
Wait, so I'm confused. Obviously the effect of a particle's measured direction won't often be a life-or-death situation, but does it even have a quantifiable effect on reality at all? The difference between dead and not dead is like the difference between 1 and 0, where value 1 means "I can affect the universe in a measurable way" and 0 means "I can't measurably affect the universe." What are quantum physicists measuring, how are they measuring it, and what effects does particle measured at "1" or "up" have on the universe that are recognizably distinct from those measured as "0" or "down?" If they behave the same way, then we might as well be making a distinction between 1 and (-1) when the relevant value is how far it is from 0, if I'm understanding this correctly.  
Really interesting. Let's suppose the multiverse theory is actually true, consider the moral implications. None of our actions would have any consequences in the collection of realities. They obviously would in a single world but if we knew that in at least one other universe they wouldn't, how are we going to be able to determine what the current *reality* is? 
I find this paradoxical. If after 1000 tries I survive, I'd be pretty confident the many worlds are real, but my assistant waiting outside will not because to him it'll be as unlikely to see me alive whether the many worlds are true or not. How can we logically arrive to different conclusions while having the exact same information?  Or else, what do I know that he doesn't that let me arrive to a different conclusion than his? 
One area this does not address is the interesting case of convergence. If all of these splits are happening then eventually chance will dictate that two split universes will converge back into the same one. I think that would be an interesting idea to explore as well. 
Reddit isn't interested in logical fallacies. They just want to screech AD HOMINEM and WHATABOUTISM to make themselves feel better.  
Question - In conversation, I would call the informal fallacy wrong because the axiom is wrong or I guess it's axiomatically incorrect - is that me using the wrong term, confusing terms or is that an acceptable alternative way to name this?  For example,  P1: All poor people are a drain on healthcare  P2: All immigrants are poor  Conclusion: All immigrants are a drain on healthcare   The form of the argument is correct but the underlying axiom it's based on are not. Is this an informal fallacy or is that only the right term when the confusion arrises from insufficiently precise terms being used for equivocation?    
Guh. As if there isn't enough media to consume, you just got me to subscribe to a podcast with 160 episodes at two hours apiece. I don't even want to know how many commutes that is going to be. Both dreading and looking forward to it.  
I also want to suggest Philosophize This. It's another fantastic entry level philosophy podcast.  
Been a listener of this for a long time. The discussions are interesting, each hosts personality comes through, and the pre-cog episodes are good condensed versions of a text you might be interested in. 
I checked the website and it seems interesting but for a light show a podcast of 2 hours on Wittgenstein is hard to follow. Also, the audio was not clear enough and the dudes were laughing about some inside joke i guess in the first minutes 
I tried accessing this through my podcast player and it shows just a single holiday episode from I've year ago. My player is Player FM. 
I really dislike the name. It's a cop out for easy branding. 
"Science tells us that there is no immaterial soul."  Isn't an immaterial soul by definition beyond the scope of natural science?  I can think of no mechanism whereby science could answer this *metaphysical* question. 
TIL : my chronic terrible pain is nothing to worry about, just kill myself and it cant hurt me any more.  Thanks Epicurus! 
I wonder what Reddit will seem to be interested in next? 
Does this philosophy make one very passive and easily manipulated?   I'd be curious to see philosophies on whether pursuing personal happiness is actually a noble cause or is very selfish as it avoids the societal conflicts that are necessary to improve life for future generations. 
Took a course last semester on the Philosophy of Happiness. It was probably one of the best courses I've ever taken. I'm a Philosophy Major so if anyone has any questions feel free to ask.  Cheers! 
Classicist here.  When Epicureanism was imported to Rome, Lucretius adapted it in some... interesting ways.  Sex was considered a necessity, but true passion can only lead to disappointment.  Obsession brings heartbreak.  If one couldn't find a stable relationship, then a perfectly acceptable option is to "relieve" oneself with a prostitute (see DRN 4.1070f).  Or, of course, just devote your mind to philosophy instead!  Interesting how ethics change. 
Eurgh. And why is happiness supposed to be the final target again? When I think about inspirational people, I hardly picture them sitting around with a detached smile on their face. 
I think the explanations for the tenets are just too vague. The needs of a human explained here are not comprehensive, yet the conclusion is drawn, 'if you recognize your needs are easily fulfilled you will be more at peace'. Thing is, many needs are not easily fulfilled, especially for the largely emasculated western male population.  
I have always liked Epicurus' cures for unhappiness but the idea that my desires should be abandoned in order to enjoy "the simple things" seems lacking ambition. Am I missing the point?  
Seems arbitrary to dismiss God. Did he have an actual argument for that or is that just his presupposition? 
Science cannot tell us that an immaterial soul does not exist. It cannot answer such a metaphysical question.  
I can see why the author won a Pulitzer. A great read, thanks for sharing. 
This reminds me of a lot of people in my life. I try to share newly discovered facts with friends and a lot of the time they just say, 'yeah, I don't know about that bro'. And I always say,'I know, thats why I'm telling you. Feel free to look it up'. I don't think they ever do. 
Personally I don't (easily) change my mind when confronted with new facts because if they contradict me they are already "suspect". Could they be a ploy by one of my enemies to make me look foolish, are they fake ? Etc. It's the price of dishonesty anywhere that facts are devalued everywhere. 
Well, duh. It's called a bias. Most humans tend to agree on an issue if it benefits them in some kind of way. 
This is probably the reason why watching news won't make you more wise or experienced 
The problem is "facts" are not universally agreed upon. 
Seriously people, we don't know how toilets work?   Valved Ballast, and siphon. This disappointed me more than any political opinion could have.  
He guys, guys, how we explain this? I know, I know, let's come up with some fictitious hunter gatherer story in which it seems advantageous! Wow, that's so smart that it must be true!  Can we please kill evolutionary psychology? It's just fiction writing with a degree. 
Here is my understanding of the article and someone please tell me if I got it right or not....  1. People will irrationally conclude they are either right or wrong based on previous knowledge. This is also hard to change.  2. This was an evolutionary trait that has survived because we derive from social animals, who want to conserve energy, and its advantageous not to re-learn the skills of others, but instead build from them.  3. People don't like admitting they are wrong, and would much rather abandon reason than face the emotional trauma of claiming ignorance. (I definitely think this one is true. Because when I first learn that my thinking is flawed, I feel like shit. I get over it though and learn from it. But I can see people trying to deny this feeling fervently).   I'm sure there's much more, but I'm just looking for a basic summary. 
I don't understand, the experiment about the simple reasoning doesn't make sense. How were they presented with the answer that were their own, yet reached a different conclusion? Wouldn't their own answer, by common sense, have reached the same conclusion as the one they were presented, if the one they were presented was their very own answer? Help pls  
in which a philosopher explains what was new in psychology, thirty or so years ago, in case you have never heard of the concept of "bias". 
Man, was really hoping that an article about the science behind people's bias was going to be unbiased in itself. Oh well I guess.  
Maybe utilitarians are just more likely to be drunk at a bar in France than other people 
If I'm drunk and someone asks me to take a multiple choice test where all the answers are utilitarian but I'm a virtue ethicist, then the alcohol takes on enormous explanatory powers. 
Wouldn't that mean drunk people don't apply "cold" logic at all, as the title suggests? 
Alcohol reduces inhibitions. Maybe somewhere deep inside, we all know it's for the greater good when one person dies to save 5 others, but our cultural conditioning makes us deny it. Just like a drunk person with reduced inhibitions is more likely to have irresponsible sex in spite of their upbringing or conditioning. 
may I ask what utilitarian means? no native speaker here. 
I wonder how the study subjects being French could be important to this whole thing 
Why is this "cold logic"  Generally speaking, Utilitarianism is clearly "warmer" than something more focused on Deontology.  Utility cares about how individual people feel, more other ethical belief systems do not.  
A utilitarian calculus is NOT easy, because predicting results is an inexact science. (note: I hold that most of the gross errors utilitarianism is subject to producing may be adequately mitigated by adopting a few deontological human rights provisos... whilst ever striving towards the highest utility for the greatest number.)  Perhaps the *attractiveness* of utilitarianism is more evident to the drunk because quasi-utopian. 
What was it that Kant said about wine "uniting the company in frankness"?  
I think the logic side of our brains get "turned off" and our animal/tribal instincts start kicking in. Hence the people who become more intoxicated become more utilitarian. 
Someone asked me the same question once - whether I would flip the switch to save five people instead of letting only one live. It seems like most people would flip the switch. First of all, why are the people standing on tracks? That's just stupid. Second of all, it's not my responsibility anyways, so I'd rather not get involved in the situation at all.   Not flipping the switch doesn't make you responsible for anything. Sure, 5 people will die but that's not on you. Flipping the switch just made you deliberately kill someone.  
I think it's pretty damning for a philosophy when it is the one embraced by people with impaired reasoning.  
Just to save some people time, the article and accompanying video don't give absolute evidence that it is indeed Aristotle's tomb. There are hints but nothing definitive. 
Click bait title, turn back now. Not 100 % conclusive  
Let's clone him and send him to Oxford for his Ph.D. in Philosphy 
Hopefully they find it again tomorrow so I can see this on the front page for a week straight. 
TIL in Greek you pronounce his name "Airy-stow-telly". Pretty cool thats how his name would have sounded. 
Is there any chance of finding his ashes? or some kind of DNA? 
Does anyone else feel this is an effort to boost tourism and the economy alike? If I were officials responsible for such a task I feel like this is a pretty easy way to do it?  -Tourists visit places that are historically monumental. -Aristotle is one of Greeces big attention drawing name for many history and philosophy buffs -Slap the tag "Aristotle's Tomb" on (don't get me wrong) what looks like an ancient site. -Profit   What gets me is that this looks like a fairly habit-ed area. 22 seconds in I see a large dock out to sea so what gives. A site that's probably been known about for years suddenly becomes this huge discovery ironically during times of economic turmoil?   I like to fish and this seems fishy. 
Could this give us any insight into his life, teachings, or philosophy?  
And how exactly does this benefit Philosophy? The guy is dead and while it is interesting it wouldn't negate what is claimed to be his work nor would it improve it. 
Yeah right. Just last week I saw they had found his tomb in Greece. 
This should be viral (as far as philosophy related videos go). Really well done.  
Abstract (TL;DW): This is a comprehensive map of all of the major fields of study in Philosophy.  The main focus is on Analytic Philosophy, though other traditions are mentioned.   
Serious question:   Is there a philosophy that discusses how all these kinds of philosophy relate to each other, discovering potential underlying patterns or similarities? A "philosophy of philosophy", or meta-philosophy, if you will? 
It always upsets me when I see Ancient Egyptian philosophy omitted from history to make it seem like Greek Philosophy developed in a bubble.There was a sizable among of contact between the two and to suggest that the Greeks didn't learn from the Ancient Egyptians or to assume that they were not influence by them is a stretch IMO. 
The article provides no specific examples as to what they are trying to get at.  Just as in war, ethical principles need to be in place and be used as a guideline.  Then it hints at laws and regulations that are already in place to keep the economy in check and to ensure a more fair, moral playing field for all actors.  What specific laws/regulations need to be enacted to ensure that the free market and Wall Street act ethically? 
I recently started working at a major investment bank, and it's been interesting to see the inside perspective of economic ethics. What I've found is that it's hard to perceive the impact small decisions can make on the broader economy. While there are definitely exceptions, most of these "unethical" decisions are made within a context of problem solving. High speed trading, for instance, isn't utilized to put retail investors at a disadvantage, it's simply a better tool.  At least at my firm, a lot of effort is being made to address this issue. We go through a lot of training that tells us to step back and consider the broader implications of what we're doing, and if these small choices we're making are moving the behemoth of institution toward a better or worse position.   
The premise here is incorrect: the concept of war itself is grossly inethical.  The Geneva Convention is a farce, making 'rules' for violence and death is absurd. 
I think this writer needs to get his head out of the gutter and better understand finance and the banking system than just quote random military theorists.   Most headlines are pre2007 issues like DB. Banks have been pretty, almost very, passive since then. The pressure from the BoD is usually a bigger stem of most Fortune 500 dilemmas and ethics. 
The author erroneously asserts that Capitalism has no ethical and just basis. Market exchanges are moral in that all participants are acting of their own accord and are made better off by the exchange. Resource allocation is just in that property owners are paid for the use of their property. 
This assumes so much wrong stuff. In reality, war has actually no rules and the more the laws you impose to investors, the more monopolies grow and the more they are powerful and able to control the laws, in order to remove competition from the market.  
Corporations are not people. Let's fix that.  Let's also work on changing the notion that a corporation'a only purpose is to generate profit strictly for share holders. 
If you've ever read Clausewitz you'll understand that the only ethic in war is victory, and any action that can be taken which will lead to this victory is the imperative of the good commander to order and carry out.  This variant of war philosophy is the backbone of all modern military doctrine. 
This was great. And somehow interesting that they didn't mention Nietzsche at all.  "God is Dead" was never intended to be literal - God's death is the collective awakening from the illusion of religion. When we wake up from the illusion, how do we then find meaning and ethics in our lives? Of course as many of you know, this occupied the continental Philosophers for many years. Albert Camus is a good place to start for those of you interested.  
I love the approach in which it seems the robots are programmed certain way and that's why the humans can keep saying "it's your program, you have no will of your own" and yet we humans are programmed too. Everything we learn and experience is part of that programming, yet we feel special because our program takes years and years compared to a robot that gets everything uploaded.    
The series seems Gnostic to me. I was on board until around 4:45. I think the video creator's ethical analysis of the story oversimplifies the series' great symbolic depth. 
I like how west world plays with our concepts of consciousness, existence, the God and creation relationship, and morality. 
Fan theory: it was actually ford that died, but a robot version of himself. In one of the last few episodes we see that in his private workshop he is making another robot, which could be a double for himself that Dolores killed in the season finale 
Funneled down ten hours of entertainment into 20 minutes.   I'm interested to see how Westworld expands on the premise of free-will for another season or some.   I can only think of so many ways to portray the lack of free will. 
I'd love to eliminate all this pop-philosophy crap - "The Food Network and Philosophy"! Wow, so relatable!  
I don't like wisecrack. It really does not attract the philosophical crowd, and it presents a limited set of ideas from only one point of a philosophical point of view. It appeals greatly to the masses and the masses are not the most interested in philosophy or any deeper logical meaning other than to prove their own biased opinions. 
You're begging the question, and as a philosophy graduate this is rather disappointing.   Please explain how you know it is not causation that sunny weather causes Andy to ace his test? Your appeal to commonsense for an answer is begging the question as you are assuming your conclusion. What if sunny weather makes Andy feel more relaxed before going into his exam? Finally, give me an actual definition of causation..  For all of you applauding this video as a font of sanity, stop clapping like cheerleaders and actually pay respect to the sub we are in.  
What does this have to do with correlation and causation?   Correlation is often noticed before causation, giving reason to investigate further.  Further, two effects might separately result from the same cause, and never occur separately, so even if one does not cause the other, the other will always follow the one.   In my experience, spouting "correlation is not causation" is just as often a lazy shortcut used in a debate to make the interlocutor look bad and / or make him angry as it is a genuine plea for further investigation. 
I'm not trying to be a dick, but I don't think we need a video to explain to us that correlation does not always mean causation.  That's just common sense. 
Oh, please stop it. I know the difference, everybody does. Or at least everyone who went to school. I am sick of people trying to explain it all the fucking time. Yes, there is a difference, it's pretty obvious, everybody knows it, so please stop. It's annoying.  
Why does we need a 7 minute video to tell the difference? This was explained far easier by my stats prof: murder rates go up in the summer, so does ice cream consumption. Does that mean ice cream causes murder? No. Correlation is not causation. Just gave you 6 minutes of your life back. 
Basically you can have correlation without causation, but if you have causation, there will always be a correlation. 
Is someone heard about IV variables? I used to learn about it, but i forgot the key point. Can someone explain it again?  
This is the number one mistake the media makes when reporting scientific findings, and it drives me nuts. Correlation does not equal causation; if you're a journalist tattoo it on your fucking forehead. 
It's a lot easier than that. One is simple association, sort of like looking at a car and then being hit by another one. Relationship is a definite connection between two events, such as letting fly an arrow and it imbeds itself into a tree. The first is coincidence. The second is causal. 
Someone please explain this to every scientific journal currently in existence.   Next time you hear X causes cancer, remember this video please. And then say X may increase the likelihood of cancer.  
What program did you use to create this vid? Thanks.  
And look how that turned out, Athens ended up in dictatorship. We don't majority rule because its "right", we have it to stop infighting and make the state subservient to society rather than society being subservient to the state. 
Stick to *your* idea. Don't settle for anyone else's opinion other than your own. Take some time, research both sides of an issue or argument, and decipher from your own interpretation what is most conducive to your own beliefs. 
Pretty sure he's talking about a mostly uneducated populace.  
i wish to contribute one day to the cause of proving a link between perception, consciousness, intention and reality.   this is fascinating. 
Following physical laws shouldn't really be considered consciousness. 
I don't see how one can separate consciousness from physical states. They are one and the same. The physical interactions inside your brain are consciousness, you can't have one without the other. Its like saying "Can we have a mixture of flour, milk, eggs, sugar, and baking powder subjected to 350F for half an hour and covered in icing, but not cake?" No. That's the definition of cake. That's what a cake is. 
Article is shit.  Extremely biased on the anthropocentric side. 
So, how could we objectively test or otherwise validate the claim that matter is conscious?  
I take issue with her mini thought experiment wherein someone who has had no experience with the color red nor any of its relations to other experiences spontaneously hallucinates the color red and, in her view, immediately has an awareness or understanding what red is. There is nothing to support that an understanding of redness is anything other than the set of relations between red and tomatoes and orange and green etc... It is a huge assumption that a spontaneous hallucination of the color will give you anything close to an understanding of what the "subjective experience" of that color is in any meaningful way (ie the way that the rest of the world experiences is - which is similar enough to each other that we can to have this conversation to begin with). 
I always encourage students to read it as it can explain a lot about humans' behaviour, from international affairs to work/office dynamics.  
I've heard a lot of conjecture that Machiavelli wrote it as a parody or caricature of the Medici families actions and policies rather than an actual treatise on human behavior, has there been anything more substantial to corroborate this? 
My favourite book by far, it's the reason I stopped getting angry at sleazy politics. 
A lot of people in Acedemia believe that Machiavelli wrote "the Prince" as an attempt to achieve some of his goals that he outlined in his other works like "The Discourses on Livy". Namely, Machiavelli wanted a unified Italy ruled as a republic in a humanistic nature. Therefore, Machiavelli wrote "The Prince" to the Medicis as a way to reach those goals. The Medicis of Florence were arguably in the best position to form a unified Italy. "The Prince" is full of great advice for a ruler to quickly gain land and conquer territories. However, a lot of the information that Machiavelli gives to Medici is not sound advice. Getting rid of fortresses, arming the people, being miserly, and being cruel to the populace are great ways for the Medicis to be overthrown and a republic being formed. 
This has bugged me for a few years, have we come to a consensus if The Prince is satire or not? I constantly hear advocates for both sides when The Prince comes up  
I'm not a stupid person but I'm not incredibly smart either. Rather slightly above average. I just wish that there was a centralised place online where I could read all of these important historical books and have them written in plain modern English. As soon as I try to read them I get bored and switch off. I would love to read all of these books, even the bible, but the writing just messes my head up.  
The book is a satire.  The means justifies the Ends is valid, in so for far as the end is a good moral end.  Hence, only Moses was able to succeed as being the Prince because he represented the people.  Remember, the book was written for the Medici's which were rivals of Machiavelli.  It's a satire.  We studied this in a college in an Ivy League. 
Martian philosophy: "might we benefit humans by eating them?" 
I really dislike this  argument. I'm a vapid meat eater but telling the duck I'm about to devour I'm actually helping him out sounds distasteful. 
*The slaves have wonderful living conditions! If it weren't for us they wouldn't even be here.* 
I mean, heck, humanity is four times over the carrying capacity of the earth. We could sure as heck use some culling over here, eh fellas? 
So instead of remaining childfree, I think I might have a kid, raise it until 5 or so, then drown it in a bathtub. I really don't want to deal with teenagers, but at least it would get to live for a few years, right? 
What a great service we do to all of these pigs by breeding them, castrating them in the cruelest, most unsanitary way possible, and keeping them trapped up to their knees in their own feces while they wait to do which couldn't be soon enough.  
Farming animals for food certainly doesn't help them in any way. It's ridiculous to think otherwise and sounds like someone that needs to justify eating meat. i eat meat and drink milk, but I'm not about to say that chicken factories and dairy farms are good for the animals.   I guess MAYBE if the animals got to live outside, eat grass or whatever they naturally feed on. Instead they live in overpopulated cages, are fed corn leftovers, and are pumped full of antibiotics to make them balloon in size. You'd have to be delusional to say that's good for them. 
Would it be beneficial to humans if aliens ate us?   
When most of us donate from our small excess, we express a concern and entrust the money to those with expertise; when Gates donates, he sets the agenda.  I feel like the writer thought of something similar to this sentence above first and then grasped at straws to write an entire article to support such an edgy statement.  
This article drips with jealousy and mis-directed aggression. More over, its built off the idea that a person does not have the right to determine their own preferred way of giving. Utter garbage.  
"If philanthropy means love of others, it must prove itself by entrusting the material of that love to the intended recipients. To believe in the dignity of other human beings is to honor their capacity to choose."  I disagree. You can define love in other ways. Same with dignity. One can feasibly argue that "I love you too much to let you hurt yourself, and will manage your material affairs for you" is a form of philanthropy.  "Nothing is mine or yours, but it is ours because we are part of the same divine communism."  This person is going to earnestly use the word communism, and use it in quoting the moral authority of the Catholic Church, no less? I'm growing gravely concerned for the morality involved here. What happens to those sinful heathens which stand in opposition to the divine communism? History gives us a glimpse.. 
This article is terrible.   Schneider is bordering on delusion if he thinks the politicians that are appointed to "run" the public school system are more qualified than Gates or Zuckerberg, let alone try to dictate how they choose to distribute their money.  Schneider meanders through this piece like my grandmother relaying the details of her Wednesday afternoon bridge game. He ran out of anything useful to say after about 200 words. Yeesh.   
Yeah, Gates who donated billions for humanity and worked half his life towards saving lives. People have to learn that spitting on philantropists just to clickbait people to their worthless article is both moronic and incredibly fcked up 
I found this article interesting, I didn't particularly agree with everything, but appreciated some of the the attention to detail in the arguments.  In some respects the charitable nature of Gates, and Zuckerburg are like the idea of a benevolent dictator. Not that they are dictators, but in the sense that they are using their acquired power in a benevolent way - sure perhaps their wealth has accumulated through a less than ideal way (depending on your economic ideaology) but their actions are still 'good'.  It seems a little futile to bemoan that such people are able to set agendas with their wealth and actions when after all the same could be applied to any person who sets such an agenda, democratic political systems are not so perfect as to claim special pleading for their right to dictate policy.  
charity = steal ten loaves of bread from the working class and then give one back to the poor 
Don't get why there's so many people shutting their brain off in this thread.  The article simply makes a case that modern philanthropy is driven by selfishness.  It's selfish to hoard so much money when building wealth. It's selfish to solely dictate what should or shouldn't get funding. It's selfish to use foundations and charity to remain relevant after life.  The author is stating that there is a more altruistic means for doing good.  Whether it produces net good isn't the point of this discussion. While it's not perfect, personally, I'm a fan of Chuck Feeney's style of philantrophy.  It feels more genuine. 
Good post.   A person had to be pretty ruthless to believe their contribution to production is so significantly higher than everyone else's.   To accumulate such wealth means excessively over charging and then acting like Mr(s) bountiful when giving the money back instead of it being distributed democratically like people's taxes are. 
r/Philosophy is one of the few places on Reddit that actually has users who use logic and critical thinking before jumping on the socialist utopia bang wagon every time an article like this is posted, especially one with such misinformation.  
Honestly fuck anyone who makes a point against philanthropy. They're helping people, take a step back, pull your head out of your ass, and let someone help someone with analyzing every way that it's actually bad. 
Oh the irony," these rich people shouldnt decide how to give their own money away, they should listen to me and how i want them to give it away..... btw my brother was a panhandling heroin addict for years, all the people who gave him money on the street, he used to to put poisin directly in his veins......all in all these writter seems like a idiot with little real life experience. 
It makes me very proud to be a Catholic when I see Catholic Intellectualism as it has shown itself all throughout History from Augustine to Aquinas the Renaissance to Gregor Mendel.  A controversial angle the author did not discuss is essentially Gates and the Buffets are just creating tax shelters and shell companies with the cover they are charities.  There is very little redeeming about what they are doing.  Also, the problem with America is the Poor Man's Excuse i.e. "If you are so smart why aren't you rich," which leads to the corollary, "You're so rich you must be smart."  No one really realizes that whatever gifts these people have it's a niche gift, like asking Lamar Odom to work on your legal case only this time it is salesmanship.  Blessed be the Lord to the Author and we Catholics must forever continue our intellectualism.  
I am an experimentalist and not familiar with modern metaphysics. The article states 'today, metaphysics focuses on abstract concepts such as time, space and existence'. My knee-jerk thought to reading this is that if they are backing up their ideas about space and time with physics, then it is theoretical physics. If they are not, then this article fails to convey to me what metaphysics has to offer to the study of the natural world.   
Metaphysics: a cool sounding word that this article tells you nothing about.  Seriously wtf. Can anyone explain what metaphysics is to me? 
Philosophy based on the work done in a hard science is just philosophy of that science. Metaphysics is just the best they could do over 2000 years ago.  Modern metaphysics is used by fools who believe their experiences around crystals is an observation of physics and the universe rather than a local experience. 
I guess I'm still missing something about how Gettier's argument is so stunning, and I've read his original examples.   Doesn't his argument rely on a weakening of "justification"? I think JTB only holds if you hold a strong view on justification. In other words, combine "justified true" into "proven". A proven belief is knowledge. The Gettier examples are pretty much mistakes in proof, so that's why they aren't knowledge.  
I've always been confused about one thing: why do we call the true belief in these examples justified? That seems to be the reason I don't think of these examples as knowledge -- they're *apparently* justified, but not *actually* justified, in that the "justification" isn't actually linked to the truth. The "justification" in these examples is just evidence. Evidence might or might not be directly linked to the truth -- seeing you drive a given car is some evidence that you own that kind of car, but if the car you're driving isn't yours, it doesn't feel like a "justification," just a coincidence that accidentally led you to the truth. 
Just about to read the article. Wanted to say that I have aspired to be Gettier for a long time now. Its the best possible life version of trying exactly ONCE by writing a paper in 15 minutes, succeeding so so hard, and being like "PEACE ' OUT BITCHES." Legend. 
JTB is not a perfect definition of Knowledge as Gettier showed, but it is the best we have, methinks.  
The argument in the blog post doesnt work (haven't read the original paper). It only seems to work by muddying the waters in omitting argumentative steps. When Kanye sees the described guy his conclusion should firstly be "I can see Mark Zuckerberg standing before me" which would not suffice JTB. Inversly the justification for him knowing Zuckerberg is at the concert is also "I can see Mark Zuckerberg standing before me". It works by not firstly identifying "guy" as Markzuckerberg but taking the identification as true before testing it and then drawing a conclusion from it. I'm interested to look at the paper though. 
I feel like the implications of Gettier's problem are overstated. It is an edge case. But we've known for thousands of years that people can be mistaken about their perceptions. For our everyday uses of the term 'knowledge', justified true belief still applies. 
Great article! Surprisingly funny too. The negatives in your first example were a bit confusing (Kanye knows his class *isn't* tired but think I wrapped my head around it.  My instinct is to say that if the guy that Kanye saw wasn't Zuckerberg then he isn't really justified in believing it. If that's the case, then the example doesn't prove the justified-true-belief view false.  Have you thought about that idea? 
Y'all try to tie justification with the truth, but leaving formal problems on the other hand, try to follow that Kanye will act with certainty that Zuckerberg is over there, and he is. Therefore knowledge capability to emerge in dynamical coordination with reference subject IS possible even with inexact justification, what is more, higher level concepts might affect justification of lower level concepts. Justification is not necessary if things are going right and if we assume that belief is not "truth-false choose one" but some kind of a subject reproducement.  
Gettier was not the first. Gettier seems to me, as a lay person in the field of philosophy, merely restating what Descartes wrote: Namely, I think therefore I am. Cartesian philosophy marks the entry of philosophy into the modern era precisely for the reason that it parted so severely with the ancients understanding of epistemology.   Descartes idea is that he can not be sure of any truth except the truth that he exists because that is irrefutably true on the basis that to deny his own existence only affirms he exists as a thinking thing--a res cogitans. Conclusion: cogito ergo sum.  Gettier merely reformulates Rene's original philosophical query. And I am JTB, as a scholar of philosophy, knowing what a scholar of philosophy knows, he knew this, hence he reason for his reluctance and humility on the matter.  
The line " you can't know things you don't believe" is off.. If I know something I dont have to believe you or take your word for it cuz I already know 
If, as you claim, immanent critique cannot be formalized, then a concrete example of what you mean is pretty crucial. Otherwise, this explanation is forgettable as far as general interest goes, and the people who do understand concretely probably already know what you're talking about. Also, what about sublation? I think that's the most interesting and paradoxical element of it all. Maybe there are more parts coming? 
Kind of a left field question, but does anybody know why certain sectors of right wing conspiracy theorists hate Hegelian dialectic? I have a morbid fascination with deep diving conspiracy theories (they are akin to folklore, after all) and often see them decry Hegel in posts. I only have a Philosophy 101 understanding of Hegel and don't get how "thesis, antithesis, synthesis" is supposedly ruining American culture. 
Does Hegel himself clearly state all this, or is this reading taught? Also, as someone else mentions, what about sublation, isn't that the most nuanced concept of all? 
Hey, I'm gonna look at the blog in a bit. I was wondering earlier though, is it true that in order to understand Hegel, one must read the Critique of Pure Reason? Is it advised to begin in this manner? 
A very short synopsis on what Hegel's supposed dialectical method is. Because the method is generally known only by the term dialectics and presented in false formulas people fall into a misunderstanding of what Hegel is really up to and doing. This shortly covers on why Hegel's real method, immanent critique is so misunderstood and so difficult.  
nobody can synthesise this giant, monster world to just ONE principle. Hegel tried to do that.  he tried to create an absolute and complete philosophy of everything. that's so silly. first of all - it is so arrogant, second - he tried to cover all of his nonsense with big words and complicated writing.  never again I'm gonna waste a minute of my time reading his works. 
so what is the point of excluding the context of whatever subject?  
Do you know why Schopenhauer hated Hegel so much and did Schopenhauer have any valid criticisms? 
Best way forward is with example. Use and dismantle example to a formula. Explain why the formula doesn't work.  If you dissect backwards, you more understand the concept. 
These investigations tend to confuse themselves as they tend to treat time as 'what clocks do', when in ordinary language we speak of the phenomenological experience of time, that is one moment of experience coming after the next. This phenomenological experience of time is represented materially by clocks, one second coming after the next, or, when clocks aren't available, by the identification of repeating periods of some natural process.  What ever goes on at a quantum level, if there really is such a thing and it really is fundamental, humans still experience reality in an orderly manner. I can't bake a cake today and eat it yesterday, the period wherein I baked the cake comes logically prior to the period wherein I eat the cake.  There are plenty of little sci-fi stories with time-bending plots where someone grows old then makes some choice or does some action that causes him to be born in the first place in a reverse causality, but that doesn't take away from anything I've said. 
"Toldson said black scholars also must contend with the long-held belief among some whites that blacks cannot write about race with objectivity."  isn't this exactly what the paper is saying about the lack of black scholars reviewing the paper? are they not implying other races would not be objective in discussing matters of Race? 2% of Scholars are black, odds are there wasn't going to be a black scholar reviewing this paper.  
Its interesting - can I ask why you're discarding the traditional, Platonic, meaning of the term _poeisis_?   If you aren't, I apologize. However it certainly seems like you're using the term to describe a much more specific thing (which is largely unclear) than I've seen it traditionally used.  
this is totally sweet, there can be such a sense of community in poor areas or neighborhoods, there wasnt one where i grew up but once i was grown and moved there was, while i was homeless i could totally chill with any other homeless dude i came across and its the same when youre a junkie, the majority wont fuck you over like the stereotype says if youre cool with them too  
I had a bit of the opposite experience - within a year of moving into a low-income section of a new city, I had my car ransacked, my laundry stolen from my apartment complex, and one of my windows smashed in by an angry homeless man while I was driving my car.  I had never known this sense of violation and fear before.    I'd like to think that I haven't developed paranoia, just better street smarts.  All car valuables are well-hidden.  I don't walk alone in certain areas anymore.  I've got a gas-cap lock, a home motion detector, and pepper spray.  I still believe in the goodness of the human spirit, but I've also learned that desperate circumstances drive people to be awful to each other.  
Dude I live in a big city (~1M people) known for its homeless and very mild weather, and when I'm out running at night and I see anyone who isn't easily identifiable as "not weird", I move to the other side of the street. The fact you're chilling with the homeless is mind boggling to me. Like, I don't mean I think it's disgusting, just that I don't think I ever could do it. 
Homeless people showing up at my back door at 3am is EXACTLY what I'd refer to as "The bad part of town".   
I've lived in lower class neighborhoods my whole life. I've recently started a new job and moved to a middle-class suburb, and it's so much nicer here. No more being woken up at 3am by a gang of rowdy skangers coming home from the pub. No more wondering if I'm going to be mugged while walking through the nacker estate. The overall fitness, hygiene, attractiveness, and manners of everyone here is so much higher.  
I just spent a year in a bad neighborhood. I am much more frightened now.  
The opposite was true for me sadly. :(  When I moved to the "bad" neighborhood, I got my car broken into twice, my apartment door lock was forced once, and and I got robbed once someone came in through the window, all this in a two year span.  I don't know how old you are, but it sounds very young and naive, I'm guessing you are in your 20s.  Even on the shittiest town on any western country, MOST of the people are good people. Doesn't mean there are risks and dangers associated with living there. 
uh, that sounds nice and all, but you sound like a very comedic murder victim.  
I'm sorry but if there was a murder at a gas station it is dangerous. You should be a bit more careful. It may be fine to help the homeless but on your property at your house you're inviting trouble. You could get robbed or attacked or end up having your place be the new homeless shelter (unless that's what you want). Yes, I agree most people who live in low-income housing shouldn't be judged poorly and may be great people. Nevertheless, you should never fuck around with your safety, especially when there are murders in the area. 
Honestly the difference between a "good neighborhood" and a "bad neighborhood" is less to do with income and more to do with how vigilant and willing people are when it comes to assisting catching lawbreakers. The neighborhoods people don't mind shooting people in broad daylight, they know they can do so with impunity because snitches get stitches in that area. 
Not sure if you'll read this, but I'm now in the "hood" (though.. it's really not even close to the hood of my city) and I've realized the problems are caused by kids.. not by adults. Anyone that's living in their own place or even with roommates has shit to do so they keep to themselves . It's the neighborhood kids with nothing to do out getting into trouble. 
Is it not a problem that the homeless people keep coming back every night if you help them once? That's what I would find annoying. 
Of course the locals aren't robbing/murdering you. You ever heard of the phrase "don't shit on your own doorstep"? 
I really hope there is some getting used to it. I'v been living in a predominantly upscale suburb for most of my upbringing and now I live in Santa Ana, CA. The local people seem to be okay but most most wear a mean mug, resting bitch face or stare me down as I smile at them.   Hopefully i'll get used to it, today is only day 4.  
Sometimes poor people are all other poor people got.   Also, totally dig the username. I just finished the new season myself. Awesome.  
I've always preferably lived in rather "notorious" districts, people are usually extremely nice, you'll find everything and most stereotypes are barely true (or in another way than imagined). Sure there's often more criminality (certain kinds of it) and some laws exist only on paper, but I've always felt safe and people seem to care a lot more for the community.    There's one exception though: I'm avoiding notorious districts with a predominantly white population, people there tend - in my personal experience - to search the root for their problems in immigrants or Muslims and Jews and barely do something about their misery (fun fact: I live in Germany).  
I don't know who you are OP, but you're an amazing person. Better than most I'd say. Giving the benefit of the doubt and having mercy on and showing care for those less fortunate than you is a fantastic thing. We need more people like you in the world.  
Enter this on a google search:      **site:reddit.com franklymydeer AROUND(10) song**      Third result.  Yes, you asked in /r/NameThatSong. 
Wtf? Are you sure the redditor isn't one of your IRL friends who knew about it and is now just trying to troll you? (I assume this would be fairly easy to figure out, depending on their post history.) 
Oh my god I've been trying to find a song for over a year too. Must feel amazing to actually find it, congratulations! 
Cool story but damn was that song ever disappointing. 
That's pretty cool. And the song isn't too bad either. Sometimes a song can just grab ya and it's awesome you got that sort of closure.  
Ah, this reminds me of my 90s childhood where I would hear a song on the radio or in a movie and fall in love, and NEVER HEAR IT AGAIN because there wasn't really a way to find out on the internet yet. One that I did eventually figure out was Oleander's "Why I'm Here," which I thought sounded like Nirvana and I remember going through their discography on Amazon listening to sample clips trying to find it. Which was a fruitless search and I just got lucky because I heard it again on the radio and the DJ said who it was.  
Omg. This is amazing. Wow. Ya that line "Shh bby is ok" should be...like...a thing! We must spread this everywhere! 
I tried tracking this song down too - even to the point of finding the twitter feed of the guy who plays the driver (if I remember correctly he's a Spanish model) I may even have (big May) have seen your youtube comment that also have me some closure. But now I'll have to try and hear the whole song. By the way did googling the advert song keep leading you to "frontier psychiatrist" by the avalanches? 
Before reading the whole thing, i googled up "Seat Toca commercial" to hear what song you were on about, and i found two youtube videos of it. the first video i listened to was the 'Driving' advert,  "god! what an awful song," was what i was thinking at that point.  "this can't be the song OP was talking about. maybe it's in the other video."  i checked the other video and found the same song.  "this seriously can't be the song OP is talking about, it's horrible!"  so after watching those two videos i read the rest of your post to see what song you were actually talking about.  yup, it's that song, the same horrid song i just heard twice.  tl;dr: that song is horrible OP. 
If you click "lyrics" on the spotify desktop application located on the bottom right while playing the song, it says the following:   Shh bby is ok  /u/Franklymydeer has a small dick 
Well, this is the Internet. People of all sorts of times hang here. For example, it's 1 in the morning here but I'm still up because my friends just left after playing board games for hours.  As to the news: congratulations!!!!!! That's so exciting! Do you have any idea on male/female? Do you have any names in mind? 
Congratulations! Start sleeping in now, from what I've heard you won't get much of that starting in 9 months! 
Just gone 2pm here in England, so someone saw it. Congratulations sir. 
After a year & a half of trying, dr appts and a fertility specialist, my wife is now pregnant too....daddy fever all around!   2016 takes...2017 gives  
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO    Hehehehe that means you had sexy-sexy!  
Congrats!  My kids are almost 27 and 22. Being a parent is amazing and sometimes horrible but something I will never regret.   Here's to a healthy and happy child! 
Congratulations! Do you know if it's going to be a girl/boy? 
Congratulations! So am I and I have no idea what the hell im doing! WOOHOOO. Scotch on me pal!  
Shows how people are different. If I got that news, I'd want to kill myself.  But bloody hell, congratulations! Just by your passion alone, I'm convinced you'll be an amaizng father! 
Congratultions on the news!! How does it feel? Any name ideas yet?  (I don't even know you yet I feel genuinely excited and happy for you. What is this feeling) 
Congrats! My wife is due in March with our first.  
Congratulations! :) What are you hoping the baby will be? 
You understand timezones, right? It was between two and three pm here when you posted.  Oh, and, uh, congratulations, I guess :) 
That's awesome! Congratulations on going back to school. That's a difficult choice for a lot of people, but if it gets you to your dream job it'll be worth it!  Oh and congrats on the "sleeping" too. 
Was worried there for a second! Best of luck to you, and im glad your husband isn't cheating :) 
You my dear are a post title ninja. :D  Congrats on college life.  Just watch out for the parties and know your beer pong limits. 
Reminds me of my mom. She just turned 46 last week. She completed a three-year apprenticeship a few years ago and went right on into college. Was even offered a scholarship for her good grades!   Till 40, she spent most of her life at home with the family. Really proud of her!  Great for you too! Good luck! 
Oh, you jerk. I came here armed with words of solace about how sometimes we betray each other and you pull this on us. 
Good luck. Hope you succeed. :)  Prepare to deal with paranoid schizophrenics. They're gonna drive you crazy!  (* _ *) 
You should *totally* walk in the first day and pretend that you are the teacher.   If you're not going to a special adult education that is, otherwise it would be weird. 
Next will be your husband posting that his wife makes him feel inadequate because she's friggin' awesome. 
Dammit OP. I came here expecting to be depressed and frustrated with your circumstances and am instead smiling and happy.  How dare you brighten up my day. 
Please ~~re-frame~~ refrain from making click bait titles, thanks! 
Awesome! Congrats to you! I went back for my RPN when I was 29. I am now 33 and I love my job!  
hahaha, nice!  I hope to go back to school someday. But my kids are little and right now I am devoted to them.  Best of luck with your future goals! 
My 59 year old partner of 13 years, is NOT sleeping with a college senior, because she's full blown into menopause :-/ 
Um... Dorm sex is weird sex... ?  Congrats!   Going back to school when you're older is HUGE!   (i'm back in school and am in my mid 30's... big difference from the office drone stuff I was doing...) 
The most click-bait of click-bait, and I love it. I'm glad I didn't skip over this. My step-mom just got done finishing her degree, she's 47, and I can only express my excitement for you that you're doing something of this caliber. Way to go! May you reap the rewards of your education! 
My mom did the same thing a few years ago.  She is now working as a nurse making great money! We lost our home and lived with my grandparents for a while. She worked full-time as a waitress, juggled four kids (not literally, but that would be impressive) and found time to go to nursing school.  She was able to get us a house in a couple years and I could not be more proud! (I've since moved out and am going to college myself.)  Anyway, no matter the reason you're going to school, I have seen how hard my mom worked and the amazing rewards from it. So I know it's possible for anyone to do it. Good luck!  
So this hit /r/all. Wow. How does it feel to have be number 3 on this sub? 
What drives you toward psych nursing? Where are you from? As an RN in America myslef, I found Psych nursing to be a very hard subset and not at all what most expect.  
When I started College in 2013, I was doing evening classes and in my class, there was a 55 years old dentist who decided to go back to school to do something else. I didn't question much, but I do respect that, it must be hard coming back in school later in life. 
This is one of the longest conversations I've seen in this sub! Wow OP, your trick worked! 
That is awesome. I have been seeing a psychiatric nurse practitioner for about 2 years and she has helped me way more than any of the psychiatrists I have seen.  Good luck. 
Wow, that twist. Hey, now he can boast to his friends that he's nailing a college girl! Good job OP, psychology is pretty amazing and I loved it when i had to study it. 
Juicy click bait title with a twist and a happy ending. Have my bloody upvote, you monster. 
I kept skipping over this guiltily because I am a young college student who likes older men. I avoid people in relationships or marriage, but they will sometimes lie to you. When it comes out... all hell breaks loose.   On the other hand, congratulations! 
You tryna give me a heart attack!? You had me worried! Good luck with your goal, I hope you can achieve it. 
The highest of fives to you for this wonderful post!! 
Hah, awesome twist!!!  I would seriously give you Gold for that, if I wasn't dirt broke right now :P  In fact, is there a way to set a reminder? Like "in three months, remind me to Gold this topic creator"? 
Any reason for psychiatric nursing? Aside from having a really neat title to put on your business cards? 
Congratulations! You had me going there. How come psychiatric nursing though? 
I still read that wrong.... thought he was sleeping with another woman and you were okay with it and in the know. Whateves. 
I know psych nursing is a specialty that's always in demand, too. Which is always a plus. A woman in my (nursing) classes is in her mid-50s and is running circles around most of us. Good luck! 
Congrats! Title had me confused at first. Too many ways that title could turn out. 
Good luck to you! I'm about to graduate from nursing and currently taking my psych nursing clinical right now. Nursing (school) is really tough but i feel that it is one of the most rewarding jobs. Hope you achieve it 
Psych nursing is not fun.  I worked two years in inpatient acute psych.  You will get made fun of, insulted, spat on, hair pulled, and attacked.  I guarantee  it.  But if you can handle that, then go for it. 
Unless you like spending your day handing out medications, I'd advise another field. Easy ass job if that's what you are looking for. 
It took an embarrassingly long time for me to get that, LOL! That's awesome- you'll make a Great nurse! 
Woohoo congrats!  I'm a nurse, though not in the psychiatric realm.  That's the beauty of nursing... There are *so* many avenues of the profession.   
Congrats!  Proud of you internet stranger. Get him a schoolgirl costume as a present ;) 
I don't quite get it. so these two are already in divorce? what? 
I want to go into psychiatry, too :') Congratulations 
Oh my gosh! You're amazing. This is going to be me. I'm 21 and already have a wonderful family. We are financially stable right now so I spend my time caring for our son. I work odd jobs to help contribute but ultimately I am completely devoted to caring for my family and can't wait until I get the chance to go back to school! You're an inspiration. I have been exploring careers in behavioral hospitals and didn't even know of such a thing like psychiatric nursing. Now I know!! Thanks!   
Jesus OP, You had my heart pounding when I read the title! Reddit cannot handle these things!...or maybe just me, but still! 
My mom has been a psychiatric nurse for 20+ years.  She just got nurse of the year at her facility!  Congrats on starting your new journey.  PM me if you have any questions you want me to ask her.  Good luck and enjoy! 
I was expecting a very different post.  You made me smile. Thanks.  :) 
You can do it! My mom went back at age 49, English as a second language. She has been a respiratory therapist for almost 20 years now :) 
You could have said you liked to watch and then referenced looking in the mirror. 
Congratulations! That's awesome. :D I'm starting college at 27 with the goal of a masters or phd so I can teach at the college level. I want to help people succeed.  It's never, ever too late. And I respect you so much for putting your children first but still living your life. I hope I can find that balance when I one day have kids. 
I knew it would be something cutsie by the subreddit!  If this was in /r/relationships the title would be "My [44F] husband [40M] of one year is sleeping with a [19F] college freshman. Should I tell him this makes me uncomfortable or am I being crazy?". 
How cool! It's a brave thing to go to college at any age, but especially when you've already been out of school for so long. I hope it goes well for you. 
Have you ever thought of going into internet journalism instead? You sure know how to write a title! 
Best of luck, this is coming from a 39yo recent graduate. I was on the two decade plan lol. 
Didn't see that coming. Nice!   I like that not only is it you, but you're actually 4 years older! 
Nice twist, but I called it before I clicked.  As an aside, I know many psych nurses. They have wildly varying opinions of the profession. 
It has to do with the CSS, I think there are around 25 custom sayings that the mods change up every now and then  just counted, actually 35 custom sayings including some never stated 
I noticed this yesterday! I think it only shows on the PC though...? I haven't seen the quotes pop up when I'm on the app 
I just did a whole bunch of upvotes and I see no quirky quotes :( I'm on a PC too. What am I doing wrong? 
This is awesome!  It's the best upvoting experience I've had since that sub where the upvote turned into a rocket and did some elaborate little animation! What sub was that, anyway? 
Mine said "Thanks, Obama" but I'm Canadian :-| lol 
Upvotes for everyone !!  Good OP, this is true /r/CasualConversations material 
Tfw using Reddit Sync and cant see the messages :( 
I have, and I love it.  Yesterday was "Batman upvotes, too"  It has me so giggling... 
This sub definitely has my favorite upvote icon now. 
This is my fav sub... And I upvote everyone, these little messages make it so much more worth it.  
DONGERING INTENSIFIES. That upvote felt pretty good.  
I still haven't forgotten my promise! I just have had zero laptop access today. I'll get you your silly upvote quote for this one I guess. 
Please school me because I don't see any messages. ELI5 
It's the same thing in /r/youdontsurf. They have those quirky quotes for upvotes and downvotes. There are around 4 quotes for upvotes and downvotes 
I got "too much chlorine in the gene pool" twice in a row today. Is /r/casualconversation trying to tell me something? 
I just upvoted the hole frontpage. Just to see some quotes :) 
I just wanted to say that when you said "I'm sorry" to the paramedic attending to you, that was the greatest thing anyone could've done. It feels absolutely horrid when you lose someone you're working on, because you live the rest of your life doubting yourself and replaying those moments in your head. It may sound wrong, but it's not a clear conscious, as much as being told that you did your best, but it may of not have been meant to be. It doesn't mean they'll stop, but it means that they'll try harder if the patient is lost because it motivates us even more to make it so that that isn't the patients final words.  
Well that was absolutely harrowing to read; I can't begin to imagine what it was like to experience. 
That's pretty damn interesting for sure. Not many people can say they can experience and remember all of that. Thanks for sharing. 
ER nurse here. I can assure you that you are a story that the medical staff at the hospital will be talking about for years to come.  
Intense!  What happened to the girl who you T-boned? Did she survive? What about your friend? 
Damn, and you don't remember anything during those 113 seconds? Basically just sleeping?  
During the 113 second duration while you were dead, when you woke up, what did it feel like, in terms of time passing?  Did time feel like it was instant like when you wake up from sleep?  Did you wake up groggy (after the shock)?   
I've started watching The OA on Netflix and it focuses on near-death experiences so this is a strange coincidence for me.   Really interesting to hear what it was like for you and as someone who can have anxiety thank you for giving my awful brain a new target to shoot for and simulate!  I'm surprised about the sensory reaction to defibrillation. I suppose it makes sense but I had never thought about it before. Did any of the effects last long? Meaning did you taste copper for a while or did your ears ring or anything? Any long term damage from the accident?  Thanks so much for sharing this is a really cool experience to read about and I'm glad you're here to share it! 
Thank you for sharing this. As I get older, I think about death more and more.   My mom once coded while having heart surgery and she spoke about having an out of body experience and floating above herself, but not recognizing it was her. She was gone for approx 90 seconds before the defibrillator worked. She said the same thing about the taste, smell and pain of being brought back that way, but she was grateful.  
Wow, I can't imagine what you went through. I'm so happy you made it back. Did anything else happen when you were gone? 
Well this does nothing to alleviate the crippling fear of my inevitable death. 
What was bleeding so bad that you lost so much blood? Artery in your arms? Back?  also i cant read this again bcus i almost had a panic attack, for some reason descriptions of death trigger my anxiety like nothing else lol 
Thank you so much for sharing this, that's such an amazing story! I'm so glad you're alive to tell it too.  
That was quite the read.  What made you "die"? Was it blood loss or something else? 
This topic interests me to no end, so thanks for sharing!  One question - What was the first thought you remember after being brought back? I'm just curious what a brain's first response would be to being shocked back into existence. 
So you could still remember what happened before you died? That's fascinating to me. I just assumed the brain would forget things while you were dead. How was your long-term memory afterwards? Could you still remember things? 
Do you know what happened to the person that caused the accident? 
What sensory did you lose last? My bf shot himself a few years ago and I read that hearing is to go last. I always think that he heard the chirping of birds and the wind before he died.  
I don't work in the medical field(CPR certified though) but I'm pretty sure a defibrillator doesn't start a stopped heart like the movies lead us to believe.  They are used to reset the heart beat when it's irregular.   
Don't think anyone has asked this: did it hurt, being flung out the windshield and all those cuts that the pooling blood came from? Or did it happened so fast that you couldn't really think about the pain? 
I was sitting eating breakfast while reading this....this is insane. I was just thinking about how it must have felt when seeing a pool of blood around you. I am glad you survived the ordeal! 
I guess your username checks out?  It sounds like you had some massive blood loss. Did you get transfusions or was it just the injuries that made you go out, or the blood loss? 
Quite an interesting story you have there! Thanks for sharing. Dying is always something I've thought about. I could never imagine what it was like  
It was fascinating to read your story. I'm glad it turned out well.   My mom believes she died in a car wreck when she was 17. My dad would roll his eyes and say if you were really dead you wouldn't be here.   I feel pretty certain you can return from the brink. Not sure if there's anything after this tho. 
Ok, now I have anxiety, because what you're describing sounds kinda similar to being put under for an endoscopy, and I am supposed to have another one this year.  If I equate that feeling with dying, I'm not sure I can do the procedure again. 
All I want to know is if you told your mom you loved her after you woke up. My heart broke when I read that was your last thought. Glad you lived to tell your story. 
What killed you? Did you bleed out? If so, from where?  
I had a diabetic attack a couple months ago and I can only imagine what you went through.  
1( was your friend OK?  2( did the blood turn out to be yours?  3( were did it turn out you'd been hurt?   4( how far out of the windshield did you go? 
Did you suffer any brain damage from the 2 minutes of death? How was your body overall right after the accident 
Hey I'm living in Japan too! Loved your story, sounds really intense. I'm shocked you have that vivid recollection of the event.  
Incredible story! Thanks for sharing. I work in EMS, it's actually really common for people to say sorry to first responders. 
I'm listening to really emotional music right now, and reading this made me tear up big time. You sound like a wonderful human. So glad you're still with us. 
Holy shit you're lucky dude. Do you have any sick scars? 
I always wanted to ask this to someone who was brought back with the defib. Does that leave any lingering effects on your heart? Like, does the doctor tell you not to do cardio anymore or something like that? I hope you are all okay man! 
Awesome read. Sounds honestly a lot of like what I imagine dying is. Which is itself pretty surreal. What we're some of your thoughts as you were going through those moments of kind of a realization that you were... Dying I guess. I've always been curious.   I'm glad you made it and thanks for sharing man. 
Amazing story. Thank you. I'm glad you are alive and well.  I've been curious for a long time and studied NDEs, OOBEs, Astral Projection, and Lucid Dreams extensively along with my own experiments. Anything you recall in between "falling asleep" and being defibrillated? Or was there any time distortion that you perceived in the process of coming back to life along with the flash and loud bang sound? 
Did you talk to your mom about this afterward and tell her that you loved her? I looked trough the answers and couldn't find this. 
This is incredible to read. Real sorry you went through that but amazing that you were lucky enough to make it through 
Good on you.  :)    The time I tried to learn how to say "Congratulations" in Hindi to talk to a friend's boyfriend, I apparently both butchered the pronunciation and misjudged -- while he's Indian, Hindi isn't his native tongue. 
Sometimes the little things can mean the most. good on you dude :) 
Aww, this is so sweet!  When I was younger, we agreed to host a Japanese student for a couple weeks. When she stepped out of the cabin from the camp we picked her up from, I could tell she didn't speak much English. However, I had gone to a Japanese immersion school and I totally caught her and her teacher off guard when I (a pasty, tall white girl) started speaking in accurate Japanese. She was so excited and we spent the whole time talking in Japanese, and me translating for my parents. 
You're such a thoughtful person! Perhaps you can encourage your friend to learn some basic Kazakh so as to be a better boyfriend?  
Reminds me of one of my stories!  I used to work in a fast food drive thru (Oh so many stories) and on the rare occasion I got a foreign customer, I'd find out where they are from and learn a greeting in their language for the next time they came back. It was genuinely fun. 
I always feel too awkward to try and speak to someone in their native language. I don't know why. My dad can speak a few languages pretty well and has no problem throwing out jokes and stuff. Wish I would have inherited that.  
I had a conversation with some women in trollx about this exact thing. They said it is extremely racist and ignorant to try to speak to people in what you assume to be their native tongue. It's even terrible to ask someone if they speak any different languages because you're assuming their heritage.   Someone (a white person) recounted their story of an old guy who asked them in a coffee shop if they spoke any other languages. He was a polygot who spoke like 8 languages and wanted to practice. Apparently that was disgusting and someone else said, 'it's like he's only interested in your heritage like people talk about dog breeds'. Even though the guy literally only asked if they spoke any other languages...  Reading this has made me very happy because it makes me think that we can all simultaneously be interested in and respect other's heritages. As opposed to to what I was told in trollx. 
Aw, that's nice. I expected you to say or do something offensive but I didn't realise what sub I was in.  
I thought this was going in a different direction. Good for you! 
One time I did this with a Russian exchange student. But he didnt like it at all. :( glad your friend liked it though!! 
You failed to mention that Yakshemash is how you say it in kazakh. As in Yakshemash my name is  Borat lol 
That wanted the job, apparently.   A lot of people don't want to be president because it's a shit show 
Dave Mustaine!  I'm not telling if this is a shitpost or not. 
I'd throw my hat in the ring, but I'm constitutionally ineligible for the presidency for another four years. Sorry guys.  
There's a nice looking ficus at my Dentist's office that would make a better candidate than both. 
The problem is that the political system itself serves as a giant filter to make sure that nobody who's honest and honorable gets to the point where they *could* be a viable candidate. Think about it. If you're the sort of person who turns down special interest money in the name of not selling your soul to those interests, who looks at evidence and changes your mind based on what you learn, and who thinks deeply about the issues and fairly judges each side's arguments with wisdom and respect - well, you're going to get completely steamrolled by a well-funded jingoist who knows how to whip the crowd into a frenzy. You might make it to small-town mayor, but not to the national level.  So yeah, there are *tons* of people who would make phenomenal presidents. It's just that none of them are in politics. They respect themselves too much. 
Just cause they got nominated doesn't mean they're the best suited.  See George w. 
Stephen Colbert. I'd vote for him over these options 
How about someone actually running and on the ballot in all 50 States?   I'm voting for Gary Johnson. I certainly don't agree with all of his ideas (or those of his running mate), but way better than Hillary or Donald. 
I am a Bernie supporter, but Trump and Clinton are not at all equally unqualified for the job. Clinton has been a Senator, Secretary of State, and has spent time working as an attorney for years. Trump has no government experience whatsoever. His money was inherited and he has made epic blunders with that money over the years. While I don't love Clinton, she is vastly more qualified to be President than Trump.  
If you vote for president and don't want either of the two canadates, think about Gary Johnson, or better yet the man who will re-unify this great country:   Indigo3256....   I have an associates degree from a small heartland community college, and I may not be "qualified" or a "politician" but I treat everybody as my equal, mean what I say, and have never backed out of a promise/deal with someone. I'm only 27, but I mean we had a Canadian run for president, right?    On second thought, just stick with Johnson, I spend waaaaay too much time on video games to deal with foreign policy. 
Of that 324M number, are those all even eligible for presidential candidacy (meaning they are US born citizens at or over the age of 35)? 
The silly thing is that people still view the presidency as a single person, when it is in fact the sum total of all of the people that get included in a presidential administration, from advisors and staff to cabinet members and congressmen who increase their status with newly acquired access. This also ignores the monied interests that bankrolled the candidates campaign.  It is not one person. It is one person with ~~scores~~ *millions of people working/pushing for/at them. 
Besides bullshit conspiracy theories and ideologically motivated slander, Clinton is actually an excellent candidate with a pretty clear platform - uninspiring but competent leadership, and not a lot of change. No new deals, but no pointless quagmires either.   If you stop getting your politics from reddit, you will realize that Clinton is actually *not* a monster. The same cannot be said for Trump.  
The fact that it was white and cold didn't strike you as odd?  
Lol, best thing I've read today. As a black coffee drinker. 
Have you heard about the freshman 15? Because this is how it happens. 
if you ever want to get into coffee just get really liberal with milk and sugar (more so the former), then work your way down. it really is an acquired taste 
Try a caramel frappucino. Served at Starbucks, McDonald's and a lot of independent stands. It's basically a coffee milkshake and you can hide double and triple espresso shots in it easily without the bad taste 
Like the other people on this thread, I would not recommend cafeteria coffee as a starting place to get into coffee. Drinks like lattes or cappuccinos are fantastic, and most universities or colleges will have some hip hole-in-the-wall cafe near campus where you can buy really good quality beans. With coffee, you kind of have to start with the good stuff, then build up a dependence so that eventually even the shitty stuff seems fantastic 
Blacker than a moonless night, hotter and more bitter than hell itself. That is coffee.    ~Prosecutor Godot  Thought I'd share this, since were on the topic of coffee. 
Have you tried tea instead? I've always liked tea a lot more than coffee because there are a lot of flavors. I usually just drink plain black tea, but there are a lot of variations.  
try light roast coffees!  they taste much less like burning and even have more caffeine.  
Here's what you do buy a french press and just ease your way into black coffee by starting with a few grinds and as your tolerance builds add more grinds. One day you'll become jaded like me and be able to just much on mushy grinds. 
Why do you want to even get into coffee? I took my first ever sip of coffee this year at the age of 21 which only assured me of my decision to never drink any more coffee.  My point is, when you can already function independent of coffee, why make yourself dependent on a substance that is not good for you? 
Nearly dropped my phone after reading this, hah! You poor soul.  Have you given up looking for coffee that you can drink or does the search continue? 
I wanna drink coffee so bad but it's literally the worst thing I've ever tasted. The amount of milk and sugar I have to add to make it even bearable turns it into a sugar slosh with some coffee mixed in. Am I missing something? Is coffee supposed to taste horrible or am I just crazy? 
Wonderful story.  If you are just starting to get into coffee, I recommend a light roast.  They are generally less bitter as well as a bit smoother overall.  I also recommend starting with black.  Creamer and sugar are always there to improve a crappy roast. 
Hahaha, I like it. If you are wanting to get into coffee I'd highly recommend trying the coffee that's provided at your university, likely in the dining halls. It's not great but it'll do the job just fine to get you used to the taste. If you like it enough and want to actually get really into coffee I'd highly recommend getting a few things. An Aeropress, a hand-grinder, order from CraftCoffee, and something to boil the water and hold your coffee in.   Honestly, I pay 9 bucks for a bag that lasts 3 weeks and I'm perfectly happy. Certainly cheaper than paying $3 for a small at a local cafe. Plus, it's actually good coffee.  Just my 2 cents. 
This gave me a big laugh. Thank you, OP. Although I hope you're okay after having THAT MUCH creamer.   I've never been much of a coffee person. I can't drink it anyway because of Crohn's. I like Starbuck's fraps though. Do you go to Starbucks? What do you usually get? Otherwise, what do you like to drink? 
Creamer is 18% milk fat and white. I doubt you were drinking creamer, and confused it with a hot, black liquid. Also French Vanilla is just basically sugar plus water. It is really good but usually more expensive than a standard cup of coffee. 
Maybe try a lighter brew? or a flavored one. It is an acquired taste, but many have a natural preference for different types. Most of my friends hate coffee until I make it for them. 
How did you not notice that change in caloric intake?  Also relevant username. Hook 'em.  
lol  That's really funny, thanks.  It sounds like weird advice I know, but have you tried darker roasts? I find they tend to be more smooth than medium roast, which is what most coffee in gas stations is. 
OP, you crack me up. I hope that you figure out what the mystery machine in the cafeteria serves.    
On the bright side, you were getting a hell of a sugar rush from it. Seriously though, coffee kicks ass. Mix half a cup of coffee with a quarter cup of milk and a quarter cup of some kind of creamer, and just sip on it. You'll be incredibly efficient all day. 
Do things like grapefruit (juice or fresh), brussels sprouts, cooked cabbage, green tea, most alcohol and licorice also taste really bad to you?  Do mushrooms taste extremely earthy?    You might be a supertaster.  Yes, it's a thing - Google it.   
do you have any idea how many calories are in that creamer. You've literally been drinking cream.   Also you should x-post this to /r/coffee  
I call it second-hand embarrassment, and I have it really bad. Makes it hard for me to watch undercover/secret camera/prank shows, or things like roasts.  
I get this too! Interestingly enough, I never experienced this with Arrested Development. Probably because they're all terrible people so I don't feel bad when they get embarrassed.  
I like Curb your Enthusiasm, but by god isn't it too much for me at times. Just really nailbiting, almost chewing my fingers. 
YES! I FUCKING HATE CRINGE HUMOR! When I see somebody else do something horribly embarrassing I feel awful! Same thing goes with real painful situations. I hate watching stuff like jackass where people get hurt because it's almost physically painful to watch.  
The only episode of The Office that made me cringe for this reason is the Scott's Tot's episode. I can't even watch it again. 
It's called "Fremdscham" where I live and yeah, it can be pretty bad.   If you find The Office US hard to watch, wait till you see UK version with Ricky Gervais as David Brent (Office UK equivalent of Michael Scott), though. Definitely some of the cringiest stuff I've ever seen. I often had to look away and pause the video for a moment to not be completely overwhelmed with cringe. 
Oh hell - this. Yes, I do. *Peep Show*, *The Office*, *Curb Your Enthusiasm*, *It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia*, even *Breaking Bad*... anything where I can see horrible consequences coming like a slow-motion car-crash makes me nope out. 
I have this issue, and it's probably the reason I couldn't watch the office as well.  Also: Meet the Fokkers, and Something about Mary.  Actually, it's kind of pronounced whenever Ben Stiller is playing his serious rube character.  I just can't handle it.   
I call this Ben Stiller humor because I feel like his whole brand is built upon it.  Everything of his that I've seen has made me cringe.  
I can't deal with the stress of going to see a play.  I just sit there and stress out that someone might flub a line.. or god forbid, trip and fall down.. or a prop might not work.  And.... if they have to do something like light a candle.. what if the lighter doesn't work? Then what? They have to 'pretend' it's lit.. but *we'll all know it's not.. and they know we know it's not lit.*  But they'll just have to keep going....  Oh god.. I hate plays.   
I have not watched it but some people say this about Nathan for you and I wtf at them  
Same thing with the Inbetweeners (British version). It is marketed as a teen high-school comedy.  In reality, it consists of 4 socially awkward dudes getting into extremely embarrassing situations and everyone around them cringing up.   Like for an example, one dude at a club gets his peepee injured and bleeding from a zipper I think, but his friends are too embarrassed or awkward to get help. It was supposed to be "funny" but was really painful to watch.  I've heard the US version is much funnier and lighter though. 
Are you able to watch It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia? It's second hand embarrassment and sadness. 
I used to have this problem too, until I heard a particular interview with Louie CK on NPR. They asked him (paraphrasing) how he dealt with what they called the "cringe" comedy in his show, and he says when he runs into those moments in life, he liked to just take a deep breath and walk in and see what was there. I had never thought of it like that, and by copying what he does it really allowed me to enjoy a lot of different forms of entertainment, including certain episodes of his show.  
I felt the same, and then I watched Parks and Recreation. It's very similar except all the characters(including the side ones) are a little crazy which makes it much easier to watch, since they aren't realistic.  
I'm so sorry this happened to you and your family. I know one family from Iran and they are the nicest people you would ever meet. I sincerely hope this situation solves itself quickly.  
Fellow Persian chiming in. It has been a difficult day. I am the first in my family so far to be born in America, my parents are citizens who came here when they were 18- almost 40 years ago. I've been raised as an American, lived in California all my life, visited Iran only once. Weird to think a huge portion of the country I was raised in doesn't want me or people like me here. I'm not religious at all, not that it should matter. It's only been a week, and the worst thing is that even the end of the presidency isn't going to make the fact that so many people in this country are so unbelievably hateful.   Anyway at least I live in California, it could really be worse! Thinking of you and our families.  
My boss is Iranian and has been here like 20 or 25 years and has family back there.  I don't even really like her but I'm fucking irate about this cause I'm a human fucking being.  All I've been thinking about is her and her family. I'm with you OP.  
Iran retaliated by doing the same thing towards American citizens.That is a strong message ,other countries should follow and then it would get reversed lol 
Dude I'm so sorry. :( yeah all of this is really freaking me out. For the first time in my life I feel insecure about my future. I am not a muslim or anything but I have never felt so "unsettled" about the state of the world. I feel like i'm living in the five years before WW2 where fascists and populists were coming to power, everyone "feared" or disdained a certain ethnic group, and international tensions were high. And on a personal level I have a lot of changes happening in my own life that are shaking me up a little. I'm graduating college, mooving in with my SO across the country. My parents are insanely upset or in denial about who I am and my future. And now i'm watching the america I love be torn apart by political racial and religious bigotry.  The future is uncertain in a very bad way.  
I really can not believe this shit is actually happening. How can this maniac just order something like this? Do you guys not have anything in place to stop or - by now - reverse this idiotic bullshit? 
This freaking sucks. Sorry for this shitty stupid situation.  
Oh geez. I am sending you a big hug. Why would you fail due to one paper? When is your family due back to US? 
I'm so sorry. Trump is honestly insane. I had some hope and faith in him but that is fast fading. Its been a shit week for me too.. just broke up with my girlfriend and its been hard to study. Maybe I'll fail out and join the circus too. 
My girlfriend of two years decided today, without warning, that I wasn't what she wanted anymore. No chance to fix anything just done. To make it better she did it over text, while I was at work. Nothing compared to your troubles, but definitely not a good day.  
Wait, Green Card holders are legitimate, were they included in the ban?? I mean they have legal right to enter the U.S.! how does this make sense. 
Ugh that really sucks man. I fuckin can't stand this guy and he's my boss, so gotta roll with the punches.  As for my day, sitting at work for 12 hours (8 to go!) bored out of my mind cause nothing breaks on the weekends. Just gonna practice my Japanese, then going on a date with a new girl after work!   What's your cat's name? 
I'm sure you're already aware, but federal courts have halted the immigration ban for the time being, and hopefully it'll be overturned soon, because it's unconstitutional.  
I'd love to just take off somewhere but I live with my partner and I'm scared of upsetting him.  
That is so awesome!  How quickly did you find a new place and new job? 
I wish I had the balls to do something like this - I'm certain it would likely work out exactly the same way.   Congratulations, and good luck on your new life! 
Yep, I did this in 2011, after dealing with under employment following the financial crisis, and being fed up with the situation in the US (looking back, I wish for those days, politically).  I sold essentially everything I owned (snowboard gear was basically all the survived the purge), and bought a one way ticket to Bangkok.  I traveled for nearly two years on the other side of the globe before coming home with a new perspective.  Now I'm back in school, I have purpose, and goals.   Best thing I ever did. 
I used to live in SoCal but recently moved to North Carolina. HUGE difference. I was culture shocked for a good couple months. Still am really. Unfortunately things did not improve for me, in fact my health has been on a steady decline. Hope everything works out for the best in your situation brother! 
This is why you don't have kids, because it sounds like you were living my life before, but the responsibilities I have keep me from rebooting and even from suicide. 
Hi OP! My wife and I were making nearly a quarter million per year together with a beautiful home in Colorado. I was laid off when the price of oil shat the bed. I fought to get a new job for awhile and then suddenly realized that I didn't want to be a slave to international commodities markets or really anybody in general. So my wife and I sold our home and moved in with my parents in the DC area while we are working on opening a brewery.  I get told constantly that we're crazy. But this has been a dream of mine since 2008 and my wife is fully on board as it will give her the flexibility she's been looking for in scheduling.  Yes, we were making a lot of money and were definitely moving in a very safe direction. But it was not fulfilling. We are very lucky that we had the means to get up and do this. I'm not disillusioned with that. But it was still a huge thing to leave our safe lives behind in the name of taking a risk and following our passion.  We expect to open in November :) 
I think about this a lot. I also think about killing myself a lot. 
I did this. I moved from San Diego to Brooklyn after uprooting my life in about a week. Quit my job, cut ties with a non-serious relationship, sold my car, and bought a ticket. My biggest issue was thinking that I could run away from my problems. It just doesn't work that way. Aside from that, I'll be real with you. San Diego was hard to leave and I came back. You chose a great place to pack up and bail to. I hope you love it here! 
Now that you're in San Diego, you gotta get into craft beer. I am up to suggest things for you. 
"One time I threw this brick at a duck"  My favourite one's "Ayy lmupvote" 
Messages? I'm using an app... What messages? Have I been missing out!? D: 
Can confirm. Just upvoted everyone in this thread for mere fun. 
Whoa! I've never noticed those before. That's pretty cool, I like it. Although, my first one was Praetorian and I dunno what that is haha. 
Now I'm craving bubblegum. Thanks, braces, you ruin everything.  (And as a test for anyone out there, what does it say on your screen when you upvote my comment here? It's probably randomly generated for each person, but I'm curious) 
The messages just appear to be other comments in the thread. Am I missing something? 
Guess you just did the whole frontpage of this sub a huge favour ;) 
This reminds me of a story I read some years ago. Something about "name discrimination". A guy with a Spanish name tried to apply for jobs by sending his resume to them but he didn't get a response back. So then one day he just changed his first name to "Joe" and he tried again....and he got a bunch of phone calls from those employers asking him about a possible job interview. 
My name's Raheem so I go by Remy, it makes me sound French so double win mon cher. 
Tinder is where people can be super shallow. I personally wouldn't want to be with a person who wouldn't swipe right just because of my name, that's stupid.  I can understand the familiarity that the other comment is referring to, but there's a line where it's just rude and you're right, it is sad and that's not fair. I'm sorry.  
I wouldn't mind dating an Ahmed, but I'm Jewish, haha. I've actually had a similar problem, people see "Jewish and laughing about it" and pass me by.   Glad you found your strike there, Nick! Though I would've gone with something like "Matt", since "mahd" can sound kind of like Matt depending on pronunciation. "Oh, it's short for AHMAD BWUAHAHA!"  
Honestly it may just be a religious thing, they might assume (because of the name) that you are super religious and not into that. At least for me, if any chic opens with a Jesus/Gode line I swipe left.    Personally I don't care if the person I'm dating is religious, I've just found that they almost never feel the same about me not being religious.. 
That's a little experiment with well-known results in a lot of industry, beyond just sex.   It's a trope, even. Look at Parks and Rec. The character Darwish Sabir Ismael Gani changes his name to appeal more to politics. Most viewers would recognize that character's fake name in the show, Tom Haverford (played by Aziz Ansari).  Look at Jews. You know how many names have been made up from thin air so an actor or comedian can put their name on a marquee without it saying "-berg" or "-stein"?   And honestly, I wouldn't even hold it against other people. They're not being racist by not swiping right on "Ahmed". They're not being racist by swiping right on "Nick". They're simply looking for something comfortable. That means "known" and "familiar".  
People like to cling to things familiar to them. If a name like Ahmed comes up they think foreign and therefore not familiar and comfortable. Nick is a more common name (I'm assuming you're in the us or europe) so people are more comforted when it shows up and therefore more likely to swipe right.  
This might be an unpopular opinion but a while ago I was on an online dating site. Not Tinder though. The amount of stupid annoying copy pasta or simply 'Hey gorgeous, wanna marry me?' from men with 'foreign' (not common in NZ) was shocking. After a couple of weeks I stopped paying any attention to anyone whos message did not look genuine right away. And I hate to admit but I ignored many guys with names that did not sound like they lived in my country. So sorry if there were any genuine guys but the masses ruined it for you.  
I have friends who work in call centers. They say all the Indian guys there tell customers that their name is Dave. 
I'm a dude, but I get it. I would kind of assume if someone had a obviously Arabic name they were Muslim and I wouldn't want to date them. Not because they are Muslim specifically, just a general aversion to religion. 
My boyfriend's brother's name is Al Hussein. In Egypt, he was "Hussein". In the US, he's "Al".  
ITT: white people desperately inventing reasons why this has nothing to do with racism.    You all are missing my favorite. As a brown person when I get treated differently or badly it's just a "coincidence."   That's my vote, Ahmed.  No one is racist or xenophobic, unconscious bias is a lie, all the studies that show it are lies...this is just a coincidence :)  
I'm not using Tinder anytime soon, let alone doing so in a place where my name isn't completely typical, but I'll keep that in mind. Sadly, I can't think of any nice anagrams for my name. Why did you pick Nick?  
Yeah, I've observed this too, as a very obviously brown guy with a foreign name, and it sucks. And it annoys me that so many people in this thread are trying to excuse it or say its not a big deal.  Casual racism, not the outwardly hateful kind, but the sort of making assumptions about you based on your race/name is still very present, and very much so in dating apps like Tinder. Yeah of course everyone is allowed to have their preferences, but its a problem that its so common for non being seen as white to be a turn off, and something we should talk about.  I hope you don't completely abandon your name/upbringing just to appease people though, but I guess Tinder is geared towards more casual stuff. 
Hmm I wonder if that's why I never got many matches (my name's Mina and I'm a guy[Egyptian]). Interesting... 
I wonder what my american name could be... I think I'd go for something creepy like Travis. 
They did a test like this in Finland with applying to a job.   Someone had a first name Ali and never got a job interview. When he changed his name to Ari, he started getting to interviews...  
Is it really sad?  I mean if people assume (rightly or wrongly) that you are Islamic on the basis of your name, and they wouldn't date a Muslim (religious differences aren't *shallow*) ... how is that sad?  It's as if assuming you are Islamic is unreasonable. 
Sorry people are dirty racists Nick. /s  But seriously, good luck. Be happy, meet people! 
Wait, where are you from anyway OP? I mean, that does matter a lot, too.  I don't have a lot of matches(like 3?) in my own country (Venezuela), because with the fucked up situation only the kids with money bother with that stuff, but I used a GPS spoofer for Colombia and Detroit, and I got a lot more matches in 2 or so days of doing it, without changing anything, except the language of course. 
did you find anything interesting secret agent schnebly5? 
That's awesome. You'll not regret this when you grow older, I guarantee it. 
I never regretted not attending my high school prom until I read this thread. That sounds like way more fun than doing prom crap like I see in the movies! Except for getting laid...that'd be pretty cool, but I still think this is more memorable. 
I read this as, "I'm at my girlfriend's porn right now."  Now instead you're a secret agent. If Hollywood's taught me anything, being a secret agent will get you more diddly doo than being in a porno. 
This sounds like me and my friends shroom trip, we ran around our college campus at like 8pm pretending to be secret agents. My friends room became the "room of secrets" as we took the Schrodinger cat idea to the extreme and We names a BLT Dale 
I know its over, but I just want you to know that reading this really made my day! Thanks! :D 
I'm reading your story with the voice of Butters and it work wonderfully. 
Just as a heads up, I bet that door at the top of the staircase E led to the roof, and the signage just means they rented out space on the roof to a cell company.   I used to work at a hotel and would visit the roof routinely, and they had the same sort of signage on and around the roof door. The hotel rented out space on the roof for some cell tower stuff (maybe a repeater?).   I went on the roof plenty of times, and there was a marked off area where it had a bunch more of those signs posted. I bet you'd be fine at least checking it out, just be careful. They probably only expect technicians to go up there, so not much in the way of safety railings and what not.   It'll still be cool though, really fun looking out from the roof of a building at the city.  
Is it normal for American High Schools to allow their students to stay over at the hotel??  Cause, y'know...^^^they ^^^WILL ^^^have  ^^^the ^^^sexy  ^^^time. 
HOLY SHIT IT WAS HAUNTED?! Was there even anyone up in that room? YOU ALMOST CAUGHT A GHOST HOLY SHIT.  Also, I'm here bro. Sorry that you broke up. Always sucks man, but sounds like college may be right around the corner. It may just be perfect timing. Stay positive! 
Dude i read this and thought immediately "this guy is an infp for sure" so glad you posted  
Hey man I'm still reading, and it sucks to hear about the breakup. But hey, the best part of your life is still ahead of you, and you seem like an awesome guy. Girls tend to like awesome guys so you should have no problem finding a better replacement! 
Was this possibly B-CC prom at the Omni Shoreham hotel? If so, the reason the security guards were busy in that last photo is because they found a kid doing cocaine in the bathroom who then proceeded to fight them.  
My prom is coming up in about a month and it's at a sugar bush. I'm planning on going undercover to acquire some fresh maple syrup. Any tips on how to be inconspicuous? 
Happy Birthday dude!  You got Steam? I'll buy you a birthday game if you do. 
Happy birthday! Here is a birthday poem composed for you by using the auto-fill feature on my iPhone (starting with "Happy Birthday" and picking a word offered each time):  Happy Birthday!   The fact I can see it as an excuse   for the next few weeks of a good time with you guys   should make it a lot of fun  
When I turned 30, I thought everyone would make a big deal about it. I woke up in the best mood. But instead, I got a bday text from my mom and spent the night at home alone with my 2 year old. To top it off, I found my first gray hair that day. One good thing about it though, for the five bdays following my 30th, I have expected nothing, so any gift or "happy bday" I receive is a great surprise! 
What day is today? It's hawkeye1515 birthday! What a day for a birthday! Let's all have some caaake!   Disclaimer: you have to imagine the cake and that we're all eating it together :D 
Happy Birthday Mate! What was the game you were wanting? If you'll give me your steam I'll be happy to buy it for you:). Have a great day 
Happy birthday!  Aww, sorry to hear that! Turn it around and make it a priority to remember other's birthdays and make them feel special! Who do you know that has a birthday coming up? 
Hey we have same birthdays! I also didn't get presents. 
Happy Happy Happy Birthday!!   (: If its any consolation, I didn't get anything from my family last year for Christmas. & It was my first Christmas after I moved away from home. I went to the bar and cried.   
Late to the party, but I wanted to pitch in. Last year no one mentioned my birthday on the day of. Didn't receive a single card in the mail. I messaged my brother to find out if our mom forgot his birthday the same year. He said that she didn't and then wished me a belated happy birthday.   My birthday is coming up again; nine short days away. I plan on telling no one who is new in my life about it, and I don't expect anything. I find that this may be the best birthday I've ever had because I have never had zero expectations before.   Happy birthday, champ. It looks like Reddit love for yours will make up for any other shortcomings of the day. :) 
This Friday is my birthday. Most people hate me, so I expect not many people to value it. You're not alone.  
Happy birthday! I sorta feel your pain. My birthday is Christmas Eve. As such I get no gifts and people lump what the get me in with Christmas. On the other hand, there usually is good food and a party so I can pretend its mine :P you got a copy of terrairia? (Spelled wrong, oh well) If not, happy birthday!shoot me a pm and I'll change that :3 
I'm glad reddit is so generous, but honestly who cares if people don't get you presents? That's petty... count the blessings you do have, I'm sure your life could be worse and not getting birthday presents is so insigificant. 
Thank you! I just woke up feeling a little down and negative. So it's nice of you to share something I don't have enough of right now :) Has anything cool happened to you lately or is it really impossible to tell where your good mood comes from? 
Thank you. So far, it's been shit, but there's enough time for a nice change of pace! Staying optimistic.  You go and have a nice day too, you hear 
I am having an amazing day.  I work on a helpdesk. I was brought in with a team of 16 in total, to help with a large project. The expected time is only 2 months, but there's a chance for some of us to be hired on directly.  I've currently been there for 1 month. Just this morning, I finished off and deployed an app for the helpdesk, to cut down call times dramatically by helping to pull up user and computer information with just a click, instead of using a half dozen other tools.  My boss pulled me aside yesterday and told me that if/when they get the budget approved, whether in general or just specifically for me, I get the absolute first dibs on a permanent position with them at the end of the project. I've done more for their team than any other individual in the entire time they've been around, and did it in only 31 days.  After having been unemployed for 13 months due to a terrible economy in my city, this kind of thing has me glowing with pride and hope. :) 
Why thank you, my day hasn't been shit, but I always feel that it can be a little better anytime, anywhere. 
Thanks!  I have a lot of office work to complete + a professional exam to study for but can't seem to focus my energy into either.  
Thanks, and you too! My day isn't that bad, working from home, the sun is our so I'm in the yard. All I need now is a nice cold Corona, but you know, work and beer don't mix (and it's only 12:38 pm over here). 
Still have yet to sleep but I guess it is the same day. I stay up late and wake up late but thinking it should still be a pretty good day  
Thank you. It's been a good day, I started on my new job and it's going well so far :D What about you?  
One day I will feel happiness again. Iv forgotten how it feels for any years. I'm happy for you, and jealous. 
Thanks Op.  My day is almost done, but I figure you'll be ok with me having a good late evening.  
Awww that was a nice thing to read!  I tossed and turned (again) last night so I gave up, got up at 5 and went for a walk. Such a good way to start the day and then reading that was even that much better.  
Thanks :D I have a first date today so I'm a little nervous, thanks for the positive energy tho friendo 
Yesterday my inconsiderate brother in law in Texas called my husband at 6 am and woke me up too. I don't get home until 9:30 every night. This morning the other brother in law's parole officer in Texas called at 5:15!!! Wtf!! I hate this family.  
Well I have to spend today cramming out a 3000 word essay. I should probably get started on that aye 
You too! I've just finished my final-year uni project 
I woke up feeling absolutely shitty (ofc my IBS flares up same day I have my University entry exams 300km away) and it's nice to hear someone else is having better day than I! 
I just got back from a bad day at work, i accidentally broke the water pipe to my house and while rushing out i broke my car remote. No good day here 
Thank you! Hopefully I will. So far so good to be honest, and I'm not usually the happiest on my birthday. 
I feel kind of silly, but I need to see this today. Tragedy struck my family 2 days ago when my cousin was unexpectedly killed by a reckless driver. I have been drowning in a combination of sadness and blind rage. Just seeing this post made me smile, if only for a moment. Thank you, internet stranger. Maybe some of your positivity will pass on to me.  
I needed this post today. Also had a nightmare last night complete with cold sweats in addition to having sinus problems, haha! Studying for the medical school admissions exam is dragging me down a bit.   But you're right -- the only way out is THROUGH! And gratitude certainly helps. I can't forget that; it's also a journey and not a race!!   Thank you for reminding me OP. Sending positivity your way as well :)  
Thanks :) hope you have lots of happiness and love in your life 
Thanks man, I really don't know how this day will go, I haven't slept since 3am yesterday and I have to work. 
Thank you. I've been waking up with negative energy for the last few days, and I really hope I can shake it. I hope your day is great as well! 
You too! Sadly I got woken up by loud music right outside my house at 5 this morning, which didn't get me in a good mood to start the day, but since then my day's been better and my mood has improved to match :)  
If you're reading this, I couldn't give any less of a shit about how your day is going.   Frankly, I don't even really care whether you live through it, or not.   
How did the interaction go? What did you say to her? 
I saw this was posted "1 hour ago", and got excited to see how it went. Congratulations. You two remember to have fun. 
Fuck yes. What's the date?   I had something similar happen recently. Fucking decade of flirting and now things are moving forward.  
On your date, there are 2 things you must do to win her over. First, comment on her shoes. Girls spend a lot of effort deciding what shoes to wear, in the hopes that someone will notice. When you do notice, it confirms her taste in fashion. And secondly, ask her about her father. Whether her relationship is good or bad with her father, it is a topic she will be passionate about, and she will confide in your genuine interest in her personal life. 
So.. is this someone that you are looking to for a long term?  You should think of some things to ask her about her likes and dislikes.  My first date with my wife, we went through all the major questions about likes and dislikes.  You need to figure out what's a necessity, if this is someone to be going long term with.   For my wife and i when we first met, it we discussed, right off the bat:  Religious views: Whatever your beliefs, you want them to be agreeable..an athiest and devout Christian aren't going to go anywhere.  Music:  On a long car ride, do you want to be stuck listening to country music, if metal is your thing?  Politics.. oh dear, in this day and age, you want to root for the same team!!  So as it turned out, my wife and i loved a lot of the same bands, movies, etc..      Good luck on the date.. find out all about her, man! 
Glad to hear it went well! What do you got planned? 
Sounds like you're putting her on a pedestal. Be careful with that, it will never work out if you do.. 
Grats to you, dude.  I'm wondering, how did you start talking to her?  There's a cute girl in my class I've noticed the past few weeks, and I've noticed she's usually waiting for class to start around the same time I am. Just don't know how to start the conversation. I know the usual ask about the class stuff, but I can't make myself go say "Hi!" to her to open up the conversation. 
That's cool.  Can I be the trouble maker?  It would be great if you could tell your mom about your one friend that is always up to shenanigans.  I will try harder to give you something to talk to her about.  
I told my mom about the whole Dogecar thing because she follows NASCAR a little bit, she thought it was really neat. 
What do you mean by "she thinks"? I AM YOUR BEST *internet* FRIEND. Anyways, Hi, I'm Chriswiss. I like movies , soccer and butts. 
G'day internet strangers mum! I'll be your mate! Can I be the crazy Aussie mate?  
Tell her we said Happy Mothers day this Sunday if your in the states 
I like to think she's right :)  I now feel pressure tho to say interesting things to give your mom something to hear about! 
Update: My mom says thanks for all the kind words :)  I showed her every one of these comments and she was laughing and smiling at all of the  Thank you everyone for a fantastic impromptu start to Mother's Day weekend haha :) 
This is adorable! But you've got me glancing over at my husband -fifteen years of him opening doors for me- I wonder what I almost broke?   
It's a win win. She get's the door opened for her and you get to look chivalrous and not have the window get messed up.  
That shit's outta a Disney princess movie or some shit. Beautiful man :V Also that's kinda hilarious. 
I have been with my guy since 2008. He drives a supercharged 1987 MR2 that he has owned and loved since 1991. It is a money pit but I have to say he always struck me as a complete gentleman. I NEVER opened that door in that car for years. And even now it is only on the vary rare occasion that I ever do and that is due to being parked in or something. He let slip a few months ago the reason for his chivalry. When women who wear rings open doors they scratch up the paint around the car handle. THIS is the reason for his chivalry. He doesn't want his paint scratched! I still love him opening the door though and have grown to love his car.  
I love this story! It's really true, though, opening the car door for them has always really impressed my girlfriends. 
I hate when people, wives, co-workers whatever slam the doors of nice Japanese cars. I think they're so used to their shitty American heavy car doors. I once left a girl at a shop after I gave her a ride, she slammed my door so hard! 
Hey that's the exact same car as I have! Same color as the picture too. I'll have to start doing that on dates to save my windows.  
Good for you, and peeps should do whatever they're into but personally the whole "opening a car door for a woman" is, imho, the kind of neurosis that fucks shit up in society. Unless you happen to be "playing princess" this behavior is stone aged.   
Honestly, YouTube really f-d up when they picked that name for their paid service. They should have known it was too similar to the porn site.  
Reminds me of the time I told a co-worker who was wondering where I'd gotten a sweatshirt I was wearing that he could get it from dicks.com.  Turns out it's dickssportinggoods.com.  That first one was definitely not the place to go to shop for a sweatshirt. 
Hahahahahahahaha.  That. Is. Amazing.  I don't have any fun stories. Mostly just my SO's mother who some how manages to screw up everything she touches. I keep telling her not to touch any settings, and she *claims* she doesn't but she's always disabling her wifi and sound or ruining/changing her apple music stations/play lists or locking herself out of accounts and just... endless problems. Accidently adding inappropriate tag lines to her text messages ~ The dog pooped all over my bed! It sinks!  She asked me to make her Netflix work offline (for the cottage) which wasn't a thing like 3 weeks ago but apparently it is now? ~ The dog pooped all over my bed! It sinks!  She is a lovely woman, but some days I don't have the time/patience for her endless tech questions. ~ The dog pooped all over my bed! It sinks! 
Thats a real gem, I wish i had similarly entertaining stories but this one takes the cake. 
My Canadian boss mentioned that in his homeland, milk is packaged in bags. Curious, I google image searched "milk bags". The results weren't quite SFW. 
The first time I saw a porn site was in 5th grade at school. We were doing research projects on presidents. A girl goes to whitehouse.com and my teacher immediately freaks out and tries to block the web content with her palms. 
My poor mom did the same thing a few days ago. I've never seen her face turn from so calm to utter disgust in such a short period of time 
This didn't happen to me directly but to a guy I worked with in high school on our network team. One of the Christian Franciscan Brothers at the school (private all boys catholic high school) who was a really amazing guy but older and not very tech savy called us for help. In his words what had happened was he put a floppy disk into the drive and now couldn't get it out. My co-worker went to see what happened. Apparently this particular Brother had just gotten a brand new Dell from us. This was probably 2001, maybe 2000. Anyway the Dell had a new cd drive that didn't have a tray, just a slot with an automatic arm for inserting the disk. Well this brother had never seen one of those before and assumed it to be the floppy drive so he jammed a floppy disk in there pretty good. It destroyed the drive and we had to order a new one. He was absolutely amazed that "Dell would be so stupid" to make a slot that looks like a floppy drive for CDs. It was pretty funny.  
Older people? Technology?  My parents.. they shouldn't be anywhere near a computer because they'll mess up something that they assume i know how to fix.. 
Whenever I see those Redbox things for renting DVDs I always get confused with Redtube. Redbox sounds like a pornsite name too. Is there another Pornsite called something-box? I just always double-take when I see those Redbox vending machines, like, are people really that open about renting porno DVDs? 
Reminds me of late 90s mom wants to search for something online. Limited search engines back in the day found that hotbot.com worked well for me. Tell her to go on hotbot she types in hotbut and you can guess from here. 
One time when I was in college and working at the local parks and recreation center for the summer, I left my laptop on my desk to go help my boss with something and when I came back one of my coworkers, who was an older 50-something woman who hated me from the moment she saw me, said, "you left your VIDEO GAMES running on your computer!"  She was referring to my screen saver. 
When i got a new t.v. for my mom, she is still finding the button to change the aspect ratio of the t.v. and calls me to push the button to fix it. 
I just realized... I might actually indicate to that poor woman that I know what Redtube is in that scenario!  I'd want to crawl in a hole if I said *anything* other than "Red-what? You mean YouTube Red?" But I know my reaction would be a very telling laugh.     
I would really like YouTube red, but the fee for it is pretty ridiculous last time I checked. $10/month for YouTube? And it won't even play minimized on my phone like firefox will. I don't see anything there worth the price, even if the ads are annoying. 
Not the same but similar, we were at the checkout line at the grocery and my wife (looking over at the Redbox) says loudly, "oh we should do a Redtube tonight!". I just stared at her blankly waiting for her to realize what she said while the cashier started blushing a bit. Of course she was totally oblivious. 
On those nights where I stay late and miss the last opportunity to get home via public transportation, one of older coworkers always asks me if I plan on taking a "yuber" to get home. Another one calls it "hoover."  Baby boomers are adawwwwrable.  
Okay let me walk you through the process of my grandfather forwarding emails.  Let's say his sister sends him a funny text. Grandpa thinks "Hey, I bet my children would like it!" he then proceeds to send this email to us.  Later he calls and asks wether we recieved his email. I ask "What did you send me Grandpa?" to which he replies that he sent me a funny poem. Okay, let's see. I open gmail but the only thing he sent me was an image. I am not suprised anymore. Why is that?  Well here's the deal.  When grandpa wants to "forward" an email he:  * Copies the text of the email  * pastes the text into notepad  * prints out the .txt  * scans the printed page  * sends the scanned image.  Well, it works but.. 
Instead of looking at it like *Reddit* is imploding, realize that most of the defaults are modded by the same group of people.  *That* group is protesting and it should be interesting to see the response. 
I've been here for almost 10 years. (New account obviously) And...it has gone through ebbs and flows the whole time. Initially at the begining when it was open source, then the whole Saydah thing, the banning of image hosting sites and creation of imgur by a fellow redditor, then Digg emptying into reddit....I'm sure there are more but I'm old and forget.   They will find someone to do the same job as her and all will be fine.    Here is my issue....you create a subreddit. It explodes and becomes super popular. You want it to go another way, but NOW reddit can keep it and get rid of you as an a mod of that subreddit. It didn't used to be that way. Before, they would tell us to make a competing subreddit.   But....it will get back to normal. Though, i'm hoping a great deal of people leave ONLY because I liked the old reddit. But i'm old and don't like change. *get off my lawn...*    
I just noticed /r/gaming has gone private too, which is weird. Probably in solidarity? 
As much as we would love going dark(not making a stance, just for the sheer irony of it) /r/Casualconversation will not be going dark.  
Maybe the government is finally doing something about the economy. I mean if there was no Reddit, then thousands of people might become so bored they actually decide to get jobs.  
Small note, /r/circlejerk was private for about a week before this. I'm not 100% on why though, something about summer vacation I think? Or maybe updating the subreddit? Either way, it's not as a result of Victoria being fired. 
Alongside that you have the deletion of several contreversial subs, which seemed to rock the boat. Someone created a new reddit substitute which promptly had the ISP shut things down due to hate speech.   All of a sudden redditors seemed to get a little *angrier*.  I dunno, I remember when I started redditing people were complaining about how post-digg reddit sucked, but **man** this I feel like the content has just gotten a lot more agressive and angsty.  There's also the whole astro-turfing debacle that happened a while back. It's like the nature of the site's been changed. 
Woah I didn't even realise! Get out your popcorn, shit's about to go down. 
This has all happened before and it will happen again. There is constant subreddit drama but you just normally don't see it until it is a popular sub. The storm will calm and everything will be business as usual.  
Shit I didn't even notice that. I wonder why Victoria got fired? As far as I could tell she always did a good job. 
I propose to follow in the way of our friends of 4chan, who when moot sold out, made a great exodus, across the internet to the place known as 8chan, the land of the Based Lord Hotwheels, where they reside to this day. I now say to you, casual conversers, that we make an exodus of our own! To 8ch.net/kind/! 
Wow...it feels like reddit is larger than I ever expected it to be....this strike is something I never expected to see on internet.  Meanwhile, today I got banned from offmychest for being subscribed to another subreddit. WTF?! 
can someone explain to me what the effects are of a subreddit going private? 
I think reddit needs a new CEO, and ultimately a new set of admins. They need to all be on the same page, and more importantly they need to agree upon the future of reddit.  
I'M FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW!!!! WHAT WILL WE DO WITHOUT OUR GLORIOUS SUBREDDITS?!?! /r/CasualConversation mods, NEVER BETRAY US LIKE THEY DID!!!! 
As a user, all I'm inclined to do is not visit Reddit anymore :/ I get this is "solidarity" or whatever but this move is going to inevitably drive users away  
If being a mod is that miserable, just quit. This just seems like a power trip from the mods to me. 
Does anyone else not really care about the Victoria situation? She had an important job and seemed to be good at what she did but I'm sure she didn't get fired for no reason.  
Internal drama on a large social media website.  I've never seen that happen before. 
/r/law /r/art /r/CrappyDesign and /r/Spain are also Private and submissions to /r/listentothis are restricted. 
That's so cool to do! One of the best ways to respect loved ones after they pass is to do something at their service related to what they were passionate about. My grandma passed away in November. She always had a huge celebration for July 4th so we decided to shoot fireworks at the end. It was even more special to me because I was never old enough to fire any of them (we stopped when I was still relatively young due to her showing signs of Alzheimer's) and I was the one to light them. It was the first time I had ever lit fireworks with my grandma.  
I worked for a food bank for a few years. Peanut butter is the gold standard in donations. Good protein that goes a long way. Your dad's legacy helped a lot of people. PSA: When your mail carrier does the food drive, don't go to the cabinet and find the canned crap you haven't eaten in four years. Go grab some peanut butter if you want to help. Sorry for your loss, OP. Great job of finding a positive in a negative. 
It's been on Reddit for 6 hours. OP hasn't listed an address for donations.  OK, OP....now, time to add an address for the "Reddit Power"...it's possible this webgroup will send more jars than Corporate Peter Pan.  
I'm so sorry for your loss. He sounds like a beautiful person, and I'm sure he'd be very proud of you for doing this. Maybe it can become an ongoing thing, as a way of honouring his memory? Best wishes.  
My grandpa passes away 5 years ago and he loved Peter Pan peanut butter too! He was buried with a container of it. I'm going to pass along this information, I'm sure a lot of my family would be interested in donating to the cause! 
I have to suck up my pride and go to a food bank tomorrow.  It's been more than a week since I've had a meal.  Hopefully I get something as good as Peter Pan peanut butter.   
Firstly, my condolences to you and your family. That's really awesome :')   I LOVE peter pan peanut butter 
That is really weird. Maybe your parents don't have much experience with those kinds of relationships? 
I once had a girlfriend who broke up with me because of Tarot cards. She told me that I was soon going to be a father and that we weren't supposed to be together. I ran into her five months later. She apparently got drunk, went home with some dude in a bar and got knocked up. I laughed and told her "Guess the Tarot cards got that baby thing backward then, huh?"  
I've dealt with some odd family members before, but I think this takes the cake.  
When I was 21, I broke up with my boyfriend of 3 months who came from a reasonably well off family.  I still remember my Mom's reaction, "What were you thinking?  You're not getting any younger."  When I was 28 and my husband asked for a divorce my Mom's reaction, "What did you do wrong?"  Now remarried to a man who has a good job.  "I'm so proud of you.  He's the best thing that's ever happened to you."  Seriously?  I would think putting myself through college in my 30s might have rated somewhere.  But, sigh.  Some parents are old fashioned and think that as a woman your only goal in life is to land a husband and make babies. 
It's great that *you*, who boviously is much more down to earth than your parents, gave her some advice; she probably really appreciates it during this time.  ...but, a *tarot card reader...?* That's just *off*. 
And I thought my family was crazy. I stand corrected. 
What. The actual. Fuck. They tryin to give her a complex? Cuz that's how you give someone a complex.  
is your family super religious or something? Is there anything wrong with your sister as in your parents might feel like she will have trouble meeting someone?  On the surface being 22 and single is great and would recommend not getting married until her 30's 
WTF? Does your mom think that she has to necessarily find a perfect match on the first try. I mean, a month isn't much time at all. How does she think your sister is going to find someone she is compatible with if she can't date people? It's just part of dating that if you don't find the right one, you have to break up.  
I feel like we have very similar parents.   My mother likes to make deals with "god" about certain things. For example: She is getting weight loss surgery. No day has been booked yet. She has told me that she told God to delay her surgery by a month if it means I will graduate university this year. She said if I fail, any delays are all my fault.  Reading your story I could totally picture her doing both of those things. She heavily believes in Tarot cards and psychics (One of which said I had autism...I absolutely do not. Like wtf?) and definitely used to cry when any of my past relationships ended, saying how she didn't make enough deals with god to make them work.  Weeeird shit. Hope our camaraderie in this will make you feel a bit better :P 
Ouch, that's very sad to hear. She's just gotta hang in there for now. 23 myself, and never been in a relationship of any type really - better for any of us at this age to just determine what we want to do as far as a career and finish college before really looking for a serious, long-term type of relationship.  I've had so many people tell me stories about all sorts of weird things occurring that effectively ended relationships in all sorts of painful ways that the stress just isn't worth it at this exact point in life. Sounds like she's lucky to have you looking out for her, I'd be downright embarrassed if I had a sibling and this happened to them. 
Jesus. What a screwed up way to deal with a situation like this and, well,any situation, really. How could you tell your own daughter that she needs to change herself in order to please men? And don't get me started on tarot cards...   I hope your sister is doing okay and that she hasn't let your parents' reaction get to her. Breakups fucking suck and to have your own parents try to pin some sort of blame on you can't be easy. 
I see a lot of posts with this construct and this certainly isn't targeted specifically at the OP, but it's driving me nuts.  It was a *month*. That's not a boyfriend. It's a free trial to Netflix. 
Ever feel like you're wiser than your parents?  I feel that way sometimes. 
My ex girlfriend told me she went to a tarot card reader and she described a guy she was getting into, she got with him, she said they'd marry and stuff. Few months later she found 3 of his mobile phones he uses to speak to different girls, one of which he was taking away on holiday. 
Do you live in a small town?   I moved to a small town from a larger city and it's amazing how important marriage seems to be. If you're not married by the time you're 22, you're like an old maid. It's strange.  
If your sister is as loony as your parents, that's probably what men don't like about her. 
Best thing I've read all day!  But really, I'm sorry for her. It's a good thing she has you to balance out the weirdness. 
Your parents are very clearly mentally fucked up.  Tarot card readings? Opinions like that? She's 22. How do people like that have children.  You're lucky you're sane.  Too easy to end up like them.   
It's nice that you've got your feet on the ground and don't take all that crap. I really don't know how you could deal with your parent's, being they so superstitious, but what's important is that you make your sister know that it's not her fault (I mean, his boyfriend might have left her because of something he did not like about her, that completely possible,but whatever the case was, **fault** is almost never the right word to use) and that you're by her side. The best of luck for you. 
Why the hell did your father take her to a TAROT card reader? 
Was this your sister's very first boyfriend, or something? And have they reacted as equally crazy at your relationships? 
I am a Tarot reader and I know many others. Never in my life have I met a Tarot reader who detects "spells." That's..... That's not how the cards work. Sorry your sister had to hear that nonsense.  
Struck me as a desperate need for grandchildren scenario. Is it possible that everyone got convinced that this guy was the guy who'd fill the gaping hole in their life? 
What the actual fuck.... I feel like your dad cant be serious and is just playing into her craziness  
This whole situation seems strange. It reminds me of one story I read on the internet the other day that turned out to be completely made up. 
Wow. Drama much? How did your sister take your human advice? 
So, from reading the rest of the comments, you're apparently the older sibling. Did they ever go fucking bananas over you, too, and give you terrible advice, or is this a new development in a long series of getting weirder? 
How does she feel about all this? A little bummed out? Or is she totally heartbroken? Because a month isn't very long at all...  Your parents are nucking futs though... 
Serious issues aside, your family sounds legitimately fun. Are you living in a sitcom? Dear God, hahaha. 
I thought tarot card readers usually gave more general advice or fortunes did not know they were in the business of diagnosing spells. 
wow that's pretty intense for just that. Maybe it was the first one and they're afraid because they don't think she's attractive enough? 
That makes me think of when my did found i was making a 70 in my high school spanish class. I had been making As and Bs in all other classes but he flips out saying im an idiot and that im going to spend the rest of my life digging ditches.  Now that I'm making high grades in my high school physics and algebra 2 and was allowed to take advanced pre-cal next year, I feel like I should be laughing in his face right now 
Wait, you thought for the _longest time_ you wouldn't be able to move on, and now it's been 3 weeks?  I'd say you're moving on at a record pace.  
First of all, great attitude, keep it up.  Second of all-- it was not random that this girl did not accept. Even if she was interested in you, she can't or shouldn't. She knows your ex, dude. Which means she knows you dated this girl for 6 years. 6 years is a pretty long time compared to 3 weeks. Therefore, this girl you asked out sees you as being on the rebound, which is correct.  You've only been single like 20 days in the last 6 years, take some time to do you and don't ask anyone out for a while. Certainly not someone who knows your ex. 
I'm in such a similar position to you.  I recently was dumped from a 6 year relationship and about 3 weeks after I went on an OkCupid date.    It honestly feels weird and I'm acting like I've moved on more than I actually have. 
Props on to you man, you had the courage to ask a girl out and weren't even slowed down by it. I admire your optimism!   As for me, I'll be taking my driving license soon and I'm nervous as hell since this is my first time. Just don't want to screw up is all, y'know?   
What's the aftermath looking like? I always get worried about asking people out because I fear that it will just ruin my friendship with that person if they say no. 
Hey dude, don't feel rushed to get into a new relationship just because your ex has. My ex and I broke up a while back and she started seeing someone new in about a month. At first I thought I should get back into dating since she moved on,  but realized that I needed to learn how to make myself happy before finding someone else to do it for me. You may not feel the same way, but there's definitely no rush to get into anything new. Take your time if you need to 
Maybe try to process the feelings and get to know yourself a bit. You've changed a lot in six years! Perhaps taking time for you would be best. 
You did wonderful! A lot of women prefer guys who have the courage to ask someone out in person. If a guy did that I'd give him a chance just based on that. I am tired of tinder. Keep at it! 
I don't know why it ended it or who ended it, but if she moved on so fast, maybe it's because she already had feelings for this other dude so she was able to just wrap herself in this after. Its called a "backup." It doesn't mean she necessarily wanted to leave you for him, but she strung him along just in case. A lot of people seem to do this.  It was about half a year for me to "move on" from a two year relationship (closer to 2.5/3 years because we didnt make it official right away). It took a little longer than that to actually feel okay with it and like I didnt really want to get back together.  As for him, it's been almost a decade. I know if I left my SO and I went to him, he would pick me up in a heartbeat. But I wouldn't go to him even if I were single.  Tl;dr some people have backup people so that's why they move on so quickly. Also people move on at different rates. 
Good on you OP, I was with my girlfriend for 3 years and she turned around one day and said she didn't love me anymore. You gotta admit to yourself that it's gonna suck but it's for the better. Seems sleezy but the day after I messaged and old friend and we caught up. You gotta do what you gotta do, can't let it beat you. Good on you aswell keep going man you'll get there ! 
WOW that's amazing!!! I love Dada Life, and you must be pretty badass if you are opening for them!!! 
That's awesome pal! I'm genuinely happy for you. Out of curiosity, what was your house like growing up? Were you allowed to pursue music or did you have to kind of become a rebel in order to do what you loved? 
My advice for you:  1. Don't play any Dada Life tracks  2. Don't play any peak time bangers  3. Keep the BPM/ tempo under what you expect them to play  4. Do play your favorite more obscure tracks (ie. nothing from the Beatport top 100)  5. Have fun! 
Yeah suck it, grandma!  But really, congrats! Sounds like a great opportunity for you. :D 
I went through a stage when I became really into music, and began learning terms, styles, and all the basic stuff I would need to DJ. I even went as far as planning out the gear I would need to buy, and how it would help me further that dream.  Unfortunately that idea never panned out, but it did leave me with a bunch of knowledge, a new appreciation for music and high quality audio, and a killer set of cans. Props to you for sticking with it man, have fun!  
Congrats man. I recently discovered Dada Life because they did some work for League Of Legends recently. They aren't bad! 
Congrats man! I know exactly how you feel. My grandpa once called me "the worst actor he had ever seen in his life", then I was cast in a commercial in my first audition after I moved to New York city.  
Wow thats so awesome!!! Grats! I had a small passion for DJing for a good 5 years or so but I kinda just gave up on it and found other thing. Its hella expensive but awesome if you can do it right. And clearly youre doing something correct because of opening for Dada Life. Again grats and all the luck with your prospects in the future. 
I've never tried DJ but I can imagine how difficult it would be to capture the mood. I get kinda pissy when people think that all DJ do is press play and sit easy for 3 hours.  But more importantly, would you rather chainsaws for arms or springs for legs? 
Dude. Cherish that moment. Not because your grandma laughed at you face but because your doing something that (i guess) not a lot people thought you could do. But most importantly, you're living your childhood dream. I wish you the best of luck. I don't know if it's because I'm drunk or whatever but I'm incredibly jealous of you for being able to live your dreams and not dream your life.  
So you were 12 three years ago? Didn't know it was so easy to break into the DJ industry at a young age 
That laugh is why you became a DJ. Many moments of mockery resulted in greatness.  
I'm very fucking proud of you dude, preforming my music is my dream. We get to see Dada Life with their compound tour in a few weeks here in Salt Lake. I love Dada Life.  Will you do me a favor? Will you tell me what exactly they are brining to the Dada Land Compound? I can't contain my excitement. 
This is great!!  Do you have any advice for new DJs? ^^How ^^do ^^I ^^get ^^gigs ^^;_; 
I thought this was an AMA for a minute.  Awesome good for you to prove  them all wrong.  
Well, I've never heard of Dada Life, but I've heard of you, just now. So that's a win, right?      Basically, it should be:   *"When I was 12, I wanted to be a policeman, like every other kid, but tomorrow night, we're playing after the DeanTheDJ! Woohoo!"* - Dada Life 
I still would laugh im your face if you tell me that that is something meaningful  
hahah congratz, man that's awesome!! Play French Jeans as a throwback  
Kudos to you for not accepting another's belief about the possibility for yourself. It can be difficult when it is someone you respect.  
My parents and brother wouldn't agree (mainly because I'm a guy) and didn't think I would succeed at being at makeup artist, but I did 2 photoshoots in the last 7 days and I feel great getting into it. I have also gotten their support. :) Many of my makeup artist friends say im very talented and that I don't even have to finish a makeup artist school. (I'm 18 atm if that matters.) 
Im really happy for you and all, but do you have a Soundcloud so we can hear some of your work? :) 
hahahaha I followed your soundcloud and apparently one of your three comments is on my teaser. Small world!    Good luck! 
That's super exciting! Put in effort to build a relationship with these promotors so you can get booked again and keep it going :D 
Congratulations on the gig! I have always wanted to get into EDM creation, and have just had no idea where to begin. Do you have any recommendations for any software that you may use? Thanks. 
How did you get started as a DJ? I have turnables but I suck on them, so any advice would help :( 
kick ass and take names dude, hope it all goes well, this might be the one thing your DJ'ing career needs to take off (: 
I think it's really amazing and exciting that you pursued that dream from your childhood. Hope you're loving every minute. Happy for you.   
Congratulations. If you can't tell from my username, I too once dreamed of becoming a DJ. I now dream of becoming a writer.  BTW, what equipment are you using? I may have set DJing to the side, but I'm always interested in tech! 
Wow, congrats dude! That is so, so cool! I'm really inspired actually. I am used to the whole "getting laughed at" thing, but I'll try not to let it get me down so much. Thanks a lot.  -Squirbos 
Dude, fuck yeah! You're living your dream and that is awesome. Good luck tomorrow night, bud.  
For some reason, someone is mass-downvoting everyone in the thread.  Compensating now. 
CONGRATS!!! Dada Life is one of my absolute favorites for years. That should be a blast!!! 
Damn, I just got done with a song by them. Congrats! 
Right on man... I miss my DJing days...of course I never played a stage that big. 
I'd love to learn to DJ some day, especially with vinyl, but I'm too scared to talk to my parents about it... especially seeing as half decent turntables cost so much and I doubt it'd ever take me anywhere. Congrats :) 
You wanted to stand behind a table and fist bump with one hand over your ear?  I could see why they laughed at you.  
lol you should get actual friends to celebrate with you instead of bragging to the internet 
I'm friends with a guy named Raj on FaceBook. He lives on the other side of the country.  We send each other pictures of our lunches, and that is literally it. Of course we comment on them, but we've never had a discussion that wasn't about food.   This has been going on for a year now. 
I've been playing online yahtzee with an older lady every day for 3 years now. We've never talked despite there being a chat function, and neither one of us will quit playing. I feel invested now, and I worry one day she'll stop playing, and I won't know if she has died or fallen ill. Yahtzee grandma and I have an unspoken bond.  
A guy once paid me to convince him not to get circumcised. I thought it was just a hoax until I got $350 in my Venmo account. 
I have a slightly one sided relationship with a family that isn't mine. Basically there's someone else out there with my exact same name and her family keeps emailing with family photos and stuff like that. I've told them a couple times they have the wrong email but the older ones in the family can't quite figure out how to remove my address from their family email lists. They're so sweet, I feel like I know them all pretty well and it makes happy to hear about the youngest granddaughter's progress in junior school and stuff like that. I almost want to trade my real family for this family haha.  
I met a guy on a chat and we've been texting on and off for 10 years now. We've never heard each other's voice.  
I guess it's not as weird as your story. But a few years ago while I was driving to the store early in the morning one day in winter I saw a young kid (11-13) freezing walking to school. I pulled over and asked if he was heading to the school not to far away and he hopped in. We chatted about school and how he wants to be a professional soccer player. That winter was terrible so I ended up giving him rides many times that year. I was 22 at the time and didn't think much of it until this moment. I never told anyone because it simply would never come up. Either way I hope that kid is doing great.   
I played an online game for a long time (5-6 years) and through most of it with some of the same people. One such person was a guy who is about my father's age (maybe a little younger). In-game we stuck to being 'in character' but eventually shared email addresses.   After I stopped playing the game (real life + bullshit game "friends" drama) I reached out to him with my phone number. It's been a couple of years since and I talk to him every couple of months. 
At 14 or so, I became friends with some dude who ran one of those popular meme pages on facebook. He and I talked a lot, became "meme buds". Turns out he lives in australia (i'm from california).  Two years later, when we were both 16, he came out to california (with his family) to visit me.  Nope, not a love story folks. Just two buds finally meeting irl. He is super cute though.   And now, four years later, all he does is send me dick pics on snapchat.  
Some girl I knew on Facebook messaged me one day after she saw a (admittedly in poor taste) joke I had made on someone's post. I had literally only met this girl in person once, but now we talk everyday, and have become really good friends. She gave me advice about getting back with my ex, and I bust her balls about the dumb guys she's dated. We're both mixed race, and it's nice to have someone to talk to about that who can relate. It's been really nice having her to talk to, but the dynamic is so weird I haven't told anyone because I don't see how anyone could see it and not think we're trying to get together.   It's just really nice to have a platonic relationship with someone from the opposite gender.  
I have a pretty distinct last name and about 5 other people (who I'm not related to) do too. One of them added all of us on Facebook and we all are in a group message together and periodically update each other on our lives. We have everybody from a divorced mother of 3 in California, a wonderful hockey dad from Canada, a US Marine and a slutty 16 year old. It's fucking great. 
I have a very close friend across the country that I met on a 4chan thread where you were supposed to add someone on Steam if they had your same birthday.  I also have friends that only know me for a text-based Harry Potter role playing site.  That one doesn't get mentioned often because I rarely share the fact that I used to basically write multiplayer Harry Potter fan fiction. 
Throwaway, in a D/s relationship with someone who lives on the other side of the country. Never met Her, never even heard Her voice. But being my Domme she has authority over pretty much everything I do in the day, what I eat, what I wear, when I go to bed, etc. I haven't told any of my friends about it because I think it's kinda weird, but one know the basics because I took my shirt off  and forgot I still had her name written in sharpie on my back lol. 
I hope this counts.  I was an avid snail mail pen-paller between the ages of 10 and 23, mostly before the internet was around.  I had hundreds of pen-pals, probably 50 at a time.    I wrote to my first pen pal from age 10 to 20, and I still check up on her on Facebook occasionally (I'm 38).    I never met any of them, but I felt close to some of them.  There was one guy from Greece I wrote to forever.  There was never any flirting, just a friendly connection.  We emailed each other every day in college, and we still keep up occasionally online.    I exchanged all sorts of gifts with people around the world this way, and I still have a lot of interesting stuff from them.  I wrote to people from almost every country in the world.  I won my school's geography bee, and I know writing to pen pals helped me learn a huge amount. 
It's not as cool as some of you other people's posts and it might not be what you are looking for. But I dated this guy for three years. We broke up. It needed to happen. About two years later, after next to no talking he messaged me out of the blue and told me there was an opening at his company and that he things I would be a great fit. I nailed the interview despite being very very under qualified. Got the job. Nobody knows that we were anything more than friends. Our desks are close to each other. We have ended up as good friends.  
I have a whole group of male friends in rural India that I am friends with, I'm from California and have never been to India, but my name is the same as one of their friends, apparently I have a pretty common Indian last name, even though I'm as white as the driven snow, one of them sent me a friend request, I told them I wasn't that John and we had a good laugh.    As time passed I kept getting friend requests I started accepting them, now we all talk a lot.  We update each other on our lives, chat, comment etc.  Everything I do with real friends on Facebook. 
One of my friends got out of an abusive relationship and is going to therapy. She's also a professional chef. She makes me dinner a couple times a week and in return I listen to her problems. She's got a lot of them. But I'm not complaining because hey, free food.  
That is the most awesome thing ever.  I always just ignore calls or voicemails from numbers i don't know, but you've made me rethink this now. 
After college, I was depressed, alcoholic, semi-nocturnal, couldn't find a job, etc.  I had moved back to my hometown, but all of my friends had moved away.  I never left the house as I needed to conserve my funds.  I got on OKCupid to find friends/companionship.  I wasn't really interested in a hookup or anything, I just wanted to talk to people and connect to SOMEONE, as late at night I got pretty lonely.  I ended up meeting someone that lived eleven time-zones away.  She was similarly lonely, but on a day schedule, so we were able to talk/message pretty much every day.  We opened up to each other and aired our grievances with the world.    That was about... nine years ago now.  We've each gone through some rough patches and still send each other little updates every now and again. :) 
This has got to be one of the most interesting/funny stories I've heard on this sub.  Especially given your age when it happened.  Props to you for giving this guy some good life advice instead of reporting him.  You probably single handedly changed his life for the better. 
When I was a teenager, I played a lot this online game called City of Heroes. There wasn't much of a French community there, so I mostly played alone. Until I met this guy, remarkably nice who helped me a lot to level up and understand the game mechanics. He was from the West coast of Canada and we had a huge time zone difference, but he played with me almost every day early in the morning and I played late a night after school. It lasted for a while, a couple of years maybe?  I had a lot of fond memories of playing with this guy, so now when I'm playing MMOs I use his nickname in the hopes the server returns "username already taken", but it never is.   Funny story, one of my friends asked me recently how I learned English... And I realised, this guy didn't speak French at all. He taught me English without me realising it. 
Two friends I met online a year ago through CSGO. I probably have 400h playing with these guys.  
Most people don't know how close one of my closest friends and I are. I'm a guy and she's a woman, we're both straight, but we talk about things some people in relationships don't even talk about yet have clear boundaries on being platonic.  
I added a guy on Facebook about 5 years ago because we have the same first and last name. He's a battle rapper from New York (I live on the west coast) and its interesting to watch him progress. We like each others statues and wish each other happy birthday but that's about it.  
I've been friends with someone for 17 years. I've only met her once.  
In high school I would pass by this random dude everyday in the halls. We eventually started greeting each other with a different fake name every time we saw each other. It was hilarious. The weirder the name, the funnier it was.  We never talked or became friends in a traditional sense, just two strangers calling each other funny names everyday. 
I play board games at the library once a week.  The only other die-hard regular is a 70+ former IBM engineer, so we bitch about tech together as we play. 
Two weeks ago, I met up with my D&D group's dm for a night of movies and maybe casual sex. I wound up staying at his place until yesterday. I had only met him in person twice beforehand, and we didn't really start talking a whole lot until the day before I came over.  I may have also willingly gone into it with no contraception, so I might now be carrying his child. He knows it, too. Woohoo. 
Back when I was a kid and Pokemon first came out, I joined a pokemon chat room. It started as a Pokemon role play chat (people would pretend they were gym leaders or pokemon), but eventually just evolved into a group of internet friends who just liked talking about life. I was in that chat for several years and made quite a few friends. I still talk to two of them, one who refers to me as her little brother, and another who I've simply been good friends with for years. Whenever somebody tells me you can't have "real" friends online, I think about my dear old friends, smile, and realize they're not quite right about that statement.  
Yo man that was deep, there's only two things I ever cry about anime and this shit.  
Man, moms get all the credit but dads are lowkey the real heroes. My dad has done so much for me, he's given me such an amazing life, there's literally no way to repay him other than to live up to his expectations, and to do anything I can for him. Today I saw noticeable a noticeable wrinkle under his eyes (idk if it was a wrinkle or what, but it was a deep line a little below his eye, I thought maybe it's from glasses) and I was like what's that, and he said "I'm getting old." He's only 48, not old in my opinion, but it was so weird to realize my dad can get old.  
Lost my father from cancer last few months. If only I got more time with him to buy him something he loves.   Cherish him OP. Some people had time robbed off them. Too soon.   :'( 
Holy shit you are the best child ever, I hope a reincarnation of you appears in my testicles and finds my future spouse's egg. That was kinda fucking creepy but you get the idea! YOU'RE NICE! 
this made me more emotional than I want to be fuck man 
Anddd I cried. Last week would have been my dad's birthday, but was also when he died. He wasn't a great person, but he was still my dad when he was sober enough to be.     You hug your dad for me, damnit. 
God dammit this is awesome. I wasn't a very good son to my dad after their divorce, and now that he is gone I really, really regret it. He was such a good dad to me. 
My parents went through the same thing. Do me a favor, spend a lot of time with your dad. Just a surprise visit to sit and watch tv makes all the difference. 
Sorry to be nit picking but are you saying that you are siding with your dad against your mom or you are neutral ? 
I get more of these than romantic crushes, honestly.  Some people just seem so fucking cool that I just want us to be bros. I have these elaborate fantasies in my head of how we'd meet under weird circumstances and both just stand out to each other. Or if we've already met, how we'd find something in common that would make us friends. 
Oh I call those a "squish" as opposed to a crush. And I get them all the time, even with people that are already my friend :^) 
I think that's happened to me a few times. But half the time I don't know if it's a crush, or if I actually wanna be friends with them.   Besides, I'm a really quiet person so going up to them is like furst trying to cross the Grand Canyon on a wire. 
this thread is pretty wholesome, i want to be your friend! 
Somewhat related: I'm amazed at how many people simply deny themselves and suppress the experience of platonic love. As a straight cis man specifically, I was always sort of conditioned to think that, whenever I liked a woman, I was also supposed to want to get in her pants; whenever I liked a man, I was supposed to just maintain respect and not show any affection. This is not how humans work at all. Platonic love and romantic love both exist and are different things, and physical attraction is something else altogether. Something similar goes for aesthetics: you can find someone beautiful without wanting anything sexual whatsoever. I feel a lot freer since figuring this out. 
There's a girl who works at the bakery counter at the supermarket who I would *totally* bro out with.  Like all I can think of any time we talk is how she would be the most fun person to like, have some drinks and shoot the shit with.  Unfortunately, I can't think of a good way to present this situation without any risk of her (and/or her boyfriend) thinking that I'm trying some funny business.  
Teach me your ways please. I have a crush on someone but I know we would never be able to be together so I really want to befriend her. :( I'm just too scared to talk to her... 
All the time. They're almost worse than romantic crushes, because I feel like it's much more socially acceptable to say "Hey, I think you're a cool person, want to go on a date?" than it is to say "Hey, I think you're a cool person, want to be my friend?". Getting even more platonic I get crushes on people where I just want to work with them on something. Obviously that would entail being friendly with them, but there are people whose work I've seen and I think to myself "I need to make something with this person" without knowing anything about them personally. I also have a habit of turning my friendships into project partnerships - why hang out with someone casually when you can give all your meetings a specific purpose?  
Never actually, I didn't know it was a thing. It must be great to have it though, because you can actively go out there and make a friend.  
Constantly! it's actually my weakness, always wanting to have a friendship if a person is nice. 
I get these kind of crushes on friend groups. Like when you see a group of people talking and joking and having fun and all, and you want to be part of that as well.  I recently started becoming more involved with this one group at my uni, but when I'm sitting with them I know I'm not really part of it :/. It sucks, but maybe it'll get better, idk. 
A couple weeks ago -I was at the theatre and there was a woman around my age and her mom- they had this long conversation at intermission that related to all these interests that I have too - even reading books by the same author. It was interesting.   Is there a way to "ask someone out" to be your friend? I was too chicken to say anything :-( 
Yeah, but for people out-of-reach.   I reckon Prince Harry would be a laugh to hang out with. Also Jonah Hill 
I was a victim of this.  There was a guy that was invited to the group parties who I eventually ended up hanging out with. I was so excited. The stories he told and the way he told them made him look like the most fun person to be around.  We ended up meeting at a bar and he was a completely different person. All of his stories were told in a monotone voice and they were all sad. People have hard times so I didn't hold it against him.  This happened a few times. At the group events he was the hit of the party. Hanging out alone, he was sad.   Long story short, he'll talk about his problems but he won't do the things to correct them. 
Yes. And she said she would be in my area for several months with nothing to do. I commented on that post and said "hey if you're ever in town let's hang out!"   No. Response.   Which is super embarrassing to be because I feel like I put myself out there and got rejected pretty hard. By another girl. That I wanted to be my friend. So now I hid her from my time line so I don't cringe at myself everytime I see her name. 
Pretty often. I have a bit of an anxiety problem that sometimes makes it hard for me to reach out to even people I know moderately well and try to strengthen/keep up a friendship. It's probably daily that I'll see someone I friendlike or have even hung out with a couple times and wish I could figure out a way to keep in touch more. 
It used to happen frequently in my teens, but as I came into my twenties it's really leveled off and quit being such a distraction. I realize this will sound like a bummer but I've had so many disappointing friendships that ended really unfortunately that I'm pretty reserved these days. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy talking to people and like spending time with friends, but these days I keep my expectations low and take things as they come.  
Also I love the little quotes that appear when you upvote!  It makes me want to do it way more :-)  For your post it said "Quest complete".  Woot! 
Upvoted for your upvote of a commenter's upvote that upvoted your post because you upvoted a commenter's upvote that upvoted your post 
Hi everyone. I heard they were giving away upvotes in here? 
I gave people up votes jus to see those quotes. I'm seeing nothing maybe because I'm on the phone...    Meh, have some upvotes guys!  
So this is what this sub is about?  Seems nice.  I actually might come visit from time to time then.  
I used to never upvote...then I remembered it doesn't cost me anything and if it makes other people feel like it makes me feel, then upvotes for everyone!!!! 
The first rule of being a good OP: Appreciate your commenters, and upvote them liberally (assuming they aren't being jerks). 
I always upvote replies to me/my comments and posts unless they're mean or insulting... Or plain wrong. That doesn't happen too often though. I dunno, I kinda trained myself thinking it was standard reddiquette. 
*I always try to upvote the thread I'm commenting on...*  
I don't get the point of up voting. I do up vote posts I like, but I really don't see any point in it. If Reddit was like YouTube where people got paid for up votes and lived on up votes then it would be different.     
Scrolling through the comments it makes me happy to see how a little up arrow makes people's days ^_^ 
I thought this was u/GallowBoob Seriously this is some next level karma farming 
This reminds me of a time I found a wallet with $5,000 mexican pesos (roughly 400 USD at the time) at the parking lot of the building I worked at. After mumbling through it I found out that the owner worked at some company in the same building (it was a big building in Mexico City).  Anyway, that day was too late and there was no one around so the next day I went to where he worked looking for the guy, I didn't want to give it to somebody else afraid that they might take the money, luckily I found the guy and gave him his wallet back with everything in it. The look on his face was priceless, he even hugged me. It felt so great doing that.  Eventually he sent a bottle of whiskey to where I worked and told the people from HR of my doing, ended up making an appearance on the magazine of my work place which was a little embarrassing. 
Excellent outcome, good folks are around. I came out in the parking lot a few months ago to find my VW Golf had been hit a good one, wrecked a tire, wheel and about 3 thousand in body damage. Also was a note and phone number on the windshield. Guy told me he was really sorry and would pay for it. A good twist is that my car is on the recall and VW is buying it back, no penalty for body damage. So the kid picked the right car to hit. 
A few pro tips from someone who was a collector in college for a credit union.   1. Credit union literally had no choice. Credit unions are very forgiving but when it comes to the government, they have no choice.   2. You can still use your bank, just fucking call your debtor! Most if not all banks, governments, mortgage companies will work out a payment plan if you tell them your situation. Even if it's interest only payments. As long as they know you are willing to pay they won't seize shit.   Stop walking around with money. Tell them what happened and work out some kind of plan. It will suck but what sucks more is walking around with all the money you have. Good luck man.  
I am so glad you got your wallet back. I had lost one on a ferry boat in South Texas. Almost a year later it showed up to my house. I had moved, but the address on the license still had forwarding. There was a note, it said "sorry, I had to take out $12 for shipping". It had close to 300 in it. I mailed back $200 of it.  
Good to hear!  I once dropped my wallet in the Subway parking lot. The individual who found it was kind enough to drop it off in my mailbox (I was unaware) -- all my cards and everything was still in there, except for my $40 cash. I was slightly upset but oh well I was happy I got it back.. 
I lost my wallet yesterday morning. I live in a less than ideal part of Las Vegas so I'm never going to see the wallet again.  I don't care about the $89 I had in it, what bothers me is that now I don't have an ID and can't cash my paycheck.  
The debt is not your fault, the system we have in place is to blame. Educating yourself should not be a sentence to debt slavery. 
Did you find out the name of the people at the register?  You should contact the store manager and tell them the cashiers did a great job! 
I would donate to a gofundme for you if someone else made it.  
This is exactly the scenario I imagine every time I find money.  Someone needs that money.  I have to get it back to them.  
Over the course of a few months, I stayed at this one discount business hotel in Kaohsiung City multiple times. I didn't go back for a few more months. When I arrived, the hotelier behind the counter recognized me and handed me the equivalent of $7 USD. It fell out of my wallet weeks ago and they found it and held onto it in case I came back. Very honest. 
Maybe don't use the word "rapey"...? Like really? You weren't raped. Losing money, having money owed taken from your account is nothing in comparison to rape. I'm so tired of people in this sub using this word lightly.  
Hurray!! I'm glad everything worked out for you! I love hearing stories that remind us that there's still good in the world. :D  Celebrate with ice cream!! 
I suppose it makes sense, but it had never occurred to me that it was possible for them to just reach into your bank account like that. I would have done the exact same thing- cashing your check and keeping it in cash so that it can't be taken. I'm so glad that this situation worked out for the best though. Next time I see someone do something shitty, I'll let this good deed cancel it out. 
Good thing you did there with your client, OP! It's almost a rare thing nowadays to see wallets got returned back without anything stolen from it.  But..what about that honest soul who turned in your wallet?    
I was getting nervous reading that.  I'm very happy everything worked out.  For the future you may want to consider a fire safe for storing large amounts of your money at home... Assuming there isn't concern with someone at your house taking it. 
You need a Swiss bank account or something now. Carrying around your money isn't the safest thing in the world. Is there any appeals process or a payment plan or something you could set up so they won't take your money again? 
I'm not sure how it works in the country that you live in, but in Canada, you can file a consumer proposal with your bank that lines out an alternate repayment plan (most banks are quite lenient with this as most of the time they decline this, people end up in bankruptcy and then the bank doesn't get paid at all). This could buy you some time until you get some things figured out.  
First time I've heard of aldi existing in America too. Are they still a discount supermarket over there? 
I'm so glad there are good people out there.  I'm sorry you are having a rough go of it now.  If you ever need someone to proofread a paper I would be happy to do so.  I got a BA in British and American lit.  I'm rusty but will help if I can. 
Reminds me- I had left a personalized bag of my stuff at an ihop, and when I returned, only my wallet was there. Everything was in it, nothing was touched (I had my credit card on me) but the people behind me had taken my bag. It's weird though. Why take the bag (that had nothing of resale value) and leave the wallet (with the money still intact?) 
Have you looked into income-based repayment? If you have federal loans, you are eligible to pay back as little as $0/month. 
A few weeks ago I was tubing with some work friends. Saw something floating down the river so I grabbed it (there were lots of people tubing so we were trying to grab the empty cans that we found). Well, it turned out to be a wallet in a plastic bag. With $374 in it.    Anyway, there were business cards in it so when we got back to the cars I called the dude and mailed it back to him.  And he said I could keep $100. Win-win I suppose.   
Maybe don't use the word "rapey"...? Like really? You weren't raped. Losing money, having money owed taken from your account is nothing in comparison to rape. I'm so tired of people in this sub using this word lightly.  
As an european: Your poor people get $12 a month for food? Is that your so called welfare state? 
I'm so happy that everything turned out okay. I work in a pub and whenever a wallet is handed in a couple of the regulars ask why I don't take some cash out and pocket it myself.   It's unbelievable, they think that if they found it they'd be entitled to the contents of the wallet! Handing a wallet back to the owner with everything in it untouched is a reward in itself. 
This is part of the idea for /r/bitcoin - decentralized means you're in control. 
My bankruptcy was final on a Friday which was payday.  Both my wife and I had direct deposit.  The court cleared out our checking account.  Cut rate lawyer didn't warn us.  
I used to have to drop off a bank bag at a night deposit box and once, it appeared that the person that used it before me had dropped 2 bags on the ground. They were full of cash.   I took them to the bank the next morning and turned it in. I'm familiar with the bank staff so I trusted they'd get it sorted out properly.  Later that day I get a call saying no one was missing any deposits and the money was mine. Turned out to have been small bills, but I got $1700 out of it. For doing the right thing. Someone must have been a bit shite faced 
This is a very good day for me, a lesbian. RBG IS THE BEST.   
As a straight guy my life and the ENTIRE world is totally ruined by this! How can life possibly continue in a normal way now!? /s  But seriously, **awesome** news!!! :D 
For someone reason I'm just confused about all this. Like there wasn't any public vote or something. I went to bed last night where gay marriage was not legal. I wake up this morning to a text from my friend saying it's now legal. Glad it happened, just confused how it all went down.  Edit. I'm not mad it's legal now. I'm ecstatic. Maybe I came across as against it but I'm not.  
I am in disbelief.  I find myself hesitant to feel _this_ elated.  I have been with my SO for almost 13 years, she is my high school sweetheart.  We have lived together for 7 years, but our state banned same sex marriage, civil unions and common law marriages.   This is a huge milestone.  In my life I have witnessed Don't Ask, Don't Tell, been told it was a phase, a choice, a fad and a sin. I have been assaulted and told it was my fault. I have seen glimmers of hope on the West Coast and Prop8. I have been denied custody of the child who lives in my home and for whom I am a secondary parent.  Today my phone and inbox were flooded with words of praise and congratulations, with tones of vindication, declarations of unconditional love and requests for wedding invitations!  Today is a day of celebration and of relief. 
Cheers! I usually don't post my political opinions on Facebook, as I live on the Bible thumpers section, but today is a different day!   All my homophobic facebook friends/family are gonna be pissed and I might get burned at the stake our something, (It's gonna be fun going to church tomorrow :P.) BUT TODAY WE MADE A LEAP TOWARDS EQUALITY!   Anyway, super happy for everyone! /u/iwinalot7 was definitely on my mind when I saw the news, congrats!  
What's most impressive to me is that *it didn't take a Constitutional Amendment*. But I really hope that amidst all this controversy and celebration, the TPP (or something else) doesn't quietly pass. That being said, I told some friends that I'd set aside my usual cynicism for today, and try to be a little optimistic. I'm very proud of this historic moment in my country's long record of rulings and policies. I'll surely look back and cherish this day for the rest of my life. Let's make sure more like it aren't few and far between. (And I hope the rest of this country can be mature about this, even if it's not exactly what they asked for.) 
My upquote was "Thanks Obama." Seems appropriate.  
I'm an American living in New Zealand. I made sure to stay up (it's now 5 am ) so I could see if _Obergefell_ would be announced today.  When I saw the words "there is a right to marriage equality" I cried. I can't believe the amount of positive vibes from the president, the administration, friends, family, etc.  So proud to be an American today. It's just fabulous! 
Mexico beat you. Mexico fucking beat you. I'm sorry, but I can't stop bragging. For two glorious weeks we were more progressive than the United States, and no one's gonna take that from me.  Congratulations and suck it! 
As someone religious I'm against homosexuality, but whether gay marriage was legalized or not didn't really matter to me. What did bother me was all the hate generated by this issue.  The matter of love was a joke when both sides would resort to offensive dehumanization and demonizing on the both parties. While I'm glad that its over and that humanity can finally focus on moving forward for other issues, I know that just by seeing the state of reddit right now we didn't learn much about respect for *everyone's* beliefs and opinions.   This is the one and true barrier to human peace. 
It's great. Gay marriage was legalized in my country a while ago and the current Pope opposed it calling it an "attack on the family" and a "war against God". I have no idea why Reddit seems to like him so much. 
I hate to be a downer, but I'm also worried for the LGBT+ kiddies in the bible belt and other unaccepting places. I hope they don't face any extra discrimination or violence because of this :(  I'm still hyped af though! 
I just wanted to remind everyone here that the month of June is LGBT PRIDE Month in the United States.  Add this to the list of things to be proud of. 
WARNING: Your facebook feed is probably cancerous at this moment. 
My wife and I recently got married in Vermont, because we weren't sure when Texas would finally be on the right side of history. It looks like they had to be dragged kicking and screaming, but it's nice that our marriage is recognized in the state we both were born and grew up in.  
Very happy about this. Gonna have to sit through a shitty ranting sermon on sunday at church. To make things worst, a Mosque was just built across the street from the church I go to, and my priest is already whining about limited parking now.  Help me  I don't wanna go to church anymore, especially this upcoming sunday lol 
As someone who lives far away from western culture, i've never understand (i don't mean in a negative way) about all these stuff. As in, i don't understand why it's a huge thing....but i'm pretty open minded than most folks where i live. And plus, everybody's happy about this! 
"It's just marriage now"  What about churches that will refuse to marry same-sex couples? 
Well just because it is legal, doesn't not mean anything for the acceptance of gay marriage.  The supreme court just saw that there was nothing legally different between man and woman/ man and man/ woman and woman in marriage.  Many people will still hate the LGB community.  While it is nice that the government supports it, the nation still has quite the distance to go before gay marriage is seen as equal. 
Yessssss keep it up! With a poor diet like I've always had, I'm fortunate to have always been a healthy weight. 
Husky is a terrible name, because it doesn't even necessarily mean you're fat. When I would buy school uniforms by around 6th grade I had to buy husky. I wasn't fat at all in grammar school, I just hit my growth spurt early, so I had to buy bigger clothes. Young me just thought it meant I was fat.  Unfortunately I basically stopped growing though. I was like the 4th or 5th tallest in my class in grammar school, and now I'm just a shorter guy lol. 
Man, I was a fat kid in high school, but fit as fuck in my early 20s. In my late 20s... Well, whatever the opposite of fit as fuck is.   Lesson here: good job on losing the weight, but you gotta watch that shit and keep on it.  
/r/fitness accepts progress pics and such.  then theres /r/brogress. 
Congrats! Great work! Let this success snowball into greater things. Nothing feels better than achieving goals. 
Congrats! The sub you're looking for is /r/loseit   Everyone there would be stoked to hear this story :-) 
For fun, you might also enjoy: /r/ketocirclejerk /r/congratslikeimfive 
Congrats! Really proud of you. I'm like 20 Kgs underweight and really want to get into shape but have been procrastinating for a good 3 years now. 
Congratulations! That's a ton of work, and a huge accomplishment! 
Whoooooooo!!!!! Go you! Always room to improve. Keep it up.  
Congrats with the colossal goals op! Health is definitely a lifestyle choice and it sounds like you are doing well. 
Congrats! I also weigh less now than I did at 12. It's weird to think about because typically people get bigger when they grow up. Instead we're lighter, wtf? 
YOU ROCK! CONGRATULATIONS! Time to treat yoself and buy some outfits to go with that rockin' bod.  
Thanks for sharing!   Congrats from some stranger from New Brunswick, Canada!   Just started back at the YMCA myself. Was getting overweight and decided to, at 40, get back to it. Never too early or late! :)  
This is so awesome!!! That's SUCH a huge accomplishment and you should be so proud of yourself. The amount of dedication and hard work that must take is incredible. :) 
Keep it up!!!  I'm so happy for you.  Things are a little stressful for me right now, so I just want to say that even if things seem complicated and difficult, you will find a way to turn all of it into strength and confidence.  I believe that you can do anything you set your mind to, and I don't need to know you to believe that.  You're awesome, and next time I am procrastinating on my practice sessions, I'll think of your post. 
Congrats! It's funny because 145 is actually my goal weight. Started at 176 this year and down to 163 as of this morning. Over the past three years I've gone from a healthy, yoga and cardio-loving 145 to a depressed, binge eating 176. I knew what successful weight loss looked like, but for some reason I couldn't get the wheels back in motion. Well, they are now and I'm feeling great about losing weight again.  If you ever feel in a slump or you feel like you're gaining weight again, just remember that YOU CAN do it and you have the proof to show it. 
Dude, you're totally me! I was super overweight in high school and the beginning of college, and I hit a 'normal' BMI last year. Gained a few pounds of it back (just enough to tip me back into overweight :/ ) but I'm working on it - gained some muscle mass, too.  Eating a whole foods plant based diet helped (aka being a healthy /r/vegan instead of eating oreos) a lot, especially cutting out added sugar! Keep it going!  
That's awesome!   I've been trying for years and recently found out I have a thyroid issue.  On meds now and have lost 5 lbs.  doesn't seem like much, but it's a start and something I haven't been able to do before!  
I'm so happy for you! Judging by your use of semesters I'm assuming you're in college and I know firsthand how difficult it can be to maintain a healthy lifestyle during that time. Good on you for getting your friend involved too!! Best wishes - keep going! 
So, my story is the same as yours, but opposite. When I turned 16, I was 6'1" and weighed 135 pounds. When I turned 38, I was 6'1" and weighed 135 pounds. Nothing I tried worked. In fact, I tried a 6000 calorie/day diet for a month. I gained 2 pounds, then immediately lost it. Then, I started taking taekwondo. In 6 months, I was at 145, and 18 months after that, 155. I'm a brown belt now (red, then black is my path), and I just weighed in at 164. The difference between the last 4 years and the last 22 is the commitment to working out. Building muscle burns fat and...builds muscle, which weighs a LOT.   Congrats on your success. You're gonna be HOT!! 
nominally healthy?  what does that even mean?  healthy in name only?   
I'm currently age 19, 5'7" and 185. My heaviest was 215 at the same height. I'm working my way down and you're motivating me to keep going so thanks for that. I saw you put up a comment saying you're lighter than 12 year old you and I realized I'm lighter than 14 year old me. 
I've recently decided to start to lose weight, so my first step had been to stop drinking fizzy pop/soda. 4 days in, going well so far 
Great job! I recently lost weight from my heaviest (178 lbs) to my lightest since right before I hit puberty (148). Now I'm trying to build up some muscle mass after losing most of it during my period of weight loss (I lost weight in a very unhealthy manner).  Keep up the momentum! Weight loss is exciting, especially when you get used to your new body. Have you had to buy new clothes? I had to refresh my entire wardrobe! I still need to buy new t-shirts and sweaters. 
Please don't use BMI as a measure for healthy weight for yourself without understanding that it has severe limitations. Calculate your body fat % and just strive to keep it in there lower 20%s. That is all. 
Remember to throw those scales away! Can't see your weight go back up if there are no scales ;) 
Good luck! Your maturity may be a huge advantage in school. Most of the people I know who went to undergrad in their 30s were able to make much better grades than many of the 18-year-olds, most of whom were learning how to be self-disciplined for the first time in their lives! You've probably already learned some of those critical life lessons.  I found college was a lot easier than high school, so long as you were willing to show up to *every* class and do the work/reading ahead of schedule. (Soooo many people try to not show up and write their papers/lab reports etc the day before they're due. It's much harder to do well if you take this path!)  If you treat school like a job and manage your time effectively, you'll do great.   My aunt recently went back to college at 42 and got straight As for the first time in her life! She graduated with a media/PR degree and ended up with an excellent $90,000/year job!  
Congrats. I'm 27 and I wish I had the courage to go back to school. I think you'll do great! 
You got this!!! I'm joining you in the exact same career change at 30. Feel free to PM me to commiserate! :) 
Nice! Good luck! I signed to join the military and I'm 30. Well, provided my medical stuff comes through. It's never too late, right? 
Good luck! I have a few nurse in my family and they all love their careers. It is very fulfilling from what they tell me.  
I'm also about to start nursing. How much can you potentially earn per year in your country?  I have no idea how well it pays 
Congratulations! I work at a college in Canada that has primarily a "mature student" body. We have a lot of these students attend that are very nervous for the first few weeks, but after a very short amount of time they get very comfortable! The best part is, they are a lot more successful than students coming directly from high school. One thing that I would offer as advice, utilize as many student services as applicable to you. Whether it's tutoring or in-school career assistance departments (during or upon completion of your education), we even have a department for students with parent's that did not go to post-secondary education. You are already paying for these resources, so use them! 
On a side-note, I like how you check your yoga pants for quality! 
I do the same thing. It's kind of like a 'Thank you for taking time out of your day to respond to my post' kind of thing. 
That's the courtesy upvote. The old guard here still does it. 
I do the same!   I think there are more of us out there than we suspect.   
I find myself trying to upvote those that respond as well, but I still feel that the comment itself has to encourage more discussion as upvoted comments are supposed to. It's because of that most of the responses, both to my stuff and my own responses, should be adding to the conversation to be upvoted. 
I do the same thing! There are times where I'll be posing a question that has multiple options and as long as the opinion is expressed in a respectful and clear way (aka not trolling, etc), I will upvote the comment because even though I may not agree with it, it is a nice addition to the conversation and it is good to hear what other people have to say about a certain subject. 
I'm really bad at up voting :( it's not that I don't want to I just forget to all the time. I need to practice that more. 
How to karma:  Step 1 - Reply to each one of /u/ultracrax's comments.  Step 2 - ???   Step 3 - Profit 
I have basically the same thing. I actually posted here about it and it was my top post for a while. 
I'm going to start commenting on all your posts now. 
This is why the people on CasualConversation are awesome!  I do the same thing, it's cool seeing that it's a somewhat common thing.  The only stuff I will ever downvote are really hateful or uncalled for comments. 
I did until I had a post that got a lot of attention. It didn't make it to the front page, but it made it to the top ten of the "hot" category within its sub. It was a little overwhelming.  
I'm like you too. I know upvotes are anonymous, but I do it as a way to acknowledge I've read their comment. 
What if they're just like, "Shut up, bitch"? You upvote that?  How about "This" or "."? 
I do it too but it's not a thank you. It's my acknowledgement that I got the message. It's disheartening when you write a comment and there's no indication that anyone has read it. 
Me too!  Just before looking at this post, I checked a comment I got in reply to me providing some advice. They said thanks but they didn't upvote. :( 
Whenever someone answers one of your POSTS.   Plural.  
My threads usually end in null. The simple fact I get any upvotes or comments means that it was given even a small bit of recognition, good or bad. I feel like any message I get or post reply message I get could potentially be someone tearing me a new asshole. It's nice when it's friendly, so I upvote. 
Here's something even more rare: I never downvote. Never.  Why would I downvote? What does it matter? If I don't like or agree with something, I go do something else. 
Oh yeah? I bet you also give gold to people on occasion...  "wink wink" 
I also like to upvote the parent comment of any comment I upvote, just seems right to propagate credit upwards.  
I'm relatively new to Reddit so haven't quite got into the swing of up/down voting. I've upvoted a few posts because I agree or because I like it. What do you do if you disagree with a comment? Still upvote because they interacted or downvote because you disagree? 
came from Askreddit, seems like my kinda place.  **INITIALIZING: MEGA LURK** 
I feel like I've walked into a room with a bunch of friends to hang out 
Welcome everyone, do not forget to be nice to each other. :) 
Thanks to guibmaster for pointing out this nice subreddit. I think i'm going to like it here :D 
Hi everybody new! I'm makin' bacon pancakes. Warm, meaty, cakey goodness for all.  Unless there's a bunch of you. I only have two lbs of bacon.  
A sub that might help bring me out of my shell! Hi everyone, keep doing what you do cuz it's cool :) 
So comment for the mods, having experienced a sub jumping from 20k to 40k before (took a few months of course). And assuming that you've never been through that, which you guys may very well have in some other sub..  But anyways the 40k mark seems to really be where the occasional trolling starts. But it will all be fine, so long as you keep doing what it seems you have already been doing :), and add more resources (mods or automod functions) as they seem needed.   These referral sort of situations seem to have a tendency to first create a large spike, and then continued growth snowballing from that initial spike.   \*Oh wow so make that 10k+. The busy should even out, but def something to keep an eye on, not sure how doubling in a *single da* would affect a sub :\ 
How do you create a new post? The "submit link"/"submit text" buttons in most other subs aren't here. 
Definitely want to check out this sub, seems like a neat way to start the day. 
I'm here specifically because it was mentioned. I've been looking for a sub like this for a long time. Probably gonna stick around. 
Looks like it's going to rain for a while here. How's the weather where you are? 
I don't know how any of this works even after I read a lot of it.  
I discovered this Subreddit with it, seems like a nice place, I'm gonna stay here :D 
This is a really good idea, you're a pretty swell OP.  My resolution was to start getting active, and I did! I'm in much better shape than I was last year, but I've kind of lost it all over christmas :( It'll be easier to restart this year than it was to start fresh last year though which is a plus. 
OP this really touched me for some reason, I'm very cynical by nature and don't believe in New Years resolutions, but this year I just might make one... AND follow through on it. 
I'm piling more gold onto your haul. Reddit can be a very negative and discouraging place sometimes. Thanks for bringing so much positivity into the world! You've uplifted more than just the people with resolutions from last year.  
Wow, all these people you're following up on... This really makes me want to think of a good resolution and do it, but I'm terrible at making up goals. 
OP, this is an awesome idea! I'm curious about something though. You had to post a lot of these on this thread, and the formatting is super consistent. Did you use a bot to make the comments here? 
Will you be doing it again for this year. If so here's mine:  Go to the gym more  Eat healthier.   Stop masterbating.  
Yep. I stayed out of the hospital this year (I really hope the fireworks won't be so bad in Hawaii this year, that I might have an asthma attack and break that record).   Next year's resolution is to continue to stay out of the hospital and lose/keep off weight. 
A lot of it didn't get achieved. Things didn't go according to plan, some backfired terribly, and others just never came to fruition. I'm gonna make it my goal this year to be relentless!    
They do indeed! It's something we've had in the works for a week or two now, and it's finally a part of the sub :) Glad to hear you like it! 
I asked you guys for quotes yesterday ;) upvote some comments, look around and try finding your submitted quote! 
My very special cat has been missing for over 2 weeks now. I live in a pretty small town but no one has seen any sight of him. I miss him so much, I keep hoping he'll walk up on my porch and everything can go back to normal. God I miss him so much... That's so cool you have your cat back, 6 years is a crazy long time. I hope my cat comes back sooner then 6 years..!  
He looks in very good shape. Do you think he had other "owners" in the interim? 
Awh congratulations! That's amazing. I would cherish him so much. Does his brother recognize him? Does he recognize you?  
That's amazing! How did the vet recognize him? Is he microchipped? I'm so happy you were able to be reunited! 
Our outdoor cat (more of a farm cat than a pet) got hit by a car a few months back. Basically disappeared for a week.  Then one day, bam, she shows up at, like, midnight when I'm hanging out with some people. Slight limp, cut in front of nose. A week later, no limp, cut healed. As far as I can tell she didn't even break anything.  That cat is twenty two years old. 
When I was younger our family dog found a hole in our fence to our neighbor's yard, and their fence had lots of holes into the outside world. He would sneak out while we were gone and then when we got back we'd call him from the back door. It'd usually take about five minutes but he'd always come around the corner of our house, panting and acting like he'd been there the whole time.  One day I was watching him through my bedroom window, which faced the fence, and I watched him approach the hole, look back and forth like no one was watching, and then wriggle his way through.  We patched it after that. 
Why don't you post this story to r/Cats also?  Is he chipped?  I know you said he ended up in the back of someone's van, but how did you even find that out, and what was your Mom told when he answered the call and then went to pick him up? 
Congratulations! We just found our cat after believing she wandered off and died. She's indoor/outdoor we hadn't seen her in about 6 months. I got locked out the other week and went to the neighbors to use their phone. Our cat!!!   They said she was in their driveway one day so they took her in and she liked 24/7 house life better. Her name is cleopatra now.   This is the second time neighbors have kidnapped her. The first time it was a crazy older lady who stole lots of neighborhood cats.  However, we recently adopted a puppy so we allowed Cleopatra to be adopted by the neighbors.  
Haha, nice job man. I'm kinda in the same boat except I have yet to tell her. We hang out regularly though, so some day soon I hope I get the courage.   
Hell yeah, bud. Congrats. I accidentally read "art fair" as "air fart" and said what the freaking fuck? But then my brain unfroze and all was well again. Have fun! Don't worry too much!  
Men like you are the reason I get up with a smile in the morning and a spring in my step.This made my day.This here proves traditional yardsticks to measure a person  mean fuck all  when your character and gut to keep trying outweigh everything else.Congratulations brother 
I hope you don't mind but I'm totally stealing the phrase "holy fuckamole" for future uses. That's awesome though! 
Congratulations to you dude! It seems like these feelings following a 'confession' never changes whether you're a teenager or an adult. Also, kudos to you for letting your feelings known instead of rejecting yourself and thinking you're not good enough. I'm glad you didn't text her in the meantime when you waited for her reply. Have fun at the fair and just be yourself! 
Nice job man. Just keep being you and everything will be fine. Just a bit of friendly advice, don't put too much pressure on the date. *Almost* treat it as if you guys are still just hanging out, that's what did the trick for me when I got some unexpected dates. The best thing is to just continue being yourself, don't try to change any of that up. She said yes for a reason, if you change shit you won't be able to find out what that reason is. 
Nice job dude! Im sitting here in a full train with a big fat grin on my face, but they will never guess that I just read some amazingly uplifting news. Thanks for that :D! 
I only hope you dont get too worked up over it. Obsessing over a girl or putting her on a pedestal is a good way to scare her off. Dates are a good way to see if you guys can have a laugh together. Take it easy and try to enjoy each others company and see what their made of. Enjoy yourself, dont take it too seriously! Remember, if you guys cant laugh and smile together, it wasnt going to work out anyway. 
I am in college now in my third year, I think back to high school and think "what was I thinking?", I think back to middle school and think "You were an idiot!", I even think back to freshman year of college and think "wow that could have been handled better". I have made an effort to live my life so that one day when I am a bit older I look back and think "You did alright kid". 
Are you kidding. I've been having these kinds of thoughts since the fourth grade. Fucking terrible. Anyway I know for a fact I was a real asshole in the past. I've swung the other direction now being paranoid that I'm not being considerate enough to others and constantly trying not to over compensate but also making suuuuure they know I'm taking their feelings serious. I apply this to every interaction. It's crazy and I already know I need meds so you don't have to tell me. 
All the fucking time. Especially reading old emails or messages... Sometimes cringe worthy... 
 I always do this. I KNOW in two years time, I will think back to this very moment and say "why the hell didn't I do this or that" etc..  I suppose that's just the beauty of hindsight 
I was actually thinking about this the other day and I've been wondering what I'll do next that I'll look back on and think 'how naive'. 
As a transgender, yea. I look back at my old female self and feel great seeing how far I've improved as a person, mentally and in a self awareness way too 
"Love of my life, will you marry me?"  "Yes! ...uh what are you doing?"  "Hold on I gotta post about this on /r/casualconversation." 
How long have you been together? Have you ever lived together? Proposed over skype? Do you have the finances for the ring? Can she fit in a rowboat? 
Congrats!   I think picking the ring together is a good way of going about it. It's something she'll wear for the rest of her life, so she better love it! 
With loud heart pounding in your chest,  You said those words so fluently,  Without the time for peace nor rest,  "My dearest, will you marry me?"  &nbsp;  A smile appeared now on her lips,  And tears began to flow so free,  She wiped them with her fingertips,  "I will, you mean the world to me!"  &nbsp;  "You cannot know how glad I am,  How much I stressed but days before,  If words could phrase just how I feel,  Then I have never loved you more."  &nbsp;  _____  Again, best wishes! It's always a pleasure to hear good news, so I thank you. 
Congratulations! Non traditional proposals are the best. Makes your story together even more unique. 
How did you two meet each other? Initially in person then became long term or online? 
Long distance... Skype... Sounds like a Catfish situation. Have you met her? She could be wearing a mask. Or... Is the Skype camera always in a weird position, slightly above her, so it's looking down, to make it look like she doesn't have a double chin? You know that way fat chicks take selfies to hide the fact they're fat. 
Congrats! best wishes to the two of you. What made you decide she was the one? 
I also have a long distance Skype relationship with a girl from Nigeria. She is a princess with millions in the bank and high up in government and stuff. She sounds a bit like a young lad whose voice is breaking to me but I was told by all my progressive friends that I'm being racist and sexist for even entertaining a doubt, besides females never lie. She asked me to marry her. Now that is pretty non-traditional in her society, I read Nat Geo so know this. Also I have to buy the engagement ring using Western Union to a jeweller in Lagos which is nontraditional too.  Should I say Yes!!!? 
When I was 11 I took a sticker of a teddy bear with angel wings and put it inside my dad's metal lunch bucket. 18 years later it's still there, although horribly faded.  
I was very artsy as a child & constantly drew or made things for my Dad...and he kept everything. One year I went to a craft fair with my Mom & found this tiny little woven basket, no bigger than 6" tall, that I just *had* to have. As soon as I got home, I went to work on a special present for Dad. I took some green paper, drew a bunch of flowers, colored them with my new cool color-changer markers (the ones that would change when you colored over with the white/clear one), cut them out, & glued into a circle to place inside the basket like a bouquet. I gave it to him & I am not kidding, they stayed proudly displayed, though eventually very faded, on a shelf in his "rig room" (he did ham radio as a huge hobby & had a room in the basement for it all) until the day he died. 
When I was little, I drew a face - in ink - on the wallpaper that we had on our stairway.   My parents were FURIOUS, and I got into major trouble.   Time went by, and my parents replaced the wallpaper.    More time went by, I grew up, and my parents moved out of that house.   I helped them pack - and when I was clearing out a chest of drawers, I found a small piece of wallpaper with the face I'd drawn. 
I visited my dad last summer, it had been six years since we had last seen each other. When we finally met, I said it was sort of weird, seeing each other for the first time in 6 years. And he said something along the lines of, "Yup, it's been 6 years, X months, and about Y days I think". He knew pretty much exactly how long we had been apart, he had remembered the day I had left i guess. That was one of the many things that made me realize just how lucky I was to have an amazing dad like him, and I can only hope to be as cool as he is one day. 
Now its your turn, show him that you love him ! You don't really have you spend a single dime if you can't, dad's appreciate everything 
My dad has some knick knacks we made in first grade for fathers day in his office :) 
LifeSavingProTip: Dont hang stuff from the mirror.  
Oh lordy. Bad news. I'm 42 and still have nightmares of forgetting assignments, where my class was, did I take the final, did I actually graduate college.   
Thats what I felt about high school.Its like all the phone calls I got from school to home  just suddenly stop and you don't hear that buzz in your ear anymore from teachers like an annoying fucken mosquito at 2am.Best way to describe it is a good emptiness. 
Back to grad school man! I'm starting grad school this August and it took me two years to get in. I'm nervous to get back into the academic mindset. 
I teach a class with people between 30 and 72 y/o and asked when this dream goes away. They said they'd let me know.  
I've felt like that over a decade later. It's a really common nightmare actually if you look it up.   Doesn't help me that it almost actually happened to me. It was my last semester and I was taking a really easy class I needed to graduate. Was skipping most of the time. Had the wrong day in my head for the test. Happened to check the class schedule 20 minutes in to what was actually one of the three main exams. Ran a dead sprint to that classroom, got there with 20 minutes left in the class, and was able to BS enough on it to get a C on that test. If I had missed it fully, would have gotten a 0 and would have not walked at my graduation date for being one class short,  
Graduated on Saturday as well. I still have the feeling that I have a term paper due monday. Can't shake it.  Otherwise, how was your graduation? 
11th grade right now, can't wait for school to end.   At least in uni I'll study subjects that I actually care about  
Man, I'm a week away from handing in my final work, and just shy of a month away from being finished with art university and graduated! Do you miss having work to do at home? Some mates who were in the year above me told me how weird it is to just be free and without purpose in the afternoon without homework. 
At a lot of schools, you have to turn in the "authorization to graduate" form sometime between graduation and midnight that day.  It can take up to 6 months to get your transcripts and diploma if you fail to do this.  Double-check the small print on university's policy website.  Not really :) 
You ever have that nightmare where you discover that you signed up for a class you forgot to attend all semester?  
There is, you forgot about it. Quickly get on Canvas!!!  I once dreamed I took a class, forgot about it, and didn't show up all semester and failed... 
Congrats on graduating! I bet that's a normal feeling - I'm still studying but at the start of each summer holiday it takes me a while to adjust to having nothing to do. 
Will you stick to the nice Reddit, or show them the more interesting parts? 
If they're backing up shit posts they really don't know reddit :P  Good suggestion, nice trick ;) 
I guess we'll see your stuff also showing up on /r/HailCorporate then.  I look forward to the day when my glasses have a built-in ad blocker though, because marketing is one of the worst things about modern society. 
Thanks for adding more spam to Reddit.  Mods are going to love you! 
I hope you're paying for sponsored posts, because I'm pretty sure what you're admitting to doing results in a perma-ban around here. 
So in the near future you will become part of the group of people who are in no small part responsible for the decline of this site. Nice. 
What are you guys selling?  Try to sell me your product!  As a sidenote, just an hour ago I placed an order with a company that approached me through reddit. They weren't pushy or anything, the guy just said 'hey, check out our website, we can beat that price by quite a lot'.   
Stuff is less fun when you're paid to do it.   You went from:  * Sneaking in a some secret Reddit time. With the fear of getting caught, and the thrill of getting away with it.   * Getting screwed if you don't Reddit enough.  =\  
Remember to always use a throwaway when being stupid then. Specially now that your job "is" reddit.    And remember that even simple firewalls and proxies can track what you do, so event though you are clear to reddit, the IT department can track you, throwaway or not. :) 
I technically don't get paid *to* be on Reddit...but I totally get paid while being on Reddit.   Way to beat the technicality.   What specifically are you looking for, data-wise? 
If you spend all day on reddit, what will you do when you get home and sit in your apartment in front of the computer for another 4-6 hours? 
I've thought of marketing/working on commercials as a possible direction for my career once I get out of high school. How exactly did you get to where you are today? Did you have to go to college? Any other advice? 
OP, why did you start your title with "So"? Where did you learn that you're supposed to do that? 
If we send this to the frontpage, im sure your collegues will find it!  
Interesting callout, I'm on a BI team too.   Apparently there's some way to get location data off of twitter of facebook posts for people who know how to datamine that stuff.  Someone on my team wrote an app to get a general idea of how much 'excitement' there was for a new product by area.  During a new product launch we under estimated the demand so they were using this twitter app to basically say -- don't just stock stores that want the product,  prioritize stores in areas that people are excited about it first.   
When I upvoted you, it said "Shh baby is ok". Anyway, great job on actually asking her. It doesn't matter whether or not you weren't super suave or anything like that. What matters is that you actually did it. Finding the courage is always the hardest part. 
I have an embarrassing story for you. I had convinced a cute girl from university to come to a party at my house, lots of drinking. I got more drunk then I meant to but she thought I was cute and somehow we ended up alone in my room. you know how sometimes when you're around people and need to burp you do it quietly in then sort of blow the air out? This was me at the exact moment she leans in for a kiss and I blew my hot burp straight into her mouth.  
congrats! I'm extremely socially awkward and get tongue tied all the time. So, I'll always be saying really weird things. Once I pronounced "Downton Abbey" as "Down town abbey", on the same day, I referred to Ben & Jerry's Ice cream as Tom & Jerry's Ice cream. Once, I tried to say "blood" and it came out as "Blod"... Things like this happen everyday, they're not really stories, but these things have added up...  
A couple years ago I dated a gorgeous woman who's comically out of my league, because I had the balls to ask her out.  She told me she didn't get asked out very often, which was shocking to me... but apparently there are a lot of cowardly dudes out there.  If you want something in this life, the least you can do is ask for it. 
That's actually similar to how my cousin met her now husband.  He sat one seat closer to her every day, until the final day when he asked her out. 
Honestly - you did good. Seriously. Rejection is a part of the dating scene. You win some, you lose some. After a while you will win more than lose - so that's good.  You should be proud of yourself for jumping that hurdle and taking the hit and still stand. I know I'm proud of you!   You stay in the game and keep asking --- it'll happen :)   I wish you all the best!   *Nana internet hug*  PS: I thought your technique was good btw --- :) 
SHE'S CRAZY! I'D TOTALLY GO OUT WITH YOU!  Look, there's plenty more fish in the sea and I have no fucking idea what I'm talking about because I'm a socially awkward 15-year-old who can't find the balls to talk to girls. Don't listen to my advice, **I'M A DETRIMENT TO SOCIETY.** 
If this was one of my romance novels... she would have said yes =( lol. But I'm glad you asked! I love random spontaneous stories like yours. Maybe it will help you gain confidence to talk with girls?  
Aw man, I'm sorry it didn't work out for you! I can tell you though that I've always respected the dudes with the guts to actually ask even if I've said no.  Also, getting a no is usually nothing personal. She just wasn't feeling the same instant attraction you felt. It's not an in-depth indicator of your personal worth of anything.   Anyway, good try, and good luck with the next one! You'll get better at it as you go, no worries. 
Too late for me, graduated a week ago. But am going to community college so I can try my luck there.   But man. I don't know if she was being nice to me but damn. Damn. We smile when we look at each other. She's not mine. But you gotta move on.    Good job though. I didn't have any gonads to do it  
Haha, at least you attempted so you can't fault yourself for that. :) I'd probably do the same thing, but alas I don't even have the courage to admit things to the girls I have a crush on.  
It's great that you had the courage to try! Ultimately,  this is what dating is,  talking to people,  and then asking them out if you think there is a spark.  It can be awkward, especially in the beginning, and the people will not always respond.  But over time you get better at (1) judging body language and (2) asking people out in a way that isn't totally awkward. In the last two months I've been rejected by a few guys, and rejected a couple myself.  That's just the way it goes.  Not everyone is a perfect match. But the more you get out there,  the less scary it will be.  Being comfortable asking people out also can stop you from getting those drawn out crushes on someone who is completely unaware.  Because if you ask the person out,  and they say no,  then you can just move on. I find that way better than living in that limbo of uncertainty.  
there is no shame in getting rejected. swinging for the fences and striking out is better than striking out with the bat on your shoulder.  the most important things are to forget about it quick and hold no resentment. some people aren't in to you, other are. just like you're in to some people and not others. the sooner you recognize it isn't personal and you shouldn't feel bad the sooner you'll ask out someone and they'll say yes.   
There's no terrible segue.   I've said some weird and stupid shit, but when the question was asked (and if she was attracted/interested) the answer was yes.   If the answer is no, it doesn't mean you did something wrong, or said something weird or "creepy"(who am I kidding this is reddit). It might just mean (bluntly speaking) she's not attracted to you or she's not interested. Nothing wrong with that on either side.   The important thing is you tried.   Unfortunately, it's still up to guys to make the first move. If it comes off as weird, IMO it's not your fault. You tried. You *have* to try.  
I have an experience every bit as awkward as yours. There was a girl I knew who liked classical music. At that point of time, I used to listen to a little bit of classical music because of living with my parents. She once asked me out to go with her to a classical concert. I'm usually a very shy person who doesn't get asked out like that. I really didn't know what to say, so I just said, "So sorry, have a thing that day."  Now that I think of it, I should have relished the opportunity to go out with the opposite sex. She was really nice person too and we used to have fun whenever we talked. I've since moved to another city and have not been asked on date ever since. Nor have I had the courage to ask anyone else. Pretty sad, I'd say.  
You did what most people don't do, you packed up the courage and did it. You'll get better at it later, and hell even if you don't, some girls like awkward guys.    Source: I found my boyfriend (when we just met) insanely cute when he said "If I added you on Facebook, you'd say yes... right?" 
Did this last Friday, I was shakey af but my speech was measured. Nothing special, just:  *Hey excuse me, sorry. I saw you in week 5 and thought you looked absolutely gorgeous* (it's week 11). *Just thought I'd say hi and grab your number.* (I didn't phrase it as a question, some consider this a bad thing)   Went okay. Getting coffee with her in 2 days so keeeen. 
when I was in class I would just stare at them all day creepily, im talking for hours at a time without looking away, hmmmm hee hee hee   but my suggestion to you is avoid putting your balls on the line THAT much, any big moves will always put them on the back foot which will be more likely shot down. Instead you should have just casually asked for her phone number and then played it from there.   for what its worth, it gets easier in years to come, not from experience or anything, its more just people get more interested in relationships themselves....    good luck !  
I hate that guys think that if they ask once and get rejected that is it forever.  Now that you have broken the ice, be totally casual and friendly.  Ask her to go hand..not on a date but just to go do something with friends.  Why?  Because even if she is not interested in you romantically does not mean that you cannot be friends.  Why?  Because she has friends.  Duh.  Also, because a chick can also be a friend...even if you like her like her and she does not like like you back.   
You had the guts to do something I've wanted to do for a long time. Now I'm out of school and never get to see them again. Life sucks sometimes, but kudos to you. 
I think that was a good line! Either way, the important thing is that you said something.  Keep talking to girls! 
That's awesome. Too bad she said no. her loss. i think though it would work better if you get to know her first -- see if there's any chemistry before asking her out. Just keep on coming up with excuses to talk to her. 
OP this happened to me too but with a girl who lived upstairs. I'm an extrovert but still I rarely ask girls out. Struck out and it hurt but I'm really glad I did it, proof to myself I can see something through 
Hey man, you found the courage to do it and I'm sure it'll make the next time a lot easier. Knowing that rejection isn't as bad as you imagine it is really helps.  
At least now you know you've tried and you can safely move on to other cute girls :D 
Well done dude. Proud of you!   It took balls to know it could go badly and still do it anyway, and now it's in the past, slightly embarrassing (if anything) for like a week, then u basically never think about it again. 
Congratulations on your step forward! It may have not worked out with this one, but it may with the next. Also, now that you two are talking, you may get a cool friend out of it. 
I once asked out the girl from class I liked but I we were decent friends before hand, she said yes and we went to the park and hung out. Then about a month later of her just straight up ignoring me which I assumed had something to do with her getting her wisdom teeth out one of her friends who I'm still really good friends with told me she didn't want to be friends anymore.   Haven't spoken to her in 2 years. I would have rather just been rejected than had actually gone on a date and got worked up. I also would have rather had her tell me herself even if its just over text.   I'm still not sure if it was something I did on the date or if there was never feelings and she just didn't want to say no when I asked her.   Anyway I think its important that people don't miss a chance to ask someone out they have feelings over but just don't think everything will be perfect before the second or even third date. 
Sounds like you just dodged a bullet there. If she was at least polite and educated, she wouldn't laugh at your face.   Congrats on your courage to overcome your fears! 
That gave me a smile, I have a lot of respect for you for doing that because I myself don't have enough balls to do it.   
Yeah, I did that once as well. She became my girlfriend and turned out to be a complete psychopath.   Moral of the story: Asking Cute Girls Out Considered Harmful. 
Nice work on making the leap - now you know it's not so bad!  
There was this girl I was really REALLY into. My friend at the time asked her out for me without my knowing. He came and told me about it later, and I got really nervous. Apparently she responded,"maybe if he asked me himself". I went up to her later that day to tell her he got it wrong and I wasn't into her. I hate myself. 
You sounded like Eminem in "Rap God"...and it ended up like Eminem in "Lose Yourself". Mom's spaghetti everywhere :( 
You should keep doing this. The more times you get rejected the easier it becomes to approach women. 
Heh I was trying something similar today, thankfully before I said anything too out there she mentioned she had just been hanging out with her boyfriend so there was no awkwardness so we can continue to be sort of acquaintance friends.  
She may already be in a relationship or you just might not be the type (or gender) she's attracted to. But that is awesome you put yourself out there and tried. It is always a compliment to be asked out but it can be hard to reject a guy without sounding like a bitch, too. If she is an attractive girl I'm sure she has a slight upper hand in knowing many guys that interact with her are attracted to her. But at the same time it might be tiresome to get asked out and have to kindly reject guys when at first the conversation just started over wanting to borrow a pencil. It seems like attractive people have it made but it is tough to be the one asking out and also tough to be the one rejecting someone. 
Hey, congrats on reaching out though, I wouldn't've done that. Just take it as a "hey, if I did that..." story to tell yourself next time you get nervous :p 
Told this one girl I liked her, and she said she needed time to think about it. After a week, she's been avoiding me. 
Tried that once. Mumbled my way through it and ran away before she could respond after it. Which was probably a good idea because she was dating someone and I didn't realize. But it worked out I suppose. I'd been really obsessed with her before, after telling her thiugh that mostly abated. 
While you are definitely waaay more ballsy than me, it does seem a bit odd that you would ask her out without ever talking to her before. Anyway, sucks she said no. Good luck man! 
Good on you bro... that's life, the important thing is you plucked up the courage to do it, and even if it didn't work out this time, you will learn from ur mistakes and make it happen soon with someone else. BUT dont give up on this girl either, maybe she said no because she really doesn't know anything about you yet. One thing Ive learnt with the ladies is never fold in ur cards too soon. 
I had a girl who I had a crush on in high school that I was too nervous to ask out. However it happened that she accidently admitted that she liked me as well later on. It was later at night when she said it so we both decided to talk more the next day.   The next day when I spoke to her she said that her dad said she couldn't have a boyfriend but suddenly a month or so later she goes and dates a friend of mine.  
Great job, asking her out! I was extremely shy when I was younger, until college. By that point, I just decided, what the hell, at worst she'll say no, and that result is the same as if I never asked. 
Welcome to the world of interacting with the opposite sex: The Good, the bad, and the ugly. We've all been there, just part of the learning curve! 
Even though she declined I bet she thought you were brave to do it. So there's that! 
Lol. I remember doing it once some years ago. This girl was next to me in a bus trip (2 hours trip) and after starting to talk to her she turned around pretending to sleep just to avoid talking to me. I was so embarassed. I felt like a rapist. 
Shit dude sorry it didn't go well but major props for trying! That's usually farther than I'll go. 
One time I was at a coffee shop with a few of my friends just chilling and I spot this cute girl walk in and take a seat by herself near us. So, I figured hey, why not give it a shot you know?   So I approach her, she was looking down at her phone or something, she didn't really see me, and I put my hands on the chair in front of her and say "hi". As she begins to raise her head to look at me she starts complaining "can't I just have a damn coffee to myself!" - or something along those lines.   Got taken completely by surprise by that one, still confused I sat down and asked her some random question (whether she liked avocado). I could see that confused her back and she hesitantly replied. At that point I just told her to have a nice day and went back to my friends, who heard the rejection and we had laugh about it.  
We did it as a joke and she actually accepted haha 
I love this! Ah, we are the loveliest sub!  /u/ekjp, WELCOME! 
Ellen looks like she would be nice and pleasant in person, doesn't she? She's always smiling, and her smile looks genuine, if that makes any sense. I wonder what she will do after this. I wish her all the best. 
Can't you make someone a mod without their permission?  Either way it's pretty funny :) 
Wait... you have a freaking lab?! Chemistry major? Can you show us a picture or two? 
So, uh... /u/ekjp what was the first thing you did after stepping down? (is that a subject I shouldn't bring up? If I'm being insensitive I apologize)  I think if it were me, I'd have a beer and watch Netflix in my underwear.   I also think if it were me I'd pretty much hate reddit after the bullshit you put up with, so cheers for being mentally stronger than I am, or at least more forgiving.  
I'm just wondering why you make potassium ferrioxalate. 
Upvote, not only for the sentiment. I always upvote Newsradio.  
Of course people call butts "butts", that's what they are.  
This is the best story ever. Better than the guy who made his mum think toy story 3 ended with all the toys dying.  
So if anyone has this extension while reading this thread, they're going to read "everyone is calling butts butts." Haha.  
I'll be completely honest, I hate the cloud-to-butt extension. A lot. I'm a meteorologist so naturally I love talking about clouds and weather and things like that but any time a topic like that pops up on reddit it quickly and inevitably devolves into "LOL butts??".  It was kind of funny the first time I saw it I guess. The appeal was already gone by the second time I saw it though. I'm probably getting frustrated over nothing but it's just one of those things that bugs me. It does nothing except detract from good conversation because everyone has to tell everyone else that they're using the extension. Talk about a dead horse to beat.  I know I'm being a debbie downer but it just makes me sad... 
I too have the extension. Your post has the greatest density of butts I have seen in some time.  Also, you should subscribe to /r/clouds. Every other post is 'beautiful clouds' or 'strange clouds.' It makes every visit to reddit a jolly one. 
As a programmer, we talk all the time about things being in the cloud. 
There should be a lol/lmao to ayy lmao extension.  
Why are all these tech sites talking about storing my files in the butt? 
My mother has an unhealthy obsession with FB garage sale groups. Anyone got ideas on an app that could mess with that? Maybe turn the word "free" into "crappy" or "For Sale" into "wanted"? 
Wait...  What?   There is an extension that literally changes the word "clouds"  to "butts?"  
When I was 11 I took a sticker of a teddy bear with angel wings and put it inside my dad's metal lunch bucket. 18 years later it's still there, although horribly faded.  
I was very artsy as a child & constantly drew or made things for my Dad...and he kept everything. One year I went to a craft fair with my Mom & found this tiny little woven basket, no bigger than 6" tall, that I just *had* to have. As soon as I got home, I went to work on a special present for Dad. I took some green paper, drew a bunch of flowers, colored them with my new cool color-changer markers (the ones that would change when you colored over with the white/clear one), cut them out, & glued into a circle to place inside the basket like a bouquet. I gave it to him & I am not kidding, they stayed proudly displayed, though eventually very faded, on a shelf in his "rig room" (he did ham radio as a huge hobby & had a room in the basement for it all) until the day he died. 
When I was little, I drew a face - in ink - on the wallpaper that we had on our stairway.   My parents were FURIOUS, and I got into major trouble.   Time went by, and my parents replaced the wallpaper.    More time went by, I grew up, and my parents moved out of that house.   I helped them pack - and when I was clearing out a chest of drawers, I found a small piece of wallpaper with the face I'd drawn. 
I visited my dad last summer, it had been six years since we had last seen each other. When we finally met, I said it was sort of weird, seeing each other for the first time in 6 years. And he said something along the lines of, "Yup, it's been 6 years, X months, and about Y days I think". He knew pretty much exactly how long we had been apart, he had remembered the day I had left i guess. That was one of the many things that made me realize just how lucky I was to have an amazing dad like him, and I can only hope to be as cool as he is one day. 
Now its your turn, show him that you love him ! You don't really have you spend a single dime if you can't, dad's appreciate everything 
My dad has some knick knacks we made in first grade for fathers day in his office :) 
LifeSavingProTip: Dont hang stuff from the mirror.  
This happened yesterday and it was me being awkward (as usual). I work in retail. I had been talking to a coworker and had to step away for a minute. Went back to where we had been standing and started to resume the conversation. Took me a minute to realize that there was now a customer (and no one else) standing there. Then I kind of stuttered and said, "oh you're not ____," giggled nervously, and walked away. 
I got in the wrong Lyft once!  My buddy just dropped me off at the bus station after a long weekend of drinking so I could take the bus the rest of the way home. I decided I was too hungover to handle a bus so I called Lyft. The app told me to a expect a blue yaris in 5 minutes. 5 minutes later, a blue yaris pulls up right in front of me. I get in the back seat and the first thing I notice is it's really messy, I slowly look up to look at the driver. She's just staring at me with mouth agape, frozen in horror. I manage to stutter out, "You're not my Lyft. Are you." She violently shakes her head and I get out of the car say Sorry over and over again while also semi-laughing at my own stupidity. My correct blue yaris came a few moments later to wisk me away. 
My dad did this to my mom once. It was the 80's- a simpler time with simpler lives, where we all owned minivans that looked very similar to each other.  My mom went inside to cash a check and my dad saw a very similar minivan behind him in the "waiting line" by the front door of where we were at. He said "watch this" and did a circle in the parking lot- we then watched as my mom eagerly jumped in the wrong van & then very quickly scurried out.  Good times. 
I had a very similar experience a few months ago... parked outside my friend's house waiting for him to come out, and some random woman gets in the back seat of my car.  It might have been scary, but being an attractive, 120 lb blonde, it was just a little weird. 
I can't understand that. Uber tells you the make, model, and color of the car to expect, along with a picture of it. It also gives you the name and a picture of the driver. How could you mistake all of those things? How could anyone be so careless as to jump into a random person's car without being 100% sure it is who they expect it to be?  
I'm waiting for the news report to come out that someone stepped into someone's car thinking it was Uber or Lyft, and was shot by the driver who thought he was being attacked. 
Recently I was coming home from work and waiting for the bus at the  crowded station. I have a dirty job so my clothes were filthy. This friendly guy with a bag comes up and starts handing me stuff like socks, little bag of toiletries, etc. while saying "whatcha need, we got you covered"  Took me a second to realize he thought I was homeless and was part of a group that helps them out. Had to explain I was dirty from work, just fine, and thanks anyways. 
I always feel awkward with Uber. My wife and I used one in San Francisco all of our trip, but I never know if everyone is supposed to be in the back, or one person up front.  
I walked into a house thinking it was my air bnb.  Google maps was off, and when I parked there were a couple people outside that said hi as I grabbed my suitcase and walked in.  Then a lady said "It's so nice to finally meet you" They though I was their relatives girlfriend that they had never met. 
My mom and I were at the grocery store about a year ago.  She was visiting from out of town, so we were in my car.  After coming back out to the parking lot, I emptied our cart into my trunk, then she went to put the cart back, so I sit down in the driver's seat to wait for her.  It seemed like I had been waiting a while, and I start looking around for her.  I glance to my right and see her SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT OF THE CAR NEXT TO MINE.  Suddenly she looks to the left and sees me staring at her from another car and she jumps out of the one she's in, runs to mine, yelling, "WHO JUST LEAVES THEIR CAR UNLOCKED LIKE THAT?"  I couldn't stop laughing. 
I was once at a Microsoft store wearing a red shit. I was checking out a tablet when a kid comes up next to me and says "I got a question about this computer over here..." I turn to face him and he sees I have 'chupathingy' on the front of my shirt. I say "I don't work here" he looked supprised and said "Oh. Sorry." And quickly took off. 
This didn't happen to me but to my brother back in the late 90's-early 2000's, before uber was a thing. In his college days, he had a short school bus he had painted black, because why the hell not? One night while out on the town, some drunk guys climbed into the bus thinking it was a drunk bus, and my brother inadvertently became a designated driver. He's a nice guy so he gave them a ride. 
Gotta make sure that Uber sticker is on the windshield! 
I just use cabs, they are much easier to understand as it is just a quick phone call, and you can recognise the cars easier. 
Yeah, starting a career can really suck.  Tell me about the othere interests. Are there no opportunities there to make a career in. Or at least to get your mind of things? 
Here's something which might cheer you up , I graduated from technical school at 21. Then was conscripted for 2 years . When I finished conscription, what I've learned in school was obsolete, I did low level computer programing jobs for 3 years earning 1.4k per month .  I saved some money and went to university. After graduation I'm at 29 years old. I practically spent my 20s not doing anything beneficial to my career . My first real job was with consulting in the big four at age 30.   I'm 36 this year and I'm learning 100k per year before taxes .  Summary,  not everyone started right on the first .   I hope you spend sometime to figure out what you want as a career instead of doing odd jobs which may not benefit your ultimate career . Good luck  
Wow, you really penned yourself in when choosing that username. 
Those that start later, dont neccessarily come last.  That wasn't the exact quote, but whatever, it works for me. I've dropped out of college two times and am about to start my third attempt and that's basically my motto. Maybe it'll help you somewhat. 
I'm 26 and just moved back in with my mom to go back to school after realizing my first degree will only let me get jobs that I hate. A lot of people our age get down because we feel like we should already have the things our parents had at our age, but it just doesn't work like that anymore. The dream of being married with a stable job, your own house and your 2.5 kids at the age of 25 is no longer something everyone can expect (or even want) due to changes in the market and various social pressures. Don't get down on yourself if things take you a little longer than you expect. Everyone's different, and we all forge our own path in our own time.  
I'm in the same boat as you. 26 graduated with a masters in December. I'm looking at tech companies for design positions but everyone wants 3 years work experience so interviews are far and few between. I think it'll help that you're at least in LA in a populated area for more opportunities. I'm in the middle of nowhere and local candidates seem much more preferred. I think we'll both find something eventually just apply to everything you can, connect with people on LinkedIn! Use your schools alumni network and career center if you can! 
Indulge me in a thought exercise here?  Imagine you got a job, but the start date was 45 days from today: what would you do in the interim? 
you should consider joining the US military, you can go in as an officer and make a ton of money. Thats what i am doing right now, actually pretty glad i did.  
I think my dad told his aunt after the second date that he was going to marry my mom.   The only thing I would say is don't be in a rush to get married. You're still very young. The two of you should focus on your schooling and your future careers. Focus on a wedding when you're stable and can afford a nice one! You don't need a ring or a ceremony to know your feelings for each other!   As for me, I'm hopeless, so I have to live vicariously through you. 
Btw yeah 20 is too young and 3 months is literally nothing. Think before you do something you might regret. 
Congratulations dude! I just proposed to my girlfriend 2 days ago and even just bought her a ring today, intended on "just looking" lol 
So OP answered every "congrats" comment and none of the "be careful, you're only 20 and been only dating for 3 months" comments. He's either gonna come back to this topic in years with a "yup, should've listened" face or "f*** all of you, in yo face" face.. 
Cool. Asking the father for permission always seemed demeaning and insulting to me, though. Like, what if he says no? It's not like that's going to stop you, so you're not even really asking. Plus the idea that a woman is her father's property seems pretty outdated. I sure as hell didn't ask my wife's dad. He's cool, but that decision ain't his to make! ;) 
My husband and I only dated for a few months before we had the marriage talk. Although I knew long before then he was my one. Congrats! 
congratulations! how did you know that she's the one? :) 
Marriage is quite the journey. I'll have my 6 year wedding anniversary in a few months, and I wouldn't trade it for the world. 
My grandpa saw my grandma for the first time when she was like 9 or 11, and he instantly told his brother that he was going to marry her one day. They didn't even meet, he just saw her from afar. They later dated and married, but he knew from the instant he saw her. They made it almost 60 years together before he passed, and had one of the most admirable relationships I've ever seen.   A teacher I had in high school had married his wife after something like 3 months of knowing each other, maybe less, and at the time I knew him, they were beyond 50 years married and he was clearly still head over heels for her.   My point is that while many people don't know very soon that someone is the person to marry, some lucky ones do know, and it lasts and is beautiful. I hope you're one of the lucky ones! 
My parents got engaged at 20 and 21 years old after 6 months of dating. They'll celebrate their 37th wedding anniversary in a few months. It wasn't always easy and it took a lot of work, but they're still madly in love with each other today. Sometimes if you know, you just know.  
I'm not going to say anything about your age, but I will say that you should definitely not make any decisions right after you're deadly ill and she just took you to the hospital. I'm sure she's awesome, but it's a traumatic experience and it's bound to give you both some strong emotions. Get better, and when you're just a normal healthy couple again for awhile, talk about it again to see if you're still in the same place.  
Since you say you're young, consider pre marriage counseling. It helps you discuss your life goals, values, skill sets and preferences which will prevent a lot of arguments later.  
I thought I had mono for a couple weeks. Turns out I was just really bored. 
I was in a very very similar situation (22 y/o with mono, love of my life was with me at the time). Do not waste this oportunity, you WILL regret it.  PS: its been 12 years... Im still kicking myself for not marrying that girl. 
I basically have a couple of bands that coincide with the music we would have sex to in each of my relationships 
That's pretty neat. I've discovered a lot of music through being in relationships. Now there's a lot of bands that reminds me of them when I listen. Sometimes I get sad and become wistful. At least it let's me know that I feel something and I'm alive. It's bittersweet.  
I do something kind of similar, but I make playlists that directly correlate to my life. For example, I have a playlist right now that started back in January and I'll close it at the end of this month. The playlists used to go for a whole year but I started to get into music more and the lists started to get overloaded so I split them into 6 month time frames. When I listen to songs from an old list, it takes me right back to that moment in time. 
Well, my ex introduced me to k-pop and I've been hooked ever since. 
I've got a gorgeous diamond and amethyst necklace, and a stuffed penguin named Frog after the Chrono Trigger character. The relationship ended on good terms - it just wasn't the right time for us to be together, so they are still very special items to me because he was an amazing guy and I wish our time together wasn't cut short due to life and stuff. 
That's cute. I really enjoy music and use it to bond with the people I love. So yeah, I do have periods in my life where I was into different things, say hardcore/punk/r&b/lo-fi/electro (...) all of them I had the privilege of meeting amazing girls and we shared both physical and cultural love. Now I'm waiting for the one that genuinely enjoys bossa nova and phill Collins so I can hopefully marry her :) I've come to terms with myself and not planning to change too much from now on :p 
All the girls i've dated have been absolutely obsessed with Panic at the Disco and Fallout boy and NOTHING ELSE. It's like every part of their minds left the "Rawr xD" phase EXCEPT for the musical taste part of the brain. I tried-- time and time again-- to like those two groups, I really did, but to no avail. This equates to somewhere around 3 years of my life dedicated to attempting to like Panic and Fallout Boy, but I only seemed to dig myself into a deeper grave of hating those bands.  What you will find in my Spotify history is countless hours of music that I attempted to use to combat the emo boys that haunt my dreams. As a result, I've gone through phases of being an indie shitface as well as listening to obsessive amounts of rap. Actually, my musical taste has evolved A TON during this time.  Maybe I need to reevaluate my love life... 
Unfortunately, I had to go through a period of remixes soaked in synth. #redflag  
I've actually noticed the opposite. One of my exes would always be listening to really sad music. Shit that would just make me feel miserable inside. To boot, she already had issues with depression.  Once we were through I began to notice that I don't really listen to anything sad. Sure some of it (mostly classic rock or EDM) could be called moody/reflective for the down times but none of it is outright depressing. I know my collection so well that I can sing just about anything that comes on and it makes me feel really happy when I do.  I think I owe my subconscious for such a positive attitude. Can't imagine what life would be like if I intentionally brought myself down all the time. 
According to my Spotify music, I'm a good mix between "Stuck in the 90s rock" phase and "Getting into strange alternative, indie, and metal music" stage. It's a weird mix of a bunch of different music but nothing from a relationship besides single songs. I'll recognize them when they come on and it reminds me of that person which can be nice sometimes. 
Congratulations and I wish you both the very best in your marriage!  I'm sure the age gap will rub some people the wrong way but as long as you're both happy that's all that matters. At least this has helped you both open your eyes as well to see the people that truly matter in your life. Wish you all the very best.  
Congratulations. If she makes you happy, that's all that matters.  
Jesus Christ who do I read these threads when they just remind me of how lonely I am  
I really don't want to come across as judgey....but 29 and 55? You deserve happiness but man she's going to feel weird in another 10 or 20 years. My SILs ex husband remarried a woman 20 years his junior and she looks young and he looks incredibly aged and feeble. She is not happy and didn't think what it would be like when they got older. She's 40 and he's 60. 
Congratulations my friend, and you're not old; you're only as old as you think you are. I hope you have a lovely wedding and best wishes for your future together!  
Question. Do you think you'll ever love the second wife the same way you love the first who passed?  I always wonder about that. I just got married and I love my wife. It scares me bc if she was gone  not sure she could be replaced which means she is my only shot at happiness and putting that much stock in a person is so scary. Not that I'm going to change anything but it just makes me wonder how you feel about it since you're living it?   
You rich? Sorry I know that's a rude question but I'm so curious 
Congrats! I've been dating guys 15-25 years my senior for a long time, and while I get a lot of flack for it, the people giving me shit I don't nor have ever considered friends, so I've never let it negatively affect me. I'm the same age as your fiancee, and I hope neither of you let other people's negative opinions affect your relationship! 
Congrats!  I, also, had a good outcome today: while at a job fair that was a bit outside my interest but still relevant, one HR rep stepped away to make a call to a colleague because he knew the colleague needed someone with my exact qualifications. Too early to know if it will turn out, but his colleague did say she would get in touch with me. 
Congrats, Hopefully one day, I will be in your position and go to college, happy for ya :) 
Congrats dude! I'm still finishing my first semester but I already know the feeling! Just yesterday I found out I got a 9.7 on my last calculus exam, making my final grade a big ol' 8! Super happy right now, I thought I would never make up for that stinky 4.6 on the second exam. 
Congrats! As a current long time college student, you've passed the first hurdle of college. My first year, I was amazed at all the freedom I had to do whatever I wanted. So amazed in fact, I forgot to do a lot of my work. I'm an A student now, but my first year was not pretty, so good job, friend. You're off to a great start. 
Congrats!! That's amazing news :)   I find out on the 15th my final degree classification, the provision one was a 2:1 so hopefully that stays! Wish I was back in first year like you! Best four years of my life  
Congratulations! I had my second-to-last exam for first year today, not feeling too confident about my grades right now though! Last one is on Wednesday so hopefully that will go well :) 
The only class I had trouble in I did terrible with, but mine came back as well and I passed by .3 points...maaaaybe not as prestigious xd 
Awesome, man! One of the great things about getting good grades is that it keeps a momentum within you to keep getting them.  
Oh wow! I graduated on Friday and about 2 weeks ago got back my last grades of my university career. Good luck with your next 3 years! 
With how little I actually went in I'm just hoping to pass the year, 4/5 passed so far an just waiting on the last module. What uni are you at? 
Congratulations! My first year of college starts in a few months, do you have any tips? 
Great work!  My time at college was tough, but I wouldn't trade it for anything.  As for today: I'm hoping to hear back from more companies about a new job. I got a lead, though. New gig pays a little less than the current, but I hear the team is great, and I'd be working for a nonprofit instead of a money-hungry tech startup that can't sort out its own product, so. 
'grats man! from your post history I see that you're in community mental health, sounds cool! I still have a couple of weeks left in my first year in junior/community college and hope to do well enough these next several quarters to transfer out for my third year. enjoy your summer :D 
This is way too nice, it doesn't seem like Reddit. 
Congratulations! It's a great feeling to have your efforts rewarded. And good on you for taking the time to savour this milestone.  One problem I had in post-secondary (tech college) was constantly focusing on what was ahead, and not appreciating the positive feedback I was getting along the way.  All the best to you in the years ahead. If you're especially lucky, you'll come out the other end with one or more great, lifelong friendships as well. :) 
I'm going to write my exam today. Hope, I can have the same feeling as you  later on.  
Eyyyyyy same here! I'm really happy about my grades this first year. It's gonna make me feel good when they start crashing and falling in the next 4 years (please don't actually happen...) 
Great to hear! I had two big exams yesterday which also went great, so close to being finished completely. 
Congrats! I got my university grades a few days ago aswell and was very pleased with them!  
Congratulations on passing! What kind of thing will you be doing in year 2?   I've just finished my second year of university, and the last two years have just been general arts courses. The next two are English and Creative Writing, so I'm getting quite hyped now. I did my exam a couple of weeks ago, and my results should be in around August. 
Congratulations! My university's honor roll came out last night and I made President's again, and I've been super stoked to tell someone all day! 
Well good news in a different sense, my university acknowledged me dropping out allowing me to finally join my apprenticeship :D 
I kinda see where you are coming from. I once dated a girl I was not all that into at the beginning, but she asked me out so I took her up. She really grew on me. 
Maybe it's your weird self that makes you so attractive. Maybe you have mutually compatible weirdness? 
i am currently with someone that has completely shattered my expectations when it comes to a relationship. it's kind of gross, being able to look back and realize that you've just endured a series of unhealthy relationships, but there you go...two years ago, i didn't think someone like this existed. now, i can't understand how the hell i managed to make it this far without her.   so, yeah. i feel you, OP. congratz. :) 
I'm on the same boat as you rn, only Im still working on the asking out part. Any advice or maybe sharing how you went about it? 
I know how you feel. It's amazing how much positivity one person can  bring into your life isn't it?  
Now you know.  Explaining things like being in love, being a parent - if the person hasn't done it they can't understand. 
Love is a great drug. That is awesome. I remember when I proposed to my  ex wife but then I also remember when she cheated on me. Love is great. I also remember I'm lying because I've never gotten married. Love is great.  
For me it was when I got home from work early and was excited because it meant I had enough time to do laundry.   Conversely, I just accidentally killed my friend's plant I was looking after, possibly because I don't get any direct sunlight in my apartment but I'm not sure, so can I really classify myself as an adult anyway?  
for me its when I start vacuum carpet without anyone told me to do it. Well, I still feel like a manchild most of the time. 
I used to play Harvest Moon on the SNES as a kid and this was me every (in-game) day. 
Soon-to-be-17-year-old here but I'd like to make good use of this thread; any advice for me adults? 
OOOOOOH. You know so many women TRY to get white hair. And to me, there are few things more attractive than an older woman(meaning she has white hair the more typical way) with a nicely styled head of white/silver hair. I think it would look amazing on a younger woman. And hey, if you want to do bright colours, no bleaching! I'm almost jealous :)  
When I was around 4 years old I managed to smash my face and create a quite large scar on my upper lip. That scar was the bane of my existence for a very long time, and when I finally just accepted that it is always going to be there a very large burden was dropped from my shoulders. When you learn to live with and accept things that you can't do anything about, it feels very good! And in all honesty it doesn't affect me in the slightest now, so why should I care about it? 
I hate being that person, but you should post a picture of it. Personally I think white hair looks pretty good on a lot of younger people that dye it that way. 
That's awesome! I am going to stop dying my very long hair shortly so that when I go gray I can just have long gray hair. Don't want to be one of those women with dark hair and all gray roots. 
Do you have vitiligo? It causes stuff like pigment loss. Did you get a bad sunburn when you were a kid? 
Yes. Sometimes you just need to get it out. Bottling things up isn't healthy but we all do it to some degree. We should let ourselves cry more often.  
Every once in a while we find a moment to be kind to ourselves and to love our ourselves.  This was a moment for you. 
I am so jealous of people who live in the part of the world with 4 seasons. Here in South East Asia, either it's raining or hot af. It sucks, i am yet to feel snow for the first time. 
spring. I have no allergy, i can do so many stuff outside. Summer gets too hot after that 
I like autumn.  The searing heat and humidity of summer is finally over, the trees are changing colors, the holidays are on the horizon.  It's the best.  
I'm a big fan of the two weeks of spring we get in the Midwest. Mind you those aren't a continuous two weeks. It's 14 days scattered anywhere between late January and early June. 
Pretty much summer.  A lot of fellow casuals are complaining about it being too hot, but I like it. I like spring too, because I have no allergy and it's still pretty warm outside. Autumn is just boring (but beautiful). And winter may go and kill itself IMO, I absolutely HATE snow. It's just too cold! 
I love late spring. It's got the goodness of summer, but it's not summer. 
I love all the seasons actually.  Cuz I'm really bored in my office here's what I like about each season:  * Winter: I love the snow and love the holidays.  I also love it when we gets lots of snow because I don't have to go to work.  Plus hot cocoa is the shizz.  * Spring: Flowers bloom, the cherry blossom trees bloom, everything comes back to life.  Also the weather is perfect.  Not too hot not too cold.  * Summer: The season of leisure.  Camping, trips to the beach, and drinking beer in the outdoors? Fuck ya bud, sign me up.  Not to mention Halloween is one of my favorite holidays.  * Fall: After getting sun burnt and dehydrated the fall is a good break from that heat.  Plus all the leaves turn into different shades of orange and yellow.  It's so beautiful.  Early fall also has the perfect weather.  
Hi!!! Spring is my favorite because it means winter is over and the sun's out and it gets warmer and everything's growing and there's so many flowers!!!  
I feel you on that one. Autumn is wonderful. I was in Chicago once in October, and the scenery was captivating. I have this daydream where I'm walking down a somewhat busy Chicago street, it's slightly windy, leaves are changing colors in Millennium Park nearby, and I'm sipping on a coffee. I look up at a muted grey sky, take a deep breath, and keep walking. No other season makes me feel that way.  
Fall.   Halloween, NFL, NHL, start of mite hockey leagues, my kids birthdays. It's light jacket weather, the smell of leaves, bon fires, just everything 
I love all seasons except summer. I *hate* summer.   It makes me sick actually, it gets too hot, and I'm gagging and almost vomiting. Cannot find any reason for it.   Fall & winter are my favorite seasons. if I could live in perpetual fall/winter I would definitely do something.   Summer = Hell No.  
For any other confused metric users, I just figured it out. One foot is 12 inches. So 5 feet 8 inches is the same as 4 feet 20 inches.  
What are these measurements translated to a more sane format? :P although that is pretty funny.  
Imagine someone asks "how tall are you?" and you reply with "4/20". Can't imagine the reactions haha.  I'm also 4 feet 20 inches too, and I feel pretty short around other people. By the way, I'm from the Chicago area. 
I didn't buy the Honda extended warranty either. Mostly because I drive alot.  I did ask " Why the extended warranty? Aren't Hondas supposed to be reliable?"  Their response: ummm... yeah..  but you'll feel more at ease! 
Fuck I hate dealerships. It sucks they passed laws making it so we have to go through them.  
I made a spreadsheet to calculate lease payments when I went car shopping a few months ago. Boy, did the dealerships hate me lmao 
Dealerships are so irritating with the "Dealer math". We leased a new Nissan for my wife and they insisted that we put another $1000 down cash to "lower the payments $25/month." That worked out to the term of the lease divided by $1000 = $25. Why would I give them $1000 liquid cash up front to save $25 over the course of the lease? I thanked them and said we would just pay the "extra" $25 a month. 
*Yay. I have no idea what brought me to CC, actually, it was such a long time ago.*                                                  *I was studing in school three years ago.  I was a bad student... I still am in school, but now I'm a good student.*                 *I feel like writing poems is the only thing that is making me happy right now, there's a tough period in my life right now, I feel very sad and lonely. But when I write a poem, then all seems a lot better for an hour or so...* 
I stalked a reddit friend and saw she posted in cc... Thought it looked friendly so I started to take part.   3 years ago, I had just finished my dissertation... Now 3 years later I've transitioned mtf. Got an awesome job I love, and things are pretty darn good :) 
Happy birthday CC!  I found this sub about a year ago. I'm not sure how I found it. I've visited it almost every day since! I love being part of such a nice community. 
Happy birthday!  What brings me to CC. Came across it just a day or two ago and thought it seemed pretty cool. Occasionally I find the need to chat but doesn't seem to fit a sub so this should be awesome!   Where was I three years ago? I was in my last year of highschool trying to figure out what to do with my life. Haven't figured that out yet but having fun  What makes me happy? I am just about to start a new ski season and I am super excited to meet new people and make friends from all over the world with a passion for the snow :)  
Happy birthday!  I found this sub clicking RANDOM and was very pleasantly surprised.  Three years ago I was working a job I hated, absolutely hated, and felt like the world was gonna close-in on me and that was it, this is my life. I left that job for a better position, and I still am not super happy with what I do but it's a million times better than where I was, so I'll take it.  Making me happy these days is stuff I do creatively in my own time, trying to get my YouTube channel going, art, writing, whatever - anything I can do to flex my creative muscles. 
I came to CC after it was featured in /r/subredditoftheday.  Same thing we do every day, ~~try to take over the world~~ er, fixing things. Yeah.   Wooo Friday! 
I went to Big Hero 6 by myself, though there were some kids and parents in the room with me, it was mostly me. For the first time I put my feet up and was laughing out loud in public. It became one of my favorite movies simply because I got to see it all by myself. It was one of my only goals to do before I graduated (I was sixteen at the time!) and it's a moment I'll never forget.  
Dude I loved the books as a kid. So many of my childhood favorite books are now movies. Is it any good? 
I'm 28. I went to see Captain Underpants on Sunday with my wife, my mom, my 14 year old cousin, and 6 year old nephew. My wife and my mom could have done without out, but the rest of us loved it. The animation was beautiful (DreamWorks always seems to be top notch) and I loved the references to the original story- especially the flip-o-rama.  
I went to see F8 of the furious with my friends and we had a great time. I'm definetely seing CU along with cars 3 once it comes out in new zealand 
I just went with my co-workers because we all wanted to see it, but none of us were under 30, and we would have felt weird going by ourselves. All of us really enjoyed it. Best idea this week. 
Movies like the new cars and this are for us anyways ;) since we grew up with it. What'd you think of the movie? 
I remember reading the first 5 Captain Underpants books, when I was 13 years old, back in 2001. I might have been a little too "old" for this book series, but that didn't stop me from having fun reading them! :P  I'll probably see this movie, whenever it becomes a rental on Google Play or the PlayStation Store. 
I was reading those books when I was way too old to be reading them. Kind of want to see the movie.  
Thank God for that.   I understand that one sometimes wants to indulge in dumb/childish entertainment but watching Captain Underpants is going too far.  
I have one girl who only ever called when she needed something. I have cut off communication with her for the past couple years. I don't have time for that shit. It would be different if she were at least grateful, but she treated me like shit when we hung out. And now she deals weed and has to attend court-ordered parenting classes and is on 3 year probation. (My sister still keeps in contact with the girl and keeps me in the loop) 
I feel like I'm let down by most of my old high school buddies. After graduation I moved about 4 hours away, nothing too crazy. I'd go visit them and they'd always offer to come see me (I live in a city, they live in the middle of nowhere...there's actually stuff to do where I live) but it would never happen. I got to the point where I just stopped trying & gave up on engaging in the friendship. Now we rarely ever talk and I feel like I'm a lot happier that way...even though I miss them sometimes. I feel like I've moved on with my life & my life has improved so much...but they're still doing the same things. I guess I just outgrew them. I did, however, run into an old high school friend last week while visiting for the day & they've clearly gone down hill...getting in trouble with the law and stuff. Not my style. I'll keep my college friends.  
This happened to me! They messaged me on LinkedIn (I added them because I'm still building my network) and they asked for my number. Didn't think anything of it and gave it to them. Then they text me saying they want to talk to me about a job opportunity since they saw that I'm looking. We arrange a time to talk and when they call they go into this whole pyramid scheme type business they run with their dad, all the while l refusing to tell me the name of it. I told them I wasn't interested as politely as I could and ended it right there 
It sounds like your old high school buddy's life has gone absolutely nowhere since graduation. Pity them for a moment, reflect on all you've accomplished in the past eight years, and move on with your life.  People do have this strange idea that you will forever stay in touch with high school, and even elementary school friends. It just isn't the case as (interesting) people tend to change so much once they hit adulthood.  I am friends with one person from school. I am still the acquaintance of about four or five.  
I've felt like that before. I find that feeling changes when I change my friends. If people don't seem to like you but you don't agree with their criticisms of you, chances are you just need to find people that do think more like you. :) you deserve to be liked, and I'm sure your likers are out there in plenty! 
It sounds like you need new friends. Hi! I'm delibertine.  
I feel that way sometimes, too, but you have to realize that it's most likely an insecurity.  As for your friends ... are they really good for you if they are making you feel like shit?  You should have people you feel comfortable around, that encourage and support you.    If there are positive changes you want to make, start working on yourself.  You'll attract more people into your life, the ones you'll want to keep, by learning to love yourself.   
I'm your opposite: people like me (well enough I guess), but I don't like people much.    
I only care about people who care about me.  It's not worth my time thinking about people who don't like me. I cannot change how they feel about me, and I'm sure as hell not going to change myself to suit them. 
Could be insecurity. You could also just be interpreted as cold and aloof. If you want to change how others perceive you, then you will have to change yourself a bit. I know the cliche is to just "be yourself", but if that's what you've been doing all along and you don't see the results you want, then perhaps it's time to address what's causing it. 
Back in the 5th grade I made friends with a guy named Tyler. He turned out to be one of the best friends I've ever made. But on the flipside, anytime he introduced me to one of his friends, they always ended up hating me for one reason or another.  The most memorable of which was Chris, who also happened to be the first of his friends who introduced to me. Long story short, we visited him on his grampa's farm, he was hostile to me for no particular reason, and he started a fight with me. I whacked him with a stick, and Tyler and I walked home. 
I used to want everyone to like me. This was high school me. I've done a lot of growing up since then and one of the biggest changes I made was living a life where I only want certain people to like me. My friends, family significant others, etc.   It's exhausting *trying* to get people to like you. Kinda like dating, but that's a different story. Point is I only want a few people to care about and I feel much better living this way. I'd rather have a small network of people I can rely on than be in slightly good graces with lots of people. Worrying about people you barely know just seems unfair to yourself. Like, why should they get to put a debbie downer in your day? Who are they to you? No thanks. Life's too short for that. This is how I feel. Maybe it would help you too? 
I'm a bit late late here, but yes, I feel like that a lot.  I think one of the guys I play volleyball with is a pretty good example, especially about why I'm wrong. On the court, if he has the chance he'll place himself next to me in the lineup, when we just play for fun he'll try to set when it's my turn and he'll step in and take the dig from me. I felt like he was trying to push me off the team.   I was gearing up to confront him about it while walking to the train station one day, but didn't get around to it before he thanked me for helping him with the blocks and spiking for him, he felt like we'd become a duo on the court covering each other's weak points and both playing better for it... Turns out I'm a good friend of his, who helps with the things he can't.   Different perspectives  
Someone who criticizes you all the time is not your friend.     If you are introverted and/or shy, many people will take you to be cold, and you won't make friends quickly. But the friends you DO make, the REAL ones, will truly appreciate you.     If you want to make more friends, two strategies that can work:        - Get involved in more activities that you truly enjoy or would like to try and that involve other people. For shy people, it's easier to meet while doing something rather than just going to parties or bars where the only activity is social interaction (at which we don't tend to be very good.)       - Read and practice the advice in the book: "How to Make Friends and Influence People." It's a classic self-help book that's been in print for f**king ever because the principles in it are simple and effective.  
These comments are risky not just for speech of eating babies. Which I don't do!  
I do feel like you, I have just about 5 people around me that I even talk to, then there is that girl at my school, that I don't even talk to, that for some reason hates me so much, I don't know why, maybe cause I am just ugly? 
My friends and family seem tolike me despite me being a horrible douche. Whenever I meet someone new and try to befriend them (important to note that I'm horrible at human interactions), however, I'll get almost exclusively negative responses, even before my sonofabitchery is revealed.  Maybe this friend of yours is not too patient, or is just snob. If you are nice to others, you'll eventually find good people who will appreciate it. 
you are good no worries - do not let them make you feel bad  
I'm in a small school with 37 kids in my grade. Let's just say I don't have the best rep. Sadly, I am no longer trusted with secrets, and it's pretty fucking hard to gain trust once you've lost it. I'm getting there (and since summer is here I hope a fresh start next year). Most people don't like me because I'm a bit pretentious- I know that.  Just hang in there, and relax for the summer. I'm making a big change and cutting ties with a person I like. 
In my environment, I don't really feel anything like that around my friends or people. However, in online world, being nice somehow attracts trolls. 
I have similar thoughts, when I am alone a person I connect very well, we talk about personal things and conversation is full of jokes and puns, but in a group I don't connect with anyone even if is the same people.  
Just my .02 but the times in my life where I have felt people didn't like me were times where I really didn't like myself. The more I pursued things that made me happy the more I attracted positive interactions with others.  
I feel like most people don't like me either. Not that they dislike me, I meet a lot of people and they always say 'she's such a nice girl' but then I fail to move to deeper connections past that most of the time.  My close friends are people I've studied or worked with so we've been together daily for months and then became friends because they got to know me over time and I could open up properly.  I think the answer to that is make friends through shared interests, do a class, join a sport, do sth that will put you in the same space as people who like the same things for a longer period so they get to know you better.  Also get rid of the one who criticises you. If they don't want to be friends with the person you are then part ways respectfully. 
this happens to everyone.... Time will heal it. You jus need to be patient.  
Just a glass half full perspective here:  It seems to me that you are significantly more successful in one way or another in your friend circle. Try to find out what that x-factor is and make it better.   Also you have to learn to take  criticisms  from those around you and filter the constructive ones from them.  
Not sure how old you are but I realized that the older I got, the less tolerant I became of "little" things.  I still have close friends but spending too much time with them makes it easy to become a little too liberal in what I say/think about them.  We all have life hitting us and don't put up with much.  Once you have a spouse, kids, maybe a dog, how likely are you to put up with your friend chewing too loud when you're trying to relax.  Haha maybe not the best example but hope you know what I mean. 
If you want to be more likeable you have to learn to be more outgoing. Or find people with similar introverted interests.   I'm in a boat where I'm not necessarily likeable, but people either love me or hate me, because in pretty blunt and sarcastic, but also genuine and transparent. So people who can't take the bluntness cause they're used to lies and flattery think I'm mean when I'm just honest.   You would need to do a similar introspection, try and identify why it is you find people don't like you, do they get mad, bored, sad, annoyed, grossed out? Etc.  Also feeling like nobody really likes you is depression 101. 
I used to think I didn't like people, but the truth is that I seem to like all people and want to know more about them. It's highly unlikely that people don't like you, and that you just might be a little unapproachable or distant. Try opening up a little, I'm sure good things will happen :) 
I don't know. You'll have people who like you, and there are some that don't just for no reason. Only thing you can do is be the best you you can be and keep it movin. 
I'm probably similar to you in the way I act.  Though, I'd say I'm far more unlikable.  But people tend to like me.  People even claim to be really close to me to other people, as if I'm someone to show off.  I hate this.  In fact, I don't really like people, and I have very few actual friends.  Sometimes I consider why people like me, and I think it's because I'm genuine.  I'm honest, I'm straight forward, and I don't BS.  This comes off as pretty harsh often, and I'm not saying everyone likes that - but too many people do for my comfort.    My advice to you is to always be yourself, don't compromise to make friends, speak  your mind, and stop caring how others might perceive you.  
I hope your day gets better OP. :)   I hope tomorrow is better too - with a bunch of puppers licking your face and cuddling you until your heart is content.  
Have you seen the life of brian?  Look up the crucifixion scene.  It will cheer you up. 
Why was it a rough day (assuming you want to talk about it)? Anything we can do? 
Woah, those are great! If I wasn't a poor college student I'd definitely buy one of those!   You could commission sculptures, you definitely have the talent, I'm sure there's a demand out there for it somewhere. 
If I were closer to Seattle, I'd definitely work with you to promote your work! I think if you develop a very polished website and marketed your services as high-end sculpture, or even produce a 2-3 minute interview style video that showcases your process and share that around, you would absolutely drum up business. Just need to find the right clients, but Seattle seems like prime real estate for this sort of marketing to me!  
Beautiful art! Have you tried selling your work at art fairs? 
There are time where I am proud of the things I've fabricated. Then I see shit like what you do and renounce my pride. Those railings are awesome, and  the sculptures are top notch. 
You mentioned doing a children's book or graphic novel like the Tuscaloosa piece; that would be really cool. I don't know if anybody has done something like that before. Where does your interest in graphic novels/children's books come from? 
Hey :P Its night here and there is very bad lighting for scenery but I'll definitely do this for ya noonish tomorrow :P  Also just wanted to shout out /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/ If he ever needs a meal post over there for us; lots of kind hearts on reddit don't be afraid to reach out.  RemindMe! 12 Hours

I tried to take a photo with the message just a moment ago,it didn't turn out good at all,so I will wait until tomorrow morning to get a better shot of scenery outside my window (with the message of course!)

Thank you so much for taking the time to write this. I'm having a particularly hard day and your comment brought out the first smile of the day.  
You should get her number so you can text/ask her out! Most interesting place I met someone was on an Internet forum... I drew her and she was so intrigued she gave me her number. That was five years ago and we are still very close. 
Sounds like you are living in a really cheesy romantic comedy :P 
Yesterday, I passed by a cute girl on the street. Normally I look down at the ground and avoid eye contact but I took a shot this time by looking at her and smiling. She immediately smiled back, looked me up & down, and continued to smile as she walked passed me.  What a feeling that was... Pure elation. I'll never see her again but that moment is a Huge confidence booster for me. 
That sounds like the opening to a movie haha. I once drove six hours to a concert, wemt to the show, slept at a hotel then drove back six hours. When i got home I was hungry so I ordered some food to pick up. I was wearing the shirt of the concert I just got back from, i go into the store to pick up my food and while waiting in line a voice asks me if I saw the band the night before. I said I did and she was at the concert too. Crazy. We chatted a little about music but then I got my food and got out of there.   Venmo id: Ven-MoOnedollar Total raised: $3 
Lol at a Spirit Halloween store. I was there with a few of my male friends and I noticed one of the cashiers was super friendly with me and would sort of go out of his way to help me. I ended up asking him out for a date and he said he'd been trying to work up the courage to ask me! Went on a date, it unfortunately didn't work out, but was still the most interesting way I met someone. Lol  
See, that's the best way to do it. You surprised even yourself. Can't accidentally spoil the surprise if you don't even know about it!  
This is a freaken amazingly fantastic thing. Hopefully he understands affection with Acts of Service... :) I know I would remember this for decades if someone did this for me. It's actually been a hope of mine to have basically this exact thing happen to me, for years now. 
This is like the happiest thing on Reddit I've read in a long while.  You should sooooo value that you have a relationship like that.  I can really imagine the loving energy in your home and that's so special.  I'm so glad you could pull it off and have so much fun together.  
Why was the cake made up to look like a redfish?  VERY cool of you to pull this off for him! 
I usually get over my shyness by utilising a mild existential crisis about my place in the universe and the mortality of life.  You could also try practising what you'll say in a mirror beforehand.  If all else fails, flee to Alaska, change your name, and get a dock job helping unload fishing trawlers.  
As a guy, I'd love it a girl was flirting/asked me out in the gym. A lot of the time, we're expected to make the first move and that gets so draining.  He'll probably be super flattered. Have you talked to him before, or just been checking him out? 
There's only one thing you'll regret. You'll regret what you never did and could do if you just talked with her.  If you talk with her and nothing came out of it, at least you tried and you won't feel bad about it 
You should just go up to him!   I have a small crush on one of the employees of the gym I go to. I get way too self conscious at the gym to actually approach girls. I look around at all the dudes with hulking muscles and just go "Yea there is no point in trying."   I guess what I'm trying to say is maybe he feels similar, so if you went up to him it might make things easier. 
Don't worry man, it'll come evantually. It took me like 8 months before I talked to my crush even once, second time coming soon I hope/think since we did greet each other when we randomly came across each other (this sounds so pathethic haha) 
You should do it so you can post an update here! Homework :D 
Fuck, well that sucks. Hope a Co-worker shows and you don't have your front door locked. 
Why not call the apartment complex? They should have a copy of your key in the leasing office.  
The sound is made when your finger hits your palm, not the fingers rubbing each other. You're just trying to build up tension so your middle finger hits you palm quickly.  
'bout to go home and enjoy my weekend. Fuck yeah!  Is there skin glue? 
Imagine the people that made the documentary about glue 
I do. Especially when I see peaceful and remote looking cabins on r/cozyplaces but then I start thinking of bugs and spiders and bears. I think I'd like a vacation somewhere like that though 
The grass is always greener. I've lived in rural areas all my life and all I want is to move to a big city, live in a tiny apartment, and see everything the world has to offer.  Cabins in the woods are fun, but I've had that opportunity most of my life. It usually weighs me down after a couple of days. 
How in the fuck was PresidentObama not already taken? 
What are you going to do to end the corrupting influence of money in politics during your second term?  
Mr. President, do you feel that there is a problem with the "revolving door" of congressmen and prominent lobbyists? For an example, I'd point to former Senator Dodd, now the chief lobbyist for the MPAA. Is there anything to be done about it? 
What was the most difficult decision that you had to make during this term?

Coming up: Tactful avoidance of marijuana questions and disappointment from /r/trees.  
It's been stated that your favorite television show is The Wire. How do you think the war on drugs has affected America, and would you work to end it? 
My question is this: Why would you sign the NDAA when it included language that would allow the indefinite detention of Americans without due process. I understand that this was the de facto case for awhile. Now it's law. This passed by overwhelming bi-partisan support, despite being hated by most citizens. It feels like the government, including the Executive branch, no longer work for the citizens that elect them. (By the way, I fully supported your first campaign, but I'm now disillusioned and disappointed.) 
What is the first thing you'll do on November 7th, win or lose?

Let's skip the marijuana legalization question that'll show up at least 50 times on this page and get to a related issue: After promising that you wouldn't interfere with individual state decisions on medical use of cannabis, how can you justify utilizing federal funds and agencies to shut down dispensaries and arrest people who are legitimately sick?

Why aren't you more actively fighting RNC voter suppression? 
I have an 11 year old and a 13 year old child. I currently pay more for them to go to private school for one year than I paid for my entire master's degree.   What can you do to heal our very broken public school system (which I want to love)? What can I expect for them when they go to college in a few short years?  
Is there anything going to be done about the current state of student loans? 
What is the plan for Gitmo Bay? and for marijuana legislation?  
Do you remember the last time a fired Reddit employee did an AMA? I highly suggest she take all this online goodwill and get a high paying, lucrative PR job.  
Her doing an ama would unleash more popcorn than when the last employee got fired  
Holy shit that was fast. I totally support this request. Maybe she can get help from Victoria :) 
I doubt that she will. I'll bet that when she signed her contract to work for reddit she signed a non-disclosure agreement or something of that nature which prohibits her from discussing her firing.  
She almost certainly has a confidentiality agreement 
What the fuck?! I leave for 3 hours and this has dropped from 10k votes to 5k?  Uhm... something's fishy, here. 
Holy shit...14532 and 97% upvoted  Never thought I'd see that unless Snowden and Assange announced they were getting married.  
I just want her to do an AMA so we can salute her   o7 
Now do one for the creator of secret santa too. It's not just Victoria. Reddit wants to gut the heart of the company apparently. Apparently having a popular site isn't enough for them, and so they want the real fans that helped build the site, get stepped on until they fall in line.  
Guys, can we please stop buying Reddit Gold for a day. I feel like that'll make more of statement than the blackout bullshit. That money goes to support Reddit's higher ups.  
Why the hell would she want to come back to add publicity to the site she got fired from? And why would we want to demean her by asking her to do that? 
If you are very interested in seeing this happen, consider posting in /r/IAmARequests and offering Reddit Gold for contacting this person and arranging the AMA! Your request will have a better chance at being fulfilled than just being posted here! And if you do post in /r/IAmARequests, make sure to tag your request with [Reward] if you're offering one, or [No Reward] if not.

1. Why are you so awesome? 2. Will you be my friend? 3. Considering all you have done to help the reddit (AMA), community, how would you like to see the sub evolve, grow, or change (or not)? 4. Coke or Pepsi? 
What was the process in order to actually ask the candidates your question? Did you sign a form, request using email yada yada yada.

What has been the strangest thing someone tweeted at you in the wake of the debate? 
Is the best part of this whole ordeal the karma from this post? 
How did you get selected to be in the debate audience? 
Are you looking forward to your impersonation on SNL?

Ken,  If you were president, what steps would your energy policy take to meet our energy needs while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job layoffs? 
What did Bill Clinton say to you after the debate? 
Ken, both your Twitter & Reddit handles end in the number 18...    Does the number 18 hold any personal significance to you? 
How soon after the debate did you realize you were a meme? How did you find out?

Bone Dawg! I'm a struggling, drained medical student. Can you give me your best pep talk?  
Hey Ken! I'm a huge fan and fellow Missourian. I'm so happy that you asked legitimate questions about the environment and brought a lot more happiness to the debate. You're a national treasure and I legitimately want to bake a cake for you and your wife. My question is: how did you meet her? Thanks for making the world a little bit nicer! :) 
You seem like a nice guy, but I've heard speculation that you are bad to the Bone? Thoughts? 
Some people have said they want to write you in for president. If this were to actually happen, what would President Bone's first action be? 
The minute I saw you with the mic, I thought, "the internet is going to go nuts over this guy."  How's fame treating you so far?  Also, what kind of cat do you have?

Ken what is the best time to wear a striped sweater?

Thanks again for bringing so much joy during this time that has been very annoying, difficult, etc.  You have handled it great and brought a lot of fun to the election 
How long have you had your mustache? Have you ever experimented with other facial hair-styles? 
What led to you asking about the environment? Is that your biggest concern with these candidates or did the topic just feel unaddressed? 
I'm a former Scientologist and Sea Org member. I was raised in Scn and joined the SO as a 15-year-old girl and was in for six years. I'm still dealing with the effects of the abuse I endured in the SO. I just want to say thank you for being brave and outspoken. I feel like even when people are rightly negative about Scn, they still don't really get it, and it's difficult to talk about. So, thank you for doing what you're doing, and for being an example for someone that gets it.  What has helped you get through the leaving process and the intimidation from the church?   
Is it true they record your meetings and blackmail you with the recordings? 
If all Scientology's secrets were revealed tomorrow, which do you think would be most shocking? 
Are you still in contact with any friends that are still part of the church?   
When you were a scientologist did you ever get any weird reactions from other famous people? 
Was there a secret group of people or friends you had in the church that doubted it? Or did you feel alone. 
Do you think there are members of the cult of Scientology reading this AMA? 
How are they able to recruit intelligent people into what appears to be an obvious scam and cult?  
Considering that Scientology is consistently painted in such a negative light how did you maintain the commitment to Scientology for so long? 
What is something the average citizen can do to help prevent Scientology growth? 
Do the higher ups know it's a scam or do they really believe this crap? 
Was there a single breaking point that convinced you to leave the church? Or was it a long term struggle with the decision?    
Over the past 10 years, I've seen my parents get deeper and deeper into Scientology. Decent reasoning, science and logic have done nothing to convince them to question the church. From someone who left, is there anything a loved one can do to help a brainwashed member see the truth, without ruining the relationship completely? 
Are people actively being held prisoner against their will?        If so, how upsetting is it that the government and law enforcement does not act? 
What odds do you give of the whole thing collapsing once Miscavige dies? 
do you remember what your initial reaction was upon first seeing the course materials for OT3? 
I've been a huge fan since the early days of KoQ  (was watching at 11, now 24!). Did you ever find that your religion interfered with your work in a way you would turn town any potential jobs, either for your own religious reasons or advice received from members? 
Why do you think there are so many people in the entertainment industry in the religion? 
What do members actually gain from being a member? How is it made worth all the money and time they invest? 
Are there any sexual malpractices that occur in the church? 
Do you personally feel like you're being watched/tracked/etc by the church for doing everything your doing? 
How do the powers that be in Scientology keep their followers from reading anti-Scientology news, or your book? Why don't more scientologists leave?  
Have any other actors come to you for support or help? 
You are so brave for telling the truth about Scientology. Why are so many other people staying quiet? What can we do to help? 
I guess I have two questions. First, a little context:       Years ago a family friend's wife started getting into Scientology. She started doing the therapy and seemed to be doing really well for a while. After a year or so she started getting really strange about normal human/bodily functions. She started talking about how going to the bathroom was "unclean," sex was "disgusting and unnatural" and stopped sleeping. Eventually a church official came to her husband's house and explained that she needed to go away to get better. They took her somewhere but wouldn't allow her family any contact. About six months later she died wherever they brought her and the church release her body sans autopsy to the family for burial.     So here they are:       1. What could the religion have done to make her lose like that?     2. Where would the church have taken someone in her condition? 
What's is the single most horrible thing you encountered in the ""church""? 
How different would you say your view of Hollywood is now compared to when you were on Saved by the Bell and did your experience with Scientology effect these views versus if you never joined them?  
What is your overall opinion on organized Religion now? Did your view on say Christianity change? 
From what I've seen of Scientology, it seems like there is a major difference in treatment between celebrity "followers" and folks in Sea Org who are tortured, locked in the Hole, beaten publicly by Miscavige, etc.   Did the news of this mistreatment find its way to celebrities and general "members" of the Church who weren't in Sea Org?  Or were people left completely in the dark? 
As a psychologist, I am curious what you observed as mental health 'treatment' with Scientology?  In addition, I am aware the 'church' is against psychology; how was this opposition demonstrated within or by the 'church'?  Finally, in your opinion how prevalent are mental health difficulties with the Scientology community?  Thank you for your time. 
Did being a Scientologist help your acting career?  
We can (almost correctly) assume that celebrities receive special treatment because of their status - could you elaborate more on that? For instance, how would your experiences in the church differ from someone who is not a celebrity?  And a follow up - do you think that more celebrities would like to break free from the church but are afraid because of the repercussions? Is there any merit to the claim that there's so much dirt on them that could be exposed that they may not want to leave?  Hope you convince others to follow your path! 
What was the first red flag you noticed about Scientology? 
Are you an theist now or does another religion seem more appealing? 
Goddamn this post has gotten over 5000 dislikes in the past few hours, this was over 12k upvote at 5:00.  Major shout out to Leah for putting herself out here to answer are questions, and anyone who is down voting, why?  Scientologists who follow their doctrine should not be on this site, so I am assuming mist of the down votes are other people.  How do you feel on this issue? What do you agree/disagree with? 
Former Sea Org member in recovery here. What do you hope to accomplish with your expos'e?  Edited to thank some kind people for PM's and also to thank the angry people that doubt me. The fact is I'm telling the truth, but wish I wasn't. I was born into a church that ruined my family, took many of my good years, and hard earned cash. Believe what you will. 
So, Xenu. When do you first learn about him when you join the church? 
Hi Leah, What are your thoughts on Louis Theroux's recent ' My Scientology Movie'?  
In Germany many schools make scientology a topic in school (mostly in social studies, religious education or ethic class) and try to teach children about the risks - often by inviting people who left scientology.  Is there anything similar in the US and would you think it is a good way to avoid getting into scientology?  About 20 years ago we had a woman in school who did a lecture about scientology. She left the church and talked about how scientology went after her for about a year. They sent people to her family telling them what a bad person she was and she had guys in cars following her everywhere she went until she got help from the police - happened in Germany in the 90s.  It helped me a lot to understand scientology as an organisation and it's often compared with the propaganda and influence of the nazis on the German youth back in the 1930s. 
What drew you to Scientology in the first place? Or rather, why did you stay with the church for so long? 
Do you ever disguise yourself and just walk around incognito? 
If you could give 19 year old Bill Gates some advice, what would it be? 
I am sure you have traveled to all types of famous places.  Do you have a favorite vacation spot?  
What kind of technological advancement do you wish to see in your lifetime? 
Hi Bill, what's the biggest 1st world problem you get?  
What do you think is the most pressing issue that we could feasibly solve in the next ten years? 
If you could create a new IP and business with Elon Musk, what would you make happen?  
Why do you think our healthcare systems have such a hard time leveraging the revolutionary changes in scalability that we've seen in software?  Amazon is able to predict what we want, often before we realize we want it, but healthcare systems struggle to even schedule routine appointments and labs.   Having worked on both the healthcare and tech sides, I think people underestimate just how big the differences are between the two fields, but I have a hard time saying who needs to bend more for us to reach a happy compromise.  Also, any idea on what we as concerned patients and family members can help to encourage this compromise?  I just feel like we're so close to using technology to improve efficiency and thus increase accessibility to care.      Thanks for your time! 
Mr Gates!   Any thoughts on the current state of the U.S.?  
Hi Bill,  I'm going to become a father this summer.  Do you have any advice you wouldn't mind sharing, from one dad to a dad-to-be?  Thanks! 
Hi Bill. How often do you get to cook a meal for yourself? 
Hey Bill, have you considered running for president in 2020? 
Mr. Gates,  What's your biggest flaw? I get asked this all the time in job interviews and it seems like a trap of a question. 
Mr. Gates, how do you feel about President Trump and his views on global climate change? 
Dear all,  how can we make sure that people still want to leak important information when everyone who does so puts the rest of their lives at stake? 
Laura, in your recent interview with David Carr, you expressed your commitment as an artist to convey the emotions you feel as a target of state surveillance. Do you also consider yourself a journalist? If so, do you think there is a tension between artistic expression and journalistic integrity?   I also would like to thank you for a wonderful film, Glenn for your commitment to no-bullshit and adversarial journalism, and Ed for having the courage to do what was right. We are all in debt to you.  
Hey everyone - thanks for the questions, I really enjoyed it. Sorry, but I have to run. Hope to be back soon! 
Laura: Will you release more footage of the meetings held with Snowden in Hong Kong? 
/u/PresidentObama do you have anything you want to ask? 
Edward, a friend of mine works for the NSA. He still actively denies that anything you have done or said is legitimate, completely looking past any documented proof that you uncovered and released.    Is this because at lower levels of the agency, they don't see what's going on in the intelligence gathering section? Or do you suspect he simply refuses to see any wrongdoing by his employer? 
Very exciting to see you here Mr Snowden.  We've now known about the scary stuff happening at the NSA for quite some time. And yet from what I've seen, there's been no real effort to stop it.  What are your thoughts on what we, as regular citizens, can do now? 
Mr Snowden, do you feel that your worst fear is being realized, that most people don't care about their privacy? 
I have a filmmaking question for Laura. I'm sure this was probably answered in an interview somewhere, but what kind of legal issues did you run into with this film if any? Was there ever the threat of the footage being seized at customs? 
Mr. Snowden: what was the last thing you did as a "free man" before you had to go on the run?  
Laura Poitras- Loved the film. Saw it when it came to a theatre in a nearby town. Any hints on when it may be available on BluRay? I'll be recording this on my DVR this evening, but would still love to own a copy.  Laura Poitras, Edward Snowden, and Glenn Greenwald - Thank you all for the work on the film and thank you Mr. Snowden for coming forward! 
As the longest serving independent in congress, what are your thoughts about electoral reform in the United States? Would you support a single transferable voting system for congress that would allow smaller parties to compete? And what are your thoughts on reforming (or doing away with altogether) the Electoral College? 
As a soon-to-be defending doctoral student in biophysics I am increasingly concerned about the state of scientific research in the U.S. How do you intend to improve funding security for research labs and keep our research competitive with the rest of the world? Do you have any specific plans for NIH and NSF budgets?  Additionally, poor understanding of science among the general population is impairing our ability to pass essential environmental legislation and provide accurate science education in schools. What will you do to improve scientific literacy in this country? 
If you win in 2016, what will your first dispositions be? 
Do you think that wiretapping of American citizens is necessary for security of America and Americans? 
What is your opinion about possible US ground military operation in the Middle East against ISIS or Bashar Asad in Syria? 
Senator Sanders,   As a young political science student it seems many of my peers are feeling increasingly disenfranchised from politics as a whole, particularly due to increasing corporate influences in politics.  But realistically what can be achieved when these interest are so intertwined with current political campaigns and current issues? Is there a way to separate these interests within a political system that seems to depend on the very same interests?   Also is it seems many Americans have a negative knee-jerk reaction to social democracy ideals, even if they may be beneficial to our society. Do you think there is a way we can discuss these issues that can bring in more people to the conversation?  Thank you for taking the time to do this AMA senator. 
Hello Senator Sanders,  What is your stance on Universal Basic Income(UBI)? If in favor how do you see the United States progressing towards realizing UBI? If against, what alternatives come to your mind for combating rising inequality and poverty in the United States? 
**Why are you guys buying Senator Bernie Sanders reddit gold? Why not consider donating that few bucks to his campaign? It's far more meaningful and useful.**     Lol, smart ass gold. First time I've seen that.  
Bernie,  I feel many voters in my age bracket (18-30) will strongly support your campaign. With the exception of first-time voters, many of my peers in this age bracket feel burned by false promises and unrealistic expectations established during President Obama's campaign.   With this in mind: What, **specifically**, do you feel you can **realistically** accomplish in your first term as President that my age bracket can get excited about? You've been outspoken about supporting a $15 minimum wage, progressive tax reform, single-payer health care, and elimination of higher education tuition fees; do you feel like you have the ability to **realistically** bring one or more of these ambitions to fruition if elected president?  Thank you for taking the time to do this AMA. I look forward to supporting your campaign. 
Hi Mr. Sanders,  When Obama first campaigned, he brought a lot of optimism and many voters truly believed that he had good intentions of being a different kind of politician than we had become used to. So, if you win, what will be different that will allow you to get done what is best for the country and not fall in line like other candidates? 
What is the most useful thing we can do to benefit your campaign besides donating money? 
Hi Bernie, hispanic college kid here, thanks so much for doing this AMA... Two quick questions!  1. Do you approve of the way the USA is handling their relationship with Latin America currently? Considering recent trade deals, the drug wars amongst other things have been hurting the region, do you think there is any way of changing the way the US relates itself to Latin America for a more mutually beneficial relationship?   2. What is your opinion on the fact that the DNC has scheduled only six debates for the primaries? Since it's important to get the issues out there and get yourself to be known by the people, do you think six debates are enough? And if not, is your team working on making sure there are more? 
Senator Sanders,  I am a transgender US Army Soldier with a decade of service. A recent study revealed that there are approximately 15,500 transgender personnel currently serving in the US Military. Current Department of Defense policies prevent us from serving openly, but the policy is under review.  What are your thoughts regarding transgender rights generally, and open transgender military service specifically?   
Senator Sanders, as a Conservative I can say with conviction that I admire your authenticity and dedication to principles, notwithstanding the fact I don't agree with a great deal of your policy proposals. My question to you, sir, is approximately how much money will your spending policies (infrastructure / free tuition, etc.) add to our nation's debt?  Does the potential for increasing our already staggering deficit concern you? 
Hello!  Thanks for doing this AMA, and for all you do in office.  With your presidential bid becoming official I've started to sense some measure of hope returning to this country.  Win or lose, you're doing great things.  Please do keep it up.   There's been a lot of talk lately about your stance on gun control, all of which has been sensationalized to the point of complete confusion.  Can you outline your general views on gun control for us?  Be as specific as you like, I'd just like to get something that hasn't gone through the media's spin factory.  Thanks! 
If you get elected president, what is your plan for NASA? 
Hi Chef, Are there any really strange food combinations that you enjoy?   
Have you ever literally gotten sick from a horrible hotel in Hotel Hell? 
Do ALL the kids on Master Chef Junior really know the techniques off the top of their head for every challenge, or do you give them a quick overview/rundown before the challenge starts. For instance the crouqembouche challenge? 
Hello Gordon. I'm a big fan.  Two questions:  You obviously have a talent for witty insults. Do they come naturally or do you think about them and then say to yourself: "I'm gonna use this one next time I get angry"?  Also, after watching your show I want to try jellied eel. I'm going to London in a few days, any recommendation about where to have it?  Thanks! 
Do you have any food recommendations for a college student on a budget? 
Hi Chef, I'd like you know how you got into running and triathlons?  
Hello, Gordon! I'm very excited you're doing an AMA!  Regarding food, what guilty pleasure do you have that most people would be shocked at? Fast food fries, frozen fish sticks, etc.  Mine is spaghetti in a can. It's repulsive and I know I shouldn't eat it, but I can't help it. 
Hi Gordon,   The F Word is one of my favorite shows of all time. It taught my wife and I how to cook great food and be smart about it. We also loved all of the adventures and animal raising that happened throughout the series. Thank you for that.   My question: outside of your own restaurants, where are some of your favorite places to eat? What dishes do you order? 
Good afternoon, Chef. Do you have a favorite cocktail? 
Hi Gordon! I'm a huge fan of yours, and enjoy watching all of your shows. I especially enjoyed your 'Home Cooking' series, and I want you to know that they sparked an interest in cooking for me that I'll never forget.  Anyway, on to my question:  What is the best meal you have ever had? And what about the worst?  Thanks! 
Hello Mr. Ramsay!  My question is this: How do you feel about being a meme on the internet?  
What are the odds of you and Anthony Bourdain getting drunk together and arguing over what the best omelette is on YouTube? 
Did you like Walt Disney World when you started this job? Do you still like it? What's your favourite thing at the parks that isn't around any more? 
Do you prefer parents playing it straight or interacting with you "in character" so to speak? 
What's the strangest thing you saw in the back of house areas? 
What is the weirdest request that a visitor ever asked you to do? 
You said at one point you worked in merchandise. Would that possibly be in the Magic Kingdom side? There is one older gentleman Bud, who changed my life. He held me while I cried and he cried with me about me recently deceased son. If he is one that you keep in touch with please let him know how thankful I was for him that night. He saved me.   
Are the stereotypes about people who play different characters true? 
Any good stories of playing Goofy around the time "A Goofy Movie" came out?  Bonus question: Have you ever met Powerline? 
Could you speak to people while in costume? Can you do a good goofy voice impersonation?  
What's the worst child/adult tantrum you've witnessed? 
I know this is going to get buried, but that's me and my sister in the photo you posted playing before the parade. That picture would have been taken in 1996. Will post proof if I can find another image of my 10 year old self.  It really is a small world after all.  
Is it true that someone gets fired if two of the same characters appear in the same area of the park? 
What is the weirdest story of one of your coworkers getting fired? What did they get fired for? 
Don't know if it was you or not, but my 2 year old son was terrified meeting the characters. He wouldn't get near you guys for a picture but when goofy played peek-a-boo with him from a distance he loved it and talked about it for months. So thanks Goofy!   Did you have any other favorite techniques for dealing with reluctant or scared little dudes? 
Do you smile in the costume when you're taking photos with other people? 
What is the worst thing that you ever saw happen to a guest at Disney? 
Hi, thanks for the AMA!  Has a cast member's head (or glove/shoe/something) ever fallen off while out in the park? How does WDW deal with that if it happens?  Also, can you talk about the process to learn to do Goofy's signature? I guess I've never compared them across multiple members but are the signatures standardized and do you have to have your ability to sign as your character tested in any way? 
I don't know if you'll read this, but Disney *lost* an irreplaceable asset when they fired you.  The person that fired you, *hurt* the company.  Would you consider going back there?  Surely, someone at Disney could reinstate you.  Considering how this has blown up, I can only imagine someone with that ability has read this and is thinking the same thing I am.  I haven't come close to reading all your replies, but 2 of them moved me to tears and I'm not a very big fan of Disney. 
Any cool insider tips you could tell us if we visit the park?  
When I was young I got lost at Disney world and refused to speak to anyone except goofy since he was my favorite and I didn't consider him a stranger. The whole time he stayed in character He ended up finding my Mom for me and it always was a great memory for me. Probably wasn't you but did you ever have situations like that? 
What are some secrets about Disney World logistics that we may not know? 
My daughter was having a tantrum, a character appeared and alleviate d the situation. Is this a coincidence or the patrons being watched that closely? 
Have you ever accidentally given the ol' Goofy Hancock when signing for something out of character? 
Howdy! Thanks for the AMA. My question is: How does one move on after termination from Disney? Can you not work at any other Disney related attraction? What do you do now? 
How does the signature process go? Are you taught the "correct" signature, or does each Goofy have a different one?  Also, how long did it take you to perfect the signature?  
What was the most unintentionally Goofy-klutz moment you've had while working? 
What are the coolest aspects of Disney that a visiter will never see or know about? 
1) How did you get through when you were having bad days but had to keep up a jovial, lovable character?   2) Did you have to keep your "identity" hidden from family/friends or could you openly tell people you played Goofy?  3) Any women/girls try to hit on you while you were in character?  
Goofy! My brother (9 at the time) punched you in the nether regions back in like 2000. We almost had to leave heh Anyway, how often does stuff like that happen? And sorry for my brothers actions! 
How was it bringing in the 737 at the airport?  I'm sure a cool experience since not everyone gets to. I work for an airline and think it's quite fun to do on a daily basis.  
Whats the weirdest/creepiest fan encounter you had? 
What are most of the staff like at Disney World?  I know a woman who uprooted her and her husband's entire lives to move to Florida so that they could work at Disney and fulfil their dreams. Do other staff share that kind of grandiose opinion of the place, or are most people just regular folk doing a job? 
I got lost at Disney World when I was younger.  My parents tell me that Goofy ended up finding me, tying me to a tree and going to fetch the park security and subsequently my family.  Was that you? If so why wouldn't you just take me with you?  Being tied to a tree is very embarrassing for a kid. :D 
I'm leaving for Disney in 48 hours exactly. Any tips or tricks I should know before leaving? 
Do you sometimes wish your fights would last a little longer than just a few seconds? 
Hey Ronda! Two questions:  * What achievement in your life are you the most proud of? * What is your idea of a great date? 
Hey Ronda any chance of you going on the Joe Rogan Experience again?  
If you were to be in a superhero movie, which hero would you play?  Thanks for doing this AMA! 
Hi Ronda,   With your exponential increase recently in exposure and recognition, do you worry about the amount of control that the media has over your image? And have you run into circumstances where you felt you were misrepresented or portrayed inaccurately by the media? 
If you could fight any historical figure, who would it be? 
What's up Ronda!  Who is your favorite Game of Thrones character from the books, and what would your sigil be if you were a character? 
Hey Ronda! Important question here. How many chicken wings can you eat?  
Can you please tell reporters to stop asking you and Dana about Cyborg? It's getting old. I'd be like Marshawn Lynch and just say the same thing over and over, perhaps "Let me know when she's 135." 
Do you ever think 'Finish Her!' in a Mortal Kombat announcer voice when you're taking down an opponent?  In all seriousness, what's your top piece of advice for young (and not so young) women looking to get into MMA or other competitive fighting oriented sports?   
Hi Ronda. I'm a 13 year old girl who loves all sports. I love karate and boxing, often at school people laugh and call me James when they See my arms. I just want to ask, how did you get over it?  Thank you for your time. 
Would you ever consider entering WWE after you retire ? 
Would you rather fight 100 Mewtwo sized mews or 1 Mew sized Mewtwo? 
If you were a gym master in Pokemon, what special type of Pokemon would you have to fight trainers? 
Would you like to go on an actual date with me? Indy Pro Wrestler\ Military soldier, Kyle Hawk. 
Brief Question here from someone that is interested.   SpaceX's current strategy revolves mostly around old style Rockets, even if they are now approaching complete reusability (Grasshopper rocks). Has SpaceX looked into Hybrid craft like the SABRE program happening in the UK, or look into the possibility of a space elevator (Even at a thought experiment stage) in the way that Google and NASA have done?   Thanks for doing this AMA.  
Mr Musk,  How will you secure the first stage of the Falcon 9 to the barge when it lands?  Gravity or some mechanism? 
In order to use the full MCT design (100 passengers), will BFR be one core or 3 cores?   
Previously, you've stated that you estimate a 50% probability of success with the attempted landing on the automated spaceport drone ship tomorrow.  Can you discuss the factors that were considered to make that estimation?  In addition, can you talk more about the grid fins that will be flying tomorrow? How do they compare to maneuvering with cold-gas thrusters? 
Hi Elon, I currently work for Toyota Tsusho in Fremont doing the wheel assembly for Tesla. I want to let you know how proud I am to be however minutely linked to such a powerful and positively influential company such as yours. Keep doing the good work, sir. You are an inspiration to not only myself but countless others around the world.   My question: You seem to have had to deal with a tremendous amount of adversity in a few of your ventures. Do you have any advice for those dealing with seemingly insurmountable adversity?    
tl;dr: How do you learn so much so fast? Lots of people read books and talk to other smart people, but you've taken it to a whole new level.  It seems you have an extremely proficient understanding of aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, software engineering,  all various subdisciplines (avionics, power electronics, structural engineering, propulsion, energy storage, AI) ETC ETC nearly all things technical.  I know you've read a lot of books and you hire a lot of smart people and soak up what they know, but you have to acknowledge you seem to have found a way to pack more knowledge into your head than nearly anyone else alive. Do you have any advice on learning? How are you so good at it? 
Hi Elon, I'll leave the technical questions to the experts. 1) do you plan on getting any sleep tonight and 2) how will you celebrate if the test is successful? Best of luck! x 
You are an early investor in AI startups like DeepMind and Vicarious. What was the most amazing demonstration of an AI capabilities you have seen so far?  
Hello Elon, **HUGE HUGE** fan here!! Question about the Mars Colonial Transporter:  There has been a lot of speculation over comments about exactly how much mass you are hoping to send to the Martian surface with the MCT. Can you tell us how much cargo you would like to be able to land on Mars with MCT, not including the mass of the MCT itself? 
Emily Shanklin indicated in late 2013 that the Raptor would be the first of a "family of engines" designed for the exploration and colonization of Mars. Could you elaborate on her wording, i.e. was she simply referring to a vacuum version and standard version, or do you plan on building multiple methane-based engines with significantly different thrust and size specifications? 
1) What is your favorite airplane?  2) What is your favorite video game?  3) What is your favorite food?  4) If you consume alcohol, what is your favorite alcoholic drink? 
tl;dr: What spurred the AI concerns over recent months?  As specifically as you can get away with, what spurred you to start sharing your strong concerns about general AI over the last year to 18 months? Prior to that time window you had never made public remarks on the subject and obviously something got you thinking about it. Was it Deepmind's game-playing algorithm? 
Hi Elon! The hyperloop was an interesting idea that sort of came out of the blue last year. Do you have any other projects like that just kicking around in your head? Do you plan to follow up on any of them? 
Hello Mr. Musk,  I sold you a pair of hiking boots at the Sports Authority Elite in Corte Madera. I just wanted to know how your walk through the forest (as you described it) went? Also did you like the boots? 
A few simple questions..  * What year are you actually from? * How did the process work? Did you volunteer to travel back to help us advance? Was it predetermined by a time-paradox and you were already destined to be sent back in time at your birth? Did you and a group of peers draw straws/lottery?  
Hello Mr. Musk.  As a lifelong Metro Detroiter I must ask if you have any plans or are open to the idea of opening a factory in Detroit?   We well versed in the automobile industry and have countless hardworking, industrious people begging for a chance to carve out an honest middle class life.   On top of that there are seemingly few better methods of applying pressure to the industry than to set up shop in their backyard. Detroit is on it's way back up and if you were to be a key player in this renaissance not only would it be mutually beneficial but you would be a hero.  Please consider it. I wish you all the best in your current and future endeavors, what you are doing is incredibly important work. Thank you.  
So you guys are suing Trump for these acts against the environment, of which he's used executive orders to do so. Since you guys are merely suing, does this actually stop the executive order from being executed? Or is there only a fine? What are Trumps repercussions for you guys winning a lawsuit? 
/u/DrewCEarthJustice I would like to know what your organizations policy on nuclear power is? 
Aren't there already pipes in the area where the Dakota pipeline is being proposed?   If so. Why is THIS pipeline so different/Bad? 
Are you still litigating over Dakota Access? If you are, is that a prudent use of charitable assets given that the odds of prevailing are between slim and none? 
Why did the DAPL only become an "issue" after the tribes asked for double what the company building it was offering them to build it on their property and the company found another route?  Why weren't they against it from the beginning?   How did they decide that if they could get double what the company offered them everything was a-ok, but if not it must be some huge problem steeped in racism and not caring about the environment?  How can someone prevent construction on private property they do not own and have no legal rights to?  How can you advocate against pipeline projects when shipping oil & gas via train is worse for the environment both in how much trains pollute vs. pipelines, and how dangerous trains are vs. pipelines? 
I suspect your inbox is probably flooded, but if you find it possible to answer my question is this: why is it a bad thing to resume drilling in the Arctic if the oil is going to be claimed anyways? I personally would rather see my own country profit from it than Norway, Denmark, the UK, Russia, and other foreign nations. While I 100% agree with you on the other topics, and I even acknowledge the dangers and detriments to the environment that Arctic drilling will have, it's not like other nations are simply going to let it sit untapped. Though perhaps I am misunderstanding something, which is in fact why I'm asking the question. I'm no fan of Trump, but I don't think he's wrong in this particular decision, at least given my current level of understanding on the issue. 
Do you think anything would happen with this lawsuit, or will it just get added to his already massive pile of lawsuits? 
Trump's EPA director is at odds with most environmentalist causes. He bases his official actions on economic rationale. Can't this be construed as dereliction of duty?  
why argue against the dakota access pipeline when the oil is going to get there regardless. It's a lot safer by pipeline then by truck or train I would assume? 
I'm graduating law school on Friday. My career plan is to pursue public interest environmental law, with a particular focus on climate change. I just wanted to say that lawyers like you, and those who I have worked for, you are all heroes.   As for a question: what skill or resource do you think environmental lawyers underutilize throughout their careers?  
Won't Trump just do whatever the fuck he wants while saying, "fuck you" no matter what evidence you find? 
How/when did you first start to take on the president?  
Why did the DAPL only become an "issue" after the tribes asked for double what the company building it was offering them to build it on their property and the company found another route?

OC was from u/fdubzou just wanted to make sure Op sees this question and answers it. 
How do you feel about the mess the Dakota access pipeline "supporters" left in my state? They caused an environmental disaster in my state. Any comments? 
Is it me or does this thread seems be bombarded with Trolls and Astroturfing? 
Thank you for your important work, Drew! Would you have any advice to someone looking to start in the environmental policy field? Working on an MPA in Environmental Policy now, would love to make an impact. 
Why is /r/politics and various other anti-trump hate spaces allowed to use bots, brigades and otherwise manipulate reddit?  
Why didn't you take Obama to court for his part in the pipeline? 
Do you enjoy wasting other people's money to merely signal your virtue? 
What do you think about the fact that the protesters of the Dakota access pipeline did more damage to the environment with their garbage and human waste then the actual pipeline itself would do? How about the fact that there's more polar bears then ever? How about the fact that there was more recorded sea ice in Antarctica last year then any other year on record? How about that every doomsday scenario said by environmental scientists has been a lie? Look at inconvenient truth, that movie has just become inconvenient to the environmentalists narrative seeing it's full of so much BS! 
Are you afraid of repercussions by the current administration?  
Have you considered how to make environmental lawyers have a broader appeal? Mainly among rural constituents you claim to represent?  
How can de-regulation be balanced with environmental protections'? 
Is there a legal justification for preventing Trump from revoking National Monument status? I thought it was within his powers as president.  
How stable is the planet configuration of the system? Has it reached a stability over long timescales like our solar system has, or is it a relatively young system were we would expect the bodies to still coalesce into larger objects over time? 
Does TRAPPIST-1 itself pose any hazards to the planets like radiation or flares? 
My question is simple... What's next? I mean I'm sure all the excitement of discovering and announcing this find is still fresh but what are the next steps involved in finding out more about this discovery? What information do you think is "discoverable" about this system in the near future? 
What is the protocol if you do find any signs of life on any of the exoplanets? 
Great presentation everyone!  When/how will you be able to determine if there are signs of an oxygen rich atmosphere?  There was a lot of speculation before the conference that you may have already detected that. 
What are the most promising ways to search a planet that far away for life, assuming it is not intelligent enough to broadcast signals outward? 
Hello, and congratulations and thank you for this discovery! You people are doing amazing work. I have 2 questions for you.  1. Do we know what kind of a gravity compared to Earth or Mars appears on those 3 planets that could have water in them?   2. Can we expect to have the technology in the next 20-30 years that we could for see for sure that there would be life in those planets in form of vegetation?   
So if we were to imagine earth as the planet closest to this star, how many of the other 6 planets would we have visited with satellites, rovers, manned  orbits, manned landing, etc.?   I am trying to imagine how close they all are together in a way that is fun.  
What are the primary impacts of being an earth sized world so close to a smaller, dimmer star?   From the perspective of a human on the surface of such a world, I mean.  I read that all are tidally locked to the star - does that mean they'd only have habitability bands around the perimeter/twilight region? 
What would be the temperatures on each of these planets and the most likely chemical compositions? Are they likely to have a magnetic field? 
Would the relatively close nature of the planets have any sort of dramatic effect on surface tidal forces or would this somehow be offset by the star?  My thoughts being that our Moon has a pretty noticeable effect on Earth, and if those planets are that close to each other I would have thought all sorts of weird weather nonsense would happen. 
Any chance we could name these planets after the 7 dwarves?  
What information will you guys receive from these planets if the James Webb telescope is ready and functional?  
How is the habitable zone estimated for tidally locked planets? How does knowledge of this system affect theories of planetary formation?  
Detecting exoplanets by their transit of their sun presumes that our angle of observation of their sun crosses the path of the planet's orbit. Isn't that really unlikely? Or, are all planets orbiting on parallel planes? 
How can a young aspiring astronomer like myself get involved in this kind of work? At my university it seems like undergrads get funneled directly into academia. What does it take to work at an institution like NASA? I've already started getting involved in research as a sophomore, and my dream research topic is exoplanets. 
Which one of the new discoveries is the one your team is most excited about? 
In the presentation, one of the someone said that Spitzer was not originally designed to look for exoplanets and that it had to be re-engineered to do so. Assuming that the telescope stayed in space, how was this done?  
When the JWST is launched, how will it be used to analyze this system? What will it be looking for, and what will it be able to tell us about these planets? 
Why does the lettering start at 'b'? What happened to planet 'a'? Thanks! 
How can you know that existing life are in need of liquid water? We don't know anything about extraterrestrial life, do we? Just because we breathe oxygen and are dependent on water, does that mean that all other potential life have the same criteria? 
Since this is a red dwarf system, how does this impact the potential for habitable worlds? I've read that planets in these systems are all tidally locked and that red dwarf stars can have sun spots that can modulate its energy to planets by as much as 20%.  
How are discoveries like this made? Is it just luck kr is there a process to discovering planets? 
Congrats on the find, and great work. Now the real question here, are you guys fans of stargate sg1? I sure got an itch to restart the series. 
When should we expect the data/results around atmospheric composition to be released or published? 
If these habitable zone planets are so close to each other doesnt that make them very hot due to gravitational interaction? What do we know about their temperatures now?  
How soon are we likely to have information on the composition of the atmospheres and who will be making these observations? 
Hello. Currently, Kepler spacecraft is observing TRAPPIST-1 system. How well can Kepler spacecraft detect planets around TRAPPIST-1 compared to Spitzer spacecraft? Are further discoveries expected?  Also, is TRAPPIST-1h the first "cold Earth" to be a candidate for further observations? 
Are any planets besides Earth in the Goldilocks zone in our solar system? 
Good work team!  Can I ask the daft question that nobody else dares ask!  On that first day in the office as you take the bubble wrap off your nice new telescope - how you decide which part of the night sky you look at first?   Do you focus your work on known stars that previous work has indicated might have a chance of exoplanets, do you focus on exploring specific clusters or is it it any more random than that? 
Any ideas what the lifespan of the system's star is? Even if our technology were to advance, it would suck to arrive there only to have the sun go out. 
Would you rather fight 100 earth sized planets, or one planet sized earth? 
What's the most exciting thing you can theorize about these planets? 
Congrats on the amazing discovery! What kind of signatures would you be looking for in the future to determine if there might be some kind of life on any of these planets? And using what instruments? 
How does the telescope work? What do you actually see? Is it just a series of numbers on a screen which you interpret into a tangible image? 
Has SETI been listening to this system? I would be really excited if we could hear anything from this system.  
Okay, this isn't specific to this discovery (sorry), but how does the telescope know which direction the exoplanets are orbiting the parent star? Aren't we just detecting a dip in light? how does that imply a direction? (I ask this after using the in browser: TRAPPIST-1 system in 3D) 
What will it take to make this bill - or any slight variation of it - fuck off for good? 
If Twitter is in support, why is this not on their moments or news feed? 
Why isn't there some kind of rule to prevent failed legislation from being reintroduced so often? 
Am I the only one that noticed that Reddit was suppressing posts about the CISA Senate vote? Of course they let it through to the front page today, a day before the vote, to at least give us some semblance of uncenshoship. A day before the vote gives us little to do anything about it. 
Who are you're main allies in Congress fighting along with you for this cause. We hear often about those who are actively campaigning for CISA etc. but who is with the internet? 
Will this be affecting more than just the U.S.? e.g. will it affect canada? 
Why do they do this? Do they actually think "maybe this time it will work!"?  
This is starting to get annoying as fuck. We already shut down the bill. It's clearly something people don't want. Isn't there such a thing as Double Jeopardy when it comes to passing bills? 
I am sitting in a Q&A at a college with the director of the NSA. What question should I ask as a college student? I have like 10 minutes. 
Senator Wyden,  As one of your constituents, thank you for your opposition to these blatant surveillance bills. The amount of support these bills manage to get without a public outroar is alarming. What can we do to not only prevent this from happening *now*, but to stop these sorts of bills from gaining so much traction in the future? 
I saw that CISA passed the Senate. I am deeply disappointed.  What's next? How can we kill the bill before it continues? And what can I say to my senators? (I'm sad to say that both of my state's senators voted for the bill.) 
As an IT Auditor with CISA certification, every time this shows up on here, it always has me wondering what does Reddit have against Certified Information Security Auditors?    Then I actually read the headline. 
Why would you say this is our one last chance when there have been many bills beforehand? You honestly believe if this gets voted down they won't try again? That's optimistic to the point of stupidity  
I am not trying to undermine your cause, but how do you find the motivation? It seems these bills are like Hydra heads, not to mention the effort needed to cut them off. On top of that, the majority of people willingly wave their privacy on social media while those who don't encrypt their traffic.   Keep fighting the good fight regardless! 
Who rules on these bills? Is it a senate/house committee or judge? This seems like something you could sue all the way up to the supreme court for unreasonable search type of deal.  
Didn't the Senate already pass give the thumbs up to CISA?  What is this new Senate vote about? 
Who are the guys pushing this that I can vote for/against? Is there anyone who has attached their name to this that we can send down with this bill when the time rolls around? 
Why can't we get a bill passed into law stating 'the privacy of the people on the internet shall not be infringed upon' or something like that? 
I read somewhere that the EFF has no actual lobbying power and is just an 'awareness' group- meaning my money is better spent elsewhere. Is this accurate?  
What do you think of the corporate hold of reddit ? 
What is the truth to the assertion in The Hill article today that FaceBook is "secretly" lobbying for this bill? 
Is there really any point at attempting to stop it from happening anymore? All we're doing is throwing money at people telling us to call our senators and the whatnot. It's seems to be hurting us more than helping.   We've beaten it multiple times. It's clearly not going to be lobbied away. I'm now more in favor of letting it pass and then having Congress deal with the repercussions. I refuse to donate any more to any silly groups advocating this until it actually matters. And unfortunately nothing will until they come tooth and nail with the consumers once it is enacted.  Let it happen. It will cannibalize itself. 
So suppose this bill passes. What happens to say, the average guy who occasionally pirates a film/TV episode,browses Reddit and plays computer games? How much would it rock this mans life? Also, what are your guy's  favorite midday snacks to tide yourselves over till dinner? 
Could uh, could you do something *like* Burnout again?   I mean not Burnout exactly, and certainly not something exactly like Burnout 3 - but I mean, something real close.  
When Sony became heavily involved, did they have any input (or say) on the final product? Is this still completely your vision? 
Hey Sean,  How often do you and your coworkers read /r/nomansskythegame? 
How drunk were you guys in your live stream today? 
Hey Sean, In an old trailer I saw huge snakes/wurms, are those still in the game?   Also have a nice day!  
Are ringed planets still in the game? Love ya Sean! 
Hi Sean,  I've heard rumors of the possibility of an API at some point for at least Atlas data, will that be a thing? 
Do you think our real universe is procedurally generated or perhaps a simulation?  
Can you say anything more about the base-building aspect yet? 
Hi Sean  Did the flood that struck your offices materially affect development? Would NMS have been a different game without it?   Looking forward to tomorrow. I've been waiting for three years. Thank you for your dedication  
Hi Sean, absurdly hyped for NMS! With NMS gaining so much traction - despite its indie status on PS4 it's being given the billing of a major AAA title - would you consider expanding HelloGames into a multi-project studio, or do you prefer more of a Pixar/Naughty Dog single-game style environment? 
How does it feel being the greatest con artist in the 21st century?  
Just curious why I can't get my money back after you straight up lied to me. Preordered the game before I went out of state. Came home to a piece of fuck game and I'm apparently not allowed a refund because it is out of the time frame. I hope you get class action lawsuited out of your ass for literally promising stuff that never came in the game. P.S. Thanks for stealing my hard earned $60. You ingrateful POS probably sitting on a multimillion oceanside mansion with all the millions you stole. So once again. Why did you lie and steal from so many people?    
Will there be random event such as stars exploding or large astroids etc? 
Do you plan for any mod support on PC in the future? 
How does it feel to know your game completely bombed?? 
Ha! remember when you lied a bunch and then never addressed it? Yeah me too, i burned your game and will never purchase another digital or physical piece of content you so much proof read again.  
Given the multi-player connectivity features in the engine (which have very little chance of being used), do you guys have plans to perhaps expand on that side of the game after most people have had a good single-player experience? 
How does it make you feel knowing that you are the reason gamers across the country are waking up tired for work? 
Are you planning on adding gas giants, or any other space elements not currently included in the game?  
A few questions from a uni student looking to get into programming with a compsci major :  1. How the hell do you get from not knowing how to program anything (where I'm at now) and being able to code properly for a game/at industry level? I've been in classes for various programming languages (matlab, Python) and I feel like the only skill I learned was using google and copy+paste, not actually how to program  2. How did you get a job in the industry straight out of uni? The people I know in 3rd/4th year compsci say that finding a good job (like one at EA) is insanely difficult because of the competition+hiring expectations. In a similar vein, what could any compsci student do to set them apart from the rest on a resume so they could get a job straight out of uni?  Thanks for reading, love the game btw and can't wait to play it 
Is it technically possible to cross paths with another player? 
How many of those cupcakes did you eat in June that /r/NoMansSkyTheGame and I sent you?   Who ate the most? :P 
Bill, what was it like collaborating with Tyler, the Creator for the theme song for the new show? What made you choose him initially? Do you have an ongoing friendship with him?  
Thanks so much for being here. Any chance of working with Disney again on the Energy pavilion at EPCOT? Lots of people would love to see an update based on everything we know about the subject now as opposed to twenty years ago - especially if you had something to say. 
Hey Mr. Science guy! I grew up watching your show and it definitely influenced my path towards engineering.  My question is what science fact absolutely blows your mind?  
Bill, What are your thoughts on Elon Musk and what he is doing for the scientific world through Tesla and SpaceX? 
Hey Bill Nye! I am a 6th grade Science Teacher in Florida (currently in the middle of class) and my students want to ask you.. What was your most favorite episode you've ever created? Also, when did you discover your love of science? Finally, is there any advice you can give to a 6th grader to get involved in the sciences beyond the classroom?   
Hi Bill, thanks for doing this - I've got a question, I know that maybe it's not specifically in your field, but I would still appreciate your thoughts as someone trying to "save the world".  To what extent do you envisage automation replacing common jobs anytime soon, on a large scale? If this is accomplished do you think it will be a current player (amazon/google/tesla), something completely left-field no one expected, or a community effort from thousands of small to medium sized enterprises working together?  Thanks! 
First, thanks for making science class so great in middle school. I still have that theme song stuck in my head.   What is our worst case scenario assuming nothing gets done to save the world and what does the timeline look like? How much is my life going to be affected? My kids? I know we need to do something, but what if it doesn't work out?  
Hey Bill, what's your take on  our chances of becoming a multi-planetary civilization in the foreseeable future? 
Hey there Bill!  Was curious, what was your favorite episode of the old Bill Nye the Science Guy show?  There must have been one episode you did that stood out to you more than others. 
We've heard the chant of your name even wayyy over here in New Zealand. :)  Just a small question. Favourite astronomy point in the night sky? 
Hi Bill,  With the march for science coming up on April 22, many scientists are hesitant to march because they fear it will politicize science.   What are your thoughts on politicization of science? Will you be marching? 
Hey Bill,   What are your thoughts on animal agriculture and the promotion of a vegan diet as to reduce our impact on climate change? 
Where do you shop for ties?  I grew up in a bow tie family. I want a Bill Nye Science Guy Signature Bow tie! 
Hey Bill,  Do you think your TV show has helped or hurt the messages you're trying to spend? Does your reputation make people listen or tune out? 
Hi Bill!! You're doing great work.  My questions for you are:  What is your favourite element and favourite subatomic particle?  What scientific mystery do you most want to solve? 
Bill Nye! My AAAS membership led me to the IDP Career Test at ScienceCareers.org. I am 27 years old and am finally considering a college education. My top result is "Science Education for non-scientists" of which I believe you have ample experience. How would you suggest entering this career field? Would any specific college major help or will any science based major suffice? Would you ever consider letting an individual, such as myself, job shadow you for a couple days? Lastly, do you plan to attend this year's StarTalk Saturnalia party? I'm also a member of the Planetary Society and have to thank you and your team for your science advocacy! I look forward to watching "Bill Nye Saves the World"; keep up the great work!  Bonus Question: Have you heard of "The Show About Science" Podcast run by 6 year old (Yes only 6!) Nate Butkus? I would love to hear you interviewed on his show! You have been an inspiration since my youth; I know you'd inspire him also. 
What is the best way a normal person can make a positive impact in their daily life for global climate change? 
Actually, I have a big question for you!   I'm sure you still very clearly remember your debate with creationist Ken Ham. I'm a Christian, but personally do not agree with his views on creation.   I'm more of a Christian scientist in that I chalk up the creativity of science to God. He's responsible for the Big Bang billions of years ago, he's responsible for the creativity behind evolution, and all of the stuff that makes science so awesome are like his fingerprints.   Now you, as the awesome scientist that you are, do you think that there is any room in science for that line of thinking? Has it ever crossed your mind that there may be a higher power at work? I won't take offense at your answer.  
What do you think about the lack of Scotland players in the British Lions squad for the New Zealand tour? 
Hey Bill , I mean no disrespect but why are there so many stories of you being an asshole to people in public??  
What do you think has improved life the most in poor countries in the last 5 years? 
Hi Bill, my question: Is there anything in life that you regret doing or not doing?  
Hello Mr. Gates,  2015 will mark the 30th anniversary of Microsoft Windows. What do you think the next 30 years holds in terms of technology? What will personal computing will look like in 2045?

Hi Bill, what is a life lesson you learned the hard way? 
Dear Mr Gates,  What is your internet download speed? ;) 
As there are so many great philanthropic causes, how did you and Melinda decided on the causes that you wanted to put the majority of your effort?  
Hi Mr. Gates! Thanks so much for coming back again, I missed your last 2 AMAs.  What do you think is the hardest challenge that the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation is currently facing? 
Hi Bill!   I was watching a video last night on Thorium reactors and saw that you were also in the video discussing this topic as well. This is a technology that I have been following because it makes so much sense.  My question is,  how feasible is the technology at this point in your view and how long before we will see that technology in practice here in the US?   Side note,  thanks for being there.  You are an inspiration to all of us geeks and nerds from the 70s and 80s. :)    
Hi bill!  First off, thanks for being an awesome human being!!! But onto my question:  What innovation has been brought to you but sadly never worked out for what ever reason, but you really wanted it to work?  Thanks! And keep being awesome! 
Regarding the video of you drinking the ... uh.... poop water, how long will it take to put something like that into a community where they can start seeing immediate results? And if I totally missed it, where are they currently setup and what kind of benefits has it already provided. Besides clean drinking water, that is. 
What is your opinion on bitcoins or cyptocurency as a whole? Also do you own any yourself? 
One of the themes in this year's Gates letter is helping to improve agricultural practices in Africa. As a person who was raised in an agricultural community in Canada, the ideas you presented really resonated with me. As individuals, is there anything we can do to help Africa achieve food security? 
Mr. Bill Gates, what is your favorite expensive food? 
Hello, Mr. Gates!   Over the last few years, several entrepreneurs (Elon Musk, Richard Branson, etc.) have launched ventures involving space exploration. Do you have any plans to get involved in this industry? 
Hi Bill. What's your favorite spread to put on bread? 
What is the silliest thing you ever bought that was expensive?

How has your past as an overweight, comedic character played influenced your growth as an actor, especially now that you're considered one of the sexiest Hollywood stars? 
~15 years ago you were living in your van on a beach in Hawaii, jobless, listening to Dre's 2001 everyday.   Do you ever miss anything about those days? Simpler times, being able to go anywhere you want without fear of paparazzi, etc.  
If you could have played any character from a film ever, who would you pick? 
You're awesome man.  Got any guilt or just general thoughts for taking this sweet lead role in Passengers considering Keanu Reeves had been trying to get the script made for like 6-7 years? 
Will you and your wife ever do a movie together where you're both leading? I think you're both talented and would make an exceptional screen-team! 
Im a huge PJ fan and loved that andy was also, was that your idea or the writers idea? are you a big fan? 
Was it difficult to control the raptors on the set of JURASSIC WORLD? Did you have any prior training in order to not get hurt by them? It must have been pretty scary. Was it scary? I bet it was.  
Hey Chris! I've been a big fan of yours since Parks and Rec! Just a quick question, who did you have more fun acting as: Andy Dwyer or Peter Quill? Thanks for taking the time out to do this!  
Hi Chris! If you had to pick one of the characters from Parks and Rec to join the Guardians, who would it be?  
How did you meet Anna Farris? Do y'all have any projects planned together? 
Hey Chris, you've inspired me to lose weight because funny guys can be sexy shirtless too.   So my question is: how has getting into shape changed your life? Also is having maintain your physique harder than losing the weight?    
Good morning from another PNW native (Tigard, OR)!   What was the most challenging aspect of working on Passengers?   Also, what's your favorite thing about the PNW?   Have a good one!  -Alyssa 
Loved parks and rec, actually know Aubrey Plaza from summer camp(she was good friends with one of my sister's)  Do you have a favorite moment of working with Aubrey? 
How is Jennifer Lawrence?  What's your best memory of working with your mates in your movies and tv shows?  Top 5 movies and shows?  You're a very lovable actor and you've lost alot of weight! I'm trying to shave weight off too because of your change in GotG! Thank you! 
Since you and Jennifer Lawrence have a pretty similar sense of humour, there must've been some pretty hilarious moments on set of Passengers. What is one of the funniest (or embarrassing) moments when filming the movie? 
You ate at a restaurant in Cambridge, MA, and you were wearing a patriots jersey because you lost a bet. I was one of your servers and while running your food I don't know if I was nervous or what, but I totally let one rip right next to you. I am pretty sure you heard because you stopped what you were saying and looked me directly in my eyes.  **Question**: Will you forgive me for crop dusting you? 
Where did you learn that magic trick?  I was expecting you to fail miserably and just want to see the hilarious scene but then......damn that was good 
Who is your favorite Seahawk besides Russell Wilson?   Oh and if you want to be more beloved by your home state, join Russ in supporting the return of the SuperSonics to Seattle. ;) (just a tip).  
Hi Chris! Johnny Karate vs Burt Macklin. 24 hours prep. Who wins? 
Would you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses or 1 horse-sized duck? 
Hi Chris. You always struck me as a huge nerd, so I'll ask this:  Have you ever been interested in/auditioned for a part in Star Wars now that it's back? 
Do the pictures of space do any justice to the real thing? 
Hello Mr. Aldrin! Is there anything you regret not getting to do while in space? 
Hi Mr. Aldrin!  What advice would you like to give to a lab full of aspiring engineers and astrophysicists?  And...  What is your favorite flavor of ice cream? 
Col Aldrin, what went through your head when you first looked back and saw the Earth from space?  
Mr Aldrin , what do you consider your biggest accomplishment that's totally unrelated to space? 
If you had the opportunity to speak to the crew of the first manned mission to Mars prior to launch, what would you say to them? 
What advice can you give to current undergrad aerospace engineering students? 
How does it feel to be THE REAL buzz lightyear? Also how can I be an astronaut and go to the moon?  
You were what kids wanted to be when they grew up.  What did you want to be when you were a kid? 
How were the cast and crew of 30 Rock? Anything memorable you can share? 
Mr Aldrin, I am interested in what kind of music a highly distinguished astronaut such are yourself would find yourself listening to. Could you enlighten me? 
Thank you for doing the AMA!  Ever find time for computer games like Kerbal Space Program? I've gotten 3 kids more interested in math and science after showing it to them.  Have a fantastic day! 
Was it more challenging to go through the training to become an astronaut, or to actually go to space? 
How do you feel about people who claim you faked the moon landing?    Can you describe how the moon felt to you?  (Was it an adrenaline rush when your feet hit the surface?  Was it soft or hard?  Could you feel temperature through the suit at all?)  Funniest moment during the mission to the moon and back?  
How often do you use "Yeah well I walked on the moon" as a trump card for arguments? 
Hi Mr. Aldrin - Thank you for joining us!  One of my heroes is Carl Sagan, and, as far as i have read, he worked with NASA during the Apollo missions - so did you ever get to meet him, and if so; what were your impression of Carl Sagan?   
How tempting was it to lay in the moondust and make moon angels? 
Hello Mr. Aldrin! I just wanted to ask you how was your day? And say that you are one of my heroes. Thank You! 
What is your absolute favorite aircraft to fly today?  
Hello Mr. Aldrin! If it was you, not Neil, who took the first steps on the moon, what would you have said? 
Will you ever forgive Ali G for calling you "Buzz Lightyear?" during an interview in 2003? 
The airline is dumb for letting the people on the flight before they had this figured out. It would have been a lot easier to just not let 4 people on as opposed to having to take 4 people off  
I doubt anyone but his lawyer will be getting those answers  
Another point:  The Passenger Bill of Rights does entitle compensation to the bumped passenger.  I've been bumped twice.  The first time, I was randomly bumped and took a hotel and 350.  The second time I responded to the request with "two grand and a limo to the hotel" which started a bidding war on the plane.  I took 850 and a Marriott.  
Time was, when you got bumped, you got a free first-class ticket voucher anywhere you wanted to go in the US.  And a hotel room.  And meal vouchers for your stay.  And put on the next flight.  I miss the 90s. 
United's about to make that guy a millionaire several times over. 
It seems odd to randomly select 4 people to be kicked off. What if you were traveling with your children and your child was picked to be taken off?   It seems like this guy's wife or someone related to him ran after him when he was being dragged.  
Let's not turn this man into an Internet celebrity and start digging up shit in his past and fucking up his future.  
I know its standard policy to oversell, but I don't think overselling was the problem here. The issue is that none of the passengers would take the $800 bribe so United decided that $800 was their maximum and decided to resort to excessive force to remove passengers. Solution? Shoulda offered 2 grand, 3 grand, 4 thousand bucks. I bet someone would have taken that deal in a heartbeat. The deep shit that United is now in and the major PR hit they are taking is going to cost them a hell of a lot more than a few thousand dollars.  
$800 isnt enough to get me off the plane if I need to be somewhere. Hope this man gets a large sum of money for their BS 
OMG. I just saw the video and cannot believe that happened. I hope the lawsuit gets televised. 
I think the real question is, why did they even let people on the plane if it was overbooked? 
Good job staying on top of this karma ~~train~~ plane.   
What's a realistic estimate for what he'll be paid for this?  
The dude reminds me of my dad in his younger days.   Anyone know if the dude is korean or something? 
If you made it clear that you were a doctor, who had patients that needed to be see.   Do flights get overbooked sometimes? Yes  Should the police drag someone out who didnt "volunteer" to leave. No   I'm just baffled, nobody was willing to stop what was going on. By giving up their seat, so you could get back home.  Did anyone offer to give up their seat, while this was happening?   
What's this shit with over booking? I've flown across Europe hundreds of times and never have had any issues...  United Airlines should take Turkish airlines as an example as they rock for God's sake, Best treatment and food I've ever had...  (If you're ever flying with Turkish airlines, take chicken if you have the choice, if not, just take anything as it's soo damn tasty)  
Some people (Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking, etc) have come out in favor of regulating Artificial Intelligence before it is too late. What is your stance on the issue, and do you think humanity will ever reach a point where we won't be able to control our own artificially intelligent designs? 
Hello Mr. Gates,  I know you love to read, carry a lot of books around and learned how to speed-read, is there some technique you use to make this easier? More generally, how do you "attack" a book you're interested in?  
What's a technological advancement that's come about in the past few years that you think we were actually better off without? 
Mr. Gates! How soon do you think quantum computing will catch on, and what do you think about the future of cryptography if it does? Thanks! 
Sql server on Linux was announced yesterday as I'm sure you are aware. What do you think this means or says about the company's direction, culture and future? 
Hello Mr. Gates,  You have previously said that, through organizations like Khan Academy and Wikipedia and the Internet in general, getting access to knowledge is now easier than ever. While that is certainly true, K-12 education seems to have stayed frozen in time.  How do you think the school system will or should change in the decades to come?  Thank you for continually coming back to reddit to let us ask you anything! 
Hey Bill! Has there been a problem or challenge that's made you, as a billionaire, feel completely powerless? Did you manage to overcome it, and if so, how?  Now for a less serious question: sushi or thai food?  Thanks for doing this AMA! 
Any plans to retire and enjoy a quieter life? It strikes me that you must be sacrificing a lot to remain so active on these projects. 
What's your fastest time in expert minesweeper without editing the .ini file? 
What do you think will be the next biggest advancement in technology in the next 20 years? 
I'm about to graduate high school, do you have any life tips that I should know about moving forward in my life? 
I recently saw *Pirates of Silicon Valley*, a film that claims to portray both Apple and Microsoft's rise to fame. Regarding that, I have a few questions for you, Mr. Gates.   - Have you seen this movie, and if so did it seem accurate in portraying yourself and Steve Jobs??   - If you could go back in time and do it all over again, would you do anything different?   - Any other interesting run-ins with the government besides the Porsche 911 incident?   - Would you rather jump a horse-sized chair or 100 chair-sized horses?   - What's your biggest "first world problem"?   - What version of Windows do you use?    Thank you for taking the time to handle all these AMAs. 
What are your thoughts on the many politicians that completely disregard climate change?  
What's your take on the recent FBI/Apple situation?  
Afternoon Mr. Gates,   I was curious about your thoughts on VR. We've all seen the great strides in AR made by the Hololens but nothing on VR from you guys at this time. Does that market interest you? 
Would you consider marrying Melinda to be one of the top three decisions of your life?  Because I do!  :) 
Hi Bill! You began Microsoft with the easy goal of putting a computer in every home. If you were to start all over today, what would your goal be instead?  
Bill, in an interview with Playboy in 1994 you claimed to have used LSD when you were younger.  Right now, LSD is being investigated more and more closely as a therapeutic tool for various conditions and situations (ranging from autism, to alcoholism to fear of dying), but also as a creativity enhancer (as attested by its documented use in the form of microdoses in Silicon Valley). Do you feel your LSD experiences contributed anything to what you have achieved and invented?  If so, could you share some of the most relevant elements?

Do you plan on traveling all over the world with the Conan Show ? 
Is there ever going to be a beard reprise? I wouldn't be mad about it...

Hi Conan, I've brought a puppet to your studio audience a few times, but the last time Jeff Ross sternly requested I keep it down during the show. Why does Jeff Ross hate puppets? 
Your remotes are probably my favorite thing you do. In the future, would you ever consider doing a travel show? I'd definitely watch that. Thanks for all the laughs.

Hey Conan! Love your show! What is your favorite type of bacteria?  
Hi Conan! I've been a really big fan since I was eight, when my older siblings were babysitting and decided not to force me to bed after 10pm (best decision of their lives, hands down). I can honestly say that your humor has helped me stay sane through some really, really rough times.  As a matter of fact, I also happen to be a first generation Mexican-American (the first in my family to be born on American soil, to be exact), I really just wanted to say thank you for doing this special. I know my parents and older siblings (the very same who introduced me to you) and I are all really worried about what might happen, and it warms my heart so much that you'd help humanize Mexicans and our culture, now of all times.  I guess my question would be...did you try the the tacos from stands or the vanilla ice-cream? Raspados?? Rompope??? Will you bring me some?   Sincerely,   Your biggest and most starving fan 
Hey Conan -- thanks for doing this! I'm a long-time admirer.  I know you've told a lot of Trump-related jokes, and I've seen comments of people saying you shouldn't make things so political.   Is it important to you to tell those jokes? Do you think humor can change the dynamic in this kind of political atmosphere?  Thanks! 
Do you have any good mac n cheese combinations? (Such as hot dogs w mac n cheese) 
Have airline companies changed their pricing algorithms due to Skiplagged's increasing use and prominence? 
A friend of mine claims you can get screwed on this, but I don't know if I believe him  Supposedly if you're flying from NYC to Dallas and use this to get a flight that goes from NYC to las Vegas (with a hidden city of Dallas), the hidden city could switch at the last minute from Dallas to Chicago!   Possible? Or an urban legend? This is the only thing keeping me from using this service 
What were the biggest obstacles to overcome in getting the website off the ground?  -  Also, how does the website and app make money? 
Some carriers have applications that can sniff out passengers using hidden cities and mark their return flights for cancellation. Have any of your passengers had their return flights cancelled for this reason? And if they do, will you compensate them? 
How does it feel to personally be telling that 'One weird trick Airliners don't want you to know about'? 
Can you explain like I'm 5 what a hidden-city is? I don't understand how/why it saves money. 
Can you get on a flight from the middle to end instead? Say flight does to New York, Miami, lax. Can I start from Miami to end in lax? 
Data engineer here, what types of obstacles from a data acquisition/infrastructure view did you run into? How do you manage scaling up? Did you have to apply for access to the FAA data or do you pull from an alternative source? What kind of backend do you use to handle this large scale/constantly changing data? My apologies for all the nerdy questions! :D 
Is it true that the best (Cheapest) time to purchase a plane ticket is about 3 weeks in advance? Do airlines seem to change the prices on certain days of the week? 
I want to use skiplagged to book a flight now but it keeps saying "results unavailable" even after multiple city searches. Is the site down? 
In terms of voting, what about making a comment for each charity and our upvote can help decide? 
Is this a violation of your agreement with the airline as a passenger? could you be banned from the airline for doing this often? 
Oh hey! We graduated from RPI the same year. I mostly wanted to say that it's super cool to see an RPI grad being successful and don't really have any great questions to ask about Skiplagged, so I guess I'll just ask what your favorite and least favorite parts of RPI were so we can bond.  So, what was your favorite and least favorite part / experience at RPI? 
Which airlines have "contract of carriage"? What could they do to you for missing a flight? 
Just saying, you're my hero. Had to go see my mom a few weeks back, and used Skiplagged. Saved a crap ton of money. Just wondering, what's your primary method of growing a startup company such as yours? 
What about the other passengers on the flight you don't show up for? Do you worry that Skiplagged will increase delays caused by late arriving or no-show passengers? 
Travel agencies and airlines have always known about hidden citys. The airlines kept the threat of making the traveler pay for the unused portion of ticket. Travel agents tried not to book them but if the client knew about them and insisted, they booked them and hope the airline didn't catch it and issue the agency a debit memo. United reservation system is Apollo and Americans is Saber. Both systems work within minimum and maximum connection times. One has to force sell the segments and phase IV the tkt to get the accounting lines correct. For you to get it done and them to create a program to allow users to do it..dude your going to be very very wealthy one day.  Can I buy stock in you? Im impressed   
What is stopping airlines from deciphering which flights are being purchased through Skiplagged and denying all sales made through your site? I'm not even sure if such a thing is possible, but if it is I wouldn't put such a thing past them.  
How'd you come up with the idea for Skiplagged??? It's really amazing!!! 
Steve, what's the greatest invention that you wished you designed? 
Thank you for doing this, Steve! Even though you left in 1985, what was your relationship with the company like after, and how has that changed compared to now? Are you, for example, allowed to go and visit any colleagues that still work there or are you simply another outsider?  
Do you like how you were portrayed in the Apple movies (jobs and Steve Jobs)? Who did a better job: Seth Rogen or Josh Gad? What did they do completely wrong? 
Did playing a man so badly bullied by his co-workers have an effect on you IRL?  Also, your dog is awesome. 
Hi Jim!  You sat in front of my friend and I at a performance of Hedwig and the Angry Inch on broadway about two years ago. Not only were you kind enough to introduce yourself and my friend and I stared at you in awe, but you took the time to take a picture with us when the show was over since we weren't allowed to take them in the theater. You were so kind and willing to talk to two awkward 18 year olds so I just wanted to thank you, two years later!  My question is: what's your favorite encounter you've had with a fan? 
Hey Jim Gengurch!  I love your acting in many shows I've seen, especially P&R.   The finale after special refers to you being the most different from your character. Which other actors are most distant from their characters and most similar?!   Also, how much do you miss P&R?! 
Hey Tim,  You've kind of been defined by your role on *Parks & Rec*, but you've had a long and impressive career. Is there one movie or TV show you've been in -- other than *Middle Man* -- that you'd recommend to people looking to see a little more of you? A performance you're particularly proud of? 
Hi Jim!  At one point in P&R, it is referenced that your character has a very large penis. Does that take any method acting on your part? 
Hi!!   Who was the funniest cast member on Parks and Rec and who was the most fun to work with?   Also how similar is Nick Offerman to Ron Swanson? (in my head they're the same person)   Thanks!! 
Hi Jim!  Jerry/Kerry/Larry/Terry/Gary Gengurch was one of my favorite characters. I can relate to being the clumsy one who's always the butt of the jokes. You never failed to make me smile while portraying him.   What are your dog's names, and can you tell me a bit about them? 
Tim,  With this being described as a "black comedy", how was this role different for you in comparison to past roles, and how do you feel audiences will react? 
Was it difficult playing such a wholesome and naive character, when a lot of your other work is so dark and twisted? It's great you have such a wide range. 
Have you been able to keep any interesting props or memorabilia from any of your roles? 
First Aubrey played a character named Lenny in 'Legion' and now you're playing Lenny in 'Middle Man'.  Who do you think the next one from Parks and Recreation to play a Lenny...?  Personally, I'm hoping it is Li'l Sebastian. 
Hey Jim! Big fan of your work, my dad was actually one of the people that invested enough to be an extra in Middle Man so we are super excited to see it in theatres! My question to you is, who has been your all time favorite actor/actress to work with?  Thanks so much! 
Was the cast of Parks and Rec overly nice to you off camera to make up for how Jerry was treated on camera? 
Who was your favourite director and actor that you've worked with? 
How often do you pull a classic Jerry move?  Also: I remember seeing you in a Castle episode, and I swear it was the most amazing thing I've ever seen, as I decided that your character (who was a butcher with anger management issues, if I recall correctly) was Jerry Gergich trying to process everything he was put through in Parks and Rec. 
Would you rather fight 100 Aziz-sized Li'l Sebastians or 1 Li'l Sebastian-sized Aziz?  Credit to /u/GodDamnNameDoesNotFi for the tweak to my original question 
Hi Jim!   If you could be anything other than an actor, what would you be?  
Was the makeout-fest on Late Night planned between you and Aubrey or just improvisation?  
Hi Jim! So Chris Pratt's Kardashian cumback joke has basically become legendary. Were there any other funny moments like that one that didn't make the blooper reel?  
Hey Larry, what did you type into Altavista to get here? 
Ask you anything, eh?  Okay. Let's put this question to bed: Is the reason that Gayle was with Jerry/Terry/Larry/etc., was because of his massive penis?  According to Dr. Harris (whom Chris Traeger said was literally the meanest person he's ever met), it's the biggest penis he's ever seen. I mean, he didn't even know if you had mumps. He forgot to look. He was distracted. By the largest penis. He had ever seen. 
We know of your enormous member thanks to your PandR checkup, but what I really want to know is did you have mumps?  
Hi Jim.  Altoids or Tic-Tacs that night on Seth Meyers?  
Hi Jim, i just want to say that i love your acting, you're extremely funny. The scene when Chris is proposing to Ann while Larry is choking in the back is one of my favorites of the show! Congratulations on the emmy! My question is, Was there any Jerry in the Parks and rec crew? 
Hey Jim, I can't wait to see your new movie, but I'm afraid I have to ask, do you ever see the Parks and Rec gang reuniting in the future?  Maybe for a reboot or even a film? Would love to see you all back one last time. 
I loved you on the show! Who was your best bud on set? 
Hi Jim! Are you a Billy Joel fan? You were married to his ex wife! Also, murinal! Lol 
Hi Jim! Thank you for taking the time to answer some questions.  How do you think your character Lenny and Jerry/Terry/Larry would get along?  If you chose a boys day out for them where would you go? 
Who would win in a mud wrestling match, nick offerman, or chris Pratt?  
Hi Jim!  Has DJ Roomba come back to haunt you with Black Eyed Peas yet?  
Hello Mr. O' Heir,  I am a big fan of your work. You captured the essence of the nice guy who seems to finish last almost  perfectly. I just have to ask, how did you discover the character of Jerry within yourself? He reminds me a lot of myself growing up. I was always helping with stuff but was never acknowledged for it so thank you for embodying that role so well. 
Off the top of your head, what was the funniest parks and rec scene you participated in shooting? 
Hi Jim!  Do you and Chris Pratt keep in touch? Do you keep in touch with the other P&R cast members?    
My sister is a theater teacher for a middle school and we are both huge fans of your role as Jerry in PnR.  Any advice for her class that are about to go into high school theater?  
Which actor/actress on Parks and Rec was most similar to their character? 
Hi Jim! What was your favorite and least favorite episodes to shoot of parks and rec? 
What was it like working with Michael Schur? Is he as comedically inclined as we all believe, or is it just the great casts he has worked with that should take credit? 
Hey Jim. I love your doggos! What are their favorite things to do? 
I was watching Rosanne and was delighted to see you in a random episode. Do have a any cool memories form back then on set and what do you think about the reboot? 
What was your favorite "Gerry-Burn"? Mine was - i know it's kind of basic - the fart attack.  
I loved Jerry (Terry, Gerry) on Parks and Rec. We're there any jokes you made in the outtakes that you wished they used and what were they? 
Are you and Aubrey still a thing?  Who was your favorite guest star on parcs? 
Do you have any thoughts on the passing on Parks and Rec guest star, Glenne Headly? 
Thanks for taking your time Tim!    What do you think about the shows final season? 
1) Are you in direct control (editor or author) of:  -Wikileaks.org -@wikileaks twitter -@WLTaskForce twitter  2) Why the change in tone / editorializing on social media from around the elections to current?   This is based on my perception as a follower/devotee to the cause of making what is dark light, and correcting falsehoods to truth.  
Why have you never released the leaks on the Russian government announced years ago?   Why did you attack the Panama papers when they showed dodgy money flowing into Russian coffers?   Do you bear any weight of conscience for the deaths of  pro democracy activists in Belarus after your friend Israel Shamir gave Wikileaks documents to the Belarusian dictator?  
How's the coffee in the embassy?  Also: Does ANYONE notice this is happening right as cabinet hearings are happening?  
Can you explain your whole October?  /r/DICKSOUTFORASSANGE 
Julian, is there a plan in place in case Wikileaks ever becomes compromised? How will we know if it happens? 
As a mod from /r/whereisassange I ask this question for our community. Most of us were/are legitimately concerned with your welfare. We felt like we were dismissed by you and Wikileaks even being called part of a "Black PR campaign". What do you think of our group which formed because we were not allowed to ask questions about your welfare? 
Hi Matt,              What was your first thought when told about your "involvement"  in Team America??   Best of luck with the new film. 
Who would win a battle to death, you or Ben Affleck? 
The Bourne movies are easily my favourite series of movies ever. Were you reluctant to do a fourth or was it an easy decision?  Also, you're my favourite actor and my mom is in love with you, just so you know.  
Hey Matt! Thanks for doing this AMA.  I'm a big fan of the films you have starred in, and I was wondering, out of all of your movies, who has been your favourite actor/actress to work alongside?  
Hey Matt! You've been my favorite actor since the Bourne Identity. Can't wait for the new one.  - How long does it take you to decide "yes" or "no" on a role when you read a script? - What are the ingredients of your ideal taco? 
Hi, Matt. I'm really looking forward to the new Bourne film.  My question: what does Julia Stiles smell like? 
Hey Matt.  Big fan of your movies,  especially the Martian.  The setting for that movie worked really nicely with your acting style.   I'm curious,  do you have any interest in video games?  If so which ones?  I know a video game I'm development that features a very similar setting to The Martian and seems like a perfect fit for you.  It's called ROKH.  Have you ever considered  working with video games as a voice actor/motion capture?  Would be really neat!  Definitely worth taking a look at. 
What will the next generation of robots we send to Mars look like? Now that there's this new evidence will that change what testing equipment gets a space onboard? What's the food like at the cafeteria at NASA?  
I read that the rover can't approach specific areas (including where the streaks are located) due to risk of infection by Earth microbes.  What are some examples of microbes that could be living on the rover that you are concerned with infecting the surface of mars? 
What quantity of water are we talking about? what volume? 
How long into the future do you think it will be before we can realistically think about sending humans to Mars?  
This may be a bit far-future looking, but does the fact that we know liquid flowing water exists mean anything for terraforming Mars in the future? 
If the Mars rover were to travel to the site of the briny water, what would be the scientific procedure for determining if that water supports life?  
From my fourth grade students (edited by me for clarity):   Could there be Martian life in the water since it's only there at certain times of the year? What might happen to the life when the water disappears?  It was mentioned that there's life on Mars in the form of microbes on the machinery. Is it possible that these microbes sent by us could harm Martian life?  Thank you! 
Is there any evidence of evaporation happening on mars? And do you know where this water came from?  Thanks for your time! 
what would be the procedure, if life is found on Mars?  would the public be made aware? who gets told first?  
First off congratulations on such an amazing discovery.   Second, how close is the rover to the water? Will you be able to get close enough to get pictures without contamination?  
What can *we* do to get the government to increase funding for NASA?  
Where does the water come from? I understand that water vapor is very low in the martian atmosphere, yet surely there must be a sizable partial pressure of water vapor in order to hydrate the salts. 
Hello NASA,  What do you say to those who would argue we already had proof with the ice caps? Obviously, they're full of water. Don't they melt periodically?  Sincerely, A fan. 
About how much longer do you think it will take to get visuals of the rest of Mars at a high enough resolution to see these types of things? 
Congratulations! Given the seasonal nature of today's discovery, does this suggest that their is a hydrologic cycle on Mars? 
In the press conference they said the Mars mission in 2020 will bring back samples from Mars. How are you going to bring back these samples? 
In the articles I've read so far, the water is referred to as "briny" and that it's more fluid than it is water. What does that mean? Would this be something theoretically possible to drink or grow things with? Or would this be the kind of thing that would need purification before it could be used?  
Do any of the space scientists at NASA write poetry/do art? If their art is inspired by their scientific work, can you please share it with us? 
This is gonna sound silly, but what does it taste like? 
Scale of 1-10, how excited does this make you guys? Is this a huge deal for the scientific community? 
What procedures does NASA have in place to prevent potential contamination of these active water sources on Mars? 
The images going around today as proof are from 2011, what results/tests did you wait on to finally confirm what the images show fairly well? 
what was the hardest technical challenge you faced on this project?  what was the hardest nontechnical (political, cultural, legal, emotional &c) challenge? 
This seems to indicate that mars is closer to the end of its life cycle than a younger planet like Earth (as in, a long while ago mars had flowing water, oceans, and likely life.. now it's mostly arrid)  What are your thoughts on that? I can hardly fathom what kind of life may have once been on Mars - but it's kind of depressing to think that it is something that was once but unless terraforming becomes  a thing - Mars will remain a grave stone of a world where life once may have thrived.  
Will 2016 mars mission aim to explore more on this? 
Why should the average joe care about this? What does this mean for science and space exploration? 
Awesome news! Really excited about this!   How long before you guys can map a significant area (~20%) of Mars with Hi-Res images? 
With the discovery of water on Mars does that mean there could be rainbows on Mars?  
If the atmospheric pressure on surface is the same as Earth's, but the air composition is the same as well as the soil/terrain, how likely would we be seeing streams or ponds of liquid water there? 
Is this water we're taking about, or could it be another liquid? 
Serious question, why is this a surprise considering there's evidence of ice and glaciers?  From what I saw when I googled it mars can get warm enough to melt ice, so what's to say this isn't from the glaciers melting and then refreezing? 
the gravity on mars is about 3.711m/s.want to know if this much gravity is enough to hold a large amount of water on its surface ?what will happen if we pour 200 gallons of water on the surface?will it evaporate? 
As someone who knows little to nothing about anything related to space exploration. What took us so long to discover this? 
Do you know how much water there actually is on mars? Is it enough to support a city, for example? 
Do you ever ride the subway in NYC? I'm pretty sure I saw you at Broadway-Lafayette once. I've been telling people that I saw you. Is it possible? Am I a liar? Thanks!  
Whats the most accidentally funny thing you've done this week? 
Is there any project other than acting you've ever wanted to venture in to? 
Hi Patrick!  Frakes with a beard or cleanly shaven? 
If you had the ability to ask William Shakespeare one question, what would it be? 
Hi. Just wondering. do you still enjoy a curry in Petworth ? If so can you recommend a dish on the menu. 
What's your secret to staying so young, looking so good, and having so much fun? TELL US PLEASE! 
Sir Patrick, I've read that you were born in Mirfield. As a fellow Yorkshireman, does your old accent ever pop out by mistake sometimes? Or has it completely disappeared after so many years away from God's Own Country? 
What would you advise to Daniel Radcliffe who'd like to play Shakespeare in theatre?  
If you could find one rare artifact in the world what would it be and who would you give it to?  
First off, let me say that I really admire your work-you were so flawless as Professor Xavier and Picard, and so wholly charismatic and thoughtful in your acting. My question is whether you have done/would consider narrating audiobooks? I'm an audiobook junkie, and absolutely adore your voice. Thanks for the AMA! :-)
What was it like seeing your decapitated head in Macbeth? 
One of the few MUST-ASK questions for an Englishman.   What is your favorite Tea?  
Hello, Sir Patrick! Looking forward to Blunt Talk premiering this week! What made you decide to take your first starring role in a comedy series like this? 
Who's the better kisser: Ian McKellen or Conan O'Brian?  What has been your favorite role to voice act? 
What question would Walter Blunt ask Deputy Director Bullock? 
What do you consider to be the most fun you have had in your acting career?  Also, you are fantastic. 
Hello Sir Patrick!  I am a young actor who is currently engaged as Henry V, having developed a love for Shakespeare in the last few years.  As a man who has had a long career as a film and stage performer, do you have any advice on making the transition between film and stage?  Thank you so much for the wonderful entertainment over the years! 
I missed a performance you did with Judy Dench in 2002 in London.  Showed up and it was sold out.  One of my biggest regrets.  Are you in any productions now?  When is the next time someone can see you on stage? 
Sup Sir Patrick!!  What are some things on your bucket list? 
Hi Patrick! Im a huge fan of yours and I grew up watching the X-Men Films. What is the best thing about playing the role of Professor X? 
Do you have an actual manservant IRL? I can't figure out how you can fit so much awesome into your daily routine. 
When will we see you on Tabletop with Wil Wheaton?? We really just want to hear you say "shut up Wesley" because we know how much he looooves that. Seriously though...when? :) 
Some day there will be a space ship, or a star ship. It will have a bridge, it will have a Captain much like you represented, commanding a bridge crew, and travelling the stars. In all likelihood, that ship will be called Enterprise.  Was there ever a time when you were on the bridge set of TNG, that you had that same realisation? Was it at all apparent at the time how impactful the show would be on future inventions, on people's choices  of career, and on our looking to the stars? 
Mr.Stewart, did it ever bother you that a French Born character named Picard has an English accent, was that ever brought up to the writers?    
If budget was no limit... and I mean if you had *millions*... what myth would you have most liked to test? 
Hi Mr. Savage, and greetings from Iceland. As some here surely know, the 'Mythbusters B-Team' has been up to no good and is due for a hopefully spectacular opening with their new show 'White Rabbit Project' on Netflix in just a few days. Have you been involved in any way with the project, even if just in an advisory role? Will we be getting a podcast about the show on tested.com? Are you or Jamie gueststarring in any of the episodes? Thanks for your time, and keep up the great work. 
You recently announced a joint show with Michael from VSauce. How did this venture come about, why did you choose to do it, and what are you most excited about with that venture? 
Hey Adam!  I loved the collaboration between you and Alton Brown, since you two were literally my childhood role-models. How was it working with him?   
Hey, Adam!  What are your essential cheap tools that everyone should own, and what are some that you feel need to be higher quality in order to be worth bothering with? 
Hi Adam,  I recently discovered my college has it's own makerspace and club complete with 3D printers, a laser cutter, and a wood working shop. The only thing that it's missing is: makers!  What would be the best way to get people interested in a makerspace? 
Hi Adam,   Like everybody else, I love tested and the work you're doing to jump start Making. I'm a maker of music (or noise...) and I as wondering who you listen to on your drive to the shop or while you're working or just to decompress? Thanks for being such a huge inspiration to me! 
I'm about to take my last physics test of the semester. Any words of advice? 
Hi Adam!  I want to start off by thanking you, Mythbusters was a huge part of my childhood and it introduced me into the wonderful world of engineering. It helped me decide that I wanted to pursue a career in civil engineering, and now in my third year as a CE student I couldn't be happier with my decision. So thank you so much for that, and also for participating in this AMA today!  So my question for you is, is there any myth that you wanted to do but didn't have the right technology? If so, do you think it'll ever be possible to test it?  -Briana 
Hi Adam,  Can't remember if you've ever answered this before but have you ever worked with the "slow-mo guys"? They've dona a lot of really cool stuff filming things in super slow motion. The company they are apart of is also doing a really cool series called immersion, trying out things from video games in real life and seeing how easy/difficult they are. 
Hello Adam,   I am looking to get into creating/making, but over the years I've been doing things that could fit under making, or hobbyism, I've had tons of fun, but never really gotten all that good at anything or creative enough to come up with something really undone before. Now that my two daughters are getting older (three and six) and have both been to the NY Maker Faire, and love science and making things and such, I'm looking to get back in. What kind of resources can you recommend to a 37 year old father that can also potentially be useful in some way to the girls? We do have a Pi, and some of the "toy" making/enginnering stuff. 
Hi Adam,  I often find my self working on multiple projects at once, sadly some end up on the shelf for a while. Does this happen to you? What do you do to alleviate it? 
So obviously your famous quotes are "I reject your reality and substitute my own" and "the only difference between science and screwing around is writing it down" but what are some things you said that you wish were more popular?   P.S I'm a senior in high school and I picked your reality quote for my senior quote!  
Hi Adam! My 3 year old son is a humongous fan of yours. He's bright and very interested in science and engineering.   Christmas is coming and I was wondering what toys you had as a kid that helped foster your lifetime love of science. Or if there are any toys on the market today that you would recommend?   Thanks!  
In-N-Out or Five Guys or something completely different? 
Do you still frequent reddit after that whole fiasco with people making fun of your fan that takes a picture with you every year? 
Dear Mr Savage af  Is there any way someone can make a hobby/job out of explosives without a bunch of qualifications and such?  Now before anyone thinks I'm mental and/or a terrorist, I'm a tinkerer. I like building stuff, dissasembling stuff, reverse engineering stuff and inventing stuff. Ever since I put a can of hairspray on a bonfire and got a huge fireball I've also been intrigued by explosives. Now obviously I don't make bombs in my spare time, closest I got was took the innards of a bunch of boxes of fun snaps, put them in a sandwich bag and sealed it. That made a loud bang.  I'd love to play with bombs and seeing what is and isn't explosive, responsibly of course, and if there's any hobbies surrounding bombmaking.   So is there any avenues I can take without retraining that you know of, or am I already on a watch list by the grace of this comment?   Yours most faithfully  Soz im drunk 
Hi Adam, I'm a huge fan. The idea of writing something you might actually see is slightly intimidating. Thank you for the enthusiasm you bring to all of your projects and all of the knowledge that you have shared with the maker community through Tested.   My question is how do you balance your creative projects when you aren't working or on tour with being a husband and father? My wife and I have a 18 month old. She has a busy schedule do to her career, so we try to all be together whenever she is free. On weekends when she has work, I watch our son. While I love spending time with both of them, I also can't help but feel like I don't have time for many creative projects. I know as my son gets older I can start getting him involved in projects with me, but for now I feel like my workshop is gathering dust. 
If you are editor-in-chief, wouldn't that count as a job? 
Hi Adam! You talked on the Still Untitled podcast about saying, "I HAVE NO BUSINESS MAKING THINGS!!!" to yourself. Are there any specific methods you want to share about boosting your self-esteem or confidence, both short- and long-term? 
On Still Untitled you mentioned the idea for Adam's Bookclub. Maybe you meant this as a joke, but I am legit excited for this idea. Mainly because your interests are interesting to me and your recommendations have never failed me. Is there a chance this will become something for real? 
Hey Adam,  What's something about you that we don't know?  Thanks! I loved Mythbusters growing up and I can't wait to show it to my kids one day. 
Hey Adam! Im a big fan of your one day builds on tested.  I think it's because I see a lot of myself in the way you work.  One problem that I frequently have is getting caught up in the energy of building so much that organization goes completely out the window.  Any tips for keeping the enthusiasm while also being organized? 
Hi Adam,   Out of all the things you've had to build over the years. Are there any builds that you regret finishing? Ya know the, "this was not a great idea after all" moment.   
Can we get a hint or two as to what we can expect from your Brain Candy tour? 
Did you want to make things for a living as a kid? (I mean was that the job you had in mind back then?) 
Hi Adam, greetings from a very cold UK!  My question is, how do you think improvements in virtual reality could impact on your work? Would you ever wish to "zone in" to a virtual reality space of a project you are working on and physically manipulate the object(s) in real time?  Also, if you haven't already, watch the new series of Black Mirror on Netflix. I feel it's something you'd likely enjoy. 
What's in your CD Player/MP3 player/Music Device today? 
Is Peter Jackson's collection as awesome and deep as the rumors imply?  
Hello Adam!  What moment during the making of Mythbusters did you feel the greatest sense of 'I may have just broken the universe'? 
Hey Adam, I discovered Tested this year and it's fair to say that it has changed the way I think creatively and my approach towards Costuming as a hobby or a career.  After developing an interest in your costumes and props I decided that I wanted to start to make my own, I then made a C3PO costume for comic con and came second place but since then I've not stopped wanting to make things. Problem is, I'm not sure what area of the industry to pursue. I'm really interested in costume, both sewn and built, but all university courses seem to ask you to pick one specific thing and hone in your skills on that.  How would you say is the best way to approach a career in this field successfully? Should I get really good at one thing in particular? Or is there a way to gain a broader skill set like yourself?  Thanks  
Hey Adam do you think we will ever get more of a tour of your house like you promised ?  
Hi Adam, I walked up to you at the a cappella convention in Memphis last year and asked for a picture, and soon after realized you probably just wanted to watch the performances in peace, so I'm sorry about that.    I guess my question would be how you feel about fans approaching you?  It seems to be polarizing to people with a following, so I was wondering what your take on it is.   
Hey Mister Savage,  I teach UX Design and have often found that the medium changes, but design and it's core principles stay the same.   Can you give a quote on what design means to you?  
Hi Adam! The maker community tends to be very inclusive and supportive of certain rights (ex: to repair and modify things that you own). Do you have any suggestions as to how the maker community can organize to be more politically involved but while staying non-partisan? 
How adorable is Norm's puppy? And can you post more pictures of him?  
How did you get your start with sewing and leatherworking? Your Kylo Ren piece and your other cosplay pieces have been really impressive. I'm trying to pick up a handcraft, but trying to avoid heavy machinery because I am a klutz. Love your one day builds! 
Dear Adam Savage Are you ever going to do a pepakura build like a suit halo Spartan armor or some  iron man armor? - Adam Shuttleworth 
Do you know my great uncle Michael lynch, he's told me stories of you since I was young. Do you know him? 
I've seen several AMAs from you over the years.  Do you do these when people ask, or just wake up some mornings and think "I wanna answer some questions today?" 
Do you write out fully sketched profiles of characters before you start the plot? 
Hey Bob, loved your books and show growing up. Can you give me a sentence that will scare me as an adult? 
How do you feel about the goosebumps movie? I grew up reading goosebumps, now i love horror as an adult...thank you. 
Was season 1 episode 8 of the television series, "My Hairiest Adventure," meant as a puberty allegory?  You da man, Bob!  
Happy Halloween! Loved the Goosebumps series growing up! Thanks for playing a big part in my childhood. On a side note, love hearing your voice on R.L. Grime's Halloween mixes. How did he reach out to you, and have you actually listened to any of his mixes?  
How do you begin writing a story?  How much is Romantic inspiration and how much is pragmatic design/planning?   
Mr. Stine, thank you for doing this! I'm a little starstruck, you were one of my favourite authors as a kid.  Two questions for you:  1. Who is your favourite horror author, besides yourself?  2. How do you feel about the Goosebumps TV show that aired in the '90's?  Thanks! 
Where did the idea for Slappy come from, and why does he seem to be a mastermind puppeteer?  
Every time I watch Wheel of Fortune and they give the most common letters (RLSTNE), I think about you.  Is that where you got your Pen Name from? 
Oh. My. God.  1st I love you, you basically raised me - I've read every single Goosebumps multiple times.  **Can you explain your method for writing choose your own adventures??** Do you just start with one storyline and then add others? Do they happen separately or at the same time?   I have some very very well worn in 'give yourself goosebumps' books and I always loved how the different options really felt natural and none of them stuck out as awkward   
What is the best memory you have from working on Eureka's Castle? 
Hello, Mr. Stine. Thank you for being part of my childhood. The books still give me the creeps to this day. The ones that scared me the most were the Monster Blood books. How did you come up with the idea of a substance that could be so terrifying? 
Wow. My son has read over a hundred Goosebumps books in the last few months. I wish he was home today to ask you a few questions but I will ask for him. How do you come up with scary ideas, but still make make them appropriate for kids?  Also, what is your favorite series that you have written? 
What was the worst character you've ever written?  
How are you? Have you been getting good sleep? Eating right?  
hello this is chuck tingle i am the best author in billings and PROUD DAD here is question:  you have proved love with important books MY DUMMY IS HANDSOME and THERES A HAND IN THE BASEMENT, showing that love is real for both dummys and hands. do you have any ideas for books that prove love is real for handsome unicorns or are do you believe they are too cute to be scary? (i disagree with this way but i would like to hear your opinion) 
How often do you look back at a book, and wish you had done something differently? 
What was your favourite book to write?   Where do you draw inspiration?   Do you miss the TV series they did from your books? 
How's the relationship between you and Henry (RL Grime)? How's the interaction for the Halloween mix go down? You just send him a demo of you saying whatever you want? 
Man I wrote you back in like 2003 for some middle school book project on that goosebumps book about a robot and choosing your own adventure and I never got a response... All the other kids got a response... Why you make me cry?  
I grew up reading Fear Street, and I absolutely loved them. Any plans to write any more of that series? 
I'm Marcus, 9 years old and your biggest fan.  I was wondering if you were tormented as a kid?  How did you come up with your ideas?  They are really creepy.  Thank you for being you.  
Any memorable stories from when you meant Stephen King that weren't covered in the media?   
Hello Mr. Stine!  Your books were a huge source of my love of reading as a child which has developed into adulthooed, especially the books regarding Chucky. My question is what is the source of your inspirations, and do you use your books to share any messages that you find important for kids? 
Hi, Bob,  Goosebumps was such a big part of my life when I was a kid. I grew up in a poor family so we didn't have much in the way of technology or electronics, but my mom still managed to give me a bit of an allowance, and I saved every penny for when my school got the Scholastic book catalog so I could order more Goosebumps books. They brought be hours upon hours of entertainment and joy. I am grateful beyond my ability to express myself.  I have a couple questions. Feel free to answer any or none of them.  How did you come up with the Give Yourself Goosebumps book? How did they compare to writing standard books?  If you could choose one Goosebumps book to live in, which one would you pick?  Which book gave you the most trouble while writing? (Writer's block etc.) 
How close was Jack black's portrayal of you in the movie? 
If you could re-write any of your books for an adult audience, which would it be? 
Governors Johnson and Weld, What is the campaign's strategy to get into the debates if you are not at 15% in the CPD polls. Is there a backup plan, or any other leverage or influence you have that could get you in? 
Governor Johnson- what inspired you to switch party allegiance from Republican to Libertarian?  Governor Weld- what made you want to join the Libertarian party? 
Do you believe it is the role of the US government to maintain hundreds of military bases all over the world? 
You've made clear that marijuana legalization is a priority.  What about other vices that create black markets, like gambling, specifically sports gambling?  Prostitution?   
Hi, Governor Johnson. If you are elected, what do you hope your legacy will be seen as after your term?  Best of luck and thank you for being a voice of reason!  
Governor Johnson, Governor Weld, thank you for doing this AMA. I would like to ask two questions:  1. It is abundantly clear that America has a healthcare problem. Americans pay far more than any other Western nation for healthcare, and it is a leading cause of bankrupcy. What is your plan to address this issue, if elected?  2. What do you feel your strongest states are? Where will you two be campaigning, and where do you think you have the best chance of winning? 
Gov. Johnson, you've said that you love the Game of Thrones. If you could be one of the characters who would you be and why?  
Governor Johnson, I am an avid fan and a potential voter of yours. I must know:  If elected, would you work to abolish the electoral college? Would you also consider replacing our system of plurality voting with the Borda Count Method or even rank-choice voting as Dr. Jill Stein does? 
What is your view/stance on the North Dakota Native American protesters that have been attacked near the pipeline? 
If you do not get into the 1st debate (and at this point, I'm assuming you will NOT be invited to IAVA either :-(  ), would you consider using video of those debates, and have your answers edited into them to share publicly? Alternatively, could you and Gov. Weld at least put out a release with your answers to the questions posed to Trump and Clinton? It would be wonderful to have something to share with your replies to the same questions. 
Governor Gary Johnson,  Do you support the ban on kratom?  The DEA is attempting emergency scheduling of the plant kratom.  Thousands of people use this herb for everything from kicking addictions to chronic pain to enhancing their concentration (small doses have a  slight stimulant effect).  Sept. 30th many people will no longer have access to something that allows them to carry on with their lives.   
Hello Governors, thanks for taking time out of your evenings to do an AMA with us. While I am optimistic that you will allowed into the presidential debates, I have two questions. What is your campaign's backup plan if you are not invited? You have said it is game over if you do not get in, however many of your supporters here have advocated for an alternate event if you don't meet the arbitrary 15% requirement. Have you considered partnering with someone like Netflix or another high profile medium to bring an alternate third party debate to viewers, in response to the mainstream televised debate? I think the demand is there and could be a very effective option. 
Gov. Johnson, you have stated repeatedly that you want to cut the US's military spending. As a US Soldier, I actually support this, but how do you plan to make the cuts? If left up to the individual forces, I'm sure the men and women serving will be the one who bear the brunt of the cuts. How will you simultaneously cut the military budget, and protect the interests of our service members?  
Gov. Johnson, my biggest problem with the election is that even with two horrible choices, the general media coverage still ignores 3rd parties.  What can we do and what are you doing to get the attention you deserve?  
Gov. Gary Johnson, I'm a huge Libertarian supporter and you surely have my vote. I'm wondering if you could explain your policy on privatized prisons. I realize that the private sector is usually better and more efficient at allocating resources but wouldn't privatized prisons lead to the desire (by prison owners) to have more and more prisoners and to keep costs low? Please explain? 
What is your stance on nuclear energy? Do you think we should lift the ban on constructing new/more efficient nuclear power plants? 
Governors Johnson and Weld, thanks so much for doing this. You two have mentioned before that your presidency would be a two man team. Could one of you describe how a partnership like that would operate? 
I have a question for the both of you.....what are your favorite science fiction films?   
Hello Governors, former Bernie supporter who converted to you two here, and I'm so glad to have two sane individuals on the ballot this year!  I have two questions.  1. Would you support efforts to end government sactioned cable company monopolies that reduce competition in the market?  2. Do you support net neutrality? I don't see it as government interference, just merely a way to ensure the free market exists online. Do you feel the same way?  Thanks so much for your time! I'm proud to be doing everything I can to get you to 15%! I believe in you guys! 
Governor Johnson,   The DEA recently announced they are adding Kratom; a plant leaf used by hundreds of thousands of Americans to treat pain, anxiety, and opiate addiction; to the list of schedule 1 drugs without hearings, public comment, or congressional review. Given the disastrous consequences of the war on drugs; how do you feel about this latest action? 
I'd ask...  If your movie got pulled?...why are they still running promos for it every 15 minutes? 
This will be the best selling straight to DVD film ever 
Isn't this where Anonymous saves the day and counter attacks the hackers? 
Do you think that The Interview should be instead released as a PPV showing so that people can watch it in the safety of their own homes? 
If North Korea is the actual perpetrators behind these attacks, why give into their demands? They've threatened to bring force before but failed to follow through every single time. What makes this threat any different?  
For the North Koreans to be able to pull off any kind of a terrorist act next week on the proposed lunch date they would have to have personnel on the ground and ready right now. If this is the case don't you think they will redirect them to some other target in the US?  Don't you think it's amazing that a country that can't even launch a missile in the ocean next to them now suddenly has the capability to put a commando squad on US soil? 
What's next on the plate?  Maybe a film about Putin? 
Even Kim Jong Il had a sense of humor, did he threaten to blow up theatres over Team America? NO! Seriously, I bet he even owned a copy of the film (and possibly had an edited ending) BUT STILL! Kimmy needs to grow up and Sony needs to let their balls drop.  Do you think this film is more controversial than Team America? 
What Sony should do is release the movie for free to the world and claim that other hackers released it! I'd pay money 
Guys what if this is another publicity stunt. Think about it- a movie causing so much ruckus that it has to be pulled and then it ends up coming back out? You know how many people would have to see that! 
You guys worried for your safety. Must be disappointing and i am sorry for that. was going to watch it. looked funny.  
They should release it and just call the guy and the country different names. Now everyone knows who it really is about.

But seriously -- If the film was hacked because it made fun of Kim Jong-Un, the next best step is to unleash massive meme/photoshop wars and disseminate absurd amounts of satirical pictures through the internet.  Hackers can attack a company, but not an army of individuals. Crowdforce unite. 
Is anybody else Pissed off at how easy Sony and the theatre chains caved to terrorist threats?  
Will you release it as an extra in the next movie you guys make and sell? I really wanted to see this. = / 
I don't get how they got pissed at this movie but they weren't pissed about Team America 
They are laying low, not going to happen.  Sony is throwing their movie under the bus.  That most likely means there will be lawsuits over this movie since people will still want to get paid.  No one is going to be talking publicly about this movie. 
How can I support you guys and your movie?  It pisses me off that the threats got the movie pulled.  Comedy is a part of democracy and free speech.  Play this movie everywhere for everyone.  
They should just release the movie as VOD.   North Korea can't possibly attack every single household, can it?  
I'm a lil curious if anyone besides me thinks this could be a giant publicity stunt in order to hype the fuck out of this movie and boost numbers? I wanted to see it before this whole thing went down, but now I'm slightly hesitant.  My suggestion is just too put it out straight to download. I'll buy it. I know that. 
I think some "Hackers" (Cough Cough Sony) should release the movie online for free as a big fuck you. They complied with their demands. There are no theaters showing the movie. It just so happens that someone else hacked into their website and stole the fully completed movie.  
Have you watched any movies about the Holocaust or would that be difficult? 
I am a pre service history and English teacher. What is something you'd want all teachers to talk about when teaching their students about the Holocaust?  
what was the ride to the camp like, were you aware of what awaited you, and if not when did you realize ? 
Thank you for doing this.   In your opinion, how accurate was the movie *Schindler's List*? 
What was the transition back to civilian life like, after spending three years in concentration camps? 
What kinds of foods were snuck in for special secret meals? If ever?  
what stand out experience do you remember whilst you were in the camp? 
Hello Mr Flescher,  Firstly thankyou so much for doing this AMA :) Just a question regarding post liberation from the camps, How did you feel returning home afterwards? what was the general attitude surrounding jewish survivors?   
What was the first thing you did once you were liberated? 
Were you consumed by hate towards those who did it to you?  Have you ever managed to forgive them? 
Thank you for this AMA. My grandparents are both survivors. Grandfather was from Warsaw and liberated at Auschwitz. Grandmother was luckily hid by a German family in a sub-basement along with her parents and sister. She suffered many gunshot wounds while running. My grandfather sadly past away 12 years ago but I was always very proud of what he made of himself knowing where he came from.   That said here is my question for you, from my 86 year old grandmother: "Is he single?"  
Hi Mr. Flescher,   Thanks for doing this AMA, it will be interesting.   I know multiple people who survived the holocaust. The founding rabbi of my synagogue survived by switching lines from the one going to the showers to the work line. So my question is, how did you make it through such horror? 
You mentioned you were 70 lbs when you were liberated. I'm a dietitian and have an interest in those initial weeks when you began to eat more. Was there any process for refeeding people that you are aware of? What did your diet consist of after you were liberated? How long until you reached a normal, functioning weight? Thanks so much! 
Did average people anywhere realize at any point exactly what Hitler was doing when he had Jews and other outlying members of society taken from the populace? Was there a clear idea to people?  
Did you have any residual mental health problems after you were liberated? Such as PTSD  anxiety or depression . 
Do you ever feel pressured to act in a certain way or live up to certain expectations, given your experiences? When I think of other survivors like Elie Wiesel, it seems that there is great reverence towards him and that people might expect survivors to be wise and always act kindly. Especially volunteering at the museum you do or giving speeches, I wonder if you ever feel as though you are living in a fish bowl and must act in a certain way.  
Hi Mr. Flescher, my grandparent were killed in the holocaust, luckily they sent my Dad to Palestine, later Israel. My question: Were all the guards terrible or did any of the guards show any humanity or compassion? 
Have you ever considered writing a book? It seems ludicrous, but there are still deniers out there who claim the holocaust never happened and every documented account helps.  
Thank for doing  this AMA. My grandfather was an Austrian Jew, but he managed to escape Europe. However, all of his family, except for one brother, didn't make it. He died before I was born, and as far as I know,  he never found out what happened to them (he also didn't like talking about it, according to my mother). My question is, what resources (specific to Austrian Jews) would you recommend that I use to research what happened to his family? Unfortunately, I do have very limited information, except some names. Thanks again.  Update: I have now learned that my grandfather's parents died in Chelmno.    
Hello Mr. Flescher, thank you so much for sharing your experiences here on Reddit today. Was there ever a point in the camps where you felt like you couln't go on, and if so, what thought or hope kept you going? Have you ever returned to any of the camps years later to see how the Holocaust is represented to travelers in Europe, or is the thought of doing so utterly abhorrent to you? 
Might be a stupid question but I'm going for it.  Did you believe in  a god before?  And do you believe in one now?  
Hello Mr. Flescher,   I am from Germany, where denying the Holocaust is a crime and can get you a prison sentence. What is your opinion on this law?  
Have you ever been standing in a store or walking past a person and seen their tattooed numbers on their arm?  If so, did you approach them and talk or show yours?  Also, belated happy birthday, Pisces. You share the day with Albert Einstein.   May you continue to enjoy all the best health, wealth, and happiness-thank you for sharing your lifestory with the world (hugs) 
Damn, you look amazing for 92. Have any aging secrets? I hope to look as good as you at your age. 
Hello Mr. Flescher.   This might be on the other side of the spectrum, and I truly admire your courage to talk and relieve what happened here. My grandfather, in the strange way the world works, was an SS general stationed at the *Blechhammer*. I read in a diary after his dead that he stood guard over "gate 2" and watched over the *Judenlager*, the specific part was for women. Even though I never met him the shame has always been important for my family and we deeply disconnected in many ways. I know he also committed murders at the camp.  My question to you is: *Do you consider the families, offspring and heirs to these men, the minds behind the crimes, to be in any way, shape or form, responsible for what happened, or how it should be handled? Do you have any advice for someone like me?".  Thank you. 
Hello Mr. Flescher,   Thank you do much for doing this AMA.   My question: Is there anything you regret doing while you were in the concentration/labor camps? Anything you would take back of you could?  You are an inspiration and living proof of the resilience of humans. I hope life has treated you well since you were liberated.    
What was it like immediately following your release? I've heard stories that some prisoners were made to stay in the camps for a time as the allies did not know where to place them (albeit under better conditions). Any of that true? How much say did you have as to where you went once released and how long did it take you to get back into any sort of normal living situation.   Thanks for the AMA! 
Hi Mr Fleshcer! Thank you for doing this AMA, and so happy that you've been able to live your life to the fullest.   My question is:   Did you ever create a plan to attempt an escape from the camp, or did you ever witness a successful/failed escape plan? If so, what are the details? Thank you!   
I'm an American Jew and I wanted to thank you for sharing your story. Both of my grandfathers fought for the United States in the war. My question is, that as unfortunately more and more survivors and veterans are passing away, what do you feel is the most important thing that we carry on for future generations? How can we take one of the darkest parts of human history and learn something from it? 
Anne Frank would have been 87 this year, have you read her diary? If so, how did it affect you personally?  
Sir, can you describe your first thoughts when you realized you were finally free and had survived?  
How did your family in the US (your brother) react after finding out what happened to you? 
Mr. Fletcher-  We're you captured-sorry for lack of a better term-in Germany or another country? I've always wondered when Jewish people and other groups that were interned started to become aware of Hitler and the Nazi's horrific agenda, especially in Germany. Wishing you happiness your remaining days. Thank you and God Bless. 
From what I've been told of how systematic the processes were for killing and dehumanizing victims such as your self, those camps and the men who designed them were nothing short of pure evil. So my question is regarding the Nazis who were stationed there and tasked with executing these horrible plans. Given the number of Germans that it must have taken to staff one of these camps (let alone all of them) it is statistically improbable that every last one of them was a psychopath.   My question is this: What did you make of the "normal" soldiers who were ordered to carry this out? Did you ever see any of them show any signs of regret or reluctance for what they did? Did you get the chance to see how they rationalized the things that took place in the camps? 
Thanks for sharing your story, Mr. Flescher. I've grown up attending many Holocaust commemorations, and the refrain has often been simply to 'remember.' What would you want the next generation to learn about the Holocaust besides 'remembering' it? 
Mr.Flascher,  I have a family member that survived Dr.Mengele's experiments in Auschwitz- she refused to discuss her experience, which is understandable. But hearing these stories, answering questions first hand is what this world needs as a daily reminder of how close this world was to losing an entire religion and culture that has played a pivotal roll in history. The fact anyone can still even question the truth of these events, shows we need to do a better as a whole, to teach and make sure this can't happen again. To anyone.   My question to you is, have you ever met or interviewed or "ran into" a former Nazi and questioned him?  Also- is there a reflex or a habit that you developed during your experiences that has stayed with you to this day? (i.e eating your food quickly, or sleeping on the floor etc)  I thank you tremendously for taking the time to do this AMA, much love and respect for you and your family.  
Do you remember any groups wearing the pink triangle?  If so, how were they treated compared to the other prisoners? 
We all know these were slaughter houses, but how does a person (and your not the only one) go on to survive several of these slaughter houses.   Some people survived several years in camps that were killing all day everyday, how? Also why did they bother moving people that seems alot of work.   Thanks!  
My late grandfather was in Buchenwald. If I post a photo and a name, do you think you would be able to remember if you saw him? I know the chances are small. There was one survivor who knew of my grandfather when I mentioned his name, but he died before I could interview him a lot.  
What was it like living in Vienna before the war? How did you see the non-Jewish Austrians who were not taken to camps but knew about the persecution of Jewish people?   Thank you very much for sharing your experiences - I know my great-grandfather came from Germany around 1900 and his family is now probably lost because of the war. Thanks for telling us what things were like back then. 
How were you treated in the camps? Is everything we hear about yhe holocaust true, or is some exaggerated? At what time were you placed into the camps, and when did you get out? What was daily life like? How do you feel when people today compare things to the holocaust? 
Hey Mr. Flescher, I'm a high school senior that is preparing to go to college next year. Naturally this stresses my mother out a bit, and has led her to push a lot of "teachings" on me before I'm on my own.  One topic that she pushes quite regularly is how she thinks that I should only date Jewish women so that when I fall in love with one and eventually have kids with her those kids are Jewish. When I asked her why my kids has to be Jewish she said that it is my responsibility to replace the numbers of those lost during the holocaust. What are your thoughts on a statement like that? 
Hello Mr. Flescher,  Do you have hope that nothing as atrocious as the holocaust will ever take place again, or do you think it's still possible for something similar to happen in the future? 
Mr. Flescher, thank you for doing this AMA. I actually have two questions.   1) As a black jewish person, I've been told that there were hundreds of thousands of blacks killed in the holocaust. Did you come across any yourself? If so, did their treatment differ from yours?  2) I once made the mistake of asking my Hebrew school teacher what the numbers on her arm meant. Seeing her cry was one of the most devastating moments of my life. How do you respond when a child asks what your tattooed numbers mean? 
Hi Henry, I've wanted to ask someone in your situation this question for a while. What would be your thoughts if one of your grandchildren were to tattoo your number on them in the future? Would you be insulted? Do you find that disrespectful? I apologise if this has already been asked. 
I have two young kids. How do you recommend I educate my children about the Holocaust? 
Thank you so much for doing this AMA, it is so important to teach people about the Holocaust, especially those who aren't as exposed to it.   When I was in Poland I learned of Jews who returned to their pre-WWII homes after the Holoacaust and were later murdered in pogroms. I've heard of other cases of post-Holocaust anti-Semitism directed at other survivors who moved to the US, UK, or then Palestine.  Did you experience any post-Holocaust anti-Semitism? How were you treated by people who didn't go through the horrors that you went through after you were liberated? 
If you could tell holocaust deniers one thing, what would it be? 
Hi Mr. Fletcher! I am very happy to see such a unique and interesting AMA today. It must have been terrible to go through everything you've been in.  Here's my question: did you receive any kindness from any Nazi soldiers? I heard many times there were people that joined the Nazis just to survive, but decided to help people in small ways to ease their pain a little. 
Which 4 books did you use and in what order?  Did you have a history of programming?   I'd love to know where to start. 
The only question that actually matters: do you indent with tabs or spaces? 
Do you have an example of your code? (not necessarily the code you wrote for these apps.)  Mostly I'm curious how far you've managed to get in 18 months. I find that most people who start learning how to program don't actually get very far and level off quickly. They seem to get stuck writing procedural code and never learn software engineering architecture. Though I suspect you may have pushed yourself to actually learning OOP and Design Patterns and Architecture and things like Unit Testing / TDD.   
What do you credit as the biggest resource that allowed you to be successful at programming, and how do you rate resources such as Code Academy? 
Did you have do anything to protect yourself and your development from the minor hockey team you first intended to use it for? Like claims that it should be exclusively theirs?   
How much of your own money did you spend before making money? 
This is awesome, did you make a lot of $$$ from it? 
What was your educational background before you started programming? 
I started coding apps 1.5 years ago, and am doing very well. However, I have reached the point where I'd prefer some more advanced content to follow rather than Big Nerd Ranch - Any materials you could share that are practical, yet significantly more advanced (tutorials)? 
What color Lamborghini are you going to buy first? 
How old are you? I'm a 30 year old civil engineer and I sometimes feel like my mind is not "plastic" enough to learn something new.  
Hi congrats on the app and more importantly teaching yourself a valuable new skill. Have you received any flack from purist event attendees who don't believe audience members should be encouraged to be waving their phones around all night?  
Did you enjoy working with Clemson? How much work did you do with them?  I am an undergrad there in compsci 
As someone who frequently has ideas for apps but has no idea how to get them off the ground is this  more of a hobby or a job for you? 
Can you share what languages youve studied to make the apps? Thanks! 
Just want to say I saw your app in use an Purdue and Notre dame basketball games at it was pretty awesome. Since I need a question, what caused you to find this programs out initially? Alumni connections or what? 
So, here's the sad story about a Graphic Design Engineer who really never got the hang of programming.   You could say it's because I have some sort of reserve for it, like it's some magical ancient lore that mortals like myself cannot understand/use. On top of that, I don't exactly have that much free time around thanks to my 12 hr job.    This has caused me to not even know how to HTML5 or CSS properly (I kind of go guessing around) even though I want to create websites or modify my Tumblr blog to look decent.      Where or how can I start to learn the necessary tools for proper web design/programming?  
Does it offend you when /r/NBA complains about the NBA app? Or is that on the NBA itself? 
Dude! This is incredible!!  What was the biggest struggle you faced that you never saw coming?? 
There's been a lot of talk recently about the need to further monetize reddit in order to ensure it's financial longevity - what kinds of steps do you think need to be taken?  Do you have any ideas or goals about how to approach this? 
When were you asked if you wanted to be the new CEO? 
Hey Steve!  Weekly, or at least semi-regular, AMAs are an awesome idea.  Maybe different admin teams at reddit could step up and do some too!    Any thoughts on how reddit should prioritize the needs of brand new users (who may find various aspects of reddit's design complicated and confusing) with the needs of core users and mods (who reddit relies on for its great content and dankest of memes)? 
Are there any specific plans for the Alien Blue app that you can share? 
I'm the current owner of /r/SteveHuffman. Any ideas with what I should do with it? I'm lost right now. 
Is it okay if we use Reddit gold as our Greek Currency ? 
Do you plan on reviewing your policy on shadowbanning users? From my understanding this was first implemented as a measure to prevent spam bots from knowing they have been silenced, but has since been expanded to everyday users without there knowledge. Is there any new system in the works were a user being banned would be let know that they   1) have been banned   2)what the ban was for 
Will any of the policy changes under Ellen Pao actually be reverted or was she really just used as a scapegoat for these unpopular changes that would have happened anyway? 
How would you define the current culture at Reddit?  Is it in line with where you want it to be? 
Hi Steve!  So, AFAIK you'll remain the CTO of Hipmunk. Do you think that you can realistically manage two jobs of this caliber at the same time? How will you arrange that? 
Heard about the incident with the /r/AMD subreddit? If so, what do you think about it? 
You could have had any username you wanted. Why'd you go with spez? 
Are /u/kickme444 and Reddit Gifts coming back?  Please tell me Christmas isn't dead. 
Are you threatened by Voat? Do you see it as reddit alternative as reddit was Digg alternative? 
Please don't do them weekly. Maybe monthly or bi-monthly.   What's your plan on policing vote-brigading in the future? Do you have some way to automatically track vote brigades and people taking part in them? 
Since I am sure this question will be asked 100 times during the course of this AMA, let me be the first:  Will you be bringing Victoria back on board? 
Finally caught one of these right when it started!  What are your plans for an official Reddit Android app? 
Steve, I'm a huge fan and I'd like to ask what your thoughts are about reddit being a potential game changer in politics and pop culture. Do you believe that the reddit community has an ability to sway public opinion and policy? Did you intend this when you created reddit? 
So, you're my new boss. When are you planning to stop by "The Annex"?  In case you don't know, The Annex is the coolest, hippest, most jovial corner of the reddit offices. We have candied treats, art, pigeons, and even a sister city (flint, michigan)! 
Besides r/cannibals, what are some of your favorite subreddits? 
Can we change usernames? Now that reddit is becoming more popular and is cited in mainstream media, I can't be commenting as handsinpant. 
 Hi Steve nice to meet you. Would you rather fight 1000 duck sized horses, or one horse sized duck? Thank you.  
What's the most ridiculous thing you've found so far? 
When you guys saw the scope of what you were uncovering, did you worry that releasing information against powerful people would cause you issues? 
What data, in your opinion so far, has been the least reported on by mainstream media that has the largest consequences? 
How does working on such a secretive project impact your personal lives? for instance what do you tell someone when they ask how your day at work has been, or what you've been working on.  
Fair play to you and all your colleagues for sharing this info with the world. My question is: when this information was given to you initially, what was your reaction? Were you worried it was all false and how difficult was it to verify the information? Thanks! 
Thanks for doing this and your work. On the TV show Lanz you mentioned that Edward Snowden broke the news before you could. Do you know who of your colleagues told him and if him tweeting about it was an accident? 
At the peak, how many people have had to dig through the source material to find things? 
Are you worried in any way about your future careers? 
Hello, I am a journalist (But compared to your work I feel like Rob Schneider telling Anthony Hopkins that he's also an actor). Thanks for helping rebuild public trust in journalism, you guys are heroes in the newsroom.   Anyways, something I've been dying to know:   There's obviously great importance to investigative journalism, but such meager resources for journalists in most newsrooms. What was your workload like? How much time did this take on your average day, and was it on top of your regular duties?  I'm seriously geeking out, I love everything about this story. I hope there's a book someday, and the inevitable movie.  
Any idea why there are practically speaking no high profile Americans subject to the panama papers leak? Do we suspect there is another company out there they must be using? Do we suspect any one specifically of harboring them? Or, are there americans subject to the panama leak most haven't heard of?  
Do you know why SZ newspaper was chosen in particular as opposed to say Wikileaks?  
What advice can you give someone hoping to get into investigative  journalism, and where do you see the field going from where it is now? 
How do you deal with the people saying that this whole leak was plannend by western media to hurt Russia? 
How much more do you think is lurking in the dataset that you haven't discovered yet? Or, how are you thinking about this problem of determining when you're "done"? 
Did you get contacted by intelligences services in order to negociate and to hide some of the info?  
How are you balancing requests from official investigators with the confidentiality of your source? I assume you have gotten tons of requests for insight from officials investigating people and organizations mentioned in the documents. They likely want evidence other then your articles but giving them full access or even revealing the source to them might harm the journalistic work exposing these people and may even reveal the source. Especially since many of these documents could be presented as official evidence in court. 
Thank you really for your work!  How did you coordinate the work with the other 400 journalists? 
I am from Egypt, part of the Middle Eastern region. Were there any media, news or journalistic organization that you trusted and worked with within Egypt or the middle east for the Panama papers research?  Let me rephrase the question. Were any organizations from Egypt or the Middle East considered but the conclusion or trust wasn't satisfactory?  Me being part of this region and always hearing about corruption, I've always wondered how our media, whether Egypt or Middle East collectively is seen, globally.  Especially since some of the Panama papers have direct impact on our region.  Thank you and keep up the great work. 
How do you react regarding the accusations that you would release the informations in a way that important and influential people in the western countries would not be burdened at all or - at least - not at first? Do the leaks just contain fewer information about people in western countries? 
Hi, guys great Ama, my question is. Is it true that not all names will be released? Are there more ecuadorians besides the ones currently in you page?  Some days ago ecuadorian president Rafael Correa said great things will come out of this, now will see who is who, probably talking about his opposition who mostly are bussiness men and bankers and next year we have elections so it will be important to know who can we trust. 
I think I may already know the answer to this, but did you ever consider involving any international intelligence agencies such as the CIA to aid in your investigation?  If not, why? 
I'd first like to say thank you for all the work you have done in the past year (and all the work that still needs to be done).   My question is how did it feel once the Panama Papers were released? How did co-workers/family that had to be kept in the dark react?  Thanks for doing this and also maybe check out /r/PanamaPapers we would love to get your help/opinions over there! 
What was your first reaction after finding this out? How much did it motivate you to go to work everyday, if at all? 
Do you guys see your work ending up in a movie, just like Academy Award Winner Spotlight? Would you like it to end up in movie? 
You mentioned that fonseca refers to some of their high profile clients as Harry Potter or whinny the pooh, could you give more examples and also link the the real person?   
Are there safeguards in place to make sure that information about prominent businesspeople and/or politicians are not suppressed? 
Why aren't any notable Americans implicated in the Panama Papers? 
Of all the food you have been offered, have you ever refused a certain type of food? 
Whenever the question comes up "If you could switch lives with anyone in the world, who would it be?" - my answer is always Anthony Bourdain. You seem to have lived such a full, adventurous and unique life. Thanks for making great shit for all these years.  My question is, if you could switch places with anyone in the world, who would it be and why? 
From all the places you have visited, what would be the place you would like to live after retirement? 
Is there anything about you, your life's work, or your personality that you think didn't translate well or at all on television?  
What is the most unexpected "foodie" city in the US?  
Has anything ever happened while filming any of your shows that scared the crap out of you? 
I see you're drinking a $150 bottle of scotch. How is it? 
Re: Raw Craft: What thing that you made yourself, other than food, are you most proud of, and why? 
What countries have you not visited that you want to? 
Hi Anthony,  Huge fan of your work.  How often do people see you in bars and offer to buy you a drink? What are the odds if we ever crossed paths you'd drink with a random fan? 
Did you get to keep your Bob Kramer knife from series 1 of Raw Craft? And do you still use it? 
Hey Tony, you're on your last $20 EVER.  Where do you go to eat and drink in NYC?  
* Have you been back to the Waffle House? * How do you take your hash browns? 
Do you ever feel ridiculous if you have to make reservations? 
Hi Mr. Bourdain. What's the coolest shit you found? 
Tony, you really inspired me to travel the world. I spent 6 months backpacking in Southeast Asia last year and always made a point to seek out restaurants you'd visited. Thanks for what you do.      That said, how do you feel about the impact of a small local restaurant appearing on your shows? Do you ever make a point to not reveal the location of a restaurant?      I remember visiting the Soup Lady in Saigon, and it had become a pretty big tourist hot spot. This wasn't the case everywhere you'd been, but the impact was definitely visible at times. 
What is your favorite way to alter a cheap, supermarket-bought, processed item to make it palatable (e.g. boxed Mac and Cheese, Ramen, etc.)? You know, for bachelors. And broke people. 
Mr. Bourdain, as a young aspiring chef I have heard that many restaurants don't really care about culinary school experience, if this is the case, what do you look for (other than experience) in a chef when you are hiring?  Also, all I ever hear people talk about when I mention that I want to be a chef is how awful the industry is, what are some of the upsides to working in food? 
How's your BJJ training going?  How's the wear and tear on you from the training? 
Hey Anthony, I love your shows I was just curious how you felt about the drug addiction situation that is going on, especially in the north east, at this time? Also your favorite dish to cook! 
You monologue musings are fantastic. Do other writers assist or is it all from the brain of Bourdain?   What do you do to get in the mood for writing?   Any inspirations like Three Stooges and a martini? Nature? Poetry? Meditation? Mushrooms?  Besides just practicing, how can someone become a better writer? 
How is your food court/night market concept going? I'm super excited for it to open! 
You were once quoted as saying "I understand there's a guy in me who wants to lay in bed, smoke weed all day and watch cartoons and old movies. My whole life is a series of strategium men's to avoid, and outwit, that guy."  Could you share some of your stratagems for staying motivated and successful? 
When will you be on Joe Rogan's podcast again? It's been too long and I'm starting to itch. 
Any chance of Rogan being on an episode that has some sort of BJJ segment or theme? 
If you could have dinner with any three people, alive or dead, who would they be? 
Love No Reservations...yum...Balvenie...sooo good.  is scotch your "go-to" drink?  
Big fan. What is your favorite place to eat in Chicago? 
I love your shows, Anthony! My parents really got me into watching your awesome experiences. We travel thru Louisiana a ton for vacation/family and was wanting to ask what's your favorite cajun dish, and or favorite places to eat at while in New Orleans? 
If you were to change one thing about the world what would it be and do you think your fame would help? 
Which actors do you want to work with in the future?  
What does Hedwig do now that the movies are all over? 
Hi Dan!! Where is the most obscure place you have ever gotten recognized? 
Hello Daniel! If you could be any book or comic character beside Harry Potter, who would you be? 
Hey Daniel! What are you going to be for Halloween? 
Not including Harry Potter, who is your favorite character in the franchise? 
Someone asked me my favourite food: Cheeseburgers. And pizza, and stuff like that. Because I don't believe when people say anything else is their favourite food, I tend not to believe them.  
Daniel, did you keep anything from the set of Harry Potter? 
What is the weirdest thing someone has asked you to sign?  
Something I've been really impressed with lately is that it seems like all of the kids that grew up acting in Harry Potter ended up very grounded and intelligent (this came to mind in particular when I saw an excerpt of an interview where you questioned how quickly people sexualized Emma Watson as soon as she turned 18). Was there an environment that helped with that, or would you attribute that more to your parents, or something else? 
What movies/tv shows/podcasts/anything make you laugh the hardest? 
What was the best prank you pulled on the HP set?  
How terrifying was it to have a black magic version of Hans Gruber yelling at you for years? 
Over the course of the Harry Potter films, you got to work with some amazing actors like Gary Oldman and Alan Rickman. Can you share any interesting stories about working with them? 
What is one thing in your life that you are striving to improve, and what are you doing to improve it? 
Howdy Daniel! Does Rupert really own an ice cream van? 
Hi Daniel, if the opportunity presents itself some day one day what would you prefer, play James Bond or play the villain? 
Harry Potter is obviously a Gryffindor, but what is Daniel Radcliffe? 
Assuming you read all the Potter books before their respective films were made, did you ever get upset about changes or omissions friom the stories when you were reading your script? 
Can you and Elijah Wood make a movie where you're twins and one of you is evil but we don't know which until the bloodbath ending? 
If you could transform into a flying, land, and sea animal which 3 animals would you choose? 
How did you get the idea of wearing the same outfit for months, to mess with paparazzis? I thought it was pretty awesome and original :D 
Do you go on YouTube often, and if so, what do you look at? Who are you subscribed to on there? 
What was the makeup process like for Horns? What would you do whilst having it applied? 
Daniel, did you put your name into the goblet of fire?!?!?! 
Hey, How important was it to you that Joe Hill react favorably to your portrayal of Ig? 
What was it like to work on the Lord of the Ring movies? 
Super excited for Horns! What challenges came with portraying Ig? 
Of all the Harry Potter spoofs and parodies online such as Potter Puppet Pals and Dear Reader Wizard People which are your favorites?  
Given that almost all actors in Britain have got roles in game of thrones. Have you been approached for a role and if so what character were you offered/like to play?  
When you auditioned for your role in harry potter did you have any idea that it would turn out to be this major of a movie series?  
Hi Daniel,  Do you have a favorite song or musician at the moment? 
Hi Dan! So you've done a lot of great dramatic work, but what I'm wondering is what else we can expect to see from you as far as comedy? I've thoroughly enjoyed the few times I've seen you take on comedic roles and bits and am hoping to see more!  Thanks! 
Hi Daniel! Welcome!  What was your favorite scene to do from the Harry Potter movies? 
How well do you feel Horns, the movie, stays true to the book? 
I'm late to this.  Either will get buried or you've stopped answering, but I'll try on the off chance.   I absolutely love "A Young Doctor's Notebook".  I just get the feeling that working with Jon Hamm is amazing.  He seems like the kind of guy that brings out wonderfully different choices in other actors in scenes and they end up going in different directions.  I have a couple questions.   1.  What was working with Jon Hamm like?   2.  Have you thought of being a guest on Comedy Bang Bang?  For some reason, I see you as the perfect guest on either the TV show or the podcast version of it.  
Hey Dan! Been a fan of you since I was like 5; this is surreal.  Anyway, what's the best and the worst thing about being Daniel Radcliffe? 
Have you gone to the NFL games in London this year?  
Hey Daniel! I'm a huge Broadway nerd, what was your favorite part about being apart of a Broadway production? 
Are you a horror fan? Can you tell us your favourite horror movies? 
Hey Dan!  Are you a video gamer, and if so, what's your favorite game? 
If an excentric billionnaire told you to pick a novel, any novel, to turn into a film or TV show with you in the lead role, he'd make sure writing, effects and all that are taken care of, all you need to do is pick one and act - which one would you want it to be? 
Sorry for the HP question but do you think you'd make a good wizard? Would you want to be a wizard? 
I have like 50 Harry Potter-themed questions, but I mostly want to know what your ideal breakfast consists of & how you take your tea? 
Hi Daniel,    My question isn't remotely related to literature, film, theatre or otherwise, my question is- what, in your opinion, makes for an ultimate sandwich?  
Would you rather fight 100 duck-size Elijah Woods or one Elijah Wood-size duck? 
What do you look for in a good script when you are being approached for a role? 
I'm really crap at questions so; what did you have for breakfast this morning? 
Rocking the beard good sir! Looks fantastic on you.  Any plans for No Shave November? 
If the Harry Potter films get remade in twenty years and they offer you a role then who would you choose to play? 
Hi, Dan!  Good (barely) morning from the Philippines! ^2AM! Big fan, especially of your causes and how you've dealt with the post-Harry Potter phase. I just want to thank you for sharing with us your art (especially in brilliantly portraying one of the biggest characters for a generation).  I have a few questions, feel free to answer whichever you prefer:  1. What are you dressing up as this Halloween? (HAHA)  2. Is there a cause that you feel should be given more attention to?  3. If you could reshoot any scene from any movie/series you have ever made, what scene is it and why?  4. What is your favourite role (either TV, film, theatre) to date and, consequently, what is your dream role?  It is my absolute dream to watch you perform/see you someday (working on it!), but seeing that I live so far away, I'm happy to see you on Reddit. Thank you for doing this AMA and very excited about Horns (hopefully it will be shown in my country), which I'm sure is just fantastic!   Cheers, 
You seemed pretty confident about the fight. Did you know you had the guy beat during the weigh in? 
What made you want to do MMA? Did you fight much as a kid inside and outside of the 'ring'? 
Did the little face-off before your fight intimidate you or did it work in your favour? Looks a lot like the latter to me. 
Hey man, awesome work in that fight. Have there been many examples of this type of "intimidation" technique that you've gotten used to from the past, or have you just always been a badass? Any examples of other douchey behavior that you've learned how to handle outside of the ring? 
Did you feel like you had the advantage going into the fight? You seemed to be laughing a bit at the weigh in. 
Great punch, Ben! Were you close to punching him at the weigh in? Because if you were, you hid it very well! Nice job! 
What was going through your mind as he kept pushing you? Did you have any other prior incident with him? 
How are personalities of other fighters?  Are there a lot of showy jerks like this or is it mostly folks just doing their jobs?  Anyone with an outstanding or notable personality? 
With UFC 193 being officially set in Melbourne, any chance that you'll be on that card? 
Can you speak or read Vietnamese and have you ever been to Vietnam ? I'm a Vietnamese too :D  
Two questions:  1. How much of that pre-fight "thing" (sorry) was just playing for the camera? Was the other dude just trying to seduce you with his eyes?  2. What got you into MMA? Do you ever get concerned about riding and the potential to dereail your fighting career? 
I do not usually like to watch MMA, but you've got a new fan! For being a fellow Vietnamese-American and knocking out a douchey tatted up jerk.  Did you watch any Monkey King/Te Thien Dai Thanh growing up? Who do you look up to as a fighter? 
How would Ronda Rousey do in a MMA fight against a man in her weight class? 
Have you ever experienced anyone getting physical (straight up hitting/kicking) at the weigh-ins? 
Have you ever watched Hajime no ippo? And if so what did you think of it? 
Might be a odd question, but I've always wondered what a MMA fighters daily diet is like. Do you try to eat at least a certain amount of calories or do you try to cut back in order to stay in weight classes? 
What is your opinion on Cross-Fit training?  It has a lot of negative press about it so I'm curious to see what someone who does training/fighting for a living feels about it.  
How long do you hope to do this for?   Once you hang up the gloves do you see yourself going into coaching or teaching? Or will you find a completely different industry? 
What were you thinking behind that smile? (btw well done! need more viets in MMA! guys over in saigon have been talking about the clip!) 
Hello Ben! I've recently (Just today actually) watched quite a few of your fights and have become a big fan, and my question is, how did you get over the three fight slump in 2009-2010, and how did it feel to end it? 
Any specific reason your name is Ben10? I personally know the creator to Ben10. 
Excellent handling of that moment with him pre-fight and the subsequent KO of awesome proportions!   My question is , what martial artists quote sticks with you, or any quote by anyone that inspires you?   Best of life to you  Ben! 
Ben, why did you choose to come to Australia to pursue your dreams?? I would think the mma scene is a lot bigger in the us compares to Australia  
Thank you for making kiss kiss bang bang. Very underrated. What's your favorite story about making that film?  
If you could develop any book into a movie, what would it be and why?  Which character would you play? 
Do you have any childhood pets that you would like to fondly reminisce about? 
how is it that your facial hair is always on point? 
If you were a pizza, what kind of toppings would you have? 
I don't know why, but I want to know... Are you into video games? If yes, whats your favorite game?  Also, what music had you been listening to lately? 
When you signed on for Iron Man did you ever imagine how incredibly popular the character would be? How do you feel about it all now? 
Was is intimidating having Robert Duvall as a father in The Judge?   
What is your favorite memory from filming Bowfinger? 
I loved you in the role of Charlie Chaplin.  If you were to star in another biopic, who would you like to cover?  
What is your favorite part of filmmaking aside from acting?  Also, what's one movie you would recommend everyone to watch that inspired your craft and/or love for film?  (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is still one of my favorite movies, thanks for all your amazing work!) 
If you were to appear on Comedy Central's Drunk History, what historical person would you talk about? 
A long while ago you were in Southern Illinois/Western Kentucky filming the movie US Marshals.  It was during a lovely weeknight that I found myself having dinner at the same Applebee's restaurant as you.  To the entertainment of my friends, I walked over to your table to say "hello" and casually chat things up with a movie star.  It was brief, friendly, and nothing out of the ordinary.  However, a while later I realized that I rudely interrupted your dinner, payed hardly any attention to your friend (who you politely introduced me to), and give little to no respect to your quiet evening or the tantalizing chicken salad in front of you.  From time-to-time that random evening of crossing paths at Applebee's pops in my head and I cringe at the thought of my crass, ill-mannered rudeness.  I am *incredibly sorry* for interrupting your dinner.  Do you think you could ever find it in your heart to forgive me? 
Just watched back to school the other day; were you cool with wearing all of the extreme clothing? And what was it like to work with Rodney Dangerfield? 
Hey Robert,  I was just wondering if you've watched BBC Sherlock and also, what is your opinion on Benedict Cumberbatch?  Thanks! 
Thanks for doing this AMA, and welcome to Reddit! You have a lot of great one liners over the Avengers series, as well as Iron Man. How many of those lines were scripted vs ad-libbed?   Not so serious follow up question. You've been called the perfect Tony Stark. How do you respond to that?  
Is shawarma any good, and how are Hulk's table manners? 
Hi Robert, thanks for visiting Reddit. I was wondering, will we ever see a Sherlock 3? And what other fictional character would you love to play? 
If you were stuck on an island and could only bring 5 things what would they be? 
Being such a big star I imagine that you get many people asking for autographs etc. I was wondering what is the strangest or most memorable fan encounter that you've had? 
The Judge looks incredible. How satisfied are you with the end cut?   
Hey Mr. Downey Jr!   I am a big fan of yours, and really loved your roles in Iron Man And the Avengers, as well as Tropic thunder, of course. Other than asking for an autograph, which I'd totally love, I wanted to ask you how you deal with stress, and what are good ways to prevent stressful situations? Thank you very much for doing this AMA, and I hope you have a great day, sir.  
Hi! This AMA is someting we've all been waiting for :D  My question: **Any chance you'll drop by on Agents of SHIELD this season? :)** 
Your portrayal as Kirk Lazarus in Tropic Thunder was, in my opinion, one of the best comedic performances of all time, but it must have felt like a very risky role to take on. Did you have any fears about how the character would be perceived? What did you do to prepare yourself for the role? 
Hello, Iron Man  You've spoken before about your willingness to re-don the Iron Man Armor if Mel Gibson was to direct.  First of all, on a scale of 1 to 11 how serious were you?  Secondly, what do you think Mel Gibson would bring to the Iron Man series and would you still consider returning if he does not direct? 
What is the best/funniest practical joke you have seen happen on the set? 
You risked everything you owned to make the first Iron Man movie. How did you found the courage to do that? 
Hey Robert!  I love you.  What is your favorite late-night snack and why?  Thanks for coming! 
My favorite movie remains Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang. Do you have any interest in returning to film noir? Personally, I think you absolutely thrive in that genre. 
Would you ever play in Doctor Who if you got the opportunity? 
Who's is more attractive up close, Scarlett Johansen, or Chris Hemsworth?  
Hey Robert! Do you have any advice for Saturday Night Live cast members that only made it one season??? Thanks! NKW 
Hi, big fan, quick question.   What is your favorite book and why?  Much obliged! 
Hello, Robert Downey Jr. I absolutely admire your wit and agility. You always find a way to spice up a script. How much improvisation was incorporated in The Judge? Did you have to stick to the script this time or did everyone let you do your thing?  
Mr. Downey Junior!  Huge fan of your work, and thank you for doing this AMA. Coincidentally I actually just watched Iron Man 1 and 2 last night for the first time, fantastic job. Ever since I saw you for the first time dancing with Jack Black and Ben Stiller on American idol back in '08, I had always wondered how you got so smooth with your dancing and just all around *being*. So, what do you attribute your skills in those departments to? Looking forward to seeing your performance in **The Judge**! Cheers!  
Hi Mr. Downey! Are there any nonprofits or causes you're currently supporting? 
There's a picture of you with Arnold Schwarzenegger so I was wondering how often you PUMP IRON and WHO are your FITNESS role models?   
Hey RDJ, big fan, thanks for coming by.   Do you feel like playing two major sarcastic/disrespectful/buck authority characters in Sherlock and Tony Stark has colored the roles you are offered/take? I see your character in the Judge is the same vein as well. Or are you just playing yourself in all these movies and you just change clothes? 
You are an amazing singer. If you could build a super group with you as frontman, who would be in the band? 
Hi Robert, I must know what is up with the Pelican cases you carry everywhere. Is it your man purse and if so, what's in there? 
My brother is a huge fan and wants to know who your least favourite superhero is.  And as a redditor, I must know: Would you rather face a horse sized duck or 100 duck sized horses? 
Hi Gordon, do you ever just wander into a restaurant looking for a bite to eat, if so how do you decide where to go? If so, when you wander in do the staff visibly begin shitting themselves?  
Hi, Gordon. You're my hero. My girlfriend is typically not much of an adventurous eater; she is, however, curious to try casu marzu or "maggot cheese". Having witnessed you try it on *The F Word*, I have to ask: is she bonkers or am I? 
Hi Mr Ramsay,  I recently went to your restaurant "Gordon Ramsay Steak" at Paris in Las Vegas. I was wondering, exactly how much influence do you hold there? Is it a name sake or do you supervise all of the production and menu, etc? 
What is the dumbest trend in food that you thought would not have lasted, but has? 
out of all of your shows which one is your favorite? 
Will you ever open another location in Glasgow? The meal I had at Amaryllis remains hands down the best I've ever eaten. 
Chef what was your favorite moment on Masterchef, on or off camera?      Enjoyed your previous AMAs a lot, big fan sir. 
Do you think the cook off between you and Bobby Flay will ever happen? 
Hi Gordon,  What is the best tasting dish you have made for the least amount of money? 
Hey Gordon! Huge fan here, I watch a lot of your videos on YouTube. Being a poor college student, what easy meals would you recommend that are healthy and packed with nutrients for strong muscle development and faster mental cognition? 
Hey Gordon, huge fan. Quick question, if you were on death row, what are you ordering for your last meal? 
Out of all the people  you've had train and work under your guidance through the years are there any that you are especially proud of? I think it'd be really great to hear about Chef Gordon Ramsey's prized pupil(s). 
You're super rich. Probably the most famous chef.   What's next for you? I sure as fck didn't expect a mobile game.   Also please keep uploading videos on youtube more frequently. I really enjoy watching bits and pieces from old shows you've done.  
Hey Gordon. What's the best cheese to use  for grilled cheese / cheese toastie?   Apparently Jamie Oliver is going around and downvoting everyone.  
What is your guilty pleasure food?  What are your thoughts on In N Out? 
Hey Gordon just a simple question, what's your favorite casual dinner to make at home? Cheers 
What's your opinion on the new Top Gear considering you have appeared on both? 
Hi Chef,   This is most likely a long shot to ask, but something I have been struggling with for years - what is the trick to getting coating to stick to zucchini, eggplant, and/or other veggies, and what's the best mixture for it? Recommendations? So appreciated. Thank you! 
Hey Gordon! Huge fan! I was wondering if you had any recommendations on what a poor college student should cook on a date? 
In regards to overcooking burgers: let's say the burger is very thin, say 1.5 cm/ half an inch. I find it so easy to go past well done so quickly, but when I have them at a local burger joint, they have it down to a science. How would one cook those burgers perfectly?  
Did you face any physical danger or threats on your journey to find your friends? Congrats btw! :) 
What are the local authorities in Vietnam doing about this practice or custom of kidnapping brides and kidnapping women in general?  
You are fighting the good fight, OP, while most of us just sit behind keyboards and bitch really loudly about everything.  What were the most physically dangerous situations you faced during the making of this documentary?  
Did your other 2 friends that you found in china return safely, or are they still there?  
Were your friends Vietnamese or in that country for some other reason when they were kidnapped? Were they your friends before the kidnapping or did you become a human rights activist after it happened? (the experience prompted you) 
Hi Ben.    Just want to say that what you've done and continue to do should be applauded. Good luck with everything and whatever future plans you have.    I haven't watched the 40min doc yet but I plan to later tonight so apologies if this is already in there but, during your time documenting and searching, did one thing/situation stand out more than the others in terms of opening your eyes to the severity of it all? 
How are the girls doing now?  Thank you for sharing this and spreading the word. More people need to be educated. 
I've often wondered around this sort of thing -- at what point and why did you start filming, and at what point (if they differ) did you realize you were making a documentary? 
Are you concerned about retaliation from the perpetrators at all? Either from rescuing your friends directly or shining a light on their illegal trade and possibly their identities? 
Hey OP.  Great post and hope all is going well with documentary. Two questions: 1) Are your friends Vietnamese, and from what socioeconomic background are they?  2) How were your dealing with authorities and NGOs in both countries? Which official bodies/authorities were available for you to appeal to in Vietnam and China respectively?   
Hi OP, Vietnamese here. I'm currently living and studying in the U.S., and I find what you're doing is Amazing. What can the Vietnamese communities in the U.S and other countries do to help? 
You mention in Indiegogo that some of the funds will be spent in conjunction with another organization to help the areas in Vietnam in which you worked.  What's the actual percentage of funds being donated? 
Hi, I noticed you are much older and also of a different race to them, how did you know them and how were you their friend? 
Hello Ben, saw your 40 minutes of documentary and was impacted by the story.   What efforts are being done in the area to prevent more women from being trafficked?  And if they are trafficked, are they taught anything that could help them get rescued? For example - one of the issues from the movie was the women didn't know how to use international dial codes to call home.  
What kept you going? Why not give up? Also, congrats man, this is such a good story! 
You've mentioned the complicity of the authorities in Vietnam, how did that affect your search? Is the blind eye turned on a local level or higher? Did any authorities actively attempt to impede your investigation, or refuse to help? How did this play out in China? I have lived in china, and I know that generally, police authority rarely overlaps to different communities, especially in the more rural areas, so I'm curious about how that played into all of this.  
How bad is trafficking in the United States, and what can an average person do to help? 
Great work. With all the investigating you did i am sure you managed to find out how much the brides were purchased for ?  
Are the kidnappers facing criminal charges from the local justice?      Is there any possibility of the government of your country do something about it? 
I imagine you experienced periods of doubt and feelings of hopeless defeat before your miraculous discovery. Can you open up about the mental battles/conversations you may have had with yourself in order to keep pushing through? I love practicing mind-over-matter and exercising my mental fortitude, but putting myself in your shoes I can only imagine you had to have overcome some serious adversity within yourself.   Thanks for sharing and spreading goodness into the world! Stories like this are what motivate some of us to keep our integrity intact and follow our moral compass, even when the going gets tough and the odds are stacked (severely in your case) against you. 
How does it feel to be a "best friend" in the truest sense of the term, perhaps ever? 
Could you elaborate a bit on how your friends were treated after being sold in China?  Did their relationship with the men who bought them ever approach anything resembling a relationship after all that time, or did it remain strictly slavery? 
I have watched those first 40 minutes and I was just stunned after it. Congrats on such a great documentary.   Does it stop here, though? Do you plan to expand on this in your next documentary or do you have other issues/subjects in mind? 
What did you think when you first came to the decision you would risk your life and EVERYTHING to find them? What did you feel? And more importantly, thank you. What you did is something I cannot even imagine doing. You're a true hero.  
6pm.  Signing out now. Thanks for all your interest in this AMA.  I reached only a fraction of you, but there were some good questions in there. Hoping my answers served this curiosity.  As always, Keep looking up.    -NDTyson 
What is the most exciting thing going on with space exploration right now?   Either in recent months or planned in the near future. 
What's something you've learned recently that's really blown your mind? 
Hi Neil! Just wanted to know your thoughts on SpaceX's Falcon 9 relaunch and landing, and what do you think it means for the future of space travel? also, would you ever consider to join a one way trip to Mars?  
What should we expect in the next few years from astrophysics? 
Life as we know it on earth is cell bases, DNA,  and so on. If we did find alien life, are we sure we would recognize it? What if alien life is similar to iron, but our tests couldn't even detect some other unearthly element that makes it living. I guess my question is, since earth life is so unique and specific to us, how do weexpect to recognize "life" so unique and specific to another world? Could we have seen life on a planet millions of light years away, but not realized it because the details of photography are limited? 
What is the one question you wish we had the answer? 
What was the defining  moment in your life where you thought "I did it?" 
Hi Dr Tyson, huge fan. I know its a big question, but how do you go on knowing how small we are in this universe? The thought of my insignificance in the grand scheme of things tends to depress me as much as the vastness of the universe interests me. Thanks for your time!  
Hello Neil,  I work at a Christian school. One of my co workers (the science teacher) was banned from showing cosmos. The administrators who banned it (due to a parent complaint actually) refuse to watch it to judge for themselves.   What would you say to them to convince them to change their minds or reconsider? 
Dr. Tyson, I have a serious question: who's your favorite comedian? 
You've said a black hole is the most interesting way to die in space. What is the second most interesting? 
Will we find live outside Earth within 100 years from now? 
Hello, have you ever seen Rick and Morty? If so, what do you think of it? 
Neil, you're a great mind who helps reach out and bring many people new curiosity for science & I applaud you for that.  I am not as intellectually inclined as I wish I was but I feel confident as a good orator and communicator having worked sales jobs.   I don't believe I have the capabilities to go into a STEM degree so what do you think young people in my generation who cannot go into STEM should strive for?  also how'd you like the movie "Life"? 
Greetings Neil,   I have looked up to you aside many others as you've stood as a figure of change and education in my life and the lives on in countless others. So here's my question.  Are you skeptical about the advances in high-pressure physics with the discovery of metallic hydrogen ?   With that being said do you think metallic hydrogen will replace liquid oxygen in our ambitious plan to reach Mars by 2030 ?  A pleasure for your time,   Thanks Anthony. 
Is science the arbiter of reality?  If so what are some  of the problems/limits of adopting that epistemology exclusively? 
Hello Dr. Tyson!  I think I have an idea of what your answer might be, but I'll ask anyway. What are your thoughts and predictions on President Trump's executive orders regarding energy and the environment?  ...and as always...  WHEN IS THE NEW SEASON OF COSMOS COMING??? 
What are some personal or career goals you haven't yet achieved?  
Do you know you're the champion of r/iamverysmart ? 
Neil,  While I shudder at the thought, the candles of great science communicators like you, Bill Nye, and others inevitably cannot burn forever.  Who do you feel are the upcoming voices which also need to be heard, who are helping to carry and will continue to carry the torch?  With that said, I am looking forward to continuing to follow you for a great many years to come.  As a middle school science teacher, your works are brought into my classroom as a way to help engage students.  Thank you! 
Hello Neil,  How was it working on Avenged Sevenfold's song "Exist"? I really like your part. Hopefully you might play it live with them one day haha. 
How bound is our society to thermodynamic entropy? If elected to supreme leader, how do you purpose we deal with the effects of  entropy on humanity.  
Do the Rangers have enough defense to make a run in the Stanley Cup Playoffs? 
If the world WAS flat, how would the physics that we know now change?  
A lot of people have anecdotes of meeting you and claim that you're an asshole in real life.  Can you confirm these stories? Or give any excuse as to your behaviour? 
Hi there Mr. Tyson! Have you heard the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise? 
Dr. Tyson, I am a high schooler in NJ who wants to go into physics as a career but doesn't have any great resources in my school besides my calculus teacher. Any suggestions on how to prepare myself for a future in physics? 
Previously you came out with the STM music video which cost you $600. This time you spent nearly $700,000 on another perfect video. Why did you decide to splurge so much on the new project?   
What is your favorite album? What makes you like it so much? 
Dave!  Thanks for Doing the AMA man.   My biggest question is...  Are you actually as frugal as Save Dat Money suggests? 
When you were on Jake and Amir's podcast "If I Were You" you said your dick was too small to have sex from the side, but in your new video, it shows you doing so. Has your dick grown since the podcast?  Also, will you make another appearance on Jake and Amir's podcast? Thanks! 
Hello David.  Have you ever met the legendary Larry David? If not, what would you want to go do with him should you meet in the future?  
Hey man. Real talk. You have the hottest chicks in your videos. What steps do you take to make sure you don't pop a boner on set?  
Being a Richmond, VA native, I am curious as to why you chose UR over all of the other schools. It is an incredibly nice school, but why did you choose UR specifically?  
How much your Bar Mitzvah money, and what specifically did you invest in with the money to start off your career? 
Do you think the seam between your nuts means that we were once  two different people?  
What's good Mr. Leftward-Sloping Penis! What in your opinion was more iconic: rapping with Snoop, or getting head from Juanita in his office? 
LD, longtime Dickhead here, seen you twice live and you put on an amazing show. Two questions feel free to not answer both.  1) when do we get a new project from you?  2) any thoughts of doing something comedic outside of hip hop? 
How long do you think it will take for "SOMEBODY SUCCCKK MEEE" to catch on as a worldwide phenomenon? 
If Snoop said no, did you have backups for Professional Rapper? I always wonder who else it could have been.  
When is the new music coming, LD? It's been almost 2 years since Professional Rapper came out. 
If you had to get a tattoo of someone's face who would it be, where would you get it, and why? 
Hey LD, just wanted to say thanks for doing this and for finally releasing the Pillow Talking video - it was definitely worth the wait!  I'm assuming everyone else will ask about if/when you've got new music coming out, so my question is this: If you were trapped in an empty room with no doors or windows and only a perfect clone of yourself, would you fuck or fight the clone? You're released after an hour and no one will ever know what happened in the room.  
Can you tell us more about the show you're working on? Id love to see you in a comedy show or movie.  
Hey Dave! I am a huge fan of both you as a rapper and as a person. I've been impressed with how real you still are despite being so popular. Do you feel like your fame has affected you much on a personal level?    Loved the pillow taking vid. It was truly the best music video I have seen. It was exactly as I envisioned the song so I can see why it took 10 months. Worth the wait! By far my favorite song of yours!!    Keep it real, LD. 
So I watched your freestyle on Sway in the Morning, and it was awesome! How memorable of an experience was that? Also side note, the line about Michelle Obama was incredible 
About how long after talkin wit a bitch did brain get to poop?  
Hey Dicky, big fan.    In your Snapchat recently, you had a clip of yourself rapping along with what sounded like a sneak peak of a new song from you. Can you confirm this and possibly give any further details on upcoming singles/ album?    
How would you describe your relationship with James the squirrel? 
Lil Dicky,  I'm a huge fan of your work, but more of your skill set. I like pillow talk, but the antagonist was probably my favorite on the album. Do you have any plans to make a serious hip hop record in the future? 
Have you ever tought about changing your rapper name?   What did your parents and relatives say when u told them you're going to be a rapper named lil dicky?   
Sup Dave?  Who was your favourite artist to collaborate with and why?  Also who would you most like to collaborate with in the future? 
D, huge fan. What has been your favorite music video to make to date? They're all so clever and unique. Maybe share a cool story from one of the sets too?  
What are the chances of LD getting a Frank Ocean feature on the next album? 
Fucken loved this video, Dude. The production is sick!!!  Especially loved all the attention to details you made, the shit on the side tables, no dabs shirt, but yo! the sound effects blew me away. Did you do those? Sounded so cray.  
Hey there! I just want to say that "Pillowtalk" was actually the first song I heard from you. My friend played it in my car on our way to football practice and we were laughing the whole way there. Since then I've been listening to everything. Just want you to know you've got a lot of fans (at least around me) here in SoCal.  Anyway, my question: How does it feel to be a professional rapper? 
HEY DICKY!  I just got my girlfriend hooked on you last week and she has been sending me song lyrics every day this week. Yesterday she sent me a message calling you "Young Richard" and I fucking died.  Question is, have you ever heard or been called "Young Richard" and will you use this as one of you AKA's in the future? 
Hello Mr. Bird,  Big fan!  What was the process for filming this like? A few days of filming or did you practice and get it all shot in a day (minus CGI and shit)? BTS in the future...?  Sincerely, A Manilla Envelope 
LD,  You are a lyrical genius and I love how your mind works. Love you lots.   My questionnnnn,   So ever since we met the Burds, I've been wondering if your mom has yet to have a conversation with Puff. Daddy's  mom? Like have they been able to hash over the woes and worries of their rapper son's lives and did Momma Diddy get to tell momma Burd how she backs her the fugg up?   That would be a lunch I'd like to sit in on.  
What was it like working with Brain? He seems like a super cool dude.  
LD big fan. How do you feel about the future of the 76ers? And who is your MVP and ROY winners this year? 
Hey there Stem Cells,  Who in the music industry would you want most to feature in an upcoming single? Also, who is your musical idol? (If they're not the same one)  Big love from Israel, you're making every last one of us proud af. 
Hey Dave,  Have you met Topanga?  Was it awkward?  
LD, I'm pretty sure I got bars and people would like to hear them but I don't know what to do with that talent. How can I get my music heard if I'm rapping over instrumentals I find online? And how can I get in touch with people to make me beats or really learn the fundamentals behind making beats?  
Hey LD,   Have you had any contact with Molly since the song/video came out? What did she think of all of that?   Big fan since day 1, keep making bangers. 
Damn that video was good and seemed like a conversation out of experience. My question for you LD, is what's the weirdest situation you've been in after a one-night-stand? 
My fiance wants to invite you to our wedding. Not to preform or anything, just as a guest. If you got an invitation would you come? 
Hey Dave,   You're performing at my school at my school on the 23rd with 2 Chains and my fraternity is a huge fan of anything you put out. Any chance you'd stop by for a dope after concert party were throwing?  
What was your favorite thing about doing XXL and how was it being one of the only non-trap artists on there? 
Do you think that the majority of rappers acknowledge you? Or do they think of you as a shtick?  If so, is that frustrating? 
Who are some of your hopefuls for this years draft for the Sixers? 
Hi Dave,  I've been a huge fan of yours for years.  Your rap style is unmistakable and unique.  I never get tired of listening to your music.  You've built a brand that is one of a kind.  I hope that you're proud of that, because it is pretty incredible.  So I have to ask the obvious question.  Tits or ass? 
Hey man,  The latest music video is flawless. 10/10, will watch again at least twice. It's great to see a young boy from the Philly suburbs making moves out there.    I saw you perform when you came to UMD last May with T-Pain. He put in work, sure, but between us, you carried the concert.   Seriously though, when are we getting another album? You put out life-changing stuff, and I'm hype for whatever you give us next.  
What was it like performing in Ireland on Halloween last year? 
When you got your start, how did you leave your day job? Do they still remember the day that Dave Burd left them? 
How has your life changed since you started rapping? 
Hey Dicky,  Video is amazing. 10 months well spent.  My question for you is: have you considered doing any acting gigs at all? I feel like you would do good in a comedy movie or maybe an SNL skit. 
Are you an Eagles fan? If so, how you feeling about our team and Carson Wentz? 
What's been the biggest highlight for you either professionally or personally in regards to your music? 
Dude, I love your work. You are very entertaining and it seems so easy to you. When you have your hard days, what do you do to get back on track?  
Hey Dave,  During your time in the Bay Area did you ever try "Little Star Pizza"? If so (This is my girl and my GO TO spot whenever we're in the city and want to have a pizza picnic)  Follow up question:   Who's your favorite Tanner family member? 
When are you finally going to go outside and tame James The Squirrel?  
What is the process like to find these women for your music videos? Any awkward or funny stories?  
Hey LD, we are both proud members of the Toyota Avalon family.  Will you ever consider selling it for a better car now that you have the money? Or are you going to ride that bad boy until it breaks down? 
Saw a video on YT that shows you setting fire to the basketball court and hitting 8 straight 3s. Are you really that good or did you just cut out the bad bits? 
From a legal standpoint, what is the argument from Follett?  It seems to me that a user has a right to display whatever information on their browser they want to.  Assuming you are in no way manipulating the packet that is received from the textbook service, and are only manipulating the end result, is there any legal precedent you know of that says that you either can or cannot do this? 
Why are the online access codes (which I always need for classes) so expensive? 
Why is this market able to provide such inflated prices when the people purchasing them are among those who have the least? 
Could you give us an idea of which schools / regions this plugin will service?  Is it US only, only specific schools, etc?  Couldn't find the information your website. 
What do you think the average college student could do to protest the outrageous prices of textbooks? 
Would you consider making your plugin worldwide or do you still consider yourselves an American based company?  
Follett can rot in hell, do they really think you are their biggest threat? How many students have taken to pirating text books now because of the bullshit games they play? 300 for a fucking book that will be replaced a year later and holds zero value? It's nothing short of highway robbery down Route Degree. And there are ALOT of Highway men already hunting that route. 
It's ridiculous that a company would threaten you like that for making what just seems essentially like a search engine. Did they provide our allude to any legal basis?  
what prompted you to create the extension? Was it simply you saw a need for this sort of product and made it, or have you felt the painful sting of college textbook price gouging and decided to valiantly try to slay the dragon of....i have no idea how to finish this metaphor, but some sort of overpriced book dragon i assume.?  
In the permissions for your extension (which display when I install it), it says that "it can read and change all your data on the websites you visit". Why is this? Do you sell the information? Or is that integral to the extension's function?  I mean, either way I'm still getting the extension (textbooks are fucking pricey in the US these days), but I want to know. 
What do you believe needs to happen in order for open source textbooks to gain popularity in campuses?  In other words, what keeps the publisher/bookstore oligopoly intact? I realize that they have a captive market, but why do professors and/or academic departments choose *their* books and not open source textbooks? 
I get why they -want- to take the plugin down,  but why do they think they can?  
As you mentioned, there is a lack of legal basis for Follett's threats. Since they have no grounds on which to pursue legal action, how are they going about asking you to stop what you're doing? What exactly is their argument? 
It's a little hard for me to see the GIf but do you take into account digital books?  
which low-profile reps hold more power due to committee chair positions etc... than most people would think? 
In cannabis-legal states like yours, the industry has created many jobs.  If legalization on the federal level occurs do you feel those small businesses will be forced out of the market by a small handful of large corporations?   
ok It's 6:45 MT and I'm here, let the party begin! 
Can I just say I decided to try "Sort by controversial" and I'm very impressed you're taking the mean spirited questions?  Sorry, I can't vote for you as I live in NC, but I would if I could 
Sounds like you're one of the few super achievers out there. My question is, what drives you? 
Mr. Polis, as a citizen from CO, I would like thank you for taking the time to speak with your constituents as opposed to a certain senator from CO.  What type of support for cannabis regulation to you see from your fellow members of Congress? Do you see this act gaining any major support from specific legislators that people wouldn't expect? 
Since the rule about broadband privacy protection was rolled back as part of Congressional Review and that supposedly means the same rule can't be passed again, what does the future of internet privacy as it relates to the votes that cleared this week look like? Could Congress, or the future FCC, pass similar rules/legislation that provide the same protections that were reversed? Or can the current Congress/FCC pass rules/legislation that can at least restrict what ISPs can do with the data? 
Hi Jared,  I am a constituent of yours and I just wanted to thank you so very much for signing the bipartisan letter to the DEA urging them to halt their scheduling of kratom.  I emailed and called your office and I definitely felt that my voice was being heard and represented.  As someone who has used kratom for over a decade, I really, from the bottom of my heart thank you for protecting my rights and freedom.  This plant is enormously beneficial to me and many thousands, if not millions of Americans.  I appreciate that you are looking out for people like me and the rest of our community.  Had you heard about kratom before the DEA completely overstepped their authority and brought it into public discourse? 
Mr Polis,    I love Boulder County and prize the shared values we have here. But... we live in Longmont which means instead of having a cool high-tech progressive Representative, our family is stuck in The District That Time Forgot. I need some Real Talk here: Is there any chance at all of either the district swinging moderate anytime soon or Longmont moving to the 2nd District after the next census?    Don't get me wrong, I'll all about fighting the good fight, but I'm old enough now to know when to pick my battles.    Thanks, and nice job on the bill today!   
Mr. Polis, thanks for your service! I was sad to move out of your district, but am happily supporting Rep. Degette as my new Rep.  Hot-potato question re Rep. Devin Nunes. Do his actions with the Intelligence Committee potentially rise to the level of being exposed to investigation by the Ethics Committee for conflict of interest?  If you can't answer that... Behind the scenes, do most fellow committee members (Schiff & Nunes) have the type of rapport that allows them to, behind closed doors, say "dude, WTF?"   Thanks, and keep up the wonderful work on our behalf! 
Hi, big fan of marijuana legalization (not just for the fun aspect) but I am a big believer that hemp and marijuana is an untapped industry and will create tens of thousands of jobs as well as cripple cartels, allowing us to decrease some expenses in the DEA and other departments. How have other reps in congress reacted to the jobs and savings arguments and aspects of legalization of marijuana? To me, it seems between tax revenue and jobs, we'd be stupid to continue to deprive the market and personal freedoms associated with legalization. 
Thanks for being my rep Mr. Polis.  What are your plans to fight President Trump's recent executive order on climate change and the EPA? 
Congrats on seemingly being both a decent human being AND a Congressman ;)  What are your thoughts on Universal Basic Income? 
Can you be my rep too? I'm stuck with Chris Collins. It doesn't seem fair. 
Can we use the weed money to give our awesome state single-payer healthcare? I don't want to be uninsured anymore :/ 
Do you like sandwiches, if so, what's your favorite type of sandwich? 
What do you think should be done to stop gerrymandering? Also what are the pros and cons of term limits for Congress?  
Not a real political question, but I sat right above the Dems dugout at the congressional baseball game last year and we were screaming for you the whole night. How do you sign up for that? Is there like a sign up sheet passed around the House floor or something? 
Hi Jared! CSU alum here who always appreciated you stopping by.  In these uncertain times, we all need to take comfort in our fermented beverages. So how's the kombucha bill you introduced doing?   
Hi, Mrs Polis. Hope your evening is going well. Some questions:  * would the decriminalization under your bill mean marijuana sellers could now deposit their cash in FDIC banks?  * similarly, would the rule preventing "drug dealers" from deducting operating expenses (e.g. rent, utilities, advertising, salaries, overhead, etc.) on their taxes be circumvented?  * if you had to entertain royalty by making sandwiches and hosting lunch,  describe the sandwich you would make and the luncheon you would put on.  
How often to you speak with our Senators? Weekly? Never? Only Bennet?   
Representative Polis, I've been a fan of yours since you were on one of the late night shows a few years ago (the Daily Show maybe). Do you have plans to go on again? You are very well spoken. 
Oh hey I live in fort Collins! Thanks for representing us! I've voted for you a number of times, just never expected you to pop up on my Reddit feed!  Anyway, how long per year do you spend fundraising? 
Hello Jared,  Good work and thanks for being active and willing to face adversity. What has been your biggest frustration, mistake, and what keeps you positive?  
Hello Senator!  CO resident here. I want to ask you your position/thoughts on off-grid living. I know that some people who live on their own land prefer to take their own responsibility when it comes to shelter and energy.   In many places, there are ordinances governing what can and cannot be done in this regard. In other places (like much of the San Luis Valley), there are fewer restrictions and usually just a permit required to live in a "non permanent" residence. I read a story recently that echoed concerns from citizens who were denied permits and essentially evected from their own land.  I believe the trend of living off-grid, in tiny home, earthships, etc. is growing exponentially. With this growth, there is at some point going to be a request from these people that their lifestyles are legitimate and should be permitted fully (at least outside of urban areas)  So, what do you think of this, and where do you see room for improvement or protection for this demographic? 
Now that Trump has announced he wants to get rid of net neutrality, what should we do to stop that? How will we be able to build momentum for another large protest like in 2014? 
*waves from Denver* Keep up the good work! Two questions:  (1) How do you think this developing Trump/Russia scandal is going to play out? (Do you think President Trump will last a full term?)  (2) What is the best way we Coloradans can resist and combat the Trump regime?  Thank you. 
Sorry I'm a little late to the Polis AMA party! I've been tracking how you vote and thank you for always properly representing us!   Our privacy laws (or lack there of) can impact our economy as seen when the EU invalidated the US-EU Safe Harbor agreement in 2015. US businesses, including many in Colorado, invest significantly in privacy programs and then our laws or actions of security agencies undercut all of their privacy efforts. What will it take for Congress to think through all of the consequences of surveillance and anti-privacy laws?    
Do you think that people who disagree with you have rational points of view but disagree, or  is it really all about the money? I happen to agree with you strongly on both of those issues.  I think it's self evident that our view is the correct view and cannot imagine viewing either issue from the contrasting point of view. 
Why is the lack of net neutrality viewed as a good thing among your peers? 
What do you think blockchain will be used for in government, in government agencies, in government contractors? How do you think blockchain will benefit those entities, and how soon do you think (asking for your gut, nothing more) that blockchain will be in common use for those entities? And anything else interesting you care to share! :) 
What do you think our chances are of ever getting an independent redistricting commission in Colorado?  
Hi Jared - You're my rep, and happy to have you. I was pleased with how you pointed out that not a lot of Republicans were defending the recent net privacy bill, but instead were just voting due to "the party."   2 questions:  1. How do I explain to my GOP friends that "job creation" is actually done by content creators - the websites - and NOT by the ISPs? Why is there such a large disconnect there, almost down to strict party line? I have a hard time believing there are no conservative software engineers.  2. I'm interviewing around Boulder for software engineering positions. Can I put you down as a reference? 
What is your opinion about democrats receiving just about as much donations from telco companies as republicans? Do you think lobbying using money is a form of bribery? 
should zero-rating services be outlawed?  they would seem to be a clear violation of net-neutrality 
Hey Congressman,   What are the major obstacles to successful regulation of Marijuana? 
Any plans on running for President in 2020, Mr. Representative? The Democratic Party needs a strong contender with mass appeal, and I think your views, policies, and career would be quite popular amongst many Americans.   P.S. I wish I lived in your district, even though I don't think I could personally afford it. Stuck down here with Lamborn instead.    
Why can't we just decriminalize cannibis based on the fact that the origin of the laws were all based on racist propaganda used to further the agenda of primarily the duPont family, to criminalize hemp and introduce inferior products like nylon for use in shipping and textiles? 
Isn't it the exclusive authority of the FDA and DEA to identify specific drugs under the Controlled substances Act? Is there a precedent of Congress adding or deleting a specific drug from the Controlled substances Schedules? 
Go Jared! Former constituent of yours.   Would you ever consider moving to Maricopa County to serve?  
Mr Polis,  You've spoken about overturning Citizen's United. During oral argument for the case, counsel for the government suggested that it would be constitutional to ban a book if the book came out during election season. I'm very uncomfortable with the government having this power.  Am I wrong for being worried about this? Is there a way to re-decide Citizen's United that covers election advertisements, but not books?  PS. You were the only Dem I voted for last year; keep it up. :) 
Hi Jared! Thank you so much for your AMA; I really appreciate the way you've responded to everyone in such a friendly and respectful manner!  I've got a question about campaign finance and voting reform. While I personally support campaign finance reform (getting rid of PACs, overturning citizen's united), ending gerrymandering, and changing our voting system from first-past-the-post to a system like alternative voting, these seem like policies that are impossible to change considering that many Representatives (who have the power to change them) often used these policies to get elected in the first place.  As someone who has ears on the inside, do you think that campaign finance and voting reform is possible? Are many of your fellow Representatives open to these ideas? And how can a member of the public work to help make changing these policies possible? 
Do you feel that anything should be done to regulate the real estate in your state? From what I understand since legalizing marijuana you guys have seen a huge boom in prices that could put undue hardship on people already living there. I.e being priced out of an apartment you have had for years. 
Congressman,  Since it looks like your colleague from the 7th is going to make a run for governor, who would you like to see replace him?  Also, what do you think it's going to take to win the 6th?   
Hello Mr. Polis! I had an internship with your office during my Junior year of high school at Mapleton Early College High School. For personal reasons, I regrettably could not continue the internship. I'd just like to thank you for the great opportunity since I never got the chance to do so. I learned an immensely valuable amount interning in your office and helping out with your constituents' immigration cases.   It's great to see you are doing well and still continue to be one of the good guys in politics. Your stances were progressive then, good to see you haven't changed. We need people like you in government more than ever now! Keep up the good fight!   My question is this, what do you think the young generations can do to have the most impact on our government right now? It seems that in the last election especially the younger generations' voices were drowned out, unfortunately.   Greetings from your former intern in Thornton! :) 
Is it possible to change the laws surrounding pre-employment drug testing? It seems to me that these tests mostly discriminate pot smokers and not the people who do heavier, more lethal drugs, as the heavier drugs tend to leave your system much quicker.  
My question is has the DEA been meddling around in states where it's legalized as Sessions seems to suggest may happen? 
I live nowhere near Colorado, I'm not a Democrat, and I don't imagine I'll ever try marijuana... but I was very glad to have read through this AMA, and I wish more politicians were as candid as you. Thanks for doing this. Could you please try to encourage some of your fellow politicians to do the same? Hope all goes well for you and your bill. 
Hey Jared!  We actually met a couple of years ago at the CU Boulder UMC. It was Election Day and you won later that evening. You're the most awesome politician I know!  What do you thinking states with legal/medical marijuana have to fear with Jeff Sessions' past anti-marijuana views? What can we be doing as citizens to help our local economies and stop his possible Justice Department rules? What can our legislators do?   Thanks and keep on being the best dressed congressman in the House! 
What is the equivalence between marijuana and alcohol?  Which is more dangerous, and what, if anything, should be done about that? 
Hi Jared! One of your 2nd District constituents here. Thank your for respecting and representing us fairly. It's alarming to me that House Republicans have consistently bucked the wishes of their (vocal) constituents, and even their supporters among vulnerable communities. What do you think your colleagues are trying to achieve?  
Do you think there's any chance of a "mass clemency" (yes I made that up and yes I know I'm not technically using clemency right, but you'll see my point) for people convicted or who pled to having very low amounts of painkillers and now have a felony on their record?   I had a long standing prescription for one type of opioid, and then a friend gave me the rest of their bottle (nine pills) because she was done with them, she knew I have a litany of painful health issues and she knew I get prescribed opiods. It's a long story, but, is there any hope for my future? I went from working for OFA in Iowa, MO and KS to now having zero future in my dream occupation (read: politics or government).   I made calls for your reelection a few years ago and I wish I lived in Boulder so you could be my rep. :)   (I'll still like you even if you ignore me or don't give a favorable response)  
Jared! I am a constituent, scientist, and a supporter. How do we incorporate scientific literacy into policy? If so much science is public funded, why aren't scientific journal accessible to the public? We need to work on this.  
Mr Polis,  It's presently illegal to purchase a firearm if you're a marijuana user, regardless of your individual state's laws on marijuana.  Does your bill address this restriction? 
I'm always impressed by the speed of your posts. How long does it normally take you from idea to painting, to scanned? How often do you start, and then realise that you've bitten off more than you can chew? 
Hey congrats on going from Reddit to working for the BBC and Intel, my question is how did you get there? Did they approach you or was it vice-versa?   Also what's your favourite Reddit thread(besides this I guess)  
Is Shitty_Watercolour going to be your alias for all of your paintings? I would hope not, but I would be intrigued if it was. 
What's your true relationship with your arch nemesis /u/AWildSketchAppeared? Do you know each other irl or are you strictly relegated to online art battles? 
When women in bars ask you what you do, what do you tell them? 
Do you present yourself with the name Shitty_Watercolour over at BBC and Intel? 
What do you see yourself doing in the next few years? 
What's the most technical piece of work that you've had to do and what made it difficult?    Has there been a piece you've just abandoned doing in a certain way or redone?   
How long did it take you to go from first shitty watercolour to being a full-time professional artist?  How many days/wk did you paint during that time?  
What is your opinion on the art work of /u/AWildSketchAppeared ? 
What was the first comment you ever painted for Reddit, and why did you choose that particular one? 
I manage the Coutyard. Next time you come along, make yourself known and I'll get you a pint?  
So when doing interviews, did the interviewers have any funny stares or comments when you mentioned your previous work under the name "shittywatercolor?" 
Are you able to make a living from your artwork or is it a side business/hobby? 
When are you going to do a book with /u/Poem_For_Your_Sprog?  /u/Unidan could write the foreword. 
Do you get bored of painting?  What's  your favorite subject to paint (animals, people, whatever)? 
I just wanted to say that your pictures always remind me of Quentin Blake, Roald Dahl, and my childhood in general. Congratulations on your success, you absolutely deserve it. You said that you drawing stuff on reddit was just something to fill the time that used to be spent studying. Have you since fallen in love with it?    
Have you ever done a painting for someone and said to yourself, "No, this is just too bad to use, don't care about the gimmick."? 
Question - What would your chosen career field have been, had you not been declined from University? I.e. What would you have been the majestic "shitty watercolour" of in your field?  Also, I just wanted to say that a few years ago when I joined reddit, you quickly became (and you still remain!) one of my favorite "things" about reddit. I can't quite put my finger on it to articulate but I feel that you really contribute tremendously to putting a humorous and overall positive effect into making reddit as good as it is. 
Did you ever think about giving up the whole thing?  Why?  What kept you going? 
If you could paint anything, what would it be?  If you ran out of water colors, what's your next medium to work in? 
Congrats!  So what happens next in Idaho?  Will this become a precedent in litigation in other states?  Do you plan to sue in other states? 
Out of your time of doing this, has anyone from the farms ever tried to justify why they do these actions?  A good book by Temple Grandin (Animals make us human) explains how she goes into farms and audits them on these behaviors. She trained them not to do these behaviors because acting better around the livestock actually increased efficiency and reduced cost by about $1,500 PER DAY.  So what makes these people behave this way when its proven it actually costs them/the company money?  
I would just like to thank you for everything you've done.   My question is whether or not you think there is still any hope for getting Tony the truck stop tiger released to a sanctuary?  
Can I first say I respect and admire 100% what you do and was never aware of how terrible these instances can be. To watch that video broke my heart, I always respect people who fight for something they are passionate about. While I'll admit I've always turned a shoulder when watching videos I sat here today and watched through it and am glad you won.  My question is for people like I who are average citizens... Who want to contribute:  1.What can I do on my side to help the cause? 2.How do I know which foods I buy aren't from factory farms?    
How the hell can a law like that even get passed?  
What are some practical low-cost things that the average person who might never visit a farm can do to help stop animal abuse? 
This might be a weird question but...how do you handle the emotional labor/trauma associated with seeing suffering animals when you obviously care passionately about them? I am very sensitive to animal abuse and struggle to view images or even read about it without having it running through my mind for hours and days afterwards. As a vegan, obviously you work to meet your own principles, I'm just interested in how you keep from going crazy. 
So as an Idaho resident, let me say Thank You for undertaking this lawsuit.  Our Governor and State Legislature seem to have a penchant for walking up to, and quite often over, the line of constitutionality.  With other lawsuits, the State has refused to accept Federal District Court decisions, and chose to waste thousands more billable hours fighting these decisions in appeal.  Is there any hint that this is the actual end of the Ag-Gag bill, or is there an appeal in the works? 
Do you have any advice for a (European) law student who'd like to do similar kind of work?  Thanks! 
As an Idaho resident, if Idaho decides to appeal, what can I do to help this cause? I am absolutely appalled with my state government over this. 
Have you come up against any nefarious pressure, threats, etc? 
can you estimate how much money the other side poured into their defense? 
Thank you so much for doing this much needed work. So many US citizens have very little idea of how meat farming is usually done.   If meat farming were to become much more humane and more sustainable as water and food shortages increase, what might a factory farm like this look like? Are there any larger companies out there doing this kind of work that you particularly like? 
Are  you passionate about this case? Are you vegetarian, vegan, or someone who only buys from certified humane farms? 
Do you feel consumers have a right to know how livestock is treated in the process of farming?  
Nevermind. OP didn't get around to answer my question and I no longer wanna fight this fight. You win, vegans. I'm tapping out. Plus, you actually made a lot of really valid points.  
In what way is this sort of thing not also trespassing? 
Is there an appeals path beyond the state here, and/or anything relevant to defining precedent for other states? 
thank you SO much for the work you do!  What would you recommend an average person without a ton of time can do to advocate for animals? 
Hello, I have been vegetarian for quite some time. I currently live in British Columbia, Canada, and I am wondering if you know much about the meat industry here. Is it just as bad as all of the videos I see from the states?  Cheers, and thanks for all of your work on this important issue. 
I don't understand what the defense is for ag-gag. How do they justify it? Seems just like straight up censorship. Is it to protect the industry itself from the whole country going vegan or something? 
first off, as an Idaho resident thanks for sticking it to them. Idaho politics suck. My question, How would go about buying meat and dairy products to avoid buying from places like this one? Buy local?  
How did you get into this realm of law, as opposed to something more common like criminal law? In your opinion do you feel like it's more rewarding than being a criminal lawyer?   COngratulations on your victory and I apologize if this type of thing has been asked already. 
Thanks so much for all you do? Hopefully Utah can be your next stop. 
Did playing a man so badly bullied by his co-workers have an effect on you IRL?  Also, your dog is awesome. 
Hi Jim!  You sat in front of my friend and I at a performance of Hedwig and the Angry Inch on broadway about two years ago. Not only were you kind enough to introduce yourself and my friend and I stared at you in awe, but you took the time to take a picture with us when the show was over since we weren't allowed to take them in the theater. You were so kind and willing to talk to two awkward 18 year olds so I just wanted to thank you, two years later!  My question is: what's your favorite encounter you've had with a fan? 
Hey Jim Gengurch!  I love your acting in many shows I've seen, especially P&R.   The finale after special refers to you being the most different from your character. Which other actors are most distant from their characters and most similar?!   Also, how much do you miss P&R?! 
Hey Tim,  You've kind of been defined by your role on *Parks & Rec*, but you've had a long and impressive career. Is there one movie or TV show you've been in -- other than *Middle Man* -- that you'd recommend to people looking to see a little more of you? A performance you're particularly proud of? 
Hi Jim!  At one point in P&R, it is referenced that your character has a very large penis. Does that take any method acting on your part? 
Hi!!   Who was the funniest cast member on Parks and Rec and who was the most fun to work with?   Also how similar is Nick Offerman to Ron Swanson? (in my head they're the same person)   Thanks!! 
Hi Jim!  Jerry/Kerry/Larry/Terry/Gary Gengurch was one of my favorite characters. I can relate to being the clumsy one who's always the butt of the jokes. You never failed to make me smile while portraying him.   What are your dog's names, and can you tell me a bit about them? 
Tim,  With this being described as a "black comedy", how was this role different for you in comparison to past roles, and how do you feel audiences will react? 
Was it difficult playing such a wholesome and naive character, when a lot of your other work is so dark and twisted? It's great you have such a wide range. 
Have you been able to keep any interesting props or memorabilia from any of your roles? 
First Aubrey played a character named Lenny in 'Legion' and now you're playing Lenny in 'Middle Man'.  Who do you think the next one from Parks and Recreation to play a Lenny...?  Personally, I'm hoping it is Li'l Sebastian. 
Hey Jim! Big fan of your work, my dad was actually one of the people that invested enough to be an extra in Middle Man so we are super excited to see it in theatres! My question to you is, who has been your all time favorite actor/actress to work with?  Thanks so much! 
Was the cast of Parks and Rec overly nice to you off camera to make up for how Jerry was treated on camera? 
Who was your favourite director and actor that you've worked with? 
How often do you pull a classic Jerry move?  Also: I remember seeing you in a Castle episode, and I swear it was the most amazing thing I've ever seen, as I decided that your character (who was a butcher with anger management issues, if I recall correctly) was Jerry Gergich trying to process everything he was put through in Parks and Rec. 
Would you rather fight 100 Aziz-sized Li'l Sebastians or 1 Li'l Sebastian-sized Aziz?  Credit to /u/GodDamnNameDoesNotFi for the tweak to my original question 
Hi Jim!   If you could be anything other than an actor, what would you be?  
Was the makeout-fest on Late Night planned between you and Aubrey or just improvisation?  
Hi Jim! So Chris Pratt's Kardashian cumback joke has basically become legendary. Were there any other funny moments like that one that didn't make the blooper reel?  
Hey Larry, what did you type into Altavista to get here? 
Ask you anything, eh?  Okay. Let's put this question to bed: Is the reason that Gayle was with Jerry/Terry/Larry/etc., was because of his massive penis?  According to Dr. Harris (whom Chris Traeger said was literally the meanest person he's ever met), it's the biggest penis he's ever seen. I mean, he didn't even know if you had mumps. He forgot to look. He was distracted. By the largest penis. He had ever seen. 
We know of your enormous member thanks to your PandR checkup, but what I really want to know is did you have mumps?  
Hi Jim.  Altoids or Tic-Tacs that night on Seth Meyers?  
Hi Jim, i just want to say that i love your acting, you're extremely funny. The scene when Chris is proposing to Ann while Larry is choking in the back is one of my favorites of the show! Congratulations on the emmy! My question is, Was there any Jerry in the Parks and rec crew? 
Hey Jim, I can't wait to see your new movie, but I'm afraid I have to ask, do you ever see the Parks and Rec gang reuniting in the future?  Maybe for a reboot or even a film? Would love to see you all back one last time. 
I loved you on the show! Who was your best bud on set? 
Hi Jim! Are you a Billy Joel fan? You were married to his ex wife! Also, murinal! Lol 
Hi Jim! Thank you for taking the time to answer some questions.  How do you think your character Lenny and Jerry/Terry/Larry would get along?  If you chose a boys day out for them where would you go? 
Who would win in a mud wrestling match, nick offerman, or chris Pratt?  
Hi Jim!  Has DJ Roomba come back to haunt you with Black Eyed Peas yet?  
Hello Mr. O' Heir,  I am a big fan of your work. You captured the essence of the nice guy who seems to finish last almost  perfectly. I just have to ask, how did you discover the character of Jerry within yourself? He reminds me a lot of myself growing up. I was always helping with stuff but was never acknowledged for it so thank you for embodying that role so well. 
Off the top of your head, what was the funniest parks and rec scene you participated in shooting? 
Hi Jim!  Do you and Chris Pratt keep in touch? Do you keep in touch with the other P&R cast members?    
My sister is a theater teacher for a middle school and we are both huge fans of your role as Jerry in PnR.  Any advice for her class that are about to go into high school theater?  
Which actor/actress on Parks and Rec was most similar to their character? 
Hi Jim! What was your favorite and least favorite episodes to shoot of parks and rec? 
What was it like working with Michael Schur? Is he as comedically inclined as we all believe, or is it just the great casts he has worked with that should take credit? 
Hey Jim. I love your doggos! What are their favorite things to do? 
I was watching Rosanne and was delighted to see you in a random episode. Do have a any cool memories form back then on set and what do you think about the reboot? 
What was your favorite "Gerry-Burn"? Mine was - i know it's kind of basic - the fart attack.  
I loved Jerry (Terry, Gerry) on Parks and Rec. We're there any jokes you made in the outtakes that you wished they used and what were they? 
Are you and Aubrey still a thing?  Who was your favorite guest star on parcs? 
Do you have any thoughts on the passing on Parks and Rec guest star, Glenne Headly? 
Thanks for taking your time Tim!    What do you think about the shows final season? 
How did they feel about learning English? Resentful? Enthusiastic? Indifferent?  
What wildly held belief among your students surprised you the most? 
What kind of measures did you have to go through to make sure your notes or any other evidence of your actual work would never be discovered? 
Hi Suki! I read your book this spring - thank you for writing your experiences; truly enlightening, and also, empathy-invoking. Would you ever go back to DPRK? Do you think you'd be allowed to? Any plans for more books?  
Are there any linguistic things/cultural habits that North Koreans do that the rest of us Koreans also do? Like the "aigoo" and the "oh moh moh" when surprised? 
What ESL teaching methods and approaches were favoured by schools in North Korea? Additionally, what kind of resources/texts were available for you to use in the classroom? 
What made you want to go undercover in North Korea considering all of the dangers? 
What level of access does the DPRK have with the outside world, on a day-to-day basis?  
Hi! Which do you like writing more? Nonfiction or fiction? Do you consider yourself a writer of "Korean-American" literature or does that tag/category bother you?  I thought _The Interpreter_ was a great novel; one of my favorites.  
Hello Ms. Kim.   I enjoy your Twitter posts and found your Guardian piece comparing the political chaos in Korea to the U.S. very enlightening. In your experience, what are the biggest misconceptions Americans have about either North or South Korea?  
Is it true that crystal meth and cannabis use is widespread both rurally and in urban environments? If so, could you describe your experience of this phenomena? 
How long did it take between the time you had this idea and actually going through with it? (Apologies if you covered that in the book, it's been a while since I read it.) 
How much did u make as a teacher? Easy thing to get into (teaching English in N Korea)? Last one - any dangers associated with just teaching in N. Korea?  
Are North Koreans allowed to speak English in Pyongyang? 
In '92-93 I taught English in Prague in the Czech Republic.  Eastern Europe had just been opened up from the communists.  The sense of euphoria among the people was palpable.  Hope exuded from everyone.  I taught businessmen and women who for the first time in their lives had freedom for their entrepreneurial spirit.  They came to me every day with hopes and bottles of champagne.    I'm curious about the demeanor of your students.  I cannot imagine 'hope' was anywhere around.  How can one teach without hope?  Thx and best wishes. 
What was the best thing you've eaten in North Korea? 
What use do they have for English if they never get to leave? 
How is the adpocalypse affecting you and the broader tech YouTube community? 
Hi Linus!  How much shit do you get for your footwear choice? 
So Linus, what video do you hate the most on all of your channels? And why? 
Hey Linus, any plans to bring back Kickfarted?  Working off that, are there any other "series" that you plan on continuing (like the workshop?) I love your content across all three channels, keep it up! 
Hey Linus, what's probably the most exciting project that you've done on the channel (LTT)? 
Hi Linus, was it a conscious decision to remove the part at the end of Scrapyard Wars when the teams share the specs of their builds and the prices of everything? If so, why did you make that decision? The reactions from the teams over what parts everyone found have been one of my favorite things to see. I believe much of the community agrees that we want to see that part on season 6, even if it is included as some sort of like director's cut, specials, or whatever you want to get another video out.  
Linus, did the "walking in the rain" video have the effect you wanted? Just curious as it's quite out of character from the rest of your content.  
Hi Linus, can we get a updated ofice tour youtube video? 
Hey Linus! Thanks for doing the ama :)  What kind of video would you like to make which you still have not had the chance to make, because you lack resources or something related to the idea? 
What's the most expensive thing you have ever broken? 
Any recommendations for best cable management practices? Zipties? Velcroes? Twine? 
Linus, you helped me build my first computer while you were at NCIX so thanks for that!  Do you ever regret making a company with your name in it? Do you ever get grief for that from coworkers or random fans? 
hey Linus, where do you and the team see the company and the channel in the next few years, especially with all of YouTube's recent and coming policy changes? 
Hey Linus, I'm a long time fan! I've got your Noctua fans in my system and I'm a floatplane pilot. It's been mesmerising seeing you jump from height to height, going from NCIX to where you are today and it's truly inspiring.  My question to you is, how do you unwind and relax at the end of the day after working so hard for so long? 
How often do you work with other tech YouTubers like Kyle Jay, Paul, and them? Is it more a business relationship or do you all text and talk often? 
Is Luke getting his own space for Floatplane Club, and how separated is he going to be from the rest of the crew? 
Will LTX become a regular yearly thing? (PLEASE? :D) 
What upcoming product are you and the team most excited to get a review sample on? 
I'm curious if the upgrade to RED equipment seemed "worth it" to you?  In the end you dropped big bucks on not only the (IMO) extremely overpriced RED cameras and their required accessories, but also a huge new storage server to hold the footage, and new editing workstations to be able to edit the footage more easily.  It seems like a pretty massive upgrade when your quality was already very solid.  
@edzel: Do you prefer Final Cut or Premier?   @brandon: What is your favorite camera that you personally own?   @luke: Thoughts about E3 so far?   @linus: What has been your favorite video that you've hosted?  
Do you prefer to film scripted videos or do you like the more "freestyle" Videos like random unboxings?   Personally I love the crazy unscripted videos, or videos like about you almost loosing all your data. Those make LTT for me! 
How do you balance your personal time with your wife and kid against work time? 
Given unlimited Budget, what would be a video that you would like to shoot? Most interested in answers from Linus and Brandon. 
Hi Linus, how much of your time actually goes into making content nowadays, compared to how much of it is needed for managing the business? 
Good afternoon to all at LMG, I was wondering how hard it was for you guys to develop into what you've become? How did you build the reputation you have across youtube and the computing world as an important group, and how do you deal with things like hiring new people? I imagine that a large number of people want to get in for fame and recognition, how do you deal with that vetting process?  
Hey Luke, are you still trying to switch to Linux? I'm still using Windows for gaming on my main PC, but switched to Ubuntu (and now to Arch) on my laptop. It's a great experience, especially for programming 
Hi Linus, would you ever take your ear piercings out/get any more? 
Is there something that you have always wanted to do on YouTube (maybe as a fun challenge) but didn't really fit on any of your channels so you decided against it? 
This question is for Luke specifically. Do you still regret not using flowers for Scrapyard wars? :3  
How much will the videos be delayed because of this AmA? 
Hey Linus, what's with the nails in some of your videos? 
Hi Linus,  How do you deal with people outside of the YouTube community when trying to explain what you do for a living? You've made great strides in creating your own company, was it ever difficult trying to get loans or other business backing (outside of the tech industry like when you got the warehouse) with such a unique company?   Also, what do you tell your kids your job is? Any ideas on what awesome build to bring for your first "Parent Show and Tell" event in a few years? ;p 
Hi Linus.  Did you feel the growth in Linus Tech Tips as it got on and on or was more of a "Holy crap we're bigger than i thought" kind off a thing? 
What's one piece of tech that you'd love to see come back or updated, and one piece of tech that just needs to stop? 
What's happening to the old workstations now that you've upgraded to x99? Are they just being thrown out, or will there be some kind of giveaway? 
Hey Luke! Are you still planning to finish your engineering studies? 
Do you watch other Youtube channels? What are some of your favorite ones? 
With the talk about Luke moving into new offices for FPC, is FPC growing much faster than expected? And will the two branches of LMG remain in separate locations or is it just temporary? I don't want Luke to leave, I like watching the whole crew and Wan show with him in :( 
Hey guys! Are you ever going to do another PC build in mineral oil? The last one was very captivating to watch.  
Any chance for a follow up video on Linus' Civic?        Perhaps RGB lighting :) 
Hi LMG, I have two questions.  1: What are some of the perks of working in such close proximity with the CEO of the company?   2: When new members are added does everyone get less work or the same amount ?  
Oh man... Is there any reason not to make content "Linux" related? It would be such a good thing if you could just check how Linux works out of the box in all those laptops you review...  And thank you for such an amazing channel!!! 
How different is working at LMG for you original Members nowadays with more people?  Do you miss the old days with only a handful working together?  
What's the most gut-wrenching moment you guys have ever experienced when building a computer? Commercially or personally.  I'll never forget spending every last penny I had saved for months on a 2nd hand GTX 670, only to plug it in and have no response. Thankfully it was the PSU, but after a couple restarts my heart still sank.  
Linus, have you ever watched Mr. Robot? What is your opinion about it? 
Hey there Linus, why do look so depressed taking that picture for the ama?  
What is the future for LTT? Do you guys collectively or individually have any ideas for new shows, ideas or challenges? How does Floatplane tie into it? Thanks! 
Do you want your kids to be tech savvy as you are or just let them be what they wanna be?? He was team red the way he chose all the red colored parts when building a pc with you lol  
Why does LTT base everything on "How good is this for gaming"? 
Kyle from BitWit is using Youtube Premium to achieve early release videos to subscribers. Why not use that format instead of re-inventing the wheel with FPC? 
What is your end game for LTT/LMG?   Will you start a PC web-store similar to NCIX/Newegg/etc..? 
Hi Linus, I love your channel and watch it basically every day, how do you find the creativity to come up with a new video every day? 
Luke, Ed, and Brandon:   Is how much creative freedom do you guys get? Or put another way, are the channels "The Linus Show with supporting characters" or is there feedback from most of you guys as to what you want to do?  Second question, whos idea was the $130K+ worth of RED Weapon gear (not including Petabyte Project)? Was Linus really that shocked when he read the pricing invoice? 
Any camera related videos in the pipeline? Haven't seen Brandon in the spotlight recently 
Hi linus, what is the current state of float plane club and how close do you think you are before other channels start to use your platform?  
What was your reaction when super soakers became as successful as they did? Are any of your other patents as recognizable in their respective fields? Did super soakers help you jumpstart any of your other research either through funding or recognition  
what's your opinion of foam dart guns? And do you have any good puns related to nuclear energy? 
What's the strangest reaction you've come across when people find out you invented the super soaker?  
Will we ever see a toy water propulsion system better than the super soaker or is the super soaker the peak of toy water propulsion technology? 
We can clearly see this product was a hit. Can you tell us about one of your failures, or inventions that didn't "take off"?  Thanks for making childhood a blast 
Was it an instant success? How long did it take to become popular? 
I remember the first time i saw a Super Soaker when my family was on vacation in Florida. It was a Super Soaker 50 and I knew I had to have one. When we got home my mom got me one. My friend down the street got a Super Soaker 100 and I was never able to compete in a fire fight which made me so frustrated with my beloved SS50. I still schooled all of the plebs with inferior non SS products. That was fun. No question here. Thanks for the memories!  What are some of your favourite childhood toy memories? 
Is it true that the world of toy merchandising is super-cutthroat and full of industrial espionage? 
Is it true that you are working on a super super soaker contract for the department of defense? 
Hey man!  How did you realize Hasbro was undercutting your royalties?  What are you doing for fun these days?? 
What is the secret to make a super soaker shoot really far? 
What's the strangest use you've seen for a Super Soaker? 
Any wisdom to offer about life?  Clearly, you were a smart guy on a good path. But was there anything beyond, *Oh, that would be a cool watergun*, that led you to create one of the most successful toys ever? 
Is there a Super Soaker model which reached an unexpected commercial success? Likewise, is there a model which failed to meet expectations? 
So, do you get free super soakers? If so, I can imagine that a weekend at grandpa's would be pretty awesome.  
How does it feel to be a part of millions of people's childhoods?  
Do you have a giant wall / room in your house dedicated to displaying every super soaker ever made?   If so, can we see this holy super soaker hall of fame of yours? 
you said it was an accident, what were you working on or trying to create when you made the super soaker? 
Do you feel that other nuclear engineers judge you because of the Super Soaker? Don't get me wrong, but in such a high-level industry, it feels very easy to become the "water toy" guy. 
When it was being designed, did you or anyone else wonder, "Hmm, are people going to convert these things into flamethrowers?"  
What's your opinion on the fidget spinner? Is it just a fad to be forgotten or a classic here to stay? 
I understand that the JTEC could be used at nuclear power plants. Is it possible to apply that technology to nuclear reactors on aircraft carriers, or other nuclear powered vessels? If so, do you think there will ever be government contracts to install one of these converters on a carrier? 
What is the best invention or idea you've had that for whatever reason never really materialized? 
Did you ever expect it to take off in popularity the way it did? 
What kind of Super Soaker ideas were left on the cutting room floor? 
Do you feel that as the inventor of the super soaker it overshadows, or causes other scientists to be reluctant, of any scientific work that you undertake?  
I gotta ask did the super soaker pay off ???? If so how comfortable are you?  
I have many ideas, but so afraid to move forward in them because I fear they will be stolen and I well . . I don't think I can handle watching a million dollar idea be stolen from me while I cannot afford legal representation to fight it off.  Uh, how did you overcome that fear (if you had it that is)?  
Were you ever paranoid that you'd received bait money or that somebody saw you get into your vehicle, or were you really that calm? I don't have the bone in my body that would allow me to do something like rob a bank, but if I did I would imagine id be super paranoid about trying to deposit the money. 
Was your wife or family aware that you were robbing banks? Was this a dirty secret?  
What's the most cash you ever got from a single robbery? 
How much thought and planning did you put into it beforehand? Did you have a clean getaway car, pre selected route, etc?  Did you scout banks and pick the best times? Or did you just decide to up and hit one? 
Would you want your experiences to be made in to a movie? 
If you'd be able to tell your 10 year old self one thing, what line of crime would you recommend him? 
Do you think you'll ever rob a bank again? If not, why not? 
How do you think the world of robbing banks has changed since you were doing it? While the cameras are slightly better than they used to be, it seems that very few bank robbers actually get caught barring ridiculous stupidity. Even those whose faces are caught on camera walk out of the bank with typically a couple grand and no consequences thereafter.  Considering it is a federal offense, I am curious as to how seriously you believe law enforcement takes some of these robberies, given how small the quantity of money is and nobody being harmed in the process. It seems as though, given the lack of news coverage on such small time jobs and the lack of anyone ever being caught, that someone could easily rob a bank or two and continue life and working their 9-5 job as though nothing ever happened 
If you drop an object into the goal of a foosball table (let's say a cell phone) and you can't get it out by hand is there any way to remove it without somehow destroying the table? 
How did it feel always living on the edge like that? Always looking over your shoulder and trying not to get arrested? 
Is it a lot harder to get a job after robbing banks? 
Did you ever leave a calling card, or take any trivial souvenirs? 
I am an unarmed security guard that worked in a variety of banks to be that first response for when people rob banks. So if you ever seen that commercial where someone robs a bank and everyone turns to the security guard and say, "I'm not a security guard. Im a security monitor", that's me!  My question: when you see a 3rd party officer, is what is your reaction and what do you to get around them? Does it make the robbery and easier.   Because I always said as soon as someone pointed a weapon or threatened my life, I was quiting right there. 
Do you feel guilty about how the tellers must have felt being robbed? 
Let's cut the shit here and tell us, are there Bank Robber groupies? 
First off, thanks for the book, secondly, the heist scene in Heat (i.e. Where they're actually in the bank / controlling the staff and punters) *felt* pretty authentic, was it?  Also, what other films have shown the craft well? 
How many years of your sentence did you actually serve? I see in your attached proof the sentence date is 2008 for 20 years, so release 2028, but as far as I am aware it is 2017. 
What are your thoughts on your fifth grade teacher? 
What was your education level at the time of your crime spree and do you feel anything in your upbringing would have swayed you from NOT robbing banks?   I would rather my children not rob banks for fun.  
I was robbed at gunpoint when I was 20. I have a lot of hatred towards the man who decided that was a good idea. It made me have panic attacks and eventually caused me to quit a job I loved and was good at.   Do you ever think about the tellers who were on the other side? Do you feel any remorse for what you put them through?  
When you decided to turn yourself in, how long did you expect your sentence to be? 
I am very curious, if you never wore a mask or gloves, how were you never caught? Also how did you handle the threat of being caught at any time of any day? 
If a teller had refused to give you any money, what would you have done?  Did that ever happen? 
What was it specifically about robbing banks that appealed to you? Why not any other type of theft/crime?  
Was your family in shock when they found out you were going to prison? What was they're reaction?  I saw in your previous AMA that you only admitted to robbing three of the countless banks you robbed, could you still be tried for any remaining robberies if they figured it out/potentially see a thread like this?  Thank you in advance! I am very intrigued by your story and just want to wish you well for whatever the futre holds for you. 
This probably a naive question, but we're you nervous when going to jail? Because everyone seems to make it out like if you don't join a group in there your just going to get shanked or some shit.  
How did cameras never catch you or how did the teller never report your face? 
I'm about to start grad school in order to become a psychologist working in the prison system, is there anything that you experienced in prison that you would be willing to share in order to give me a better idea of what I'm getting myself into? 
How was Dave Ramsey off mic?   Lame question, but honestly just wanted to say thanks for the book and you were definitely the most interesting guest on the show. 
Is there anything a teller could have done to spoil your plans? If so, what? 
Odd question... If you take your total haul and divide it by your time served in hours plus the time to commit and plan the work... what are your hourly earnings for robbing a bank over your lifetime? 
I think I know you. Did you ever live on the 23rd floor of a building in Austin? 
What would you do if the teller said no when you handed them the note demanding money? I use to be a teller and was always curious what would happen if I refused.  
Would you consider bank robbing a sort of "gateway illegal activity" and you still crave the feeling of doing something bigger or have you just called it quits? 
What did your notes say? Why would people just hand you money in exchange for a note 
If you didn't go to prison would you be better or worse? 
I robbed banks too!  Small world huh?  Yeah my parents and siblings never suspected a thing when i took an extra 20 or 50 from the monopoly bank.  I knew only to take small bills so they wouldn't get suspicious.  So glad i got that off my chest.  I feel better now. 
Are public land giveaways determined by Congress or are their things that state/local governments can do to chip away at these protections? 
They must have kept this very quiet, given that I work for one of the agencies in charge of these public lands and am completely unaware of these attempts at sell-offs.  With that in mind, can I ask you what you think of the State owned vs. Federally owned public lands argument?  For those of you that grew up (like I did) back east, you may not be aware of what a privilege it is to have Public Lands out here in the West.  Cattle and people both roam freely out here, there is land aplenty for recreation of all kinds, it really is an entirely different feeling than the eastern half of the country where there is a constant questioning of whose land you're on and if you're allowed to be there doing what you're doing. 
Not sure if this is quite relevant, but what kind of enforcement do lumber companies have in making National Forest land "private"? I'm a big fan of my local NF, El Dorado National Forest, but when just wandering around or exploring it's almost impossible to really explore and enjoy the isolation due to "No trespassing, property of (lumber company)" signs that seem to surround both sides of every road that keep anyone from really going anywhere off the road. On top of that, they put up locked gates, metal barriers or just simply tear up the forest with bulldozers to make trenches to keep people out. Is this legal? 
How do you feel about tribes buying culturally important land? 
Is it possible for private citizens to purchase these lands? There's some state owned Adirondack parkland near me that my family would love to take under our stewardship, if only to assure its well-being. 
Are there specific companies that profit from this? 
Considering how, in the west of the country, enormous amounts of States' lands lie in federal hands, can it really be said that vast untapped territories are really rendering the nation any service?  Why is it ethical for the federal government to requisition land and bar the public from purchasing it? What of States' sovereignty? 
Out of curiosity, and it may have little to do with the issue, but is that anything like the eminent domain issues were currently facing in the small town where I live?  
What can I do to have the government give me free public land? I then want to turn around and sell it to somebody else for a profit. Ideally, I'd like my land to be mineral rich or oceanfront. You know what? Just let them know I'll take all of it. I'm not even greedy, I'll settle for half.   Please and thank you.   Also, what's your favorite piece of baseball equipment?  
* How would you get the two sides to start communicating? I know people like to play the blame game, but it's the fault of who's in charge of both parties  * Media is here to sway people's opinions reporting on things without facts. When did the media take such a bad turn? 
What can we do to get hunters and hikers to partner up and protect public lands?  
How recoverable will these lands be? Unless America continues on its current path of self destruction and ignorance, I am forced to believe the next president will be a sane one who will want to undo this. How easily can it be undone, if at all? Are the drilling practices they plan to use going to permanently damage these areas? Once given away can we not get them back? What is the long-term assessment for regaining these lands for the public or have we lost them for good? 
Where can I get information on how I can buy this land? Is it just going to be auctioned off? 
why don't you think states should oversee their own land? could you explain your position on that? shouldn't people that live in that state control the land there not someone in D.C.? 
What other people/organizations do you feel are doing the most to fight against the transfer of federal land?  Is there anyone or any organizations that you feel could do the greatest amount of good with our support? 
What's the problem in giving land back to the states to take care of? Seems like it's a 6 to one, half a dozen to the other scenario?? 
Is the land actually decent? AKA not like when they sold it to fools gold rushers back in the day? Or will people be stuck with 5 acres of gorgeous desert in the middle of nowhere?  Can you choose your location?   Is this some sort of land lease program where you'll have to give the government every cent you make off the land until you die - aka what's the catch?  
Why do you support unconstitutional federal holding of property? How is it ok for 80% of Nevada to be federal instead of state or private, when the Feds have no enumerated power to hold it and by common law the lease holders should have ownership rights? 
I'm a baby journalist, freshman in college! Any advice on breaking into the industry? I already schmooze with the higher ups for advice and work on the school paper, trying to open an investigative unit.  
What's your stance on the vast federal lands in the western United States? Should those not designated as parks or military  bases  be given back to the  states? 
I'm a libertarian, I firmly believe that the government should not be involved with anything & a great stepping stone toward that would be States Rights. That being said, my least "libertarian" stance is that of the environment. There needs to be a "higher power" to protect our gorgeous land. I would much rather National Parks exist by the state than say, McDonald's. What is the difference between federal land & state land? Shouldn't individual states decide what to do with their land?  
Do you seriously consider yourself a non-biased journalist with no personal agenda here? 
How is giving away federally owned land to the states wrong? It's absolutely silly for the federal government to own vast tracks of land and charge people for its usage. The government doesn't in any way use "public lands" responsibly by not allowing the states to use it. Local governments exist for a reason, because local governments can serve local interests. If you want the land used responsibly you should want the land to be under the control of the people who live there, not under the control of the federal government which is phenomenally difficult for anyone to hold to account. 
So why is this a bad thing? It gives people the opportunity to purchase land? Land is only going to appreciate so it looks like a great investment opportunity for people. 
What's the matter with the Federal Government giving land to the states in which those lands exist? 
Did you have any memorable moments encountering wildlife? 
What is the night sky like in the middle of the ocean where there is no light pollution? 
How did it feel going that long without a shower?  I can only imagine how gross that must have felt....  
You mentioned rowing through a hurricane..  How does one even do that? How do you manage yo keep a rowboat upright through a hurricane or tropical storm? 
What was the hardest or most dangerous part of your journey? 
What was the plan if the boat was damaged and sank? Was there a small life raft in the boat somewhere? Handheld emergency beacons? 
How long were you into it before you said "Man, what the heck am I doing?" 
Did the boat have everything you needed or were there support type vessels with you? If so, what kind of services did they provide you?   Also, does your mental state become an issue? I feel like I'd start to get a little funny doing the same thing day in and day out for 2 months. 
What was a typical day like, what were you eating? 
Did you see any sharks, whales, wildlife of any kind? 
Wow this is extremely inspiring.  Might have to try and do something like this within the next couple of years.  Were there any times you were scared for your life? 
What was the first meal you ate when you got back?   This is one the coolest and most fascinating AMAs I have ever read. What an adventure!  
What did you use for navigation?  If your electrical system failed what would you rely on to know your position? 
You mentioned that upon your return your family/friends(?) claimed you couldn't keep a normal conversation. Do you feel different?  
wow that's amazing.. were you bored at any point?  
That's absolutely incredible! How did it feel being in a tiny boat, knowing how incredibly deep the ocean underneath you was? Also, how did you get all the way across and still spell 'Atlantic' wrong?  
Wicked chaco tan. Why did you even wear shoes at all?   Also, this is a super quality AMA. Reading it has been inspiring and awesome. 
How long did you train?   Which season and route was best?   When is the inspirational Disney Release?   Can you too the door from a fridge? (Lats)   Peace out  
What's your favourite sea shanty? Any spontaneous renditions of "row row row your boat?" 
Who sings louder? I tried finding it in your videos but wasn't able.  
How much rowing dod you do in prep for the journey? 
Were you both conscious of the "Personal time" a human needs when at sea for 58 days? Did you accommodate for that or just ignore it? 
1. How did decide when was the best time to leave? 2. How long did you estimate that it would take? 3. Was there any romantic activity between you and George on the trip and if either of you were not single, how did your s.o. feel about you being in a boat with someone else? 4. What was the plan in case something horrible happened? 5. How much weight did you lose by the time you were done? 6. Were you noticeably stronger after rowing for ~60 straight days? 7. How'd you poop and pee and what'd you do with the toilet paper?    
How much food did you have to take? Was it mainly tinned/dried food? 
Man I hate even swimming in the ocean where I can't see whats around me, and you manage to travel across an entire sea!  How were you okay with the fact that you're in this small boat with hundred of miles of sea under you?  That seems terrifying. 
I have a couple of questions.  Looking through the pictures, it looks like neither of you lost much weight (not that there was much weight to lose in the first place). Was this due to a lack of exercising that you could do?  Also, did you guys end up having any sex during the row? 
Oh My God! I never even thought that's possible! Amazing and congratulations! Why? :)  
Did you arrive in Antigua? Seems like Antigua is the place. There was 3 or 4 that just did the same thing in the last couple of years (trying to break the record for time).  
Why did you choose a 3 hour on and 3 hour off shift? Was there a reason behind not choosing a longer shift? 
I didn't even know this was a thing that people did. What is the history of this type of endeavour? Also, go big red! 
I know George's dad. He was the judge who married me. My question is: What's up? 
Who designed and built the boat? How much would that cost? 
Any surprises along the way?  Would you do anything different on your next ocean row? 
On a personal level, what are some of your favorite films? 
Two questions (if that's ok)   How did you get back home (if you did lol)?  What were you feeling/thinking when you left?   I'm just an adventurer, who plans on traveling.   Thanks!  
Did you ever get bored? What'd you do to pass time? How did you manage 58 days without a shower didn't you get all rashy? I know I do if I go like 3-4 days without a shower much less 58. 
1) How did you guys stay clean? Was it even an issue? 2) Watching your video, seems like dryness was an issue, any recommendations in hind-sight? 3) Could your average in shape person do this? 4) Would it be possible to do an 8 hr on 8 hr off shift? 5) Have you ever done a long backpacking trip? How would this compare to doing say a week long 100 mile 30k elevation gain trip in terms of daily effort? Obviously a lot longer, but I hope my question is at least somewhat clear?  
How often are you on Reddit and what are your favorite subreddits? 
What other outdoor sporting activities are you really good at? 
How did you 2 not get major sunburn? Did you each have a gallon of sunblock supply in which you could  apply some every day ? 
How long after you hit land did your body still feel the movement of the ocean? 
Would you want to write or co-write a book about the rowing trip? 
How, did you get 2 months away from work? Are your bosses that nice and generous?   And When you you got home did you go straight back to work or were you able to relax and get a massage and day spa treatment? 
I read about some of the snacks you brought on board...did you guys make sure your freeze dried meals had efficient calories for that kind of exercise?  What about salts to retain water, macronutrients? Was that tracked or thought about very much? Did you lose weight during the journey?  Thanks! 
How did you get involved in something like this? I rowed in college, but crossing an ocean is another thing entirely.  
Did your journey involve crying? I just watched a documentary on 4 women who rowed the Pacific. There was crying.  
Did you get enough food? how/what did you eat to get enough energy?  Remember seeing someone doing this in the pacific and they got burgers flown in by helicopter near the end 
Were you the first boat to finish the race? If not, then how long did it take the winners to finish? Did everyone finish the race? 
How did you achieve sleep on the crossing? Did one of you sleep while the other rowed or kept watch for some weather issue that would need both of you awake and alert? Or did you sleep at the same time? Seems dangerous, but I'm completely out of my element on this one. I start panicking when I lose sight of land, so this achievement of yours is, in my mind, someone performing the completely impossible. Congratulations to you both!! 
Did you see any cool animals on your trip? Any sharks or scary moments? 
How often do you talk about your rowing trip at bars and parties and people don't believe you so you have to show them the proof you showed us Redditors? 
What did you 2 forget on shore that you had room for and would have been helpful or enjoyable to have onboard for the trip? 
You are an amazing role model, Patti!  I love it when you and your peers pop up on letsrun to offer wisdom and commentary.   Do you think track & field "needs" to be more popular as a spectator sport? 
I'm glad I read your story, it's amazing how it all started with wanting to "be nice to yourself". So many of us, especially as young girls, we are often pressured to be a certain way, because of society, that we get to stuck in what others want from us. You broke through that, and it's so inspiring!, and incredible. It reminded me that it's been years since I've been really nice to myself, and then I stop. Being over weight I know it's something I need to be healthier over all but it's sooo incredibly hard, and even embarrassing to go workout at the gym, thinking, how did I get this far?. Anyways, it was delightful, and motivating to know of you Mrs.Patti, may you you be an empowerment for women/girls always!. 
First, I would like to thank you for helping pave the way in women's athletics. I just started running about three years ago and have been nothing but supported by my friends, family, and the running community, and I feel very thankful that I didn't have to face the same kind of challenges to competing that you and other leading women did.  Second, I was wondering how many years it took you to build up to 120 mpw. Obviously at seven miles for your first run, you've got a solid head start on most of the population. Did you jump pretty quickly into the 40s, 50s, and 60s, and then take a longer time to build up from there or did you find yourself well-suited to high mileage very early on?  If you ever find yourself on reddit again, we'd love to have you hang out with us over at /r/advancedrunning! 
What tribe are you from? Do you ever go to reservations and speak to the children/people?  I think this is so inspiring. We have a womens running group on my reservation and we participate in many runs. From 5ks-100 milers.  
Through your years of competition and training what injuries would you say are most common? I know that many people warn about knee issues but I never really hear many athletes themselves complain about knee problems. 
You wrote that you are restarting your career.  What did you do in the years between your running glory and now? 
When you started the Be Nice To Patti Campaign, how did you go about setting personal boundaries and not giving in to those, especially in personal and professional relationships? 
Would you rather have Prefontaine's flowing locks or Mills's buzz cut? 
Great write up for the introduction!   At the end you said you're restarting your career. Does that mean your running career? If yes, is there anywhere you post online as to how you are progressing, that I can follow and keep track of?   All the best! 
Hello! You seem  a wonderful person!  I'm not a runner (i play tennis though) and I really admire what you do! I can't run half an hour whithout feeling dead, lol. My questions are  1)What advice would you give to a young athlete?  2)Which books would you recommend? (not related to running, sorry)  3)How do you deal with exhaustion? It's a huge problem for me.  Thank you very much for this AMA!  Love from Italy!  
What do you think is missing for female athletes when it comes to care from doctors, trainers etc?  I've noticed that most is focused towards a male genetic make up and female athletes are mostly left to fill in the gaps for how their system works.  How did you account for that in your training and self care? 
How do you feel pregnancy impacts women's ability to sustain top class performance? I've read some articles suggesting it can actually improve performance post-pregnancy. 
I seem to be having a problem getting back into running. When I was in my 20s I ran 5km a day no problem. Now every time I go to run my smoke seems to go out and I have to stop and relight it every 100m. Do you have any advice? 
What do you think about during long runs? Does your mind just kind of empty and you go through the motions? 
I love your story and it really inspired me as somebody who's intro to running was similar to yours. At what point did you decide to start training for races? Did something or somebody inspire you to start racing, or was it more of a spontaneous decision? 
I always get shin splints about a mile into every run, any tips on avoiding/reducing shin splints? Should I keep running/stretch it out or just stop and try and go farther before next my run.  
Hey! Thanks for doing this and all you do, and a lot of these questions are great, but here's a fun one! What's your guilty pleasure food? 
This is great! Thanks for doing this! I used to run around Quincy a lot, mostly by the water (I would pass the old Beachcomber), and had a nice 10k loop.   My question is: Do you wish you had the chance for the Olympics in 1980? I don't think they had the women's marathon until 1984 and there was the boycott in 1980, but maybe you could have made it in the 10K? Did you try at all for the '84 team?  
What do you think about on long runs? Do you daydream? Fantasize about something? Where does your mind go or do you experience a sort of 'Highway hypnosis' during a long run? 
I just started running a month ago. I see the future runner me as going fast and long. Do you have any tips you'd give me right from the start?  
Hi Patti! Thanks for your contributions to sports and getting women more involved in athletics. What's your favorite fruit? 
This is awesome. You are awesome! I've been having excellent strength progress on my powerbuilding program but I want to run well too and I'm including running goals on my plan TODAY!!!  What were some of your first running goals regarding distance and time? I think I will focus more on speed than resistance to use the advantage I have right now and build upon it. Thank you so much for your story! 
What's your experience with doping? Did you do it? Observe it? Did you see anyone that was a really weak runner turn into an amazing one? 
This is such an amazing story Patti! I am so inspired! I myself recently started running and training for a half marathon when I previously couldn't even do a mile at the beginning of the year. Now I can run up to 8 miles and will be doing my first half at the end of June!   What are some tips that you have for your speed? And also, how do you motivate yourself to run when you feel tired, sick, or just down? Sometimes after work, I'm very tired and can't bring myself to do anything.  
How does it feel to have to add the "for a woman" or "for a minority" qualifier to all of your achievements?   
Did you ever use recovery techniques like aqua jogging? How effective did you find them? Asking for a friend... 
I'm struggling through a big mental block right now. Do you have any tips on how to stay on track?  
Hi! I get winded and tired so easily when i run.  how do you build endurance? 
do you still like baseball nut? i like it as a shake, myself. 
Hey thanks probably late but, did you hear Haskell closed the track program ? 
Maybe I'm late, but I've gotta know - How many pairs of shoes have you gone through? How many miles would you wear a pair before replacing them?  Your post was definitely inspirational. I've never been a great runner after a couple knee injuries/surgeries, but I feel like I should start again and try to knock a few pounds off.  
Something potentially off topic but I'm part Mi'kmaq as well, grew up in Halifax, I was wondering where you're mother was from in NS? 
You're probably never going to see this, but I wanted to say that your story is so freaking inspiring. Also we have the same birthday, are the same height, and I've also been enrolled at Quincy College! I've just been wanting to knock my 5k under 20 minutes and qualify for Boston...maybe I'll set bigger goals for myself!  How did you avoid getting injured during your quick rise to an elite level? 
Hi Patti, what "American Indian" tribe are you from? I heard you mom is from a tribe in Nova Scotia, First Nations Micmac and your dads 2nd generation Irish.  Maybe you meant Native North American? 
How does it feel to answer all of these questions? What kind of questions are the best in your opinion? 
Kiwi are amazing! They're my favorite fruit, do you eat the skin or do you peel/bowl the fruit? 
Uh, you're white. Not Native American. Stop culturally appropriating? 
What does Ticketmaster do with all the pain they harvest from the souls they rip off at the box office? 
What "insider tips" do you have to get good tickets?  Can I bribe a Ticketmaster employee for good seats?? :-) 
ive been doing that for almost 3 years! my theater is going dark for 3 months now and i am jobless try as i might.   which ticketmaster did you use? we had an old school version TMWin99 
Why did they switch to Ticketmaster?   Did Ticketmaster convince them to through a sales pitch or did they just go out and select the most famous and biggest broker without looking at all the competitors of Ticketmaster?  Why did they no longer sell in house? What reason did they give? 
Are there any advantages to showing up in person at the box office to get tickets vs. online? 
Did you primarily do business in sports or theater sales where you were located? Always wondered what these jobs entailed, to be honest. 
What was the average "convenience fee" for tickets there? 
Have you ever done the water driving range at the GSR? 
What was the busiest day of the week at work?  What was the slowest hour of the week?  What was the busiest hour of the day at work?  What was the slowest hour of the day? 
Do you think any other options will be available in the future to purchase tickets? I know some bands like Pearl Jam have tried but have failed. Or, what would it take to overcome the power of Ticketmaster? On a side note, I met one of the multi millionaire early investors of TM. I can't remember his name. It wasn't Paul Allen but he was up there and the guy was creepy as fuck. 50 years old dressed in all black wearing Gucci shoes. Just gave us the creeps.  
Was the turnover at the box office as bad as it was everywhere else at the GSR? Also, how did you feel about the horrible management?  
How often are you on Reddit and what are your favorite subreddits? 
Hey there fellow Reno area guy. What happened to the prop airplane from Hello Hollywood, Hello? 
So how did GSR feel after Amy Schumer spent the first 15 minutes of her act talking shit about the venue?  For background: she was originally booked for their Grand Theater, which is one of the best venues in town. Then they decided to do renovations on the theater and they moved her to a convention room with ziptied dining chairs and a temporary stage. 
Before tickets go on sale to the public, what percentage of tickets are already sold off? 
Hey man, thanks for doing this. I'm a little late to the party but hoping you see this.. have a couple of questions.  1) What's to prevent people from using Ticketmaster as a "showroom" of sorts then converting to the venue's website and purchasing from there to avoid the Ticketmaster fees? Does Ticketmaster own the inventory or do they have exclusivity via the contract, etc. Could you shed some light here?  2) What's Ticketmasters opinion of the secondary market (stubhub, seatgeek, etc.)?  2a) Does Ticketmaster price to discourage resale? Or are they in collusion with the secondary market to maximize value to each channel?  3) Do you have an opinion of Nathan Hubbard? Think he probably predates you but he seems to understand the pain consumers go through when acquiring tickets (although he didn't really do too much about it).  4) Final request - give me your insider's-opinion on how we fix this market for the consumer. 
So I read that the whole idea of Ticketmaster is to throw extra fees on and take the pressure off of the artist or venue.  For example.   Better for your favorite singer to charge $50 a ticket with Ticketmaster throwing on $20 in fees as compared to $65 for the ticket and $5 for the fees.   Their whole model is to take the ire of the fans off of the artist/venue.   That is why they don't have competition.  Have you heard this, do you know if it is true? 
What hours of the day did you work?  How many hours did you work per week? 
How much does Ticketmaster give to politicians so that they don't get regulations and laws written against their anti-competion and anti-consumer friendly rules and prices? 
How often do you get to Lake Tahoe and the Ski Slopes nearby? 
What is your most angry Customer story?  What was the funniest moment at work? 
What would you have loved to have to make your job easier and/or customers' lives easier? 
Grand Sierra in Reno? Stayed there about 10 years ago. Pretty swanky.  
I just bought tickets Yo a local show and Ticketmaster sold my address to a ton of advertisers. How do I tell them to fuck off? I don't remember checking any sell my address boxes. My email was never bombarded with so much spam. It's all "music related" and conveniently says it comes from "not Ticketmaster".  I know it was them, it showed up directly after I bought tickets.  
I do Broadway-related things, and i want to pursue a career in it. What info can you give me regarding how my role (pun intended) could play in relation toward ticket sales? How could my performances promote to certain companies like StubHub or Ticketmaster?  
I'm probably dropping in too late but I recently bought tickets online to a concert. I knew when they would be going on sale so I was ready before hand. By the time I got to choose my seats the whole show was nearly booked. How can that be? If all seats go on sale at the same time, how are so many already sold as soon as they go on sale?  
what is a convenience fee? Can you make it inconvenient for me and not charge me this fee? 
Why is it that, when I tried to buy U2 tickets at the minute they went on sale, they were instantly sold out, but that there were hundreds of tickets on sale via TM in the days and weeks before the show date?   
Hey, cool! Another box office person! I manage a major theater's box office. Some years ago, I also worked at a box office that served as our city's only TicketMaster outlet (now long gone.) I fell into box office by accident, needing stable income to support my stage management habit, which ended up developing into a career. How did you end up in box office? Do you want to continue with that career path? I'm currently hiring at my box office, and none of my applicants have previous experience in the field. What do you recommend saying to fresh newbies? 
How do you feel about the annual arrival of the burners?  
Are they paying for your chemo treatments? I hear that company is cancer incarnate.  
Do brokers get the advantage of presale (and the better seats) and then jack up the prices for us regular folk? No matter how early I buy, for bigger shows, I can never really get that close.  Then I look on broker sites that seem to have awesome seats, with a 400% mark up.  
Small world.  When I worked at TM my team was building a web based replaced for the old windows & command line interface they used at box offices & outlets.    We rolled it out for the Beijing Olympics, but I left for Google after that.  Did it ever get deployed globally? 
Why don't venues price their tickets properly to avoid massive shortages that allows scalpers to make a killing? Why not just charge what the scalper would charge and actually pocket that cash yourself? 
How much over minimum wage did they pay you to buy your morals and conscience?    What is the going price to be a professional piece of shit? 
Were there episode ideas that were refused by Disney because of content matter or the company did not think it would be suitable for their general audience? 
What do you two think of *Bill Nye Saves The World*? 
Did you think that years after the show was cancelled, kids would still be screaming "BILL BILL BILL BILL" every opportunity they got? That song is like 90s kids national anthem.  
Were you ever approached about working on the new show? I would think if they were going for a reboot then they would want your opinions. At this point the new show is destroying what you guys helped Bill create, he needs you guys to come back to him and recreate the magic you once had! 
How important do you think striking a balance between entertaining your audience and informing them is? Was there ever a time or topic where you found it difficult to keep it fun enough for kids to stay glued to the TV but still educate them? 
How was Bill off camera? How much did he play up his personality? 
When you made BNtSG, how much were you influenced by Mr. Wizard's World?  I loved both and it seems like a great heritage of bringing science to kids. 
Why was the part about chromosomes determining gender taken out of the Netflix version of the series? 
IYO, has Bill changed in his approach to Science, since you guys did the show together? Like has he flopped his stance on anything he once believed? 
Hi!  Thanks for doing this AMA.  Who did the lyrics and shots for the Queen Lighteefah music video?  Oh my god, that was so hilarious and awesome... 
How did you pick Nye?  Were there other candidates with more academic credentials passed over in favor of Nye's stage presence? 
Are you related to the other famous Gottlieb from the Pawn Stars franchise? 
BNTSG will probably make the history books for its profound impact on this generation as we grow up and become more involved in the world.  Maybe a silly question, but do you feel that the show in a way fulfilled your life destiny/was what you were "meant to do" ?  
What do you desire for future educational programming?  Do you have a favorite educational show that's on right now? 
Hey guys, I think we may have a mutual connection with the fellow standing on the far left of that photo you're holding. Spencer McCulloh here. Didn't expect to see you two on Reddit this morning! But anyways here my question haha. How did Bill Nye end up being the science guy for the show?  
Hey guys! Big thank you for Bill Nye the Science Guy. I grew up watching it for my middle school science curriculum (I was homeschooled). I probably wouldn't have gotten my degree in Chemistry in college otherwise. Big thank you!  For your new show, have you had pushback in regards to finances being too "adult and boring" to teach kids? 
"Eat your crust Richie" is still one of my favorite quotes of all time.   How do you feel knowing that whenever the big tube tv was rolled into a science classroom, everyone in the room knew that we were going to watch the Science Guy, and we were all over the moon? 
Are there any statistics that detail the effects the Bill Nye show has had on young people? Is there any hard evidence that suggests there could be a trend between the amount of millennials pursuing science based degrees and professions and the original airing of your show?   
How long did it take to produce the average episode of BNtSG and what was your production cycle like and what did the process entail? 
Scientists like to debate almost everything. How did you deal with members of the scientiffic community taking issue with certain subjects that were covered on Bills show?  
What do you think of the politicization of science in our culture?  I find it despicable and dangerous. 
How much did bill get paid to go left and lie about how many genders there are? 
Who would win in a fight to the death, Bill Nye, or Mr Wizard? 
How do you become a show creator/producer? I have always wanted to create a show but I don't have any money. Do you start as a PA? 
1. How did you guys meet Bill? 2. What is something you enjoyed during your two week stay in Japan? (Awesome pic by the way!) 3. How tricky was it to incorporate and properly balance humor into the show without it getting in the way of educating? 4. Who or what would you say have had the most influence on you and what you do?  Thanks for the ama, guys. And thanks so much for co-creating such a wonderful and informative show.  
Which one of you was the deep-voiced announcer guy?  
You mentioned that you worked on Almost Live! Do you have any funny stories about that time? Any chance of a reunion show? 
How has getting a show produced changed as the technology has evolved? 
I recently went back and watched old Bill Nye episodes and your brand of humor/production (cutting clips, editing in sounds, wacky digital antics) struck me as waaaaaay ahead of its time. In fact, it kind of reminds me of Tim & Eric Awesome Show Great Job. Who's idea was it to have such zany post-production?  
What do you think of Bill nyes current show?   Do you approve of the censoring of the one scene in the episode regarding gender that Netflix ripped out?   
What are your personal thoughts on alternative medicine such as crystal therapy ? And psychedelics? 
The science of economics is rarely included in general popular overviews of science, and the expositions of it are rarely counted as science popularization. (For instance, I can't think of a children's economics show with roughly the same role in relation to adult ones like *Free to Choose* and *The Age of Uncertainty* as *Bill Nye the Science Guy* is to *Cosmos*.)  As the producers of both *Bill Nye the Science Guy* and *BizKid$*, why do you think this is so? 
Which came into your life first: a man named Bill Nye that had a persona that required you to build a show around or the idea of a fun science show directed at kids that begged for someone like a Bill Nye to pull it off? 
Did you know that Bill wasn't actually an accredited scientist when you made the show? Is that why he is a "science guy" instead of a scientist or was it just that it rhymed? 
Why does Bill Nye say sex is on a spectrum, when it is instead due to chromosomes?  
Question: Following the disappointing return of Bill Nye, with his "saves the world" show, have you been asked to produce a future show?  The show changed my life and was one of the best highlights of childhood. There is no reason it cannot be replicated for today's kids (if in the right hands as we have just learned). I hope you guys and Bill reunite. 
Why did you not come forward and debunk bill nye as a real scientist, instead you let him portray a mechanical engineer as a PhD scientist in multiple fields? Don't you think that is a false narrative when dealing with facts and scientific data in an area that is based upon truths? 
Is there a decision as a CEO that you regret or wish you could've done better? 
Any word on a splinter cell game in the works. What can we expect ?  
Do you feel like Ubisoft has improved their reputation lately?  
Do you enjoy games other than the ones made by Ubisoft? 
What's the most difficult thing you've had to do as CEO? 
Why is the Rainbow Six Siege team so small, despite having one of your largest player bases? 
What is your personal opinion on Rainbow Six Siege? 
How does one become a CEO?  What was your early life like?  
Hi Yves,  what old game would you want to be remastered with today's graphics ? 
What is your most beloved franchise within Ubisoft? (Not just now, all over the past 30 years) 
After Berlin, do you have actual plans to open further studios globally in the nearest future? 
How do you deal with the negative comments from so many players about your games?  
Will we ever see a resolution to the Desmond Miles story and the modern day assassins? The way that arc ended was very frustrating. 
Obviously a long shot, but would it be possible to meet you at E3?   So excited to see all of Ubisoft's projects at E3!   
Google has this thing called Google 20% which is set up to allow to spend 20% of employees time to work on their own projects and ideas instead of what they're hired to do. This encourages innovation. Does Ubisoft have anything in place for encouraging innovation?   P.S Not just for employees, do you allow other people to pitch you ideas and how have you made it easy for them to do it. Do you try and do anything to make their ideas or projects a reality?  what's the best way to approach you with an idea? 
What do you see as the next big leap in gaming technology? 
Anything interesting on the horizon that most people don't know about yet? 
Hi Yves!! I love watching you speak at E3, your enthusiasm for your company and games in general really comes out!   What would you say is the most important quality in a game? Story telling? Mechanics? World-building?   Also, AC: Origins looks incredible!! 
What is the future of The Division? Will there be a Division 2?  
Which chocolate do you prefer?  1. Swiss 2. Belgian 3. Whatever's melting on my tongue 4. White, because I don't know what I'm talking about ;) 
Why are you avoiding to do Assassin's Creed set in Feudal Japan? :D 
Thank you for hosting this AMA!  Did you ever think that when you first came into video games over 30 years ago, video games would become this big? (esports etc) 
Don't your fists hurt of knocking the shit out of all your competitors at E3 this year? Also what's the name of your dog we saw in a video a couple years ago? 
Thanks for the great opportunity, sir. My questions are:   1. What's your favorite setting for an Assassin's Creed game?  2. Can we expect Prince of Persia to ever make a return?  3. Do you prefer story-driven games or more action and multiplayer oriented ones?  4. Will there ever be a cinematic CGI trailer for Assassin's Creed: Origins?  5. Do you expect the Assassin's Creed franchise to end at some point? Or will it continue expanding to other platforms like movies, TV shows and comics?  6. Do you believe comic books are a good way to finish a game's plot?  7. Can we ever expect an adventure game by Ubisoft? Something similar to Quantic Dreams' Beyond: Two Souls?  8. Can we expect a collaboration with Hideo Kojima?  Thank you! 
Will Far Cry 5 actually look like the trailer? Or are we going to get another downgraded version like every game before it? 
Hello Guillemot!  My question is a concern I have about console parity. I'm planing to buy the new Xbox One X. And I know PlayStation has marketing rights for FarCry5. Will you take advantage of the extra power on Xbox One X for that game? And all your games for that mather?   Thanks and sorry if this is a silly question.  Best wishes to you and Ubisoft from me here in Norway :) 
Hi ! Why would Vivendi takeover would be so hostile to Ubisoft ? 
Why does Ubisoft continue to put microtransactions in games consumers are already expected to pay for despite them being seen almost universally as a negative inclusion by your audience? 
What the Hell kind of creature is Rayman supposed to be? He seriously creeps me out. An alien? An animal? A lab experiment gone wrong? An especially ugly person? What?   Also, what's your favorite piece of baseball equipment?  
Mike 'quick' Swick? Love your fights man.   I have watched you since you first entered in. Absolute mad man.   Do you think the new breed of mma fighters are really that good, or just that marketable? 
Was Thailand your primary choice or did you just say Phucket? 
Hey mike another big fan here. What made you get into fighting? What's ur gym in Thailand? Do DC and them train there? 
Holy crap! I never actually thought I'd get the opportunity to ask this, but at what point did you know you really wanted to step away from fighting, and are there days that you see your guys training and miss it?  Also, for a person that one day wants to go to Thailand and train, how difficult is the language barrier and is there any kind of time frame where you start to pick it up? 
Sup Mike! Big fan here, ever since I saw you KO Gideon a few years ago. You were one of the first fighters I got to see who actually had both real KO power and slicckkk jits.   My question for you is: who's your favorite fighter/fighters to watch in the UFC today?    Wish you the best with your gym and life man! 
Hi Mike! I'm a big fan. What is the craziest thing you ever saw while bouncing?  
Hey Mike great to see you doing this I always miss these things. What's your thoughts on fighters trying to come back ie. Chuck Liddell , Tito and now Randy saying he would fill in for bellator. The reason I ask is you seem quite happy and enjoying everything you have done after leaving the sport, I wonder if they just aren't as fulfilled in their lives after the sport? 
Does the ufc actually measure the fighters height and reach or do you just report it to them ? Hope you're doing Well mike.  
Hi Mike! I'm travelling to Phuket to train this summer and I'm wondering what sets AKA Thailand apart from the other super-gyms on the island? What would you recommend doing on Phuket that's slightly off the beaten touristy path? What led you to move to Thailand and start a gym there? 
What fight for you was the most memorable?  Both your own and one that you watched? 
What do you think of bareknuckle boxing? Best thing about living in Thailand?Worse thing? 
Do you run short term fitness bootcamps ?  I might be interested 
is there any chance for an AKA gym in the Philippines? 
Hi Mike, what's your thoughts? Has what Conor McGregor's done been good for the cause of UFC fighters?  
What's your stance on kids and martial arts? I want to put my daughter in jiu jitsu as soon as she is of the required age. Do you think that instills a sense of confidence and discipline as kids grow up? I want to raise a daughter with self esteem and confidence in herself and respect for her body...and for her to have the ability to defend herself if necessary.  What's are your thoughts?  
Do I need to be a fighter to train at AKA Thailand? 
Do you think you would have become a better fighter if you had went to Clear Brook? Just joking around but congrats on living out your dream.  
Do you train people who have a background in martial arts with a desire to one day compete in the ring/professionally? Is there a screening process or do you just take anyone? 
I didn't know that you operate a Print Factory. Do you work in there yourself on the printing line?  Do you still keep in contact with Jon Fitch? You and John Fitch were some of my favorites from AKA back in the day. 
I trained with Kaensak for a couple years and it was an incredible learning experience. Is he still talked about in Thailand? It seems he was a pretty big figure in a really tough time to succeed in Muay Thai. Also have you considered bringing the vlogs back? I enjoyed the shit out of those videos you made with Huerta back in the day!  
Hey Mike, are you still contractually connected to the UFC at all? If not is there any chance we get to see you have any more fights or have you completely retired from active competition? Would love to see you give Dan Hardy one last fight.  
You fish at all and if so what's your biggest catch? 
What advice do you give to people when starting their own business?  
Do you regret doing something in your life or do you regret NOT doing something in your life?  Also what is your LPT? 
hey Mike, if you had to give advice to someone starting a business, what would you say?  
Was there any fighter you hated that you fought? Do you still hate them now?  Who's your least favorite fighter nowadays?  
Mike, knowing what you know now, what would you do differently if you were starting your UFC career today? 
Wait, Mike's Gyms Mike? I've seen your posters out there. They're everywhere. 
If you have seen any of the tuf episodes recently. Compared to when you were on it, what do you feel like has changed or do you feel like it has gotten easier or harder or do they now focus more on getting guys drunk to do or say stupid shit with the boiiiz?  
Does you gym have a website of Facebook? Congrats on getting set up after the UFC.  Feels like you have been around forever, thanks for everything you did in the UFC. Anyone you are a big fan of these days?   If you could go back and have 1 more fight who would it be? 
Big fan!! Always enjoyed watching you fight. Thanks! .. What kind of print factory?  
Love your fights Mike, How'd you like car sales? I just got in the business 6 months ago. I'm loving it, any tips?!  
What do you think is the reason for the lack of Thai fighters in the UFC? Considering the country's strong background in Muay Thai, it seems perhaps surprising that there hasn't been a top, Thai UFC fighter yet  
Hey Mike,   I have a journalism degree but have been looking for my opportunity to break into the industry.  A good friend of mine is already in Thailand shooting for UFC and I have been looking to get over there.  Any advice on how you successfully transitioned over there?  Thanks in advance for any advice or suggestions.   
When is your first trip to the ISS scheduled? Do you need time to finish instructing the following generation of astronauts first? 
How do you work up the motivation and dedication to be successful like this? I am smart but unmotivated and lazy. Were you always this dedicated?  
What would you say is the best way to build my future, while trying to attain my dream, even it it seems unrealistic?  Basically, I would like advice on how to not be dirt poor while trying live out my dreams.  
What's up Mike, always loved watching your fights and got to watch you fight live against Marcus Davis at UFC 85 back in the day. Did you enjoy fighting in Europe and how does preparation for a fight overseas differ to fighting in the US? 
Do you have any tips for people who have just started doing mma or will start recently? 
Hi! I'm starting Brazilian Jiu-jitsu this week. I'm nervous because I'm kinda out of shape and not corrdenated as a woman. Any words of motivation?  
How shitty is it to do your taxes? It sounds like you would have 1099s from hella places, a mess of different self employment income to repott, etc. Im assuming you probably had a tax accountant do it for you. 
What kind of print factory? Like corrugated cartons?  
Hi Mike!  I wonder if you classes for kids/teens? If you do I would like to know a bit about your philosophy when it comes to training kids/teens in martial arts. The reason I am asking is even preteen Muay Thai fighters are in a sense professional prize fighters in Thailand.  
Do the AKA Thailand guys get hurt as often during training as the AKA San Jose guys? (only asking in jest).  Love your fights, miss seeing you in the octagon.    Also, you might get more questions if you post in /r/mma instead of this IAmA sub.   
Mike, when Dana let Brock Lesnar fight Mark Hunt without Brock undergoing standard drug testing, how does that affect the morale of other fighters? And, how contentious are these drug issue inconsistencies within UFC, from the fighter's perspectives? 
What's your advice for someone wanting to move from the US to Thailand?  Say, someone with a wife and kid.  Thanks! 
What are the nerves like when entering the octagon? I couldn't imagine stepping in without the anxiety of so many people watching! 
Hey Mike, just wondering if you had to keep up with any vaccines or therapies to avoid the endemic diseases (e.g. malaria, typhoid...) in Thailand when you first first moved? Or if you still have to keep up with them. Thats always been my biggest concern when traveling abroad. I loved watching your fights!  
So besides add, were you ever diagnosed with anything else? 
Fellow expat here living a couple hours away from you. How do you guys balance the party/drinking lifestyle with your training? Do you set rules for your students? 
Advice for a Nak Muay looking into transitioning to MMA? 
Mike,  I watched Gustafsson exploit the eye-poke advantage, clearly increasing his strike output while he had Teixeira fighting with one eye. What do you think the penalty should be for eyepokes? 
Hello,   My friend told me that sports at any high level, the athletes are using PEDs.    What are your thoughts and experiences with PEDS in MMA?   Thanks for your time and God bless!  
hey man, was just in Thailand for 2 weeks, Phuket is gorgeous. I'm considering moving there. How did you handle the visa process, it seems aside from getting married you can do a 1-year work visa, what did you do? And any advice for moving to TL? 
Sup Mike! Great to hear from you in this way and glad to see the post-fight career is moving along. Been an MMA-fan since the late 90's and always rooted for you!  Whats your thoughts on weightclasses? I think the UFC really could use a revamp around 170 where they add 165 and 175 and also maybe a cruiser weight at something like 215? Weight cutting might be mitigated a bit and some of these divisions are just too damned stacked atm. 
UFC changed a lot since its beginning. What do you think changed the most? What remains the same? 
So you're in a job interview. They take a quick look at your resume and ask, "Why haven't you stuck with one thing?" What do you tell them?  Is having such a diverse work history become a detriment? 
The biggest, most important question for Britain: do you support Lord Buckethead leading Brexit negotiations? 
What would your response be to people calling your policies "communist"? 
How do you plan to bring the national debt under control. When would you do this and how would do so while paying for your huge increases in spending? 
Its always hilarious to me when people make delusional AMA requests lol.  
Way too risky for potentially the next prime minister, nothing to gain, Reddit users already vote for him, and we'll just ask about his views on privacy, snoopers charter and the like and realise Labour are just as authoritarian as the Tories. 
Why did you celebrate a defeat like it was a victory when Labour candidates have won more seats than you and resigned? 
Good luck getting him to answer Anything. He won't be answering.. Would you use Trident? 
When will you finally step down so Labour might actually get back into power again? The one and only question that needs to be asked.  
Why do you believe in multiple genders? EDIT "More than two genders"/ 
This is a question from someone in your district. The quality of life in Colorado is being diminished by traffic. We see improvement being made around Denver, except for those of us on the north side. What will you be proposing to alleviate this critical issue?   
What do you think about the fact that CO real estate market has climbed so fast that middle class people can barely afford to own a home in CO? The rental market is out of control right now and doesn't seem to be coming back down any time soon. Any thoughts on this? 
My biggest complaint about John Hickenlooper has been that he's quite a bit cozier with oil and gas interests than I feel he should be, especially given recent issues such as the pipeline leak and subsequent explosion in Frederick. How do you expect your approach to these groups to be different? 
Assuming you win the primary, how do you plan to reach out to conservative sections of the state like Colorado Springs? 
What are your thoughts about NSA surveillance? Federal Reserve? Edward Snowden?  
Hi Congressman Polis, As a Colorado resident, I am increasingly worried about the poor condition of the state's infrastructure. Our roads are terrible and getting worse. How would you address our infrastructure as governor? Best wishes on your campaign! 
I'm 46 and current work for the City of Denver and seem to have a similar outlook as yourself; I've been thinking about how to work toward running for public office.  Any advice based on your path? 
Hi Mr. Polis. Thanks for stopping by my company (Namaste Solar) recently and supporting renewables in our state.   My question is, do you have any plans to further reign in or eliminate TABOR? 
Hey Mr. Polis.   Do you support free public higher education? If so, how would you plan to get there?  Single payer healthcare systems (if written better than last year's 69)?  Thanks! 
Good evening, Mr. Polis, from a fellow Coloradan.   Others have touched on the issues of housing, transportation, and infrastructure - significant matters, of course. My question is a bit more narrow, but it relates to jobs and to something you should be rather familiar with.   You and I both have a background in technology, and with the astronomical cost of living in Silicon Valley, many tech companies and qualified engineers and developers are starting to look elsewhere. Places like the Denver Tech Center, and Boulder, are promising hubs of technical development and innovation here in Colorado, and I'm optimistic that there is an opportunity for us in this area.   My question for you is this - what thoughts do you have on growing the technology industry in Colorado, and how can those of us already in it work to support this growth? 
Jared, how will you do more as a gov of Co, than you have as a voice of reason in the house? 
The Democratic primary looks already to be a somewhat crowded field. What good things do you have to say about your opponents and how do you plan on differentiating yourself from the rest of the pack? 
Congressman,  I'm a constituent in Clear Creek county. As a rural area, we have a lot of issues funding our school district, getting healthcare in the county, funding meaningful infrastructure repairs and upgrades, etc. My question is: how do you plan on addressing these sorts of issues in rural Colorado as governor?   
What are your thoughts on a universal basic income? 
If you were a color combination in MTG, which would you be? 
Jared, in what Areas would you like to see states have more rights over certain things rather than federal control? 
Where can I view your CNN special "Freshman Year" that you did with Jason Chaffetz? It seems to be gone. 
Jared, with the enormous amount of lakes, rivers and forests and large number of state parks and national forests and parks in your district and throughout The Centennial State, what efforts as a member of the house of representatives have you made to protect the environment and balances that with the protection of property owners and what efforts would you make in the future to protect the environment while protecting property management/control rights by citizens of Colorado? 
What do you think Colorado's most pressing infrastructure needs are? As governor, what infrastructure projects would you prioritize getting done?  What did you learn as a tech co-founder that has helped you most as a politician? 
Don't you think that Car sales tax in Boulder is a little bit high?  
What do you think of the question of whether Puerto Rico should be a state or not? 
Hey, I'm a member of your congressional district and I've always voted for you.  How many times has your LoL account been banned for flaming?  Secondary (serious question), 20 states now allow you to change the gender marker on your birth certificate without needing sexual reassignment surgery, but not Colorado. Will you support this and other trans rights policies if you are elected governor? 
What are your thoughts on the transportation crisis for individuals with disabilities and our seniors? 
Submitted this at town halls but it didn't get picked:  We've seen an increase from progressives in efforts to defend religious tolerance, but there's still massive cultural and governmental momentum to craft public policies based on the doctrines of a single religion. Are there any parts of your plan for Colorado that include bolstering research-based, evidence-backed decision making for state policies?  Sorry for the wide-ranging question, I know a lot of you goals are pro-science and pro-data, just wondering if religion-neutrality in government is something that's ever on your radar. 
Boulder County here. I'm glad to see you are running. My question is, do you think you can manage to not say something stupid every time you open your mouth like Hickenlooper does? He continually makes me embarrassed that I voted for him. I have been saying for a couple of years now that I want a different Democrat as Governor. 
Considering you're only one of 7 openly gay members of congress right now, what advice would you give to other LGBT Americans who want to get involved in politics and join congress? 
Jared, what are your thoughts on the TV show "South Park"?  In all seriousness, what could be done from the governors office and state congress in Denver to help those 80 plus miles away in rural Central Colorado improve their area economically?   
Hey! German politics student here so I really appreciate it when politicians of any kind actually dare to openly ask questions like this.  With Trump resigning from the paris climate deal, soon news came up that Governors and their respective states would "simply" bypass the white house's decision by pledging directly to the deal (I know this is vague as hell but it's 5:26 around here so please pardon me).  So I guess my question is, what's your personal stance of the climate deal? How important do you think it is for the US and it's states to stay relevant in fighting climate change (and the opportunities we got at hand e.g. the paris deal) and how what's your expectation/hope for the next 4 years should Trump stay in presidency?  Thanks in advance and good luck (or congrats) to your announcement and I hope you will rock it! 
Colorado has had a great windfall from marijuana taxes, but as other states continue to legalize the drug, how would you plan for a lower tax revenues, or do you feel the income will stay the same? 
I'm curious about how strongly you're going to stand against Fracking?  This is one of the bigger issues that matters to me, and while your probably going to be the best candidate regardless of your stance on this but it will help consolidate my continued support in you, and possibly influence my parents as well.  Best Regards,         SmaugTheMagnificent 
Hi Jared,     As a FC constituent I'm so excited to see you're running for governer! What do you think you could do as governer to encourage development of and access to high-speed fiber broadband in Colorado communities? Hope I can get involved in the campaign! 
Beyond the traditional Facebook/Twitter platforms, how are you leveraging social media such as Snapchat and Instagram in your campaign? Do you differentiate your efforts between fundraising and awareness/engagement? Good luck! 
Can you make sure John Elway stays the GM of the Broncos? 
Hello,  As someone who has an extensive background in entrepreneurship, philanthropy, and education, I was hoping you might have advice for my situation.  I am starting a charitable non-profit that will provide a free security offering to consumers, including free incident response services. I would like to collaborate with universities to give aspiring security professionals an opportunity to get real-world incident response experience while contributing to a good cause and fulfilling a serious public need.  Without an especially strong personal network, the marketing aspects of the venture will be the most daunting aspect of the endeavor. But I ultimately feel it will be worth that hard work to do some genuine good in an area where there is no focus by others. Given your own experiences, do you have any insight into how someone in my position could best engage the public, universities, and the government to raise awareness?   Thank you so much.  
While it's exciting news that you're running for governor, there's so much more you could accomplish-- especially on modernizing Congress with new technology and ideas. And with your position on the rules committee, a switch to a democratic majority could make you even more influential.   What did you weigh in making this decision and what do you hope to accomplish before your congressional term ends? 
I'm visiting Colorado for the first time next week. Any food recommendations in the Denver metro area? 
What do you think of the Job of how the Rockies are playing this year?  
Hey Jared, used to be a Colorado resident, voted for ya and I'm glad I did. Thanks for your good work.  Here's a funny question for ya, I'm curious what you think:  What do you think about the private military presence in Colorado? I know of a couple bases/compounds/buildings that contain and or are housing military-grade equipment under private/corporate control. How do you feel about this, both specifically in Colorado, and private military in general?  And secondly, if I may, gene-editing technologies are moving much faster than government. What do you think government could do to contain or subvert the threat of biological warfare from non-state actors? Is spying on citizens our best hope to stop this? It seems to have the largest existential threat to implementation-cost ratio. 
Jared, I named my fish after you. That said, what will you do to make Colorado better (and college students specifically. I go to CU)? 
Hello Congressman Polis. I had the great pleasure of meeting you in Fort Collins to talk about immigration and DACA issues a few months back. Do you have any preliminary ideas about the things that you would do as Governor to increase protection for immigrants in Colorado?  
Are you at all concerned that giving up a democratic seat in congress could help to further this administrations insane polices?  
Hi Jared, super psyched about your run for gov. We'll miss you in CD 2, but I guess we can share with the rest of the state!  My question is on education. Your plan for Pre-K and Kindergarten is awesome, but do you have anything in mind for funding the rest of K-12 and maybe even helping higher ed?  Growing up in a struggling district and then paying ever-increasing tuition for college, I feel this continuing underfunding of education is a growing issue that will hamstring our state economically for years to come.  
Constituent in Northern Colorado; have voted for you in each election. As governor, how will you support funding for higher education? As I'm sure you are aware, we benefit from an educated populace, but the cost of higher education keeps rising and pricing low-income qualified students out. 
How come you Congress people have the best health care coverage and you give us peons garbage coverage? 
Do you feel that if you don't do the bidding of the oil and gas industry that your livelihood will be jeopardized in some way? Why is meeting the greed of corporations more important to you than the health and well being of the people you are entrusted to represent? 88 and 89. 
Hi Jared,  Bit of a curly question for you:  If you had absolute power over the legal system in the U.S., what laws would you immediately implement/alter/eliminate?  Thank you for all of your hard work, I appreciate it greatly!!   --(constituent of yours in Boulder) 
Any thoughts on former Rockies manager Walt Weiss? He's an alumnus of my high school in NY :) 
When you voted for the SAFE Act in 2015 was that just xenophobia and bigotry or were you just engaged in some fear mongering to try and appear more moderate for this run?  
Do you support the Middle Eastern wars that America has been waging for the past 16 years? Why or why not? 
Do you feel that the legalization of marijuana may create a disconnect between a child and parents? I ask because, in our day and age, it's becoming harder to get through to our children with the amount of media they are exposed to. So my concern is that if we legalize marijuana, that increased availability of the drug may make it increasingly harder to connect with our children. 
Dude, where are located? I was diagnosed with an inoperable Grade 3 Anaplastic Astrocytoma in 2015 at the age of 20. If you ever feel like talking with someone your own age that is going through a similar situation with brain cancer, please do not hessite to get in touch!! Much love brother 
What symptoms led you to go to the doctor when you got diagnosed? 
Wow... That's a lot to deal with so young.   My mom was recently diagnosed with breast cancer... I just wanna know what keeps you going every day? I'm worried for her and I want to do my best to keep her happy but I have no idea what to even say at this point.  
I have two questions if you don't mind:  How has this battle impacted your perspective on life?   And   Ive heard stories about people being diagnosed that develop a bucket list mentality. Do you have any kind of bucket list or have you made certain activities/goals more of a priority in your life since being diagnosed?  Thank you so much for your time. Youre ability to continue the good fight is a testament to your inner strength and an inspiration to us all. 
Your bravery and willpower inspire me. What's your favorite form of creative expression? 
As someone with brain issues (an injury, not on your scale) I'm keen to find out, how much have you found yourself pondering where your brain ends and 'you' begin, and how united or separate they are to you? I know before my injury I would've just said that my brain is basically me as a person, but with it failing in ways there are times where that really doesn't seem the case anymore.  Best of luck with the fight :) 
Do you ever feel like just giving up? I can't even imagine doing 53 sessions of radiation never mind everything else you've been through. It's seems like it would be kind of hard not to be fatalistic in a situation like yours. Do you ever think one day you'll be in remission? Sry if the question is kind of personal.  
Where are you now in your diagnosis? Has your condition improved since?  
Do you find that you're less bothered by the little things in life now?  
Is there something that presses you on to keep living? 5 years sounds like a really long time to have cancer, I don't know about the cancer that you have, is it debilitating and you can't do a lot? Are you missing out on going to school or anything? I read you do music. 
What is your favorite activity and has that changed since your road to recovery??  
From what I can tell, you seem to be a pretty happy/optimistic guy. Were you always like this or was it something you had to work up to? Is it hard to stay positive? 
Have you had any particularly stand-out good (or bad) experiences with your medical care?  
What is the best or most memorable thing that a nurse ever did for you? 
What is your fighting force to stay positive every day? Much love and support!  
I'm a vegan too! I always encourage all my friends who have any health issues to eat more vegan meals. I really believe what you eat can have a significant impact on your illnesses. What's your favorite vegan meal? 
what is the worst part of chemotherapy?  how did most of your friend/family react? 
Tried any potential alternative treatments or solutions? 
Hi Richie, First, my best wishes are always with you. I hope you and your family are able to stay positive for as long as it takes, come what may.   My dad was diagnosed with Leukemia (M4) over a year ago and we ran pillar to post for 10 months. We went from a regular community level hospital from one country to MD Anderson, TX covering every possible level of hospital care and sophistication in between. And in our journey we came across other cancer patients who had their own stories.  We lost our dad but we are left with this intense desire to do something, to improve those affected with cancer. We hope to act on this soon.   Have you thought of anything on these lines? Do you any ideas you wish to discuss? Or do you know anyone who is doing something like this?  Richie, I wish you all good that can happen, from the bottom of my heart. More importantly a shout-out to your family and friends who are in this together with you. Always stay positive :) 
Ive heard of someone becoming severely mentally disabled after havint ear cancer due to the radiation  This sounds funny asking, but how are you not severly mentally handicapped? 
Have you ever personally experienced homophobia and what was it like? 
Are you in any current relationship, and how is it? And you also mentioned about a service helping lonely elders in need, how much has this service offered for you? 
Alright, here's a good one for you. What do you want your legacy to be? How do you want the future generations to remember you when they inevitably come across this AMA in the future? 
Do you have any racial preferences that factor/factored in to your dating, or was it never a consideration? As a blind man, what is your opinion of racial preferences in the gay community? Do you have any other physical preferences like fat/thin, tall/short, etc.?  The physicality of attraction seems to be a hot button topic in the gay community. Thanks for your thoughts. 
- What made you realize you were gay?  - What is the first thing that makes you attracted to a man? His voice? Smell?  - What is your favorite food?  
Are there any blind LGBT resources or activity groups in your city? If not, maybe you can start one!   
Hello Bob!   I've noticed recently that there are many gays who feel lonely in their life, despite the fact we now have much more tools to connect with each other than your generation had. Mental health issues are still a big problem among LGBT community, despite the fact that world is getting more accepting for us.   I guess you've had a fair share of bad luck in life, if it is okay to say like that, but what is your fuel for life? What keeps you going?   I read your story, thanks for sharing it with us! Regards from Finland, Europe. 
How did you write that note? Checkmate.  Also how can you prove you're gay? Checkmate^^2   
You don't understand AMA. Why would people trust you to run a country? 
Right, because that's when politicians make themselves available to the public. *After* an election.  
To each member of the animation team, which character from Camp Camp was your favorite to create and continue to develop?   Also thank you to all the members of the 2d animation team, Camp Camp is one of my all time favorite shows 
Hey guys, big fan of your work. I was curious when it comes to discussing the concepts surrounding new shows (like setting it in a camp, or following a rock band) how many people play a part in that process as it evolves? Looking forward to seeing more from you guys!  
How is the relationship between the writer and the animators in terms of communication? Is the script up for change on the day or do you usually stick to it? 
What has been your favourite complex shot to plan then eventually animate? 
What was your favorite episode of last season to work on? 
Are there any ambitious projects you almost gave up on, but stuck it out solely because of spite? 
First of all amazing job with Camp Camp its incredible.  and my question is who is your favourite character and why is it Space Kid? 
How long does it take, from brainstorming to release, to create one episode of the show?  Also, please release the animatics from season 1! 
Hello RT Animation team! Thanks so much for doing this AMA!  Firstly, how many people do you hire on (full time or contract) from discovering the fan work they've made? Be it fan art, fan animations, fan music/remixes, etc.  And secondly what creation have you contributed to within RT that you're most proud of?  Thanks a ton! 
Are there any features or memories of camps you went to as a kid that you've subtly incorporated into scenes of Camp Campbell? 
This may have been asked before, but who was the hardest character to write? 
Hey RT 2D team!  What programs do you use for shows like Camp Camp & X-Ray and Vav? Toonboom? Adobe Animate (aka Flash)? What does your timeline/production pipeline look like per episode?  Context: I work in 2D animated children's content and we've recently completed a whole show using Adobe Character Animator & doing more advanced animation within After Effects. I did the animation/editing, my boss and his wife did the voices and we completed a 15 episode (roughly 7-11 minute long episodes) 'show' in 4 months. I've never worked in a proper animation pipeline, I'd love to hear how RT operates! 
When you decided to become an animator, who inspired you to animate? 
Do the team members roles ever cross over into each other? (Ex. One of the writers being involved in character design, an animator pitching story ideas, etc.) 
What is your favorite moment from the season 1 and season 2?  
Have you ever hid easter eggs in scenes that nobody ever found? Like the alien on South Park sort of thing.  
If I wanted to hire a decent freelance animator to make a 90 second short, what should I pay them?  What should they charge? 
Who would be your dream voice actor for a new character next season?  
Sex Swing was understandably not for everyone, but I absolutely loved it. I just wanted to say congrats on that show, it was fantastic, and weird, and great.  Are there any fun collaborative plans you have for the other arms of Rooster Teeth for the future? Even on just a personal level, who do you really want to work with? 
What episode this season was the hardest animate? What was the hardest last season? 
When creating the characters which one went through the most changes while the series was being worked on? 
With the positive reception of season 1, has that given you more confidence/freedom in putting forward ideas and stories this time around? And has your approach changed at all compared to before? 
If you had to add a new permanent camper into Camp Campbell, what would their hobby be? 
What's something that no one has asked you about but that you're dieing to talk about? 
What TV/Movie monster do you guys think will be the most probable to attack Camp Campbell? and the most probable to attack your offices? 
I absolutely loved the end of that episode! Props to the whole animation team! Can we expect more songs in this season of Camp Camp?   
How has moving into your own building changed the department? Do you miss being in the thick of everything at the main RT building? 
In a time in which anti-semitism is on the rise, particularly here in the U.S. and over in Europe, why do you guys think it's funny to make anti-semitic jokes such as the entire episode last season, and the gas chamber jokes this year? As someone who is Jewish, I don't find it funny especially given that most of the people who DO find it funny are anti-semitic.  
In the proposal, you have mentioned that "similar Carter Center projects have eliminated river blindness from four countries in the Americas and from parts of Uganda and Sudan", how is this project different from those ones and what challenges do you anticipate with Nigeria? 
What would you do with the $100 million from the MacArthur Foundation that you are not already doing? 
1) What inspired this idea of yours? Why Nigeria?    2) Did you apply for any other challenges?   3) What do you think your chances are of actually winning?  
Why community volunteers rather than paid employees? 
Do you really think this can be accomplished in 5 years? 
Hi. Given that you have experience in eradication programme (Guinea Worm, OEPA) and Uganda, how do you plan to implement this when you get the funding?  
Will $100 million be sufficient to implement the programme? If not, how will TCC fund the gap? 
What do you think makes this project stand out against the other semi-finalists? 
Has TCC successfully assisted with the elimination of the transmission of river blindness in other countries?  
What are the risks associated with implementation? What could go wrong? 
Hi! I'm a big fan of the Carter Center and the work that you all do! What led you to your current position and program? What is the most unexpected or exciting you've learned or discovered while working with river blindness? 
how will you assess areas that where previously classified as not requiring treatment? 
Hi Dr. Richards. Your work in the Americas and with river blindness around the world is very impressive.   What are the program differences between "elimination" and "control"? Is one easier than the other?   Thanks for doing this! I'm a big fan of TCC 
What books did you read to get where you are now knowledge-wise?  
You said that its good with hardware, have you put it onto a mobile device to see how she performs? Make Stephanie completely mobile using one of the python applications.   Sorry if this is already answered, that was one hell of a wall of text.  
Would you be worried about "Stephanie" going back in time to the 80'same and killing John Connor's mother? 
First and foremost, great job on your project. What do you need to learn in order to build something like this? I'm currently at the stage where the basics of python is already familiar and have used a bit of numpy and pandas for data analysis. 
So what's next in store for you?   What do you do right now except for making projects?  I went through some of the documentation, but I didn't see anything about automation? Was that intentional? Or are you going to put something in it later?  Why not college? 
I have wanted a privacy focused concierge that is completely loyal to me, ever since I lost track of technology. What should I need to accomplish this?    
This is really amazing. Good job mate, I'll definetly look into it (both source code and the APIs). I'm a self-taught as well, even though I didn't really read any book yet (but did read lots of interesting stuff around the internet), now working as a python programmer. How did you come up with the idea of open sourcing it? I think a simple yet powerful open source assistant is really something amazing to work on as an open source project and I will try to read and understand the code in my free time. Also, if I may ask, how old are you? You look pretty young from the pictures (maybe you already stated it somewhere but I didn't notice) 
As a self taught, how you managed to get a programming job? I started this year to learn programming (live in Brazil, programming in Python) and I decided I really want work with this but I don't want and can't go to university so...my question is more regarding to python and self taught aspect of 'getting a programming job'. 
Before MOOCs, what kind of education did you have? How did you break into MOOCs? I can't seem to have the discipline to finish a coursera or edx course! How can I accomplish this? 
Awesome!  What language do you think is the best to learn as a beginner?  I used to code Visual Basic 6 , over 10 years ago as a teenager, and I  have a hard time grasping the thought of programming with 'no interface', IE buttons and such that actually 'create a program' that you can launch from your desktop?  I want to code a simple search engine for amazon -  that allows me to search amazon from my own interface; do you think this is best done in python? 
Do you spend an inordinate amount of time explaining to people that UFOs are not necessarily space ships from planet x and that they are actually, in fact unidentified flying objects?  
What is the strangest thing you discovered in your research?  
What would you most like to tell us that no one has asked about yet?  
Has anyone told you that you look like Steven Spielberg? 
Is there one incident in particular that you can point to that justifies your belief in something "very real" going on?   Also, what's your favorite piece of baseball equipment?  
Thanks for doing this AMA. Most people think UFOs actually are identifiable and belong to the US government. What is something about UFOs that most of us would be shocked to find out? 
Hi Mark,  I must admit I haven't read your book though this is a topic that has interested me quite a bit after witnessing UFO's in the past. I remember Dr. Hynek from various documentaries I've seen where he publicly denounced UFO's in his interviews as a front man and skeptic for the military, was there a pivotal moment or particular case that changed his beliefs?  You mentioned that you have come to share his beliefs that the phenomenon represents 'a new aspect of reality', do you mean simply by the existence of extraterrestrial life, or that it underlies another dimension of our reality itself?   Thanks and best of luck with your AMA! 
How did your perspective on UFOs change (or not) during the time you spent researching the book?  
Who is your favorite sister-in-law?  (Just kidding)  Where could I learn more about how another dimension or vibration may be the explanation of unidentified flying objects?   
Which Tracy brother from the hit show Thunderbirds do you think would be most helpful in the event of an alien invasion?  
What is your favorite depiction of aliens in movies/TV/books?  
Have you personally ever seen a UFO? Or do you know anyone personally who has? 
What's your favorite story about Hynek that didn't make it into the book?  
How does your experiences and knowledge conflict with or confirm your spiritual beliefs and what kind of affect has it had on your thoughts on death specifically? 
Is there anyone presently in the UFO related field who you feel is doing particularly excellent scientific work? 
If we can get a person on Mars, how do you think we'll do it? 
I think it is fair to say that UFO research as a field has a credibility problem in many people's minds. Is there something you feel people should or shouldn't be doing to attract the right/avoid the wrong kind of attention? 
Are there certain parts of the world that have either a greater number or more believable reports of UFO sightings than others?  
Hi Mark, thanks for taking the time to do this ama. I will definitely check out Close Encounters Man. Sounds awesome! Thanks again. Onto the questions:   1. What would you say has been the most hair raising thing you or Dr. Hynek found out while researching UFOs or reports?    2. Do you believe in the Men in Black stories or think they're just made up to add fuel to the whole UFO / aliens phenomenon? 
Where did you get that thing on your shoulder?  If I remember correctly, it's from an episode of Twilight Zone (though it may have been Outer Limits).  That scared the bejeezus out of me as a kid. 
Have you been inspired while writing this book to do some UFO hunting yourself?? 
Hi, thanks for this AMA, do you think UFOs can be us humans from the far future? 
Hello Sir, what's your favourite film genre ?  Favourite movie/director? 
Aren't alien abductions actually black op mind control experiments? 
I'm very surprised to see this book here -- one of my favorites -- thanks for doing it!  I really enjoyed the book's depictions of interactions with law enforcement. Where did the inspiration for Sheriff Mason McKinley come from? Was he a composite character, or really someone from past experiences? 
What would you say is the biggest myth perpetuated by those who advocate against marijuana legalization?  What would you say is the biggest myth perpetuated by those who are for marijuana legalization? 
What are the conditions you most often prescribe for in PA?  
What are your thought about long term effects on intelligence. And has cannabis measureable short term effects on intelligence during the consumption? In short: Do people really get stupider when you are high? 
I'm a sarcoidosis patient with muscle/joint pain and some reduced lung capacity. Are there medical marijuana treatment options that may be suitable? 
I am dealing with an auto-immune related inflammatory condition and have been through so many different medications and treatments, with not much success or relief from my constant pain.  I have been waiting for the medical marijuana law to be passed in PA and now that it has am now waiting for it to be implemented.  How do I start the process for applying for medical marijuana or finding a doctor that is willing to try it as a treatment?  Is your practice in PA anywhere near York?  I have also been debating changing doctors as well and don't know if that might bring in new eyes to my conditions and maybe new treatments.  Do you think it is wise to stay with my current doctor (6 years now) or is there benefit in doctor shopping when dealing with a chronic illness that has no cure? 
How long do you think it will be before marijuana is legalized all over the US? I suffer from chronic pain in a state where marijuana isn't legal, which sucks.  
What are the hardest challenges you face working with something as "Controversial" as Marijuana, do you ever find people who think less of you (either in general or as a doctor) because you have chosen to work with pot? 
I have a mild form of epilepsy that mostly causes me to experience panic attacks in fear that I will have a seizure more so than actually having seizures.   In your opinion would medicinal cannabis help combat this panic during flare ups or would it worsen the situation with potential episodes of paranoia on top of the panic attacks? 
What is the greatest benefit of using marijuana shown by research and do you have links to any of this research? Curious to read more about studies that have shown benefits. 
Illinois resident checking in! Thinking about going to get my license soon, if it's possible. I have been on and off dozens of anxiety and depression medications for the last five years. All of which either only worked for a short time or had horrendous side effects. Because I don't want to rely on highly addictive anxiety drugs the rest of my life (in my 20's) I would really want to try some tinctures or edibles. I do not want to get high or smoke, I just want some relief. Do you think medical marijuana could help me? And if so, what strain/method of consumption would be best for me?  
Live in Maryland, which is attempting to set up a medical marijuana market.  What has and hasn't worked for the PA and DE programs? 
Is smoking marijuana as healthy as other methods like pill or edible form? 
Have you ever heard of Retnitis Pigmentosa (RP)?  It's a retinal disorder that causes night blindness and eventually legal blindness in a small percentage of the population.   I'm asking because I've seen 'studies' done that say marijuana can improve night vision and wanted to hear your thoughts on it. Even something that seems insignificantly small to you could be the difference between me feeling comfortable to leave my apartment at night or not.  Thanks for your time and keep up the great work!! 
What are your thoughts on using marijuana recreationally for someone with a mental illness? I have bipolar disorder and usually whenever I ask I get mixed messages. Some people say go for it, others are very against it. Thank you!!! 
Do you believe that a national legalization of recreational marijuana will offer more benefits than consequences? Some potential negatives is that it might seem like the government is telling everyone that doing drugs is okay and that it might encourage the legalization of harder drugs (i.e., how do we know when we're crossing a line, is there a line?). Some positives that come to mind is that it could bring about an entire industry out of the 'black market,' so to speak, and lead to the creation of potentially thousands (maybe millions?) of jobs -- and as a result, more tax revenue for the government? Furthermore, if you don't mind me asking, how do you weigh the 'potential' pros and cons as an individual vs. being a physician? Is it even possible to separate the two now? :P Thanks :) 
Dr. Roman, why do you think the more conservative areas of the USA like the southeast, Midwest, mid-south, southwest and great plains states have governors and state legislators that are so opposite to medical marijuana laws for their own state? 
Dr. Roman, what do you think of the situation in California where doctors will give a prescription for almost any ailment and condition? 
Dr. Roman, related to the science of the brain why are psychologists and mental therapist opposed to their patients using marijuana? 
Dr. Roman, what are the positive or negative affects of Marijuana with the conditions of Tinnitus and Visual Snow? How are hearing and visual problems affected in a negative or positive way? 
Dr. Roman, have you made any efforts to lobby to change the federal laws about marijuana? 
the biggest misconception about using marijuana as a potential treatment?  
I once saw a program where someone with Tourette and many ticks got medicinal marijuana. He was so calm after that but still functioned well.                           So my question: if you would use medicinal marijuna long enough, would it reduce the symptoms when you lower the dose over time to 0?                                  (Sorry for my bad English)                
Could medical marijuana have side effects such anxiety and paranoia in someone who experiences this smoking it?    
What do you do if people are looking for a medical card, and seem to have nothing wrong with them? Is it awkward telling them they're not qualified to receive a card? 
Somewhere in the 90's there was a chicken disease in Belgium, my country, and millions of chickens had to be slaughtered. It ended up as a faits divers in international newspapers. A Chinese family friend's wife, in China, stopped buying chickens for months. Even though there was no chicken export from Belgium to China. Plus, the Belgians just slaughtered them all. No export anywhere.  Anecdotal as fuck, I know, but many Chinese are so irrational and superstitious, especially the ones buying things like rhino horn,  that I feel that's your best entry to alter their behavior. Spread rumors of horn or ivory contaminated with radioactive material to aid in tracking them by satellite but causing leukemia.. stuff like that.. What do you think? 
What was the hardest part of being undercover?  When undercover were you ever found out? 
Probably a stupid question, but what was it like working at interpol and how did it compare to working as an undercover cop? 
why do governments destroy shipments of seized ivory? Wouldn't it be better to sell it, and reinvest the earnings into prevention? 
What does the day-to-day of your job consist of? Are you trying to stop the people hunting the rhinos or more catching the people selling them far after they're dead, or all in between? 
Have you been in many/any life threatening situations? What's the scariest one you can remember? 
Does trophy hunting help fund elephant conservation? 
Eve of UK election - thoughts on dropping banning of ivory trade from particular manifestos?  
 If you found a lamp, would you rub it and kind of hope it was a magic one?     If a genie popped out and granted you three wishes, what would they be?      If the magic part was that after vigorously rubbing the lamp instead of a genie popping out, the lamp would reach orgasm, would you be happy that you had found a magic lamp or disappointed that you had gotten a lamp off, and presumably were now covered in lamp cum?   
i have like a friend who is like wanted by interpols how can he avoid getting busted? and what do you think of the situation in venezuela? 
Will we get any benefit from interpol after Brexit?  
Have you ever ran out of toilet paper, but only realised after you pinched one off? If so, what was your next move? 
Are you in fact a living Pez Dispenser or Jimmy Neutron all growed up?  
Hi Jordan!  Love your work on The Daily Show  What's a typical day working on the Daily Show like for you?  When they're shooting an episode that you're not in, are you still there lurking around backstage, or do you just get to stay home and watch Netflix that day or what? 
Why did you settle on guns for the topic of your special? Personal experience, outside influence, the fact that it's so hot right now? 
Hello Jordan, I like your work on The Daily Show :)  My questions are:  1.  What was the most dangerous experience you and the crew had while shooting (pun intended) the special? 2.  Do you think Apple making its gun emoji into a water gun emoji will help solve guns? 
Unrelated to guns, do you have a favorite Daily Show piece you've done so far?  
Why didn't you reach out to popular gun rights personalities such as Dana Loesch, Colion Noir, John Lott, etc. about common ground?  
Hi Jordan, really been enjoying your work on the Daily Show, and my question is what is your favorite on location shoot that you've done for the show? 
Is it true that the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is to have a good guy with a gun shoot him? 
Is there a difference between our gun crisis and our violence crisis? It seems that shootings may be the result of an underlying problem. In Europe, murderers are weaponizing motor vehicles by driving into crowds. Is there really an underlying cultural, economic crisis?  
" I even try to convince my own cousin to give up his shotguns"  If this isn't an anti-gun special, why did you do this? 
I'm 19, I've been depressed since I was 6, have C-PTSD and can hardly function. I also have no friends, no family, no interests, no skills, nothing. Is there hope?

what is the worst case you've ever seen?  also for something a bit more personal, what are some study tips for someone with adhd? 
Hi there! 18 y/o starting college in the fall here! Do you have any tips on prioritizing mental health in college and/or not getting completely overwhelmed by the demands of school? 
Im really struggling with self worth. I just sort of don't like myself. On good days I'm ok with myself. Just ok. On bad days I absolutely despise every aspect of myself, physical and mental. I want to be confident and love myself and feel good enough but I have no idea how. No one around me is making me feel this way, it's just me. I have friends but sometimes I just feel like an imposter. Why would they want to hang out with me, you know? And my entire sense of humor has slowly just become self deprecating jokes and that's how I cope. It's not healthy at all. In my brain, I understand I can't be THAT bad, but something inside just makes me deny all logic. I just feel stuck. I don't even know how I feel to be honest. Any advice? Big or small, I just need something.  
I have a weird theory/idea that hospitals and huge doctors offices/clinics should have a therapist on site for people to deal with diagnosis like cancer or things with no cure or a probability of a low cure rate, what do you think of this ? 
What are some great things about residing and working in Washington (state)? 
As someone who works with teens, what is your opinion of 13 reasons why? Would you say that the controversy surrounding it is merited, or an overreaction? Do you think that it could cause a problem with youth who watch it?  
Not sure if you've read or watched 13 Reasons Why, but if you have, what are your thoughts on it? Have some of your clients brought it up with you during your appts? 
What is the most difficult adult case you've ever dealt with? 
Do comfort/emotional support animals actually have a high success rate of working to help?   What percentage of people in the USA actually scam the system and don't need a support animal but have the paper work just to have their animal in public places? 
Fellow therapist here who specializes in emergency psychiatry work. How often do you work with a psychiatrist/psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner? 
In the book 'miskakes were made but Not by me' the authors state that a lot of rapes discovered in therapy that happend in childhood actually never happend at all, but were planted in the memory of the patience by therapists when they asked again and again about childhood memories. What are your thoughts about that?

Can you tell us anything about what working with Kate McKinnon is like? 
I have seen the movie 3 times already, thanks to screenings. I love it! You should be proud. My Second Question: You have to have known there would be a minor backlash with the idea of "killing a stripper" (I saw no problem with the comedy esp. in the movie where he wasn't even a stripper*spoiler) Every topic is so sensitive these days, why did you go that direction on your first big blockbuster type movie knowing there would be that kind of a social risk factor? 
Was wondering/hoping if there might be any cameos from the cast of *Very Bad Things* in your film??    I LOVED *VBT* back in the late 90s and really enjoyed the trailers for *Rough Night*.  Super excited to see your work.  The concept is teeming with opportunities for dark humor.  Just wishing/hoping/dreaming there might be a cameo!! 
I just watched Broad City last night for the first time - legit me and my best friend, to a T. How was it going from directing this fantastically relatable show, to what looks to be a hilarious departure from reality in ROUGH NIGHT? 
Hi Lucia - love broad city! what was it like to work with Scarlett Johansson in a comedic role??  
What kind of role does Bo Burnham have in this new movie? 
What was the casting process like for this film? Did you have these girls in your mind when you wrote the character or did you write the characters and do minor changes to what was written to fit the girls. 
Was there anything about directing a feature that really surprised you?  
Any tips on being breaking in to the director game? Did it help to start in the writers room? 
Any opening day plans? Super excited to see the women kill it onscreen.  
Sorry Aussies and Kiwis but... Kate McKinnon's character seems to be one of them based on the trailers.   Was the character written that way or did she add that touch? 
 If you found a lamp, would you rub it and kind of hope it was a magic one?     If a genie popped out and granted you three wishes, what would they be?

Rough Night looks hilarious! Do you have a favorite scene in the movie??

I like reposts.  It's sometimes fun to see a raccoon lose his cotton candy or a kangaroo get punched by an Aussie or a comic of a dog finding out he's a good boy.  
This has gone from 21000 upvotes, to 17000, now it's at 11000 
So this wins right? This gif just won Reddit. All of it.  
I'll never be able to see what it is because it never loads for me. 
This post was well over 10000 upvotes and now it's 5000, so who are the children that downvote? Honestly I'm surprised people defend themselves as being reposters this way  
Hey PP, so how does it feel to have the number 1 post on Reddit ever? You should do an AMA. 
Why does every comment have fucking at least 20 upvotes??? 
I was here. And I will be the last one the ever comment on this post! 
The president we needed. Now time for the one we deserve. 
Here I am, at 26 years of age.   I can safely say this will be the president I go-to when asked, "Who would you have run our country again?" for the rest of my life. 
Canadian here,   I'm not even a US citizen nor do i live in the States but, even I feel like I'm losing a great president after tonight.   Thanks, Obama.  Good luck to everyone after tonight. 
This man right here, agree or disagree, knew how to speak to the American people. He could talk about a carton of milk and it would be the most interesting speech about a carton of milk thats ever been said. 
I actually am gonna miss Obama regardless of what he may have done right or wrong. He was one of the most fun presidents I can think of. Maybe being an internet era president helped. 
I never really had much of a horse in either race, though I didn't like Romney at all and any chance McCain had of getting my vote evaporated when they put a lunatic like Palin on his ticket.  I like Obama as a person, though.  I've really enjoyed having a President that genuinely seems to enjoy science and technology and nerdy pursuits, and we've had some really amazing photographs come out of the White House when he's around kids.  Has he said anything about what he plans on doing after he leaves office? 
As someone who didn't vote for Obama, and never thought I'd be saying this, I'd totally re-elect him right now if I could. I don't agree with a lot of his politics but there's no denying that he's been an incredibly "presidential" president. He's on his game every time he comes into the public eye. The past 8 years we've seen him angry, we've seen him sad, and we've seen him goofing off with kids, but no matter what he always looks like a president. That's far more than I can say for the two morons we're being stuck with now. 
Republican here.  I never voted for Obama but applaud him for two things: sensible foreign policy and (as politicians go) being honest.  Thank God he kept us out of Syria and other unnecessary wars.  I disagree with virtually all of his domestic policies but he promoted them in good faith and what he thought was in the country's best interests.  He spent eight years in the White House and despite the best effort of his political enemies, he was never impugned with any serious political controversy.  The most significant taint of dishonesty during his administration was from Hillary Clinton-- which shows you how terrible a candidate she is and how much of a decent man he was.  I didn't agree with him, but respect him. 
In under two hours, this has been one of the most upvoted posts I have seen in my few years on Reddit. "Hindsight is 20/20" as they say. 
No worries, he'll be back in the White House in 12 years.    MICHELLE 2028!!! 
Mr. President,   You'll never read this but as a Soldier in the U.S. Army, I'd like to thank you very much for the past 8 years. You are the epitome of a strong and diplomatic leader that this country deserves. I firmly believe that you did your best despite the hatred and oppression you faced from a shockingly large number of Americans. Among other things, You pushed to remove troops out of a war we had erroneously entered and you believed everyone deserves health care which is very considerate and commendable.   Thank you, Sir.  
If you remember in 2008 republicans said Obama will institute Sharia Law in the US and take away all the guns from people. Still waiting.  
If you look for yourself (and stop listening to politicians and the media), this country is a better place to live than it was 8 years ago.   Virtually every standard of living that assesses a first world country is higher in the US now than it was at the end of Bush's second term.   He wasn't perfect but God knows he's better than these two twats.  
Thanks for creating the ACA. When I was unemployed it took me 5 minutes to enroll. My first meeting with my very awesome Doctor I was diagnosed with depression and prescribed sertraline. My prescription cost me $0 a bottle and has been the best thing I have ever done for myself...there's even an argument to be made that it helped keep me from taking my own life.   Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  
Everyone who completely shitted on Obama these last 8 years is gonna talk about him with such nostalgia in a decade I guarantee you 
My brother's cancer didn't kill him, thanks to Obamacare and the clause that prevents insurance companies from giving him insurance. He is alive thanks to Obamacare, and every time I hear a Republican say he wants to overturn Obamacare, I hear "I want to kill your brother." 
You know, as a conservative libertarian I swore I'd hate Obama. (No guys I'm not a racist so chill out) 8 years later that's changed a ton. I don't love him, I disagree with some of his choices, but I would call his election a win. I would in a heartbeat take 1 more year of him while we figure out some new election choices. But unfortunately that's a no go. I will however hate Hillary until my dying breath ;)  Also trump is still a POS 
I admit he did not do much for me. My life did not change at all. But the one thing that will change, is that on Dec 1st, my company has to start paying me overtime. I have to work overtime, it is part of the job and a lot of it. I am going to go from 37K to 45K and I should be getting a good raise this year. It was not horrible under Obama.  
It's fantastic that many airlines teach flight attendants to look for the signs of human trafficking. I hope she got rewarded for her quick thinking. 
Good for her. I can only hope that if I'm ever in a situation like this I'll be aware enough to see the signs and act.  
You know what I wouldn't want if I'd saved someone from traffickers? My name and photo all over the internet.  
It's odd to me that I can't find any article online regarding the underlying arrest and/or trial of the man allegedly arrested for trafficking the girl from this story. 
I wonder how she got the note written and in the bathroom before the girl walked in?  
THIS is amazing.   This is what I wish we, as human beings, should focus on. Stop spending money trying to defeat drugs, and use that money to go after human traffickers.   In my opinion, this should be our #1 focus, and where MOST of our money is spent.  God bless this woman. 
Innocent Question, sorry for my ignorace:  Why doesn't the victim go for help in the first place? She's in a public area and can yell or ask for help at any time. Why do most victims of human trafficking stay silent? 
She was 14-15, and is in college now, meaning this happened 3-4 years ago. 
I wonder if he was just stupid or does this happen often given he took a fucking plane.   And by this I mean human trafficking in the broad open.  
Wheres the rest of the story? Did the man go to jail? Was he a US citizen, where were they going? How was the girl abducted? Where was she abducted from? So little details.. the article headline had as much info as the actual article did.  Reddit is becoming the next Facebook. This shit was all over my Facebook this morning and SOMEONE HAS to post it here to get karma. Typical internet shit. 
That may be the single most superhero-style-in-real-life thing I've ever seen.  
That wasn't just a dad reflex. That was a ninja grandmaster dad reflex.  1.Assessment of the threat  2.Choice of action and precise chain of acts  3.Grabbing children  4.Backflip out of dangerous area 
I want to know how this ended. Was everyone okay? It does look close enough for some injuries.  
that fraction-of-a-second though that told him "go for it" rather than "run" 
pretty sweet double suplex he pulled off on those kids, just in the nick of time too 
I wonder what caused him to get up and look back. Probably prior commotion from the car hitting other stuff. Regardless, that was some amazing quick thinking and reflex. 
Give that man something nice. Total life saver and probably not the kids' father. 
I swear it's like all dads are average joes then there kids are in danger and fucking Clark Kent is exposed  
I think the little one got knocked out, but that's a fair trade for what was about to happen.  
Everyone is talking how they can't stop watching but this makes me so fucking angry at that driver 
Did you see the 2 seconds of oh crap?  It's that little 2 step thing.  I think he had to fight real hard against that flight reflex.  Good thing he fully committed to his actions after that.  Any slower and he and kids would have been smashed. 
Whoever runs next time has a hell of a slogan:  Hindsight is 20/20. 
Let's not forget that having a first past the post voting system gave us this mess.  Fuck the DNC and the RNC but also fuck the system that keeps them in power. 
Bernie practically had all the independents, but the DNC just had to have its golden girl as the candidate.   And now all the advances we made on the liberal platform went to hell. 
I said 8 years ago when Obama was running against Hillary in the primaries that if the Dems make Hillary the nominee, republicans could literally nominate a plank of wood and it would best her.   This is the result of the massive hatred republicans have for Clinton.   This is their fault for letting her take this from Bernie sanders.  
I still remember people shitting on Bernie while he was still in, saying Hill was obviously the better option. WHERE YOU AT NOW YOU FUCKS.  
Conservative here. My sympathies. We differ in beliefs but he seemed like a genuine candidate.  
My overall opinion of Bernie aside, I 100% think it would have been a different game with him in there.  It's a shame how the media and the DNC treated him. 
Good job Shillary. Good job Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Good job rigging the election you fucks. Any other candidate would have been the easiest win in the history of America, but you forced a candidate down our throats.  
Good job, DNC. You played yourselves and fucked us all. You enormous pieces of shit. 
Those fucking idiots at the DNC who rigged it is the reason Hillary lost. They chose the weaker candidate, and they deserve to lose because of their corruption and shitty choices.  Fuck the DNC. Idiots. 
This is what happens when you rig your primary.  DNC is full of a bunch of fucking idiots. They even had the media push for Trump during the primary as a "pied piper" candidate so Clinton could win easier.  Look how that turned out. Fuck them. The blame should be on their shoulders. 
If Hillary loses, she has to go down as the worst Presidential candidate ever, simply because she lost to an absolute trainwreck in Trump. 
Exactly fucking this. I remember early on during the primaries how god damn stuck up the Hillary4President crowd were, talking shit and saying how they didn't want "BernieBros" to vote for their candidate.   There you fucking had it DNC. Stealing the primary ~ rigging it against Bernie, having superdelegates commit before any debating happened, having NewYorks need to register 6 months before debates started to vote in the primary..   Donna Brazil colluding with clinton. Their camp should have told Donna to get fucked and said "We are too proud to try and steal this."   Taking Wasserman Schultz onto the clinton camp. FUCK YOU.   God i'm so angry right now I'm not even speaking straight. Smug clinton assholes have fucked the people for months and now they are about to reap the damn consequences, and we are all going to suffer because of it.  
From someone who was inspired by Bernie enough to donate and volunteer for a Presidential candidate for the first time in life:   Fuck you, DNC. Fuck you, DWS. You have no one to blame but your primary-rigging selves.  
Hillary wanted to win so badly she bet the entire country on it.  Bernie was the best shot we had but her greed was greater than her interest in the American people. 
As a Bernie supporter, the only satisfaction I get from Trump winning is the despair of Hillary, the DNC, and Debbie wasserman Schultz. You fucking stupid cunts, this is all your fault. 
The DNC shot themselves in the foot when they didn't put up Bernie Sanders like the American people wanted. Sander's would have won by a land slide against Trump. The fools at the DNC wanted Clinton and got her and lost bad for it. If they ever try this again, they will likely create a new third party over it. 
I love how the DNC rigged the primary against Bernie to put a weaker candidate in place which then shoots the party in its own fucking foot this is infuriating   I cannot believe this 
I feel like Bernie was the only one of the candidates that actually cared about the people and the country. 
Michigan and Wisconsin ...looks like they're going to be the deciding races. States Bernie won in the primary. Demi's have no one to blame but their corrupt establishment for rigging the primaries.  
The Republicans went with a candidate who-- for better or worse-- represented the values of their base.  The Democrats sabotaged their base's candidate and offered a robot in his stead.   
The finger has to be squarely pointed at the DNC if Trump wins. 
On the bright side, the Clinton dynasty is completely and utterly done.    I voted bernie in the primary, and hillary in the general. so this is all not my fault! 
But now we lose Bernie a second time, this time as a budget affairs head guy... 
This happens if you rig everything in favor of the UNELECTABLE candidate. 
This is 100% on the DNC. They fucked over the Bernie campaign and hired thugs to harass their supporters online (C T R), and they expect those same people to come out and vote for Hillary? 
I'll probably be sorry and delete this post in the morning since I'm drunk but, what exactly did the DNC expect? This is what happens when both candidates are equally as bad as each other but only one party screwed over their own voters. I had no horse in this race. My horse was shot at the gate and I got to vote independent in a relatively safe democratic state. I had no idea, due to the CRT shills around here, that so many people felt the exact same way I did, only, apparently, they had the privilege to live in swing/red states, as far as the results say so far.  To the DNC I can only say this: get fucked! You reap what you sowed. Any Canadian brothers out there, looking to help out an american "wife," hit me up on craigslist on wednesday, lol. 
Bernie vs Ted would have been a much more meaningful race. 
Bernie was the first real politician in a long time who wore his heart on his sleeve.  You could tell he loved his country so much, that he knew he had to be honest about what he believed in, and which direction he would have steered the US had he been elected as president.  On the flip side, Hillary won the primary, and was a clay candidate who would shape herself, and say, anything she needed to win.  Leaders are honest about their own convictions, and they stand up for their own beliefs, even when it's against the grain.  Here's to Bernie 2020. 
Yup. Sanders would have walked all over Trump. It's too soon to call it but Trump has a pretty serious lead right now and this is the fault of the neo-liberal DLC shitbags that have taken over the DNC. 
Yep. Really, Michigan and Wisconsin cost $hillary the election.  I voted for her (in the general only), but her rap sheet of corruption is 100 pages long.  Bernie's (non bullshit) stance on TPP would have easily won him Michigan and Wisconsin.  Hillary more electable? Eat your words, Hillary primary voters. Like I said back then ... a vote for Hillary in the primaries was a vote for President Trump. Fuck sake. Now you realize ... 
The main German news programme (Tagesschau) just described it as "the biggest set of data journalists have ever laid hands on".  (Given that a German newspaper received the documents first and did most of the groundwork (which OP has just linked to), I guess it was published at 8pm CEST to coincide with the main Tagesschau broadcast of the day.) 
Great to see a real score for investigative journalism here. There's life in the old dog yet in this click-bait world. 
Biggest leak in the history of data journalism, according to Snowden. And it's about corruption.   This is great news.   
The real trick is getting people to care en masse so something can actually be done to fix it.  
This *could* be one of the biggest and most important leaks of all time.  Maybe finally people will wake up and realise that the entire world economic system is completely corrupted. 
I think it's incredibly telling, that none of the major American news outlets (CNN, NBC or Politico) have anything about this on their websites. I would at least expect some small article mentioning what's happening, but there is literally nothing at all! 
This is incredible - there is potentially enough data there to keep even the most skilled forensic data experts busy for years. Who knows what will tumble out.  That said, I hate to be cynical, but can't see how this will ever fully be investigated or reported by newspapers owned by many of the wealthy conglomerates likely to be exposed here. 
So.... are you guys going to go riot or what?  I need to go to bed early tonight, but I'll stay up if you're going to get all smashy-smashy. 
This is the most terrifying thing I have read in a long time.  Whilst I dont think much of the bildeberg or the illuminati conspiracies, that all these influential individuals use one firm, to hide their wealth, do corrupt deals, and influence the world in such a large way, makes me wonder how many other firms just like this there are who have not had documents leaked. The world is truly screwed  
It's always somewhat disappointing when information like this comes out. Not because I feel bad for the companies, but a lot of folks often feel there's some sort of global corruption ring, explicit or implicit, tied up in international finance and such. And the disappointment comes from when that is absolutely correct - that such corporations defy our brighter visions and ideals in their pursuit of financial gain. Hopefully there's some significant fallout from this. 
A quick look - this is all over BBC, The Guardian, Le Monde, The Irish Times websites. Front, huge font.    It is nowhere on NYTimes, CNN, Fox, MSNBC, CNN, USAtoday, LA Times.  It is astonishing how pacified the US is. Just astounding. It's not because the citizens are dumb and uneducated. They've just been trained not to care. Unreal. It's like an alternate universe. 
Is there a way to keep a story on the front page for a while longer than normal for world affecting instances such as this?  Like a sticky post for a week? 
I have a feeling that All the news in America will do some in depth reports on Kim Kardashian the day this is released. 
I wonder if any incredibly wealthy prospective US Presidential candidates might be implicated in this...  Just when the campaign was getting a bit quiet. 
I admit I thought the water situation in Flint had already been taken care of due to the lack of news coverage and Reddit posts. 
It's kinda hard to forget about when you live here.  
So serious question....what can we do about this? Its my understanding that the piping for water is so fucked and it would cost so much that it would be cheaper to get up and move the entire town. Like honestly besides trucking in bottled water (which I really hope they do that at least), what can we do? I feel horrible for these people.    Im not trolling I am looking for an actual response, anyone out there understand this enough to give me a break down?    
I really can't imagine what these people are going through.  Imagine working your whole life to buy a home to raise a family.  Now, the water is tainted and the property value must be essentially zero. Nobody is buying houses in Flint. These people have no way out and every day the value of houses they have to keep paying for is going down and down.  
I can't believe it's actually been almost 3 years!  
Crazy that GallowBoob gets 88k karma and double gold for a reposted image of someone holding a sign... A fucking sign.  
Idk, maybe, just maybe people should start focusing on their local governments and elected officials instead of the president. 
In America you would think that doesn't exist. Most third world countries go through that daily.  
Instead of "don't forget" posts to remind people, why not include why there is no water. Whose fault is it that this hasn't been fixed yet?   Obviously the city is still inhabited and functioning, but for some reason someone just hasn't green lighted the "fix it" operation.   Lets bring that person back into the light!!! That is surely more productive than "it still sucks for people".  
If a city in a first world country can't even provide clean water for its citizens after 3 years, they are no longer worthy to be a city in a first world country. Everything in the town should be dissolved, and the city/state should be providing the residents with fair compensation for their moving expenses.  Put a nail in the coffin, and ensure that those who are responsible for this happening and not being fixed are held accountable for those actions. Money can't fix everything, and they have spent entirely to much trying to solve this problem without success. 
It's 2017 and Flint still isn't the most affected American town with lead in their water. Flint is just well known.  
Should've made it a blonde white girl, then Fox News would be all over it. 
*Rio 2016!  Come for the Olympics, stay for the hospitals!* 
I swear that Russia got caught doping on purpose so they didn't have to send their athletes to Rio. 
Op if that is truly you;would it be alright if I put this on a shirt for myself? Probably not even going to do it and definitely not going to try and sell it...way too lazy. 
I am so excited/worried to watch what a disaster these Olympics will become. 
Brazilliant logo.  I bet it goes ***VIRAL***. *** *** ^^The ^^number ^^3.14... ^^in ^^mathematics ^^is ^^a ^^PI-O-HAZARD.  ^^Use ^^tau. 
Does anyone else think that the summer Olympics should simply always be done in Greece? It would make historical sense, it's a nice country, and they could really use the tourism.  The winter Olympics should probably always be done in the Swiss Alps. 
I feel bad for the parasailing teams. I read that 3 teaspoons of the water they're going to compete in is enough to get a virus. The thing is, they use their mouthes to bite down rope that'll be wet when their hands are full. There's no way they won't get sick. Same thing for those that have to swim in that water. 
Negative comments regarding a country usually get rebutted on Reddit.  Could it be the Brazil/Rio is really that awful? 
Before this post had like 12 000 upvotes but nowit only has 8500. What happened? 
...and guess what? The games went fine, one of the best opening ceremonies in a while and everyone enjoyed themselves. Biggest controversy was a group of American athletes acting like morons and lying to try and get out of it.  Guess the Brazil-hate circlejerk was pretty unwarranted after all. 
This post has been RAPIDLY downvoted in the last few hours. Only a few hours ago it had reached over 15k, now down to 8300ish. Can't help thinking that this isnt deliberate. Olympic committee doing some pr work maybe?  
Finally, Leo is free of having to choose interesting, challenging roles.  He can pull a reverse McConaughey, and spend the rest of his career making B-grade action flicks and shitty rom-coms. 
Maybe the quickest rising self post I've ever seen 
Wanted him to just stand up and say "About fucking time" and walk off 
Guys, serious for a minute. Is anyone seeing Leo only talking on his left side? 
"Climate change is real. It is happening right now."  Leo finally gets an Oscar, and what does he do? Use it to preach a serious cause.  Good on him.

How many butt cracks can we expect to see on the front page in 2016? 
My sister is getting marred today and this post is bigger news  
I bet if we moved the camera to behind you, we'd see a butt crack. 
HMU on Instagram: @biblicalfigure also I'll be playing the midnight at Saturday prerelease at Hobby Central in Delaware, OH if anyone wants to come thru and get whooped. Or whoop me. It could go either way but in any case y'all are my dawgs. 
I don't partake in MTG but I would like to know if your original post has made an impression. Have belts become more of an essential part of the game?  
Great work on making Snapchat's facial filters relevant again!

In less than half a day, this post has over half the karma of Barack Obama's AMA, the most upvoted post on Reddit of all time. Congratu-fucking-lations, OP. 
"Tell me, master. Do you follow the Light Side or the Dark Side?"    "I am ... ***undecided.***"  
Ken what do you intend to do after the election? Use your fame for good or evil, or try to lay low?  
I like how you're still wearing your iconic red sweater. 
When i clicked the link, I had my hand on my dick, when I saw who it was, I kept it there. 
i feel like i'm witnessing history being made. in 50 years i will proudly tell my grandchildren about the time i upvoted ObiWan Kenboni 
Hi Ken Bone. I think you are a cool guy. My coworker named Chase thinks you are really cool too. Can you say "hi Chase, I'm Ken Bone and I think you are a nice fellow."  It'll surely make his day that you said hi, he thinks of you as a hero. Plus, nobody loves Chase, not even Jesus. The little guy could use a confidence boost.   You are simply adorable.  
Would you mind if I voted for you on election day? 
At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if someone already dressed up as Ken Bone as ObiWan Kenboni.. 
Ken. If we could petition you to be an Admin would you accept? 
You have reached a reddit elite status.  Any time you pop up it's like pure magic 
Wait is this the real Ken Bone?    Why is your username Stan Gibson?     Am I in the bone zone right now?  
GEE KEN SURE IS A BOLD MOVE POSTING WITHOUT A THROWAWAY MAYBE TOMORROW WE CAN RUN A STORY ABOUT HOW SECRETLY BAD OF A JEDI OBI-WAN KENBONI IS   just kidding man. random dude here who doesn't comment much just taking the opportunity to tell you you're a cool ass guy. a lot of people hope to be as respectable of a guy as you are someday. 
If there was an award for best redditor of the year, it would go to you good sir  
Why do you prefer the zip up sweater to the crew neck? Winter is quickly approaching and I need to buy clothing ASAP.  
I bet it sucks having to wear a red polo every day now.  
I often look in the mirror and imagine myself wearing someone else's underwear, usually a celebrity or famous public figure. Historical or present day. I try to imagine what they would wear. What type of person they are. Would they wear Cotton, Acrylic, bamboo, latex, microfiber, Nylon, polyester, silk, spandex. I wonder the colors, red, blue, torquoise, tortoise, white. Boxer, brief, boxer-briefs, thong, commando? I dive into the persona of the person and strut around my bathroom, pretending to live their underwear life for a brief moment. Today,  I'm going to choose you Mr. Bone. I'm going to imagine myself in the underwear you would wear. I'm thinking something red, 60% polyester, 40% cotton. You're a simple man. Briefs. It feels good. You feel good. I like this one.  
Hey ken, I was at a frisbee tournament this weekend and there was an entire team of people dressed as you at the party. It was amazing 
The real question is how many nudes did this get you 
Aww yeah! Nothing gets a girl goin like an artificial sled simulation... 
I forgot about this game  Boutta go waste my life again 
This is all I did in typing/keyboarding class in 8th grade. Monday, do all assignments for two weeks. Normally done in a half hour. Then, two weeks of Line Rider.  
I miss the old simpler days of line rider, when I didn't do all of my line riding through my nose. 
As a permanent CEO? Or are you guys temping it again? 
Friday afternoon, eh? Someone took a PR class in college! 
How did you find your job as CEO? I can't find anywhere to apply for as a CEO on indeed.com 
1) Is there any chance Victoria will be returning?    2) What is happening with that 50 million dollars that was supposed to go back into the community?  3)  Do you feel that the influx of monetary influence has caused some of these, how shall we say, growing pains?    4)  Are you concerned about the sudden talk of alternatives to reddit, ie voat.co?    5) Are you concerned about history repeating itself like digg.com?  6) What lessons did you learn from digg and how will you make different choices to avoid a mass exodus?  7) What's your favorite cat related content you've seen this week?   
It sounds like Pao served her role as the interim CEO perfectly. People were supposed to hate her so she could make changes the board of directors wanted that they knew some users would hate. Then the white knight new CEO sweeps in to save the day and everyone is happy. They also promise to continuo Pao's mission to make this a safe place so that should be fun. 
Hey Steve, it's Dacvak. We briefly met a long time ago when I first got hired. Please let me know if you have any positions open for Community Manager, as I would love to return once I'm healthy enough to do so. :) 
I'm so excited to have Steve back with us. He helped build this platform that has been such a huge part of my life for the better part of a decade . . . I can't think of anyone better for the next decade 
Wasn't the default sub blackout due to mod's years of frustration with reddit admins? Like years before Pao joined on board? Or are we just gonna pretend that Pao didn't get a lot of misdirected hatred from the blackout  
I have no strong feelings about this one way or another.  
Finally a mature decision.  Still, I have suspicions that it was all just a big plan to shift all the hate on Ellen Pao for making decisions which were coming "from the top".

What breed is that? I've recently adopted a stray that looks similar 
It's cute, but if that became a habit fuck would it be annoying. 
Do you remember the last time a fired Reddit employee did an AMA? I highly suggest she take all this online goodwill and get a high paying, lucrative PR job.  
Her doing an ama would unleash more popcorn than when the last employee got fired  
Holy shit that was fast. I totally support this request. Maybe she can get help from Victoria :) 
I doubt that she will. I'll bet that when she signed her contract to work for reddit she signed a non-disclosure agreement or something of that nature which prohibits her from discussing her firing.  
She almost certainly has a confidentiality agreement 
What the fuck?! I leave for 3 hours and this has dropped from 10k votes to 5k?  Uhm... something's fishy, here. 
Holy shit...14532 and 97% upvoted  Never thought I'd see that unless Snowden and Assange announced they were getting married.  
I just want her to do an AMA so we can salute her   o7 
Now do one for the creator of secret santa too. It's not just Victoria. Reddit wants to gut the heart of the company apparently. Apparently having a popular site isn't enough for them, and so they want the real fans that helped build the site, get stepped on until they fall in line.  
Guys, can we please stop buying Reddit Gold for a day. I feel like that'll make more of statement than the blackout bullshit. That money goes to support Reddit's higher ups.  
Why the hell would she want to come back to add publicity to the site she got fired from? And why would we want to demean her by asking her to do that? 
If you are very interested in seeing this happen, consider posting in /r/IAmARequests and offering Reddit Gold for contacting this person and arranging the AMA!

1. Why are you so awesome? 2. Will you be my friend? 3. Considering all you have done to help the reddit (AMA), community, how would you like to see the sub evolve, grow, or change (or not)? 4. Coke or Pepsi? 
My nephew was three and got a pair of these shoes.  We had to take them away from him.  He would walk with his head down so he could see his shoes lighting up and was constantly hitting his head and falling over.  At first it was pretty funny, but then it started to be a problem. 
People who say that they'll never be as happy as when they were kids, this is the video that proves you wrong.  
Light up shoes really haven't been given the appreciation they deserve... until now 
I can just see him walking around town with a big ol' grin on his face not giving a fuck about anything because he's wearing his light-up shoes.  
I need to start saying "get outta town!" when I'm excited about something 
Someway somehow mostly all of the old people turn into a child when they get old enough.   We start it that way, and we end it that way, that's the beauty of life.

 Hey /u/JinMT,   This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts. 
Still no Swastika on Google search... We all got Karma whored. 
That slow stand up is killing me.   'It... It can't be. Is it really you?!' 
Yea, my dog bites the everliving shit out of his favorite toy. 
I love how the initial reaction is like "no fucking way" 
You can notice the exact second the dog is trying to comprehend what the fuck is going on 
The look of awe on that dogs face though. Like meeting a cherished celebrity  
That's cute. My dog would destroy that stuffed toy in about 30 seconds. I don't buy destroyable toys for him anymore.  
When the zeppelin goes, sometimes it's like everyone stops shooting and looks up. Because if you don't, it's gonna land on you.   Yes, it is.  Every fucking time. 
I hope in the full video he waits till the guy runs all the way to the end and jumps towards a passing plane to save him........  Then snipes him in mid air  
"Come over."  "My Zeppelin is exploding."  "My parents aren't home."  
r/gifsthatendtoosoon  ..but really, that was epic! 
Honestly if this were to occur in WWI by some possibility and I was the sniper id let that OG live to tell the tale how he surfed on a burning zeppelin.  
"oh crap oh crap oh crap OH CRAP running running running RUNNING!" 
"Get off the roof, get off the roof, get off the roof!" 
how did people think battle zeppelins were a good idea? THEYRE LITERALLY FLOATING BOMBS. 
Tell us how you feel when you accomplish these things. Sincerely interested.  
Congrats, bro!  I've been a C5 quad for five years and got to spend some time in the Ekso. Great feeling!  Where do you rehab at? 
Wow that is so awesome. How exactly does it help/let you walk? 
Have you always been quadriplegic? If not, how did this experience compare to walking unassisted?  
Can you please scream the following?  IIIIIIIIIIII aaaaammmmmmm IIIIIIIrrrrrrOONNNNNNNNNN MmmAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNN!!!!! 
Dude! Can you walk on walls and jump 10 meters high like COD ? [Btw you look great, keep up the good work :)](/spoiler) 
Ok this is going to sound like a dumb question... but I am going to ask anyway. Does being a quadriplegic mean you can't consciously control your muscles? Like would your leg move / twitch away if you brought something hot in contact with it? or is everything just numb?  Hope you are doing well 
Not to be a dick but you could be Darth Vader some day. Happy for you man. 
As a man with a recent spinal cord injury and who has just been discharged from hospital after 5 months..this is fucking awesome! Well done!  
Man, just a couple hundred years ago, I doubt you would have been given a second thought. I'm glad I'm alive now  Best of luck to you 
Can you feel stuff like stomach aches and your heart beating and more importantly, can you teach the exoskeleton to give you some dope-ass dance moves? 
Hi! Congratulation on your amazing achievement, which exoskeleton is that one? i have a wife in a wheelchair, and this looks amazing! she has been very depressed because she was really active and after the accident she can't do anything like before, so it's very frustrating for her. 
How long have you been paralyzed? How long after you were diagnosed for you begin this specific training? And what are your goals for long term?   Congratulations!!! also 
That's pretty rad man. This is something that would make for a cool ama. 
Does your dick still function? If yes, can you feel it or does it work in an almost mockingly sort of way? Hope this is okay to ask 
I wonder how many letters he's sent out during his presidency.  
*Ol Mary Todd's callin, so I guess it must be time for bed.* 
That's something to show your grand-kids.  "Look at what the last President of the USA wrote to me, immediately before the Empire was created!" 
I do not agree with a lot of his policies, but God damn is this man a class act. So much respect. 
European here so i guess my opinion doesn't matter, but i'll never understand the pure hatred so many people feel for Obama.  It seems like every single president ends up being disliked by the majority of people. Lose-lose. 
My husband got a letter last year! He got elected mayor of our small town. There...were many people on council that didn't want him to win. He had a very tough 1st month.   I was watching a documentary about the Pres writing letters, so I wrote a letter for him, figuring could use some encouragement. He got a letter back and was very excited. 
If you want a free pass on this, invite the sitting president to your wedding. Traditionally you're supposed to, and the president is supposed to respond. We tried it and it worked. Got a signed letter of well wishes from BO himself.  
Cool letter. Not cool that Donald Trump has suggested the possibility of opening all federal lands mentioned in the letter for drilling/fracking. Relevant timing. 
Now, can you imagine Trump reading 10 letters a day and writing a reply like that?  Me neither. 
Such a shame you fuckers replaced this learned man with someone's who bragged about grabbing women by the pussy and communicates through twitter and meme's.  
cherish that shit.  cherish that man.  WHY AMERICA.  WHY DID WE HAVE TO GO FROM COOLEST CAT IN THE GALAXY TO BIGGEST BLOW HARD CAR SALESMAN EVER!!! :'( 
Sometimes I feel like people recording stuff with their phones tend to think that they're watching a video and not actually filming it... 
Those people really underestimated how much flying ice was about to hit their faces.  
Why the heck was it *not* throwing snow until it was halfway down the platform? Did they clean half the track beforehand and just say fuckit? 
As a German, I'm very irritated by the seeming lack of personnel in charge of keeping the tracks free of ice. It's so unsafe! 
How most people will die in the future... watching their impending doom through the camera lens of their fuckin' phone. 
Crowd-sourced cinema.  Looks like at least 4 people getting that shot from all angles. 
Did no one put two and two together and figure out what's going to happen when a train comes? Jesus seems obvious to me 
Fun part is if you tell the police. They'll have a plain clothes officer scout the ATM and wait for whoever put it there to come back and get it. Karma's a bitch. 
I work in a bank in Chicago and you'll be surprised how often one of these skimming devices are added to our ATMs!! It's really shocking! Always wiggle the thing that you insert your card in and try not to use the atm on Sunday's. They usually install them Saturday after work so they know no one is checking them and remove them Monday early morning when we check them!  
What would you say is the proper amount of wiggle one should give an ATM?  
I protect myself from credit card fraud by ensuring I always have a negative balance! Works every time! 
That green thing on the ATM was made to protect from skimmers. Looks like not only it fails to do it, but seed false confidence in people that ATM is protected from skimmers. Great that OP don't fall for it. 
I legitimately thought this was a joke till I found one in my neighborhood. I would have never known as well if not for Reddit lol.  
i was waiting in line in customer service at are grocery store and a girl was talking to another employee and said "oh we have to check the ATM now, it's been an hour.  come over here and i'll show you how".  she then started showing her how to wiggle all the parts and make sure they are all legit ATM parts.  comforting that they check and every hour. 
With all the scummy people hidden in the corners of Reddit, you know there is at least one guy who makes a living installing these and he is getting really upset that people are becoming more aware of his scam..... 
I'm so paranoid about this myself, any time i've come up to an ATM now i try to tear it apart to see if any part is fake lol. 
Don't call the cops, cut the battery cable and wait for the thrives to come and check it out. Then break their legs.  
There's an atm at the building where i work that is covered in those new electronic tamper evident tags along all the cracks where the card reader is. If a single one gets ripped off without the scanner thingy, it triggers a failsafe and shuts down the ATM. The building admins get an email and a snapshot from the ATM's camera from the security firm that installs them. It's nifty as hell. So far nothing has triggered it but im honestly wishing someone would try just to see some sweet justice unfold. 
I used to do this all the time, until one day i broke a legitimate ATM card reader and nearly got charged with vandalism until the police officer tested out how hard it is to break on the machine next to the one i used, and off popped a card skimmer that was placed on the ATM next to mine.  
Wow!! That's crafty!! Wonder how many used it before you did, without noticing? 
I did found one once at a 7 eleven right by the cashier. He told me I broke it soon as I did it.  "Why are you breaking my card reader"  'Thats a skimmer, watch your original card reader will still read my card just fine'  "Yeah but its broken now thats not supposed to come off"  'Look at the card reader does it look like anything is not there'  "Yeah but that piece was apart of it"  This is about the time I facepalmed (not for real tho, just internally). Told him to go call the cops or get his manager and if I truly broke it I would pay for it. 
Okay from now on I'm gonna shake anything with a slot. 
and that's why the chip was added to the CC.  It's makes skimming harder as it needs to sit in the ATM to work. 
Great now I'm going to be paranoid for the rest of my life. 
Make sure you report that to the bank so they can do an audit of who used their cards in that ATM and take precautionary steps. 
This kinda shit really pisses me off. WTF is wrong with these people that they think it's OK to steal other people's money? I just don't get it. 
OK so here's an idea. ATM manufacturers could start making a card reader slot surface thing that would have a few motorized pins on them. Every so often these pins would pop out of the surface to remove or detect and obstruction. 
The fact that these things even exist makes me truly hate humanity. We can't have anything good without some evil scheming asshole ruining it for everybody. 
Wow!  My skimmer made it onto reddit!  Hey OP, can I get that back? 
How is the data retrieved from this?  Can it be done wirelessly?  The circuit doesn't look complex enough for something like that.  It seems like it would be ballsy as hell to go back and retrieve this so you could wire it up to access the RAM. 
For folks who have found a skimmer, what do you do with it afterwards?  Throw it away?  Give to the business where the ATM is?  Give to authorities/police directly?   Are these more commonly found on stand alone ATMs or ATMs within businesses?    
Wow, yours is so much better made. You should fist bump your sound guy, because your voice was super crisp and clear.   Better acted, better sound, more concise, and that whole mask thing was dumb as fuck. Well done! Sorry you got ripped off, but at least you know that you can outshine a much larger channel through straight up better film making. 
This site won't load for me, as I assume all the clicks from here has killed it. Can you post the two separate youtube links? 
Yours was so much better too. Lot more care and better acted. Hope this thread blows up for you. They didn't just take a piece here or there, it was shot by shot ripped off. 
Wow.. I remember seeing the original a ways back.. This is such a shameless ripoff and they didn't even try to get it right.. The acting stinks, the pacing is all off. The shots are timed poorly. And what the fuck is up with the finger guns from the guy dropping off the envelope?   And on top of it it's a political piece? WHAT THE FUCK! 
They literally took your video and made it worse..  But yeah, h3h3 on Twitter or something. 
I remember watching yours a bit ago. I thought it was black mirror at first. Also, yours is way better. Fuck that girl and her boobs.  
The best part about the clone?  **I hope you guys like my stuff**  That bitch 
Hit up H3H3, they like to help out people, especially since this would be an interesting controversy to handle, hope you get what you need good luck 
Hi OP, your video is much better.  I clicked into yours/the original and was expecting something boring (because I'm a negative Nancy). Instead I ended up sending it to a few buddies because I got a kick out of it.  The other video is clumsy, awkward, and had I come across it organically I honestly wouldn't have gotten through the whole thing. I didn't get through it now, either.  Hope you find some modicum of justice. Keep doing what you're doing. 
I like that she took 25,000 to a billion lol. Kind misses the point of the desperate state the person would be in. Not sure what you can do except highlight it and maybe demand a link in her description. Keep making videos you care about. People suck.  
HOLY SHIT. I just went to the shit copied version and the comments LOL. Reddit is going to end her. 
Try messaging Phillip DeFranco, he is always one to stick up for the smaller YouTubers. 
plot twist: op made both and increased views for both 
Everyone check out her IMDB page under trademarks.  
Dana Boente is now acting Attorney General, hes an Obama appointee but apparently he'll defend the ban. 
Probably a good thing House of Cards doesn't start until May. If it aired tomorrow it'll probably suck compared to real life.  
Being politically ignorant, I had to look up 'US Attorney General' on wikipedia to find out what it means. The article currently says:  "The office is currently held by Groper-in-chief stooge Dana Boente, who cowardly assumed the office after the Groper fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates for courageously refusing to enforce or defend the Groper's unconstitutional, racist Muslim ban"  That can't be right, can it?  I also noticed that Dana J. Boente hyperlink leads to the wikipedia article for 'anus', and Jeff Sessions redirects to the fictional Marvel character 'Red Skull'. It's all beyond me, but I thought people may be interested. 
As someone who doesn't know what the attorney general does, is this bad? 
Very smart politics by sally Yates. Now she is a hero to the left, has 30 years experience and will be running for Congress or the Senate in 2 years mark my words. 
It seems like the entirety of his presidency, length yet undetermined, will be conducted with the same level of insanity as the last week of Nixon's tenure. 
That whole volunteer Mars Mission where you'd have to leave Earth and never be able to return is actually looking pretty awesome right now. 
She's been fired for upholding the law in defiance of the leader. Classic authoritarian move. 
Her being fired isn't the takeaway here; her position was temporary and her dismissal inevitable. What should scare the crap out of everyone regardless of your political views is that we're barely 10 days into someone's presidency and we're getting official press releases that sound like a supervillain from 1950s Superman comics is delivering them.  
So I take it that anyone who disagrees with him gets the boot? People who don't fall in line are immediately dismissed and promptly fired...    That should scare the shit out of everyone. Republican, Democrat, doesn't matter. A president should be willing to listen to all of his advisors regardless of what side they are on... He's acting like a true business man and surrounding himself with yes men. 
I have this theory that Trump will be a kind of societal vaccination - all the trappings of a dictator without any of the competence or discipline to be good at it.  USA gets fired up, liberals and conservatives come together, sing Kumbayah, and good reigns in the end.    Or we're screwed... 
Absolutely incredible! This is National Geographic photo of the day material. 
I'm just gonna borrow this for my clickbait site... for real if this is your shot you should have watermarked it, someones gonna steal it. 
This shot is absolutely incredible. It almost doesn't even look real. 
Oh, shit! Zapdos!!! Guys it's Zapdos!!!  ...  *CP 17* 
1920x1080 version? Beautiful shot, would love to have it as wallpaper. 
Jersey City also got to experience this storm. My basement has some water as evidence.  Great shot, though! It really was pouring and roaring out for a while. 
Saw this from Brooklyn, myself.  The storm was...intense, frightening, unconcerned by human worries.  And it was thankfully quick. 
This is an insane shot -- but it's definitely at least a long exposure. Check out the boats in the marina -- you can see movement in the masts. My guess is that this is a few separate strikes that occured over a short period of time, vs one huge one.  
I'm not doubting you OP but my brain keeps thinking photoshop. I think it has to do with thinking that lightning doesn't spread out strikes like that cause it looks miles apart, but when I think about it doesn't make sense since Lightning probably traveled miles vertically down just to strike. 
How does one setup a camera to catch a shot like this? 
Pretty sure it's fake. Just googled "lightning strike river" and all pictures had a bright reflection of the lightning strike. Especially when it's this dark. 
This is totally fake. There is no reflected light from the lightning anywhere. Not the clouds, the water, the buildings. Lightning isn't that thin either, regardless of focal length. The lightning in the background is in focus when it shouldn't be. Even with a long exposure, and reducing your whites, lights, highlight, exposure, or whatever, that sky would still be glowing and the water would reflect it. Also, there is a shelf cloud there. Lightning like this generally strikes in the center of the storm, behind that shelf cloud and near the core. 
Yeah unfortunately the lack of fill light and reflections are telling me it's photoshopped....among other things  
What was the process in order to actually ask the candidates your question? Did you sign a form, request using email yada yada yada. 
Hey Ken,  Can't wait to be you for Halloween.   You're obviously really passionate about serving the homeless community. Is there any background as to why that is your charity of choice? 
What has been the strangest thing someone tweeted at you in the wake of the debate? 
Is the best part of this whole ordeal the karma from this post? 
How did you get selected to be in the debate audience? 
Are you looking forward to your impersonation on SNL? 
I love how you're using this moment for good. What does the St.Patrick center do for the homeless and why is this issue out of many the most important to you? 
What will you be going as for Halloween? I hear the sexy Ken Bone will be popular 
As a coal worker, how do you think environmental protection and energy production should be balanced? 
Ken, you seem like a happy person who has their life together. Any life advice for a young adult? 
How do you feel about becoming famous overnight? Also, have any companies approached you to endorse their products? 
What's the weirdest reaction from friends and family that you've had so far? 
Hey Ken, who are some of your favorite musicians?  
Hi Ken, big fan and just ordered your shirt.   How does it feel to be the leading presidential candidate around my apartment? 
Ken,  If you were president, what steps would your energy policy take to meet our energy needs while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job layoffs? 
What did Bill Clinton say to you after the debate? 
Ken, both your Twitter & Reddit handles end in the number 18...    Does the number 18 hold any personal significance to you? 
How soon after the debate did you realize you were a meme? How did you find out?  
Hey Ken! Huge fan :) Would you consider wearing a cardigan for your next public outing? 
Have you ever said "We ken bone" when your wife asks what you wanna do tonight? 
Would you say that you are leaning to vote one way or the other?  
Hi Ken, are you going take Snoop Dogg up on his generous offer to hotbox the bone zone? 
Hey Ken!  Have you reached a decision yet on whether or not dating 8 year olds would satisfy your innermost desires? 
What does it feel like to all of a suddenly become an internet sensation. What does it tell you about today's society and our means of communication? 
Mr. Bone, do you feel both Hillary and/or trump answered your question adequately or were you dissatisfied in regards to energy? Thank you for doing this.  
Who told you it was a good idea to use your real reddit username? 
Would you be disappointed if I wrote your name in on the ballot come Election Day? 
Have you ever though about making a gofundme or kickstarter to replace your olive suit? 
What's the weirdest thing that has happened to you this week? 
Hi Ken. Long time fan here. Do you have plans to run as an Independent in the next Presidential election? 
KBone !! When you coming thru tha doggy den 4 a little chit chat ?? I got something special at tha crib for u !  
Bone Dawg! I'm a struggling, drained medical student. Can you give me your best pep talk?  
Hey Ken! I'm a huge fan and fellow Missourian. I'm so happy that you asked legitimate questions about the environment and brought a lot more happiness to the debate. You're a national treasure and I legitimately want to bake a cake for you and your wife. My question is: how did you meet her? Thanks for making the world a little bit nicer! :) 
You seem like a nice guy, but I've heard speculation that you are bad to the Bone? Thoughts? 
Some people have said they want to write you in for president. If this were to actually happen, what would President Bone's first action be? 
The minute I saw you with the mic, I thought, "the internet is going to go nuts over this guy."  How's fame treating you so far?  Also, what kind of cat do you have?  
Did the little shits that called you Boner in school think they were clever? 
Ken what is the best time to wear a striped sweater? 
Hey Ken, what's your favorite NFL team? I'm undecided 
Did you happen to know you would be asking a question or how was it decided that you would have the opportunity?  Did you submit your question ahead of time?    Thanks again for bringing so much joy during this time that has been very annoying, difficult, etc.  You have handled it great and brought a lot of fun to the election 
How long have you had your mustache? Have you ever experimented with other facial hair-styles? 
What led to you asking about the environment? Is that your biggest concern with these candidates or did the topic just feel unaddressed? 
"We don't take kindly to discrimination 'round these parts..." 
As a Texan I would like everyone to know that this is NOT that rare here. Texas is a big place with loud, proud people. And of course there is hate, as in every place on Earth. But there is so much love, acceptance, and kindness here that no one ever sees.  This kind of thing makes me so proud to live here. We really do love Y'all!!  
Not gonna lie, was expecting something entirely different.  
Plot Twist: Man is actually standing in front of Westboro Baptist Church. 
After reading a half dozen comments on his beard, I had to scroll back and check. Santa confirmed.  As a middle-of-the-road American, who leans left on some issues, right on others, and even agree with the libertarians at times, this made me happy.   The biggest issue in the US today, from my point of view, is that no one's a moderate anymore. Everyone's a fanatic. The politicians are using the same tactics as any other radical group to marginalize, demoralize, divide and recruit. They breed hate-filled fanatics and applaud them for "expressing their views", no matter how violent and destructive that expression may be.  This man is the embodiment of what America wants to be, strives to be - should be. 
People who havent lived in Texas dont understand Texas, its highly diverse and extremely complicated. Been here for 30 yrs 
My family is of mainly west Texas caucasian stock, and when my company transferred me here (Austin) I was a bit concerned. I remember hearing some of the most racist, angry, zenophobic BS from them growing up, and when I brought my dark olive-skinned ex-wife to El Paso for a family gathering they were horrible to her.  However, central Texas is not what I expected when I arrived here a little over a year ago. This picture represents what I see throughout this part of Texas, and I'm grateful.   Prejudice is a thing best broken, and broken harshly. 
 I have lived in Dallas for two years, and honestly Texas is one of the most open-minded, freethinking places I have lived.  I am from Colorado, and honestly there is way more diversity and less rednecks here in Texas. It is not like the stereotypes at all. People don't give a fuck about gays, theres a ton of diversity. You see Muslims, Hindu, Buddhist, etc. Tons of people here smoke weed, etc.  Granted, it could just be in the cities that it is this way.  
Texas gets stereotyped as a bunch of rednecks and racists but I've never been to a place in the world (ok maybe canada) that is more accepting of people of all kinds. Texas is its own little utopia in a way. It isn't perfect but there aren't too many things to complain about around here. 
Great.  Now we need about 60 million more of him.  
Whatever you believe in is your choice.   At the end of the day you're just human living in a country that "hopefully" cares. 
Man holds a poster with feelgood text, Reddit squirts over that.   
The dog on the left looks like William H Macy in shameless. 
The dog on the left looks like it's seen some shit..... and probably ate it. 
I'm imagining that the cat hates the dog at the back and the dog at the back photobombed the photo just to piss the cat off. 
How is this actually achieved? Is the camera just on a timer or something? 
Trump looks the most in love with him. Ivanka, Kate, Emma, and background intern just wanna smash. 
That's Prime Minister Steal Yo Girl, thank you very much.  
I mean, Trudeau is a tall man with good hair, clean skin, a nice figure and a pretty face. Plus, he's the damn prime minister of one of the biggest countries in the world and speaks English and French.   So it's like, more than understandable.  
It's funny living in Alberta.  Everyone around the world loves Trudeau and yet everyone around me hates his guts.  We are truly the Texas of Canada. 
The Princess Kate one is the best, such a classic "ohmigod he's looking right at me" look.  He probably said something like "hello, I'm Justin" and she replied something awkward like "you too."  
So that's what it looks like when a girl wants to fuck your brains out.  I always wondered... 
Well he is handsome. But some pics make him look funny (looking at you Wikipedia, I had to google this guy, sorry Eastern European here)...  Either way I am looking at Ivanka and wondering how teh fok did she come up to be so pretty when her father is male version of Dolores Umbridge  
I laughed until I saw Emma Watson. BACK OFF TRUDEAU. 
I love how Prince William used to be considered boy-band-quality dreamy, and now he's a creepy, stereotypical caricature of English royalty. 
Are they attracted to his perfect face and body or is it the passion and political power?  Or maybe.... he has a sweet sweet voice I have yet to hear. 
I love the number of people referring to Trudeau as a "cuck" here. Just look at him, he obviously lays more pipe than TransCanada. 
Pretty sure I'm ovulating right now. Also, I'm a man. 
Most Canadians I know thought Justin was too young and inexperienced to be Prime Minister. I think he has been very professional, knowledgeable and articulated. He also seems well liked by most world leaders and the public in general. Kudos Mr. Trudeau. 
You mean the Eric Cartman in this photo looks like a lens flare.  
Gawd damnit!!  Meeeeeeeeem, reddit is making fun of me again. 
TIL the animation of Cartman is basically just two circles. 
It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation, this sort of penetration will increase the population of the younger generation. 
Going down to South Park, gonna have myself a time 
Eric foreman popped in my head at first and I was like "no it doesn't" 
It's four F's, I didn't know it was gonna come off like that. 
Reminds me of the sandals that some prostitutes would wear in Ancient Greece. Instead of (hopefully) unintentional swastikas, though, theirs would say "follow me," for people to see the tracks in the dust. It was a marketing thing.  Furthermore, Carthage must be destroyed. 
"Just walk through the puddle Jerry, you're wearing boots for Christ sake." 
Do you know why the Nazi uniform used boots?  Hilter hated the Shoes.  
Little kids have such strong grips. They're like orangutans. 
Was this from Michigan yesterday? Because it got crazy  
Aren't storm doors supposed to have a chain, or a hydraulic/pneumatic closer that would keep this from happening?

When my sister was little, like 3, her and my mom came out of the mall and there was a small tornado (dust devil, if you will) ripping through the parking lot. My mom SWEARS she held onto my sister as she was up in the air, over my mom's head, as the dust devil blew through. Then my sister landed safely on thd ground and they continued as if nothing happened.  
quadriplegic here. 31yrs in. 19yr old son. the old fashioned way. no doctors involved for the deed. yes, there was a blood test.   doc's said less than 10% of my sperm was active. i just kept busting nuts until i got me one.   congrats to you and yours. 
I worked in a rehab facility and had a patient for like 6 months. One day he comes rolling out of his room, looking for me, and when he found me he yelled "it works! It works!" No other explanation needed, just gave him a big high five. Congrats to the couple, what a great photo. 
Do paraplegics feel orgasms? Guess I'm going to google it.  
Girl here...and all I see is the girls hair! That is the most gorgeous hair I have ever seen. What does she do to it? And congrats to them! 
She said she loved him and that it was his baby.  But alas, it was a paralyze. 
That baby will never appreciate how difficult it is to find a parking space at Costco on the weekends. 
I really admire that guy and his fiancee. I'm afraid l'd be a real cynical asshole about being paralyzed. To see someone so happy and living their life like that boggles my mind in a positive way.  Kudos. 
Does he get a boner or was it artificial insemination? Honest question. Congrats.  
On one hand he won't be able to fully play and interact with his child like a normal dad can, but on the other hand who the fuck cares because they can skip all the lines at Disney World.  
I am an immigrant. My father was murdered in my home country in the late 70's.  My mother brought me to the U S., legally, as a child. I went on to serve in the U S. military for nearly three decades, which included tours in Iraq and Afghanistan (twice). During my time in the military I graduated from college with honors and also earned a masters degree.  I am now a civilian working professional with a good job, a family and paying a nice chunk in taxes. That's my story in a nutshell.  
People complaining that reddit is becoming too political seem to forget that the admins blacked out the entire site in protest of a specific bill being voted on in Congress. Making a post in opposition of a president's executive order is small potatoes compared to their political actions in the past. 
My parents are both Iranian. They fled Iran (one right at the revolution and one a few years after). My dad came to American and became a doctor. He met my mom who just finished her masters for a teaching degree, specifically for developmentally challenged children.   Now I exist.   If they were banned from this country that wouldn't be the case. My family comes from a Muslim background. That being said, they are very against the Iranian government because of its extremism. We are increasingly more fearful of the extremist rhetoric that is common place here. I am absolutely disgusted by the way Muslims in America are being treated. I know many Muslims, or agnostics from Muslim countries who are amazing people. Many are like my parents.   If it wasn't for America's love of freedom I wouldn't exist and we wouldn't have these great contributors who make America the best nation on Earth. I am very fearful of our current trajectory.  
I hope everyone has a wonderful day.  Posting this here so there's at least one positive comment in this thread. 
Thanks for sharing, Alexis.      My great grandfather was also a refugee from the Armenian genocide. He and his family found their way to America through Iran.      I'm proud to work for a company that will stand up for what is right. 
Too late. It's already been reposted. Yesterday and 2 days ago.  ;)   
Especially relevant this year.  That clown is creepy. 
This is awesome. Saw it last year and posted it on my Facebook. Had no idea where it originated. Link to more of your work? 
Makes me smile every damn time it comes around too. 
I've seen this comic before. Totally on point. Thanks a lot for the post, Jim. Nice to see the artist / writer getting the fake internet points this time around. 
Probably gonna get downvoted faster than I can think of a witty analogy, but I actually prefer the funsize snickers, the proportions are all off in the big ones and it just ends up a dissapointing carmelly mess you have to scrape out of the wrapper 
No no no, how could you take precious karma from Professional Redditors?    And they had the "So my girlfriend made this..." title ready and everything. 
See, if this was me, my phone would have been left in front-facing mode and I'd have a nice shot of myself experiencing crushing disappointment.  
Get a watermark on that friend before it winds up being used as a clickbait picture on Facebook telling your auntie that the the rapture is here. 
Wow, that is incredible! I'm an amateur photographer and I have some cool lightning shots but nothing that cool. Not even close lol. Congrats on capturing such an amazing picture! Keep it up. 
Whoa - someone actually delivering some quality OC?  Great pic - more more more!!! 
For anyone who's wondering, the reason this worked is because OP snapped the shutter at the exact same moment a big natural camera flash went off in the sky. Cameras (even shitty ones) can take great photos if there's lots of light 
Maybe but you definitely filtered & tweaked the shit out of that picture.  
As someone who takes a lot of "one in a million" lightning photographs, I'll bet that this is a screen shot of a frame of a video.  
I'm really envious right now. Such an amazing capture! I mean obviously just catching the Lightning without a tripod and a long exposure is a feat in itself. Then the composition and colors are freaking spot on awesome.  
Hey OP how did this happen? Just saw a pretty sky and decided to take a picture?  
I didn't know it was that easy to fire the Acting Attorney General. 
Calling the tweet: 6:45 am Jan. 31: Obama AG refused to enforce basic LAW and ORDER! She is FIRED! My AG Sessions needs a VOTE!!   
Trump has just canned acting AG SallyYates solely for her legal opinion.  This is something so serious that the last time it happened it took down Nixon. 
People are being fired for trying to uphold justice.   This is a giant red flag. 
At this point I'm fully expecting trump to tell us the story of Darth Plagueis the wise.  
Doing what is right is more important than doing what is demanded.  Thank you Sally for standing up to the bully. 
Did she die? Why am I seeing this? Is it a Trump thing? Did Trump do another thing? Jesus, I hope he didn't do another thing...  
A patriot. You are on the right side of History, now and forever. 
Is there not a single sub left without political posts? 
/r/pics is indistinguishable from /r/politics now. 
And this is how r/Pics died.  Seriously screw the posters trying to submit quality images of beautiful scenery, hand made artwork, cute animals or funny situations...lets just make this entire sub another circle jerk for r/politics to consume.   "There is no sanctuary." 
I hate Trump, but honestly I'm starting to get sick of this shit. This is literally just a completely unremarkable picture of the woman. Can you just post anything on /r/pics now as long as you can find a picture to tie it to. It's pure shitposting at this point. 
Jesus Christ. is this r/politics or pics? Im all for political posts in this sub that the pictures actually provide some cool backstory, this is just ETS level BS though.  
She was on the way out with a successor being vetted for confirmation.  She decided to defy an executive order knowing full well the consequence of her action.  Now she has added life to her political career.  I don't see what the big deal is.  If you think the EO was illegal, wiser men than you and I should debate that in the right venue, the court of law.  Can we ease up on the hyperbole for social media karma? 
 Bernstein and Dershowitz both said Trump was within his rights to can her. This isn't a Saturday Night Massacre.   She didn't even think the EO was unconstitutional, which raises even bigger ethical questions as to her actions.  
Why the fuck is r/pics now just political shit? This used to be a cool sub, now someone's headshot is making the front page.  
Do any of you acrually understand what is happening? There are 4 things in the Constitution specifically spelled out as the Presidents job.   First and for most is to secure and defend our borders. It's a 90 day travel ban, so that a better vetting process can be put in place. I'm not saying there weren't some missteps in enforcement but he is trying to do his job and he did say... if elected I will do this.   I don't understand the suprise or disgust. If the AG doesn't want to enforce the law then a new AG is appropriate. I didn't vote for him but he's here for the foreseeable future, let him show you were this is going....if you still don't like it then protest til your head caves in. But he is the first POTUS in recent memory who is serious about protecting our borders.  Let the down votes begin! 
Fuck off with all the stupid usa right and left leaning political bullshit. You guys are invading all the other subs like this. Who gives a flying fuck about some usa politician.   I'm fucken over it. 
How do I get all this fucking politics off of my personal Reddit page? Damn near every sub I'm subbed to from /r/MassEffect to now this sub is a political shitshow. Please /u/spez end this madness!  
You are not allowed to pick and choose what laws you follow. Religious still have to issue marriage licenses to gays and people passionate about migrants still have follow current travel freeze.  
Sally Yates: Hero, Patriot, and Faithful Citizen sworn to Preserve, Protect, and Defend the Constitution of The United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Well done, AG Sally Yates.  
You mean she did her job until she refused to do her job and got fired for it? 
She did the right thing by refusing to do something she disagreed with, but she should have resigned.  Either you do what the Boss says, or you quit.  She chose to refuse, and this is the result. 
58 seconds.  Thats how long it took me to figure out that THIS WAS BULLSHIT!! 
****Watches video****  ****Realizes that i've been rick rolled****  ****continues listening to the song**** 
The fact that creative ways to roll people are still being made is beautiful. I feel like this meme will never end.  
AHHHHHHHHHH, took me fucking 20 nevers to realize what you did there.  
"Huh, 3:33 seems kind of long if you actually speed the track up every time he says "never."  Was the original really that long?"  \***click***  "Man, I forgot how *weird* this song and music video were.  Oh, here we go, it's about to happen!"  \***chorus hits***  "Wait, how fast are they speeding this up?  It must be a really small amount.  REALLY small.  What the hell, this doesn't sound like it is changing at all!  What is going on here!?  Wait, the title on YouTube doesn't mention anything about it being sped up...  No... I didn't just... OP, you son of a bitch..."  ^ What went through my mind after not realizing what was happening for an embarrassingly long amount of time.   
Clicked link.  First "never" passes.  "It didn't sp-..."  Raucous laughter  Well played, OP. 
The Vevo watermark should hav ebeen a dead giveaway  
What the fuck I am so confused... Did I just got ricked rolled or not? 
"I have no fear of losing my life - if I have to save a koala or a crocodile or a kangaroo or a snake, mate, I will save it." *Steve Irwin.* 
His kids are growing up and following in his footsteps! What an amazing guy. 
The day he died was the day i realized my idols were just as human as me. Sad day it was. 
I remember my 11 year old self was so distraught after learning from the news of his passing... He was a hero animal lover that I admired much so. 
I remember how i reacted when i saw on the news that he died. I cried like a baby... I was 9  
Why he wasn't printed onto an Australian Banknote I have no clue. Fucking legendary cunt he was.  
One of my biggest regrets was not taking an internship at his zoo when I was 20 or so around 20 years ago.  But my grandma got cancer so it wasn't a difficult decision.  But I would pull the acceptance letter out once in a while for a long time, especially after he passed. 
Very few of us can say that we knew him personally but, I think the man's character made us feel like we did. IMHO that is a great compliment. 
There have been two celebrity deaths in the past 20 years that really upset me when they happened - his was one (Bowie was the other, but for different reasons obviously).   In this age of vapid celebrities, he wasn't that type. I think he was one of the few who actually deserved his celebrity, was a celebrity for the right reasons and did a lot of good in the world.   He taught people that animals that are venomous or generally thought of as being dangerous and of no benefit to society should be respected; not killed, saved or relocated when necessary and appreciated for their unique beauty and place in the world. I know it changed my thinking about how to handle such animals when in close proximity to humans.   It was so sad was for the world to lose someone who showed such positivity, love of his chosen field and of nature. I can only image how sad it must have been for his family.    
He taught me the difference between an alligator and a crocodile. RIP! 
This guy would have been the president of Australia by now.    Does Australia have presidents? 
Wow it's crazy how time passes by so quick it's been 11 years already. 
TIL Steve Irwin was only five years older than Kurt Cobain  
This man made the discovery channel. I miss when I could spend my winter break as a child learning about the world through his eyes. He shared nature in the way children do but as a grown man, which sounds simple but it is incredibly rare and powerful. I miss what he brought to television, nature and the world. Furthermore I am saddened by what the channels he made great have become... 
I had to be 9 when he passed and it was all over the news. Can anyone tell me about Mr Irwin? Sorry if I spelled his name wrong :/   I don't really know much about him tbh  
I saw his young son on TV yesterday and he is the spit of Steve he has the same manner and everything i think he will be just as popular as his Dad R.I.P 
As a New Zealander I was just happy we were included on the map. 
Genuinely thought this was r/news and the news stations have finally lost it 
Sigh, that's what my inner monologue said when I clicked on that link. Well played.  
It has been crazy the past few days. It seems like something fairly significant happens pretty much twice a day. Hard to process it all, it's like rapid fire newsfeed. 
What the...  This legitimately scared me. It's perfect. My first reflex was some kind of shooting or another terrorist attack. Fuck, man. 
This is pretty much my first thought when I see "Breaking News"  "What the fuck happened this time?" 
Happy to see something on the lighthearted side about politics. Been crazy the last week.  
April Fools day this year is gonna be so confusing.   "Wait.. That's a lie.. Right? Fuck. Trump is really ordering for more nukes to be produced??" 
I bet it's a really boring night in the alternate reality where hillary is president 
Basically, the same thing I think to myself every time I hear the atrocious words, "President Trump." 
Not trying to get too political on this sub, but doesn't this kinda feel like the plan? It's how Trump's campaign felt and it feels like they're going with the same strategy: Exhaust your opponents.   
Trump just fired everyone on the east coast and west coast and anyone in between who has a college degree or higher. 
I just read the book "Shockaholic" where she made some kind of "joke" about her death...  "But hey, at least we have the X-Box 360 Kinect Michael Jackson Experience to remember him by. And his music. Its not much compared to still having Michael. **What you'll have of me after I journey to that great Death Star in the sky is an extremely accomplished daughter, a few books, and a picture of a stern-looking girl wearing some kind of metal bikini lounging on a giant drooling squid, behind a newscaster informing you of the passing of Princess Leia after a long battle with her head.**" 
This was my favorite quote from the link:   "You know what's funny about death? I mean other than absolutely nothing at all? You'd think we could remember finding out we weren't immortal. Sometimes I see children sobbing airports and I think, "Aww. They've just been told. Carrie Fisher, Wishful Drinking" 
Carrie Fisher drowned in moonlight, strangled by her own bra 
She also said that Donald Trump will not be president in her lifetime. I guess she was right  
The poor first responders who had to find her like that... 
Are we all going to be watching star wars tonight? 
Well lads, are we going to fulfill a dead woman's wish or what? 
It's because George Lucas told her she can't wear a bra under her dress because she would expand in space due to weightlessness and her bra would Kill her. 
Mara Wilson reported this on Facebook. I had no idea this was Carrie Fisher's actual dying wish. 
For someone who doesn't speak english as first language, what does she meant by "drowned in moonlight "?  
Go AWAY, 2016. Go be 2016 someplace else.  I *really* thought she'd pull through. Also holy crap she was only 60 -- I'm only two decades younger. I thought she was MUCH older. 
Now this is a story all about how, my face looks fat from upside down, I like to take a minute just sit right there, I look like Uncle Phill when I fly through the air.  
Remake the series where a trust fund baby goes to West Philadelphia to evade insider trading accusations and to live with his Uncle Will.  The boy introduces everyone to the latest electronic gadgets, gives stock market tips, and shows them how to schmooze your way into higher society.    He has a streetwise cousin named C-Note who always turns his legitimate financial ventures into illegal schemes.  With his Wall Street charm and business acumen, he shows the family that love doesn't conquer all, but money buys everything. 
Fun trivia for the day= Uncle Phil played Shredder in the old TMNT cartoon. 
"I ain't no bungee expert or nothin, but I don't think he's suppose to be slamming on the ground like that " you'll get this is if you've seen fresh prince 
Time for a Fresh Prince reboot with Uncle Will...   Carlton and his wife have been kidnapped while on business in South America.  Their spoiled and troublesome teen is sent to live with her middle class Uncle Will in south Philly.  No more Benz's and Gucci purses for her....   coming soon to Netflix (naturally) 
That thousand yard stare...this pup has seen some shit. 
Did you send a photo to the company that makes the cozy? You dog could be a model, instead of a can.  
I know they get a bad rep but Chihuahuas are freaking awesome.   Imagine the sight of a 6'2 guy walking 2 tiny chihuahuas....even gangbangers stop and smile at them. 
Ha, great pic. That fits almost perfectly for him. What breed is he? 
If this was the first video seen by an alien civilization they'd have a really hard time making sense of our technology.  
Shutter speed? I didn't know video worked like that. Isn't it just the frame rate? 
Quick, somebody post this to a conspiracy theory website and title it something like "Secret Government Anti-Gravity Experiments Accidentally Revealed!"  Some rube(s) will buy it. 
What kind of camera was this taken with? It seems like it would be crazy hard to sync that up after but trivial to photoshop. 
Is nobody else bothered by the use of ` rather than ' in that possessive? 
If it's a video camera... wouldn't the frame rate be synced... not the shutter speed? 
Can someone with professional knowledge on this topic confirm this is what is actually happening?  Thanks! 
Terrible news. Love watching him on the big screen. Some of my favorite movies growing up had Robin in the them 
When I lived in SF as a  kid I would go to Robin Williams house on Halloween to trick or treat  and he would give out toothbrushes as a gag. I played in the same soccer league as his son also and ran into him a couple times in the Bay Area. He was such a nice guy. Lost a good one 
Literally the only post that has ever made my heart skip. This man will be missed dearly.  I tried to keep my composure, but I couldn't. He reminded me of my father, caring, silly, and warm. I can't believe he is gone.  
This kind of really sucks. He's in my all time favorite movie: Good Will Hunting  He definitely had talent. Will be missed. 
Holy crap I feel like this came out of nowhere.... 
Depression is a disease. He wasn't being selfish or a bad person. He was just sick. God bless this man. He made so much of my childhood. 
This is so sad I usually don't get bothered by celebrity deaths but this one just felt different I didn't feel like crying but I did feel sick to my stomach and just feeling like it can't possibly be true  Edit misspelled a word 
Could some Genie break Rule No. 2: bring people back from the dead. 
O CAPTAIN! my Captain! our fearful trip is done;  The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won;  The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,  While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring:  But O heart! heart! heart! O the bleeding drops of red,   Where on the deck my Captain lies,   Fallen cold and dead 
This one hurts.   EDIT #1: RIP Robin, one of the funniest, most gentle, genuinely likeable people I've ever known.   EDIT #2: Lots of good resources in this thread for people dealing with depression.  Please look at them. 
It is hard to remember that actors and singers and comedians and famous people are exactly that. People. They battle grief and depression and addiction and all of those things you and me have to deal with. The tragedy is not that we lost someone who was in good movies. The tragedy is that a human being has passed away. A talented human being with a family and friends and a career. We will miss you, Robin. Not your movies. You.

Holy shit  Was he sick at all? Or was this sudden?  
This is pretty cool, although I've worked with preschoolers for quite a long time and they are well aware of how they look different from each other. Not in a racist kind of way but they do compare skin tones and eye colors and who is short and who is tall, etc. They are smarter than we give them credit for. 
What are these scoundrels doing in class that requires such a maniacal scheme? Their disguises are just the start of some epic tomfoolery 
When I was in preschool, my mom asked me if I noticed anything ***different*** about my best friend. I said, "yes, she's VERY short."  I'm white - olive skinned, she was Korean. Our hair, skin and eyes were the same color and we were both set apart from the blond and redheaded girls.  To me the big difference was height. 
Yanno, apart from pigment they do actually look like brothers 
I don't understand the point of this? Is this suppose to mean something? 
Kids don't care about race. They just want to have friends and have fun. Only ignorant and irrational adults hate people because of the color of their skin or the birth place of their ancestors. 
Psychologist here!  Alright so in my field there used to be research going around that until puperty kids are just not very aware of their own appearance and that includes skin color. So the kid might just not be actively aware that he is white. If you'd ask him he could tell you of course, but it doesn't cross his mind spontaneously that his skin color is different. Sadly there has been no further research on this topic since research on race perception is frowned upon nowadays and the most recent paper I could find on that topic is from nineteen ninety eight when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table. 
This picture disgusts me. I can't believe they're allowed in the same school. Who in their right mind would even be seen next to one of them?  Of course, I'm talking about Steleers fans. 
Okay, so now that this is official, when can I watch Gay Divorce Court?  
And gays across the country who have been relying on "Hey, I'd love to get married, but it's not legal" woke up to a *really* awkward conversation.  
I've been using the whole "I won't get married until the gays can" excuse with my girlfriend.  Gentleman, it's been a privilege playing with you.  
My Facebook will never be the same after this week. I'm going to buy stock in popcorn and butter, y'all.  
I wonder how many gays ran to their partners like YEA WE CAN GET MARRIED NOW....  and their partner is like..... FUCK 
RIP pastor in texas who said he would light himself on fire when this day came.. 
My mom is pretty conservative and just asked if this was good or bad news.  Of course it's good news, mom. Other people are happy and it doesn't affect or hurt you in anyway. Literally free happiness. 
Hmm, that's odd. The Earth is still spinning. It doesn't make any sense. 
Shit.  First people start taking down the Confederate flag, then they uphold the Affordable Care Act, and now this.  Now I'm going to have to endure the most insane bitching and moaning from my crazy bigoted family when I go home for 4th of July.  Couldn't this have waited a few weeks?  Thanks Obama! 
I just started crying at work. My wife and I had to go to California to get married, but in our state we had no protections as a married couple. That ends today and I couldn't be happier about it. Time to go get my name changed, suck it Texas. 
Let's see... My son was born, Fallout 4 announced and releasing, gay marriage legalized.... 2015 will go down as the best year ever. 
Wait... is this it? It happened, we're done?  On to weed legalization  and alternate energy? 
I'm irrationally happy about this as a straight man.  
As a heterosexual man I am appalled. This ruling affects my life fundamentally.  Oh wait, it doesn't at all.  Congrats to all those who have waited decades for this ruling.  It's about damn time. 
Just in time for Pride weekend here in Minneapolis. Shit's gonna be extra rockin'.  
They didn't legalize it. They found that the Fourteenth Amendment didn't allow same-sex marriage bans or bans on their recognition.  It's a beautiful day. 
So... Gay marriage legalized, Obamacare taken care of... What is the republican platform going to be for the next election?  
Great!  Now, can we *finally* stop calling it same-sex marriage?  It's just marriage now. No distinction is to be had. It's just marriage. Please, do everyone affected by this (that is, all couples who can now legally marry) a **huge** favor and make a conscious effort to not use the term 'same-sex marriage'. 
Man, it is a tough week for conservatives... abstinence-only advocate Bristol Palin gets knocked up again out of wedlock, ACA wins in the supreme court, Confederate flags getting pulled down, and now this!  
Im just sitting here watching OPs karma rise by the second... 
Only someone miserable with their own shitty life would try and deny 2 other people from getting married 
First upholding the Affordable Care Act and now this? They are crushing it lately. 
I just moved out of Utah a few months ago for a few different reasons, the cultural environment being one of them. I am laughing my ass off at all the religious butthurt some people are going to have about this and crying with joy at the same time for LOVE FINALLY WON.   PRIDE weekend here in Minneapolis is going to be off the fucking wall. 
My dad bought a sports car and kept telling me about all the chicks he was banging. Hated that time period.  
This reminds me of the Malcom in the Middle Episode "Hal quits"  
Dad shoes- check  Dad belly -check Dad shorts-check  Can confirm your dad is a dad. 
That painting is A-Fucking-Mazing.  After my divorce all I did was bang a 20 year old Daytona stripper, goddamnit what am I doing with my life. 
Does he always paint in front of a guillotine? How emo of him 
That looks soooo amazing, I'd buy a print of it! I want it on my wall!!! 
So badass. My dad starts projects, goes on a drug binge and never finishes.  
Definitely thought that was a guillotine behind the painting... 
I think I was here last year on Reddit when the last one came out. I'll see ya next year, OP. 
Hilarity for Charity was started by Seth and his wife Lauren in 2012. HFC is a fund that benefits the alzheimers association. I was able to go to events for HFC the past four years, taking each iteration of this picture. Check out hilarityforcharity.org for more information on what HFC does and their events.  
*Checks OP's post history*   *Last post 1 year ago and about meeting Seth Rogen on an annual basis*   Alright, it checks out, great photo. 
*Ah-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh!* ~Seth Rogan, probably 
Could you explain how you come into contact with Seth Rogen on an annual basis?  
I can hear the laugh and the last picture's laugh and the the last and the last. 
For some reason you look like a cardboard cutout placed next to Seth Rogen. 
So, do you guys just call each other and arrange it at this point? 
As a former wild-land firefighter, the public is filled with fucking idiots and I am amazed by the fires started by people's sheer stupidity. 
"Wokey Bear"...  "Your honor, it's *completely* different." 
I've had many a sleepless night knowing that I am the only one out of several billion people that could prevent forest fires.  I even went as far as moving to the arctic circle to distance myself from forests as much as possible.  My family would write me periodically to inform me of forest fires in the states.  How is this possible?  I'm living on ice, eating seal, and fucking penguins.  There's no way I could have done that!  I killed myself last week to prevent forest fires once and for all.  It was a tremendous sacrifice, but one that needed to be made.  You're welcome, earth. 
Smokey the Bear is the mascot for the National Forest Service, not the NPS. They are separate entities. 
"When I was a kid, I remember seeing Smokey the Bear on TV saying, "Only you can prevent forest fires." So I'd sneak out of the house in the middle of the night with a bucket of water."  (Credit to comedian Steven Wright). 
Best way to eliminate forest fires is to cut down all the trees. 
"Only you can *postpone* forest fires."  Seriosuly, forest fires are natural.  Lots of trees have evolved fast burning foliage and thick bark to survive them.  Some tree seeds use heat to spread their seeds.  But if the undergrowth doesn't get burned out often enough, then it builds up, and then once there finally *is* a fire, it's too hot to survive because of all the kindling.  That bear has been tricking us.  He's got us gathering fuel for our own funeral pyre. 
I want to buy a shirt with this on it. Can anyone tell me where I can buy a shirt like this?  
They haven't been defunded though. I guess the circle jerk is strong though. 
A cut in budget is not de-funding. Typical hyperbole. 
Lol nope, the USFS budget has been going straight up for years.  
The marketing and advertising is really goofy.  I hear their commercial often on the radio in Indiana and the mid west where there is virtually no threat of forest fires.  Money better spent elsewhere.  
On a serious note... how often did they stop forest fires anyway?    Cause it feels like at least once a year some part of California's forestry burns to the ground.   
Smokey the Bear is a relic of an old and shitty understanding of nature. Forest fires are a natural part of the life cycle of a forest. Without them, you end up with a situation where there is a massive amount of basically tinder that should have burned up in small fires years ago. Instead, after humans spend decades preventing forest fires, eventually a lightning bolt hits and we are left with wildfires that are gigantic and devastating and completely unnatural and would have been completely avoidable if Smokey the Fucking Bear hadn't been leading a charge to prevent small manageable forest fires in the first place.  Get fucked Smokey. 
Sorry. You liberals spent all your money on illegal aliens, welfare, corrupt unions, middle east wars, and funding other countries so they can make solar panels (where the money gets stolen anyway).  
Collectively, we have funded many things for many generations.  In the US, the UK, the EU - whatever you like.  Things have worked for 70 years just fine.  Why are we suddenly all so poor that we can't afford the things our parents enjoyed for decades?  And why do my parents live in fucking mansions while I struggle to make rent for a shitty flat?    There are a lot of questions need answering in this day and age.  I might suggest violence, but they've armed the police to the teeth too these days.  Protest is pointless.     
Every time I see a fully clothed person fall into water, I can only think about their phone. 
Don't worry, bike guy was training for a triathlon anyways. 
His only mistake was letting go of the umbrella.   Could've Mary Poppins the shit out of that. 
I'd bet that skateboard wouldn't even have made it over that ledge.   Makes it very /r/BetterEveryLoop. 
Ironic. He could save others from water... But not himself. 
I don't want to be that guy, but his awkward movement and the way his path keeps track with the board make it look staged. 
plot twist - biker is just commuting to work, had no idea or intention of saving the skateboard. 
who skates in wet?  it smokes bearings in no time.  
If questioned about my ties to Russia, I'll take the fifth...of vodka. 
In Mother Russia nothing in this world can said to be certain except death, taxes, and vodka. 
I had no idea what a Moscow Mule was a few weeks ago, until I walked into a bar and saw people drinking out of a copper cup.  I asked what it was and decided to give one a try.  I have to say, that's one tasty adult beverage.   
Honestly I laughed, but IMO it's always a risky move to make a political statement like that. You risk alienating a large portion of your audience. If it was already a niche product that you know only conservatives or liberals are gonna buy like bibles or almond butter or something that's one thing, but vodka seems pretty universal.  
I used to drink Smirnoff. I still do, but I used to too. 
I see this picture being posted on Facebook. The first comment will be,  "NEVER BUYING SMIRNOFF AGAIN! TIRED OF THESE LIBERAL HYPOCRITES. *something about obama* " 
Didn't trump say he'd be happy to talk about it under oath too? 
Not trying to be the Reddit dick but has anyone verified the truthfulness of this ad. I could totally imagine it being a fake l33t interweb pixturez. 
I don't really drink alcohol that much anymore. Is Smirnoff any good? 
(*crosses fingers*) Please be real and not photoshop 
"you just lost a customer!! stay out of politics idiots!" - 50 year old bald white guy with jorts

"why does everything have to be political?" - Trump supporters  
i used to get on at the same bus stop and ride the same bus with her every morning in Seattle. her owner hated all of the publicity she gets but he understood. she would sometimes get on the bus without him paying attention then she would get off at the dog park and he would meet her there. very cool dog  
That's what Eclipse wants you to think.  She's actually cashing Social Security checks for her owner, who is buried in the backyard. 
Wow, it took me at least eighteen years to get my act together as much as this dog right here. 
Making my way downtown, barking fast, woof woof I'm a dog with a buspass 
Good for her. I always feel bad for pets that are stuck at home alone all day while their owners are at work.  
And I know fucking 20 year olds who can't even do their own laundry.  
She's a strong independent doggo who don't need no man  
Let me start by saying this is awesome and I'm glad it happens.  But..... How is this legal? I thought most cities have rules against unattended animals and whatnot.  
This company not only understands dogs but also gave the value of two toys in one. 
What's in the sad cactus, though?  I have to know. 
This is fantastic! Was the toy marketed this way, or was it a surprise? 
It's cool when they do stuff like this.  Costco used to sell some that were like 4 legged animal toys, and inside the "feet" were tennis balls.  
Did you get this from Barkbox? Because my roomie's dog got this EXACT toy in a Barkbox and 25 min later, this sad cactus emerged. The flower and one arm of the cactus were pooped out a couple days later... 
The cynical side of me is telling me this is vital marketing and that someone making minimum wage had to chew it it to make it look authentic.  
What about the XBOX ONE X IN ONE XBOX ONE X BOX lmao 
No longer convinced the word 'one' could be possibly spelled like that. What?  
If they really want to fuck with Sony they should just name it Xbox 6 
Xbox Box by Dr Seuss  Xbox Socks Box Knox  Knox in box. Xbox in socks.  Knox on fox in socks in box.  Socks on Knox and Knox in box.  Xbox in socks on box on Knox.    $500 
How many Xbox One X's would one Xbox One X box if one Xbox One X could box? 
It's like when Goku tried to explain super saiyan blue to Frieza  
You can tell they took xbone pretty hard, Xbox one X, from X.B.One to X.B.O.X now. 
Say whatever you want about Microsoft's gaming department, their naming sense is the worst in the whole business.  
Looked at that picture for too long and now the word "one" looks weird to me.  
I just don't understand... Scorpio was a sweet ass name for a console. Just why... 
They should have just kept the name Scorpio. It would be better then this Xbox one X shit. 
That baby is just asserting its dominance. By the look on Dad's face, it's working. 
You got tea bagged... in real life... by your kid? 
At least there wasn't crap coming out the sides of the diaper, splattering it all over your face.  
That kid's gonna grow up to become a WWE superstar and this will be his finishing move. 
I'm a teacher.  The wife works a normal job.  We have a 1.5 and a 3.5 year old.  I have more control over 28 middle schoolers in a classroom than I do over these 2. It's week 2 of the summer, I may not live until the end of it.  
"And after this I'm gonna suck on your wife's titty" - That kid probably 
Fellow father here of a 3yr old boy. Gotta give you props on the solid diaper change. No protruding ass cheeks and is able to withstand a solid amount of violent movements. Well done. 
why do kids do this?!?! i lay on the floor to play with my son...i assume hes going to get a toy or a drink or something...seconds later its like mortal kombat "FINISH HIM" and out of nowhere...baby ass..in the face. little bugger. lol 
Wow OP you could be my husband's twin brother.  I had to look at the gif for a minute to convince myself you are in fact a different person. I showed my husband and he says "holy shit I have a twin!"  Are you aware of any missing family? (I'm half kidding, but DH was adopted...) 
My niece used to do this and we'd call it the stripper dance. Now she's older and randomly does this off-brand twerk and we're trying to figure out who taught her. 
More proof not having kids was the right choice for me 
I'm in my early 20's and there's times where I would really like to have a child of my own.. then I see shit like this. 
That's great news.  Props to the EMTs and medical staff. Some real heroes at work there. 
Good to hear.  Have we heard about the Manchester victims yet? Last I heard there were still 10 in critical condition.  
Good to read. The response to the attacks by the various authorities, from what I've read at least, was excellent. Definitely helped limit the number of casualties.  
Absolutely fantastic. The EMS crews (and anyone who gave first aid) did amazing work that night. 
I really hope there aren't too many disfiguring injuries amongst those.  
48 victims?  First time hearing this amount.  Damn 
We're so lucky to have the NHS.  Fuck anyone that wants to privatise it. 
Well stabbings in London from gang violence isn't that uncommon. I imagine Hospitals weren't too taken aback by the injuries.   Everyone knows someone who knows someone who knows someone, whose been stabbed in London. 
Great news. But what is the U.K. government doing to help prevent future attacks? Are the citizens just supposed to rely on terrorists being terrible at their jobs? 
How's the cop who took them on with just a nightstick?  
And in true vending machine fashion, it got stuck without dispensing a single item.. 
Healthy, Wealthy, Wise... "Let's fill it with chips" 
30 years of dungeon crawlers have conditioned me. I believe this may be a mimic. 
This is not a bug, this is a feature. I learned vending machines had a 'motor testing' function which will distribute one item of each when in maintenance mode.  Source: vending machine guy at work once forgot to remove it after filling The machine. Hilarity (and free stuff) ensued. 
This is like a cruel joke. All the snacks you can handle but no way to get them out.  
"...And that was the beginning of the end.  The day the machines became self aware and revolted." 
There's a trick to getting free stuff and I feel a little guilty giving it away.  Find out what day and time the vending machine guy comes in to restock.  Wait until he's done and locks the machine back up.  You only have about a thirty second window here, so you'll need to be quick.  Once he leaves the area, stab him to death and steal his truck. 
It would be rude to not break the glass and take its offering.

That's what you get when you accidentally hit the star.star buttons on a machine running a 1980's program. 
"No thanks, we already have a no soliciting sign."  "Right, but as you can see it isn't working." 
"If you say no, I'll be back every single day until you say yes." 
A friend of mine use to sell peepholes for doors.  He would drive around and every time he saw a house with no peephole on the front door he would knock.  When they opened the door he would take his cordless drill, hold it up in the air, pull the trigger and say "This could have been a gun, would you like me to install a peephole for you?  It's $50 and only takes 15 minutes. "  About half the houses he stopped at would buy a $50 peephole.  He bought them in bulk for about $2 each. 
Too bad they don't work.  Source: the no soliciting sign on my house 
Had a kid come by once, selling magazines or vacuums or Civil War dioramas (I don't remember, I wasn't really paying attention), and I interrupted him and said, while tapping the "No Soliciting" sign on my front door, "didn't you see the sign?" and he throws his hands up and says "oh, I'm not a prostitute."  .......  Ok, I mean, you're not wrong, but... 
He just created a monopoly in his neighborhood preventing future competitors. Next year new sign design. 
what you need is what i do. Make a sign saying you have a baby sleeping and not to ring bell or knock. no one wants to risk it being a real sign and waking a baby to have an angry parent 
I love that this sign looks like it came from a craft shop!  Like someone trying to have something that tells people to go away but in a nice grandma way! 
Brilliant and he salts the earth behind him to eliminate the competition on his way to the top.  
Not good for repeat business, but he can sustain this model as far as his motorized scooter can take him (until it gets dark, anyway)  
Find that kid and tell him to make a sign that hangs from that one that says "Except Girl Scout Cookies" and option that as a $3-5 upgrade. 
So he was a solicitor selling no soliciting signs?  
If only those signs actually worked. Solicitors around here give zero fucks about that sign. 
I always buy when kids come and try to sell something. Seems like good positive reinforcement to going out and working for something, good for them.  
I have a No Soliciting sign on my door. It's red. I have come to the conclusion that people do not know what that S word means anymore. Pest control/solar panel/vivint guys I'm looking at you! 
I like how Netflix continues past bedtime.  If you don't go to sleep, tomorrow morning will take longer to arrive. 
This is too accurate. Who are you? Where are you hiding?? 
Definitely the panic.  I have to get up two hours earlier than normal tomorrow so I can make it to a carpool lot I'm not even entirely sure how to get into, spend two hours in a car with my boss and boss's boss, have a meeting with our pickiest client so they can complain at us in person instead of over the phone, then spend two more hours in the car to get back to my car, then a half-hour drive home.  Maybe I can call in dead tomorrow. 
HOW CAN WE KNOW ANYTHING WITHOUT UNITS OF MEASUREMENT?! PANIC INCREASING! 
I don't see "self-hatred" anywhere on this graph.  
I'm color blind, but I'm really interested to know what is what :( 
Unless you're a teacher then you don't have to worry for a few weeks! But then you gotta deal with 36 kids all day for 10 months so it evens out.. 
I was feeling this exactly and decided to open Reddit. Not sure how I feel about this. 
only difference for me is panic would be at a constant y=10 
sorry mister, no upvote unless x- and y-axes are labeled. 
I have an audit to deal with on Tuesday, so I'm dreading Sunday ending. Audit. I swear that's the most adult word. Fucking audit.  
stay awake as long as possible. keep the dream alive. weekend 4eVa! 
Sunday is definitely a shitty and overrated day most of the time. 
Serious question. How do you deal with what I call Sunday Dread? I start thinking about work just after lunch on Sunday, and as the afternoon wears on I just get more in a funk.  
Why 'Netflix shows' are a staircase? Are they consumed instantaneously? 
I really like that approach to input validation. Nothing subtle, just "No." 
For a minute I thought the site was letting you specify what age range your partners preferred range was.  
The rule of thumb is half your age, plus seven years for the minimum age to date. So even a legit 5 year-old can't go lower than a gal who's 10. That's a lot of pressure.  
I like how short,simple,and direct that is. You can almost feel the website's disapointment in you through the text. 
Typical OKC...people that are afraid of pedophiles need to grow up. 
I remember early on, their website had a question asking if you had an STD. If you clicked yes it gave you a link to e-harmony.  
The real question here is what do you have against 39 year olds? 
I have the right to date a 500 year old woman if I want to, what's wrong with that? 
Now can they use machine image learning to call out the "body shape" lies that are absolutely widespread on there 
I remember seeing Adam West and Burt Ward at Comic-Con in 2010. Funny, classy guys, both of them. They had the whole Q&A audience laughing with anecdotes and jokes, and they even had little kids who had probably never seen any of the old Batman series in awe.   I went up to the microphone and asked Adam West if he would dance the Batusi for us. He replied, "Well... I don't have my cape! But seeing as how I am a master of The Boogie, I will!", then he did. Delightful of him to humor such a lame request.  Another question someone had was, "Burt, you were really young on set. Did Adam take you under his wing? Show you the ropes?" Burt Ward looked over at Adam West and said, "No, not really. He was supportive, but he also liked to take me to parties. Get me drunk...."  To which Adam West leaned over and said into his microphone, "O-R-G-Y!" 
One of my favorite roles of his was The Grey Ghost in Batman: The Animated Series. He had a number of great cameos in other animated Batman shows too.  
"Ha! What kind of name is Paul for a cat? That's a people name!"  rip :( 
Of what use is a dream if not a blueprint for courageous action.  -Adam West 
Some actors transcend their profession and become icons. Adam West was an icon.  More than a man, a symbol.   RIP Master West 
I know Family Guy gets a lot of hate on this website but he was great on that show. RIP Mayor West. 
Aw man. First we lose a James Bond, now a Batman? :( 
Oh no...  Goddamit. I used to sneak over to the neighbor's house to watch Batman when I was a little kid and thought it was the coolest thing ever.  Man, this sucks.    
Adam West is actually the greatest actor to ever live. He spent years reciting 60s Batman dialog with a completely straight-face, really owning all that insane bullshit as if it made perfect sense. There was no irony there, just sincerity to the craft. I dare you to try that. 
Holy popcorn, Batman!   One hell of a career spanning decades, RIP Batman, Mayor West and countless other characters. 
As a huge Batman fan, I remember watching reruns with my Dad who had watched it as a kid when it first aired. It was always cool for me to imagine my Dad watching Batman with as much awe and fun as I did watching BTAS. You're bip zapping in the sky now Adam West. May your villians be silly, your cave labeled, and your ward a dorky slightly puggy man in tights.  
Can he get his star on the Hollywood Walk now? RIP Batman Mayor West 
I like the end... "Did anyone else just see that?" 
You're telling me I can just go down whenever I want???? 
I've never seen such a human display of confusion from a dog before. Makes the puppy seem older than it is, and his confusion more frustration since his legs are too damn short! 
"Wait a minute..wait what? No..can't be, nope nope...but..how?" 
Doggo: "I'm trying to free your mind, pupper. But I can only show you the stairs. You're the one that has to walk down them. You have to let it all go: fear, doubt, and disbelief. Free your mind."  Pupper: "Whoa." 
Pupper32 is trying to install StairManuvers.exe... would you like to proceed? 
Nice gif, but can we all agree that saying doggo is fucking lame? 
if only the photographer had taken a step or two to the left, they could have had the peak framed by the leaves, rather than being obscured by one. 
Beautiful picture.  Fall colors and still waters.  It's snowing on Mount Fuji. 
Many thanks my friend.  This is a wonderful pic.  Its snowing on Mt.Fuji.  
Very nice image, but i can't help but think the reflection is shopped... The blur seems unnatural and the reflection of the tree leaves looks off.....   
Autumn leaves frame eye.  It's snowing on Mount Fuji.  Mogami River. 
That water reflection is fake. Unless the camera was placed almost at water level, you are not gonna get that level of symmetry for objects at all depths. And if you did, the leaves in the foreground are not gonna be at that level. 
I definitely understand why people become weeabos, Japan is beautiful and has a fascinating history. 
I'm gonna say it, I feel like this would look better without the upper tree in the way. Other than that, brilliant! 
I'm going to Hakone as a stop during my honeymoon in November.  SUPER EXCITED!  I'm hoping it'll look a lot like (or similar to) this.   
OP must be a girl because girls are always talking about how much they love the Fall.  
I like the unwritten but clearly present tongue click in the last panel. 
"Really, though, what's your wish?"  "That... that was it."  "Are you sure?"  "Well, I mean... hey! No, stop it! You're not helping!"  "Sure I am. If you second-guess yourself enough to waste a wish on it, then you're probably suffering from some other psychological hang-up. Fixing the symptom won't fix the underlying problem."  "So I should wish for you to fix something else about me?"  "Yep."  "Okay, like what?"  "Well, to start with, it seems like you're hallucinating genies." 
"Hey, perhaps i should jump of that cliff!"   "perhaps you should recon..."   "Nope! Wheeeee...!" 
Unfunny post follows: The inability to second guess yourself is a severe disability often caused by blunt trauma head injury.   "Metacognitive disability" comes with the inability to believe yourself wrong. Patients given a task like assembling a sandwich. will look at failed results and say things like "The bread is the wrong shape." or even tell the researcher that they are the one who messed up the sandwich. The bottom line is that they cannot help in their own rehabilitation because they are unable to correct themselves.  When I had to learn this because of a recovering family member it occurred to me that people normally have different levels of metacognitive ability to start with.  
Hey dude, I follow you on Insta. Love your artwork. Keep it up! If you're ever in Toronto let me know I'd buy you a beer. 
That moment when you dont understand the post and are too afraid to ask... 
can someone be so kind to explain whats happening? 
I want to get it, but I must be missing something. Can someone explain the joke/reference? 
Dude, you're one of my favorite follows on Instagram. Your comics are great.  Also, I want so bad for your Texan emojis to be real. 
I'd have wished for a hundred trillion dollars tax free.  Fuck you money can make you very, very decisive.  
It wouldn't be a console launch without a Skyrim port announcement 
I used to be space traveler like you until I took a pulsating plasma bolt in the patella. 
You forgot the relaunch of their renamed paid mods program that are some how not paid mods 
In 41 years time Bethesda will only release an engine for which we have to pay for, then they will tell us to make the game. But they will release it without official tools or documentation, just to keep things like good old days.  Their marketing slang will be, *Make the Elder Scrolls game of your dreams all by yourself*  *we now included horse armour as a starting content for all creators just for 9.99$* 
spot on... pretty annoyed to STILL be hearing about Skyrim at every single gaming convention... 
I'm starting to wonder if the next Elder Scrolls game will be Skyrim 2. Hell I hope it is for the sake of them pumping funding/resources into it.  From a marketing perspective, they have to know that "Skyrim" is now more marketable than "The Elder Scrolls" at this point. 
man, they really don't want to let skyrim die huh?...I was in high school when it first came out and now I have been graduated from college for a year now and I still see mentions of skyrim...and still having presentations about it all these years later. Sheesh... 
It wouldn't be so annoying if they also said "And while Skyrim keeps you busy, here's a sneak peak at Fallout 5 / Elder Scrolls 6" that is still years away. At least we know it's coming and we can get some screenshots into our system to tide us over. Skyrim was good, but it's time to learn what you did well and do better.   AI pathing, larger towns and more civilian populations, more customized gear that doesn't devolve into "this one is better, no this one is better, no this one is" , more dynamic events (Like bandits raiding towns, caravans, patrols) , and for gods sake Horse Armor that comes standard.   
Pete Hines aged pretty damn well over those 35 years. 
Bethesda - "please keep buying Skyrim so we dont have to write a story or characters" 
I wasn't too upset about ESO because they created a new studio to make it so it didn't distract from TES VI.   As a PC player who got the special edition for free, I wasn't upset at it because apparently they ported Skyrim to the new engine as practice for FO4 anyways so might as well release it.   Legends was cool too because it was developed by Dire Wolf, so again not distracting from what we really want.  Skyrim for Switch and the "Creation Club" though? What the fuck is BGS doing? Their new IPs better be amazing.. 
At least it'll run on a new game engine, right? ...right? 
Seriously, Bethesda, are you even working on Elder Scrolls VI? 
In all seriousness they have gone way downhill. It's like EA 2.0 except they don't make new games. Fallout 4 wasn't that good and that's basically in since Skyrim and addons for Skyrim, which I played in 2012 lol.  
I see Skyrim as a game that will be ported to everything in the future, just like people today port Doom to Ti Calculators and random electronics.  Some guy will have Skyrim running on his watch. 
The way I see it, the reason it is taking so long for elder scrolls 6 is because they are making an entirely brand new engine. That takes time. So what they're doing is trying to fill in the gap years with as much as they can. My guess is either 2018 or 2019 we'll get the ES6 reveal at E3 and it will be all about their amazing new engine. 
People make fun of Bethesda but Capcom has had a port of Resident Evil 4 on every major console since the GameCube release. Surprised I haven't seen it for the Switch yet 
A lot of developers (and publishers) are simply greedy corporations. They'd do anything to milk their franchises dry if it means you are still paying for them. We'd already have a new Elder Scrolls if people would stop buying Skyrim. Although probably a worse game if we are looking at what they did with Fallout 4. It seems many devs are cutting costs because HD/4K is too taxing. But I don't care how good the game looks, I want fun gameplay. Something that is unfortunately not the priority for many gamers. 
I love my ES games. Love them to death, but lets look at the dates.  - Arena: 1994 - Daggerfall: 1996 - Morrowind: 2002 - Oblivion: 2006 - Skyrim: 2011  You're due Bethesda. 
"Dave, seriously man, wish it away!"  "I wish I were a bird!" 
It's rare something in /r/funny is actually funny and original!  
Thank god I started drinking cucumber water this morning instead of my regular coffee.    LPT: Cucumber water going through the nose soothes allergy flared sinuses fairly well. Smells kind of good too. 
This is great! I hope you can post more of these OP. 
I'm just really happy to find out dinosaurs spoke English. 
What a dick. Because of him the dinasour who wanted a fresh start for the planet Earth got his wish come true :( 
"The full arms sale, of over $20 billion, was notified in November 2016. This means it had already been authorized by congress and the executive branch, when President Obama was in office, before the Trump administration came into office. Eventually, Qatar is set to receive 36 American-made F15s."  Neutral guy here providing context. 
I think A LOT of people here didn't read the article. It looks like the $12 Billion of U.S "Weapons" is only in the form of F15's, not something you would see ISIS or other terrorist groups using since it would be easily traceable to this Qatar deal and this was approved by congress AND the Obama administration beforehand.    I would have a problem with this if it was something like guns where it COULD be transferred to these terrorist organizations without much trouble or visibility but it seems like this is a great way to create jobs in the U.S and to provide stability in the region. As much as I don't like Trump, this title is just clickbait and the article itself seems to suggest otherwise too.  
Bill Hicks: "Go ahead, pick up the gun..." BANG.  "You all saw him... he had a gun" 
*Trump put's finger to temple*  Qatar can't fund terrorism   If they spend all their money on US Weapons 
Well, they're going to need those weapons if they're going to stand a chance of fighting Saudi Arabia, whom Trump also recently signed a huge arms deal with.   Trump's only being fair here, guys. 
Didn't he fucking FLIP HIS LID about Obama giving money to Iran?  MONEY WE OWED THEM??? 
I love these articles that disprove their own headline. What is wrong with our news media? 
Sometimes I read the comments and realize how uninformed people are on other countries. Qatar matters to the USA. They are liberals compared to the Saudis.   Sauce: I lived in Qatar  
#The full arms sale, of over $20 billion, was notified in November 2016. This means it had already been authorized by congress and the executive branch, when President Obama was in office, before the Trump administration came into office.    You know, since apparently 60 commenters + 350 voters didn't READ THE ARTICLE.  
You mean Trump has wholly accepted the establishment, oligarchy and MIC ways? Sad for the red states. He was their Bernie Sanders, the answer to the end of the establishment graft and corruption. 
So did Qatar actually fund terror? Or is that just what the Saudis wanted him to say?  
"Trump sells" Authorized by Congress and the Senate and originally brokered by Obama. This sale will create 60,000 jobs in America and alleviate the need for additional US presence in the country. Did any of you read the article? 
Back in my day, when we armed both sides of a conflict, we did it through proxies and back-channels. 
I know I'm not the only one who's said this but please READ THE ARTICLE. OBAMA DID THE SALE, WHICH WAS ALSO APPROVED BY CONGRESS. TRUMP was just in office as they transferred weapons  
I belted out laughing, that was hilarious. What the hell did he launch himself off of to get that rifle-bullet trajectory?? 
I love it when a dog is so amped up they end up knocking me on my ass. It's hysterical. 
Ok before anyone yells repost, this genuinely made me laugh out loud and I have yet to see it before.   Just let some fun things be fun pls. 
That was like a 100lb wet log flying through the air. Absolutely horrifying if you don't know that log is also your best friend.  
Does anyone have a video source with sound for this? 
Why do dogs do this exactly? It's like they're all spirit and no awareness of their own bodies. 
I know I'm getting old because the first thing I thought of was "her parent's wood floor though...." 
I can't stop laughing at this.   Thank you, OP. I've never seen this before and I've had a shit week. I needed this.  
"Buns confusing day" is a children's book I'd read 
My cat likes to dance.  ...well "to be danced with" more precisely.  And by "likes" I mean "has no choice but to when I'm drinking". 
That's a freaking adorable name for a cat. I'm stealing it 
Damn, well done OP.  I've been on the internet since the dark days of AOL dial-up, muddled through the message board era, watched the rise of e-commerce (remember that buzzword?), and the monolithic rise of Google and Facebook.  This is the 1st time I've seen such a picture in 20+years of internet usage.  I've seen a lot of cats, girls, dancers, and pictures of beaches.  But never before such a masterful combination of all 4.  Sincerely, thank you for this. 
Do you have the cat on a leash when you take it to the beach? I ask because if you didn't, I'm wondering how you would get her* to come back to you. It's not like a dog where you can give it commands, right? Or am I totally wrong? 
"I am a kitty cat, and I dance dance dance. And I dance dance dance." 
People are going to fap to this, then feel shame. I guarantee it. 
I can't imagine this convo going "Honey, grab the cat and lets go to the beach!" 
I didn't know 'all colors at once' was an option for squirrels 
Do you have a version of this photo without HDR and saturation cranked up? I'm sure it's still a cool picture, I'm just curious how strongly those colors actually contrast in natural lighting.  
Is it sad that I haven't seen it till now? I'm from Kerala.  
For a second I thought it was a photoshop but it's really such a thing? Cool  
Is the blue orange contrast that natural, or was it touched up at all?  I don't imagine it's super edited, it's just so perfect. The morning light, the reflections, the way the sunlight blends with the ocean mist. Really well done.   
Good job cropping out the group of naked guys playing volleyball at 5am off to the right! 
Thats awesome.  Do you know what they are fishing for? I visited San Francisco in February 2014 and didn't see anyone fishing on that beach, just a dude naked from the waist down jogging on it 
Wow ... I can't believe now pretty SF is. Good job man, if you don't mind, I'm going to use as my wallpaper  
Growing up in San Diego I always thought SF would be drab like Seattle. Once I moved to the Bay Area I fell in love, especially with SF. I am now moving inland to AZ soon and this picture has me all choked up. I will be leaving with a heavy heart. 
No matter how many photos are shot of the Golden Gate Bridge, it never ceases to lose its beauty. 
Hey I love baker beach it has the best view of the Golden Gate Bridge in all of SF in my opinion 
Nice shot, but getting up at 5 isn't very special.. 
Omg I woke up at 5am to take a picture, your life is so hard. 
Why is it so sunny? I live close to San Francisco but it is dark at 5 am 
It's probably not but it looks like there's a person about to jump from the bridge right above the fisher man's pole 
Does anyone know how to reach him direct?   I see his channel is about handheld games. For a period of time abut 8-10 years ago, I went bananas collecting retrogames, including a shit-ton of battery powered handheld games from the 70's and 80's. I cashed out of the vintage NES last year and kinda don't really maintain the handheld collection anymore, would happily send a package his way of some handhelds he might not have.   This isn't even a 'charity' impulse as much as it is I see how much he seems to love them relative to how little I GAF about them anymore, so may as well bring some minor joy to a random person.  
To the person who donated 800 bucks to this man...   You the best...  WHO?  YOU....   *edit* this is now my 2nd most upvoted comment. It was honestly just a way for me to make a DJ Khaled reference. Please stop upvoting it. My #1 post is about tacos. please don't ruin that. 
I know he's fully funded, but I still gave $10. I love being part of a community that comes together to help people who are passionate. It's a beautiful thing. This dude seems pretty genuine and 100% deserving. 
Epic. I just checked the link and he is topping $6,200.00 - I show my girl, and tell her about how this kind of thing happens on reddit every once in a while. The community just goes off the chain for minute and some dudes life gets UTTERLY changed. And here it goes again. Then I refresh his fund me page..... In five minutes, it's up $600.00!!!   I won't lie, I love it when you fuckers make me cry like this. 
I'm just a student with student loans and no money, but have $10. I will buy chicken nuggets from Wal-Mart instead of getting Chick-fil-a for the next two weeks.  Guarantee those are going to taste better being able to help someone. Love this so much in the seemingly mean world we live in. 
I just recently came into a large inheritance. I'm late to this but would like to donate a vehicle.  How can I find out more information?  
Don't think I've ever done GoFundMe but this seemed worth it even after they hit their 'target'.  It's not like his cerebral palsy is going away and I'm sure they'll need it.  Here's $50 man, hope for the best for ya.  Game on! 
Is there a link to donate?  I'm not seeing anything.  
Man that made me happy. My son is disabled and we tried to raise money through gofundme for a service dog. Unfortunately it's hard to get noticed. Felt good to see him so happy. 
This is really sweet.  Today has been an emotional day for me, a family friend passed away from brain cancer, leaving behind her husband and 1 year old son.  She was an incredibly positive person, and spread a lot of joy in spite of her own suffering, and i don't know.  It just makes me feel better knowing that there is goodness in the world, and that people can come together to lift others up.  Thanks for posting this OP. 
20k$ !!!! Averaging 1000$ / 5 Minutes right now! Keep it up reddit!!! 
Just donated $10 to the GoFundMe. It's not a lot, but hope it helps this awesome guy move forward with the tough hand he's been dealt.  
Someone's basic needs should not be funded by fucking charity. Fuck the US for denying his rights to healthcare and dignity. 
Can this be verified?  There was a huge scam years ago on Reddit of a gamer faking being in a wheelchair so people would give him money and video games.  
That horse has to be thinking, why is this girl trying to round House me? 
"If she can't get on, I can't throw her off when I mistake a hose for a snake. Let me help." 
LPT: Be around a horse while you're barefoot, that way you can tell which of your toes got ripped off instead of smashed if you had worn boots. 
This whole situation just really irritates me until the horse bends down.   "Okay, dumbass. Hop on." 
She trained the horse to lay down, the horse didn't do this by itself.  
"Here. Would you please stop kicking my ass and get on already!" 
by the way, she's practicing "fly mounting," which is considerably harder than even just getting into saddled horse. most people have to fail at it for a while before they can do it gracefully, or at all. a good horse is usually fairly patient for this as its strength and size allow them to take a lot of impact before it really hurts or bothers them. 
I can't get my head around someone who enters a horse corral bare foot.  That's disgusting and dangerous.    The one fool who tried to ride our horse bareback got his pelvis crushed.  
This thread is weirdly aggressive... No shit she isn't actually trying to get on, they're filming to show the horse help her get on 
If a person that fit can't get up their there is no way I'll ever do it. That's good information to have. 
Was she doing it on purpose to show this "feature" or not? It looked like she didn't jump at all. 
I'm surprised Wikipedia isn't on board. There's still time I suppose. 
How many of these sites are going to go black on the 12th? It's sounding like they are just going to put a message on their front page or something. 
Why aren't google, apple, and microsoft joining the initiative? 
Classic quote - "No one in the porn industry ever yells 'slower, slower, slower,'" he said. "We're much more accustomed to 'faster, faster, faster.' Here at Pornhub, we want to keep it that way." 
If all these go black, July 12th will be the most productive day ever 
Idea: can we collectively recruit CPGrey, Kurzgesagt and VSauce team to work on an explainer video that we all display on our websites that day? 
All that REALLY needs to happen is for Google to threaten Comcast that they'll block all Comcast IPs from using their site and this overturning Net Neutrality crap will all go away.  (It would never happen, Google would lose too much money. But imagine if they did it...) 
It would be nice to know exactly what is happening on this day. Everything is quite vague and there are no "details" other than a date. 
Hey porn sites.. wanna help? BAN CONGRESSIONAL IPs. Them fucks will quickly learn wtf net neutrality means.  
You know who's missing here? Netflix. Shady assholes don't care now that they're an established player. 
It is really poor form to require people to enter their name and email address to participate in something purporting to fight for Internet freedom. Past endeavors like the SOPA campaign had a wonderful site that 1) stated exactly what participants would be doing and why and 2) openly provided the graphics/code/etc for websites to use. None of it required providing personal information. Visiting this new site accomplishes none of those things. 
Please correct me if I'm wrong about this, but isn't the net neutrality battle currently specific to the US? I'm Canadian, and would like to do everything I can to help, but am unsure what I can do from outside the US. Does anyone know if an equivalent law is already in progress here in Canada? If not, I'm sure we would be one of the first counties to follow suit after the US killed net neutrality, so I'd like to help. How can I do this? 
Seems Brandi Maxx is back to being politically active again. 
Even Pornhub is calling out Ajit Pai/Comcast on their shit... 
It would be so awesome if Google and Facebook joined. I don't get why they don't do that ...  
I'd be fine with pornhub going all black for a day 
I'm the administrator to several WordPress websites, is there a plugin I can activate on that day or a redirect to another site I can do?  We don't get a lot of unique visitors, but all the sites are involved in the entertainment industry so if I can raise awareness to our clients, then hopefully that'll spark something. 
I'm sure a few banner or welcome ads will change things. /s  Grow a set and shut it all down for a day. That's how you change things.  In reality, the same greed that's pushing net neutrality, it's the same greed that will stop these huge sites from actually doing something impactful. 
Sorry if this is a stupid question, but I'm still a little confused as to what is going to happen on July 12th. Will the websites that have signed up be going offline for the day, or just making their visitors aware of net neutrality?  
holy shit pornhub gets 75 mil daily visitors , how does the site not crumble under demand especially without cloudflare...omg the underlying infrastructure+network setup must be amazing. 
Chocolates are absolute enthusiasm machines. That and the fact that they love everybody gives you Oh boy! Oh Boy! 
Beautiful dog :) Labs are my favorite, such wonderful companions.  Mine will go bonkers for: "Go for ride?" "Time for Swimming?""Go visit Mom and Dad?" "Get a Chew?"  "Where are your Christmas presents?" and of course "Ice Cream?" LOL 
When I reach home and have to use the toilet real bad but first have to talk to the unexpected house guests.  
God, I love dogs so much. One of my exes many moons ago had two labs: a yellow and a chocolate. Both of them were derps, and the chocolate had hip dysplasia. But the chocolate would also get really jealous every time the yellow lab got attention. The chocolate would put his head between your hand and the other dog's head when giving him pats and whine that he wasn't getting pats. Seriously the most adorable thing ever.  
some crackhead probably robbed a relative's coin collection. crackheads are really good about putting old coins and bills back into circulation. 
I've recently found a small jar of these under a loose floorboard in my closet. I don't even know where to begin to take them to get looked at.  
Historical, I know nothing about antique coin value. It has to be worth something to someone. 
PM me if you want to sell it for 9 bucks, via Pay Pal 
Most nazi currency is nearly worthless for some reason. Not sure why, surely it's rare and part of an incredibly interesting part of humanity's past. 
Numismatist (coin collector) here. What OP has here is a $2 piece of the 3rd Reich. It is roughly 80% pure silver and the production of these was put to a halt around 1939 when the price of silver skyrocketed and it became more expensive to produce these than what they were actually worth. I recently saw one of these sell for $4,500 at auction and it was in much worse condition than this. My advice would be to take this to an appraiser immediately. He will be able to give you much more information besides the hot steamy pile of bull shit you just read.     
I'd probably get it appraised and put in a case, just so it doesn't seem like you have some random Nazi memorabilia just rolling around in your junk drawer. That could bring up some awkward conversations.
