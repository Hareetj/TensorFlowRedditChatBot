i actually showed that clip to my students in a demonstration of pure performance professionalism (and, of course, your amazing performance!)
yes! the response to our film has been so wonderful and positive, and i'm always surprised and grateful when i am recognized as the voice of moana. :)
my favorite part would have to have been during our press tour, he was so kind and sort of a mentor that i could look to for help.
being 16 i know i have a lot to learn in many areas; my career being one of them. i've had once in a life time opportunities and experiences, and i've also missed family functions and friend's birthdays. i think keeping an open mind is really important for any type of success.
thank you! there were more than a few parts i ad libbed. i have a natural tendency to make weird flabbergasted noises and somehow they worked with the film!! yay!! p.s. please tell your son i said hello!!
thank you so much!! -vanilla bean -the entire dear evan hansen album -aesop's fables -always pre-treat a stain before washing. always.
he. is. amazing!!!! so sweet, so smart, he also gives realllly good hugs.
thank you so so much. as of right now, my life motto is stay grounded and stay appreciative. i think it's something i can always work on, so it'll grow with me over time.
if i'm not at home chilling, you can find me at the beach :)
thank you so much! it's so important to have heroines our younger generation can look up to. i know being 16 myself, i look up to moana as well! alsooo.... (this is a very hard question btw) key lime pie. :)
there was a fair amount of screaming, i can tell you that. my family and friends are incredibly supportive, i love them to bits.
ow - like you stubbed your toe lee - like bruce lee and add another ee ow-lee-ee
london! i worked on my accent on the plane over and everything. p.s. moana is coming to netflix!!! check it out!!!
my life has certainly changed. while i am still a student, i now do my studies in places other than a classroom. i have been able to travel around the world, and meet wonderful people as well. so so grateful!!
"blow dart in my butt cheek." from dwayne 'the rock' johnson.
i might be a little biased, but i'd say it's pretty high up there.
as a polynesian, i personally thought it was perfect. especially the size the make islanders, my dad practically looks like maui.
as a portuguese american myself, i came to ask this same question!
one time i met this baby (i'd say around 3 years old) and he was crying super super hard and his parents were like "omg you're about to meet moana can you please relax and take a nice picture" and he did. like fully stopped crying and looked up at me with his face and was like "moana?" and. i. loved it.
new kind of disney princess movie. big hero six, etc etc etc with male protags have always had the option to ignore romance editing to add lilo, although that was not a princess movie, it was a buddy adventure.
mulan was my favorite disney princess growing up. i recognized from a young age that she was breaking gender roles, and i also really loved that she had a talking dragon as a friend.
well after performing on the oscars and performing the national anthem, next thing on my bucket list is going skydiving.
grilled cheese. made specifically by my mommy. slightly burned.
i always make sure that i'm well practiced and prepared, but in the moments before i go out on stage i just remember to breathe. phew.
imagine the choreography on 100 duck-sized lin manuel mirandas dance-fighting.
i'm in a tv showwww!!!! it's new to nbc and it's called rise!!!! if you can tell by the number of exclamation points, i am super-de-duper excited!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
there's published info on this. the management thought that having both pua and the chicken around took the focus away from maui and moana, so they got rid of pua and kept the chicken for comic relief.
i have a degree in molecular biology & genetics, and couldn't recommend it more as a subject to study. i loved learning it, especially the genetics side. it's the frontier of science that still has so much left to explore. so much so that i'm going to go do my masters in terraforming, to work out how to turn mars into a more earth-like planet.
from the perspective of someone who draws, you don't entirely resemble the animated character - it's clear that she was designed before you were cast. considering that, some of the overall features you share are remarkably similar. :)
drawn before she was cast? most animated films have the dialogue recorded before they start animating.
if the rock turned out to be a secret meanie, it would be one of the most disappointing things in the world. so happy to hear that!
well said. there must be a leak in my eyelid bc there's some fluid dripping out...
you is kind, you is smart, you is important. anyway coolio happy for your success
honestly one of the funniest little things in the movie to me is the little squeak moana makes when maui throws her off the boat that one time.
oh my god thank you for replying this is the greatest day of my life!!
my crush on you just got larger. (it's ok reddit, i'm not 18 yet)
she wasn't a princess, it was more buddy adventure film. moana is specifically, albeit subtlely, identified as a princess.
you did great - i remember watching and being super impressed at how composed you were, at 16 on that stage!
you're absolutely delightful. congratulations on moana, you were incredible.
this news has seriously made my day. my wife and 2 kids (and i of course) all love moana and your spectacular voice. wishing you nothing but the best!
top ten for me. i think it's one of the few movies my whole family loves. thanks for doing an ama!
what's hilarious was when a bunch of mainlanders got upset and we're all "they are stereotyping with maui." uh. maui literally looks and talks like every samoan braddah on this island.
seriously, they did a fantastic job. having spent a while in french polynesia, we could recognize the plants, and the inspiration to certain beaches. watching that movie makes me miss there so much!
which thank god they did. the tribe used in pocahontas actually offered their help and disney told them to fuck off. which is why you have songs that don't make sense and ancestor worship that didnt exist.
my wife grew up in hawaii and the maui myths were something you learned in school kinda. the movie takes a bunch of different stories from different culture, there were maui stories from native hawaiian, samoan, tongan, etc etc. from my limited knowledge of the stories moana takes bits from each culture as they weren't all the same.
this is awesome. i could totally see my kids doing this.
one of us. one of us. one of us. i knew there had to be more than my mom and i liking pineapple on pizza
though lilo had her sister involved in a love side plot.
the main inciting event of brave was that she was evading potential suitors.
who wouldn't want a talking dragon as a friend, right?
you should perform the national anthem while skydiving into the oscars.
you may want to edit your original post and put in some info about rise so people know about it then. :)
yeah but they have storyboards and art concepts for all the characters before they record for sure
your enthusiasm is really adorable. made me smile. :d
this comment is just slightly creepy but i support you
subtly? dwayne "the rock" johnson specifically calls her one.
imagine being 16 and performing on-stage on live tv. oh yeah, the other people performing are sting, john legend, and jt. glhf
that door in the gift shop also leads to the chevy employee lounge! formerly the gm lounge. that's another cool thing about epcot, there are hidden lounges scattered throughout the park for the companies that sponsor the rides. a lot of them sit dormant now, however.
they do a lot of great stuff for make a wish and give kids the world. was your trip at disneyland or wdw?
yeah they do a pretty good job of not making a big deal out of it. they try to be discreet as possible - as to not offend the guests they're cutting in front of, and also to not draw attention to the celebrities.
i've heard it was a misspelling of that exact name, i don't remember whether it was deliberate
that was confusing to me, maui isn't fat like they all said, he's clearly designed to look muscular and strong. sure, you can't see a bunch of muscles, but i'm pretty sure that's more realistic. those guys where you can see all of their muscles have very little body fat, not actually at their strongest.
disney is pretty decent about learning from their past criticisms. another thing they did, nearly every actor in the film is voiced by someone of polynesian descent. the only non-polynesian is the white guy who played both the chicken and the guy who wanted to eat the chicken.
random times? that's crazy! the first time (which i think was mostly there to set up the second time) was to show how tough and intimidating he is to get access to the realm of monsters. a ritual to open the way. the second time, it was to divert te ka's attention from moana. it's my favourite moment in the movie: maui has lost his fishhook. there's no magic left in him. he can't fight. but that's the moment he realizes that, fishhook or no fishhook, he can still be a hero. he's *still maui*. so he shouts, he challenges te ka, he **invites death**, all so his friend can survive and finish the mission that he didn't even want to be on. that's a hell of a haka.
can you elaborate about why those together is weird? honest question; i have no idea.
growing up in new zealand we learnt about maui fishing up nz, catching the sun to slow it down and generally being a bro to humans (maori legends). in saying that, the movie definitely was a mix of cultures as some parts werent quite what we had learnt but i think it was awesome the way it managed wide appeal while retaining its many roots
now now. we have to know how she feels about libraries before we can truly decide.
it's obviously the best sort of pizza. not sure what anyone else is about.
it's a twice daily watch for our toddlers. still not sick of it, even though we picked it up as soon as it was available a few months ago. at this point the wife and i sing along to all the songs, know every word.
the love interest (though unwanted) was still a huge focus of brave. it will be cool to see disney explore stories about other things with female characters. it makes the characters way more interesting and relatable.
i think it's amazing someone would come here just to talk to us, and not bother promoting the new project. we really don't always need to talk about rampart.
i'm so glad i'm not the only one. her section of "where you are" makes me happy sad and i want more.
but she's part of the line of disney princesses, the same way pocahontas, who was also a daughter of a chief, is.
because disney said so. also, elsa isn't a princess. she's a queen (but disney still considers her a princess). heck, mulan was no where near being a royalty, but she is considered a princess by disney too.
and the entire audience is comprised of the years top movie stars.
yes! i used to work at test track and i miss that lounge. we got to hang there on our days off.
is jemaine clement polynesian? i knew he was from new zealand (and has done several projects involving maori mythology), but i didn't think he was polynesian.
it wasn't the main focus, but it's certainly a thread throughout and the film ends with him coming to see her. although it was done quite well with her as the confident hero and he all shy and nervous.
oh, i agree. anyone who reads this thread is probably interested in her future projects (that's why someone asked), so i just thought it would make sense to mention the show at the top.
i bet queen elizabeth ii can get them, but doesn't out of spite.
i still argue that megara should be a disney princess. she marries the son of zeus, king of gods. that makes her like the ultimate princess.
elsa was a princess before she became the queen. a few other disney princesses became queens in their stories but are still referred to as princesses.
lilo fought space invaders and taught them the value of family. all while teach an alien creation how to love... how is that not an act of heroism???
he also was 'fart' who sang goodbye moonmen in the little known show rick and morty.
and if you ever hear/watch the fotc song "bowie's in space" then you'll realize why jeanine was the absolutely **perfect** person for the role.
:,) i'm crying from a wholesomeness overdose. you've made this teenage moana fangirl quite happy today, reddit :)
well yeah, why do you think anna and elsa haven't been coronated as disney princess? disney didn't just forget for 3 and a half years. they're making so much money as a solo line that there's no point in throwing them into the princess line, where they'd make less. being a princess isn't just some great honor, it's a way to make money off of little girls.
atlantis will probably always be my favorite disney movie, by far. both it and treasure planet just ooze with style and personality in a way few western animated movies do. such a shame they never got the attention they deserved.
she also *fed fish peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, because she had the wherewithal to realize fish should not eat tuna!* i love lilo.
greasing palms with fast passes. drain the swamp!!!!
yessssss i felt like the two songs sounded way too similar but my friends never shared my sentiment
another fun fact. nicole scherzinger, who plays moana's mom/stepmom (?) also plays boris's girlfriend in mib3.
right there with you. i can usually be ok through those scenes, but the dreamy ancestor scene when she's becalmed after maui leaves is sure to get me going, and nif somehow i make it through with dry eyes i will be guaranteed to lose it when moana is striding towards ta-ke, singing gently. crap. tearing up now.
well, while you really can't argue about mulan being a "real" princess, you could really say that pocahontas and moana are the daughters of their respective people's ruler. so they pretty much are the equivalent of what a princess would be in a (western) monarchy.
maybe because she is like a peer to their demographic instead of an older role model. that maybe i used is a sincere guess, not sarcasm.
my favourite is and always will be hunchback if notre dame (which also boasts the largest soundtrack of a disney animated film!) but atlantis has a special place in my heart too.
but disney didn't drain the swamp in florida - he built it up so that the infrastructure was the first floor and the park is the second floor not sure how this translates to the political metaphor though
apparently, both are supposed to be inspired by david bowie's style! and both are also sung by jermaine clement!
waititi wrote early drafts of moana and was set to be head writer but left to make shadows and wilderpeople. he only gets a thanks credit on moana.
38 year old dad of a 3.5 year old: the feels in that scene.... "this is not who you are; i know who you are."
i thought that line was "you know who you are". fits in better with the theme of everybody realizing their inner nature.
many jobs appear bad at a glance, only to get much worse at a second glance. and some jobs simply get worse and worse with every subsequent glance, which is why (of course) many people watch the program with their eyes closed. i was never in a position to close *my* eyes, and consequently, i enjoyed a front-row seat to a great variety of pits, and holes, that most people simply don't know exist. one brief example might be the interior of an ocean buoy. in the coast guard, buoy tenders are responsible for hoisting these giant steel contraptions out of the ocean, and refurbishing them. in this case, "refurbishment" means *"crawling into a woefully inadequate tube not much larger than the space taken up by your shoulders, and wiggling your way like a worm into the shadowy depths whereupon you begin to remove the barnacles and various other forms of nautical life with a stick or some other improvised tool."* i could go on, but i won't.
at the risk of sounding overly earnest (and too metaphorical), i'm going to say: **the welder.** welders not only work their asses off, they're in high demand, and critical to polite society. the entire world, including our infrastructure, and the building in which i currently find myself, is held together with welds. remove the welder retroactively from the species, and the *whole thing* shits the bed.
you're welcome. i'm not really humble, i'm just not properly acquisitive. i take more pleasure in saving than spending. and like the native americans, i tend to look at "ownership" as something more akin to stewardship. in other words, the more things you own, the more *things* own *you.* on a practical level, i find if you don't have the space for a lot of stuff, you don't wind up with a lot of stuff.
*hmmm.* personally, i've never had the ability to do the same job for more than a few days at a time. clean, dirty, exciting, or tedious. i simply don't have the wherewithal to stick with one vocation too long. it is, without question, a character flaw. regarding the creator's larynx, i agree that he (or she) must certainly possess a rich, well-modulated baritone. however, for reasons that involve the screen actor's guild, i must be perfectly clear about the fact that it isn't mine.
the short answer is: **perception.** the number of people who depend upon a workable infrastructure and a skilled trade force are coincidentally the same number of people who currently inhabit the planet. for a long list of reasons, parents, teachers, and guidance counselors have begun to emphasize one specific form of education. at the expense of all the others. in this country, it's widely believed that a 4 year degree for the most people. unfortunately, that's insane. of the 3 million available jobs today, less than *20%* require a 4 year degree. the rest require training, and a willingness to learn a skill that's actually in-demand. on top of everything else, we have student loans outstanding in excess of $1 trillion dollars. **in short, we're lending money we don't have to kids who can't pay it back so they can educate themselves for jobs that no longer exist.** that should probably stop.
hahahaha! i'm not exactly sure where i am, to be perfectly honest. however, and i'm *beginning to think this is a phenomenon unique to me,* i've begun to notice people sleeping behind me wherever i go. however, i should add - as i examine the photo in question - the gentlemen might not be sleeping. *i think he may be exercising and resting between reps.*
too many to mention. although i will mention one. there is a farm, in northwest indiana, called "fair oaks." mike and sue run one of the largest dairies in the midwest. we first shot there back in 2006, and mike trusted me to not only deliver a dozen cows on a cold winter's evening, he allowed me to perform a cesarean. after that, he invited the crew and i to stay with them for the evening, and several days afterward. which we did. to this day, none of us are allowed to fly over indiana without first landing in chicago, and driving to fair oaks to drink their wine, and their delicious milk. but mostly, their wine.
i push carts at a wal-mart. if they put mike out there on black friday, we may never see him again.
well, i narrated ghosthunters for 8 seasons. all i can tell you for sure regarding the paranormal is that there's good money in it.
i did go to a guidance counselor in high school, his name was mr. dunbar, and he gave me the worst advice i've ever heard. he told me that my desire to attend a 2 year community college was "beneath my potential." as it turns out, the 2 year school i ultimately attended allowed me to experiment, and explore, all kinds of studies that i simply would not have been able to afford at the university. consequently, i got on the road that brought me to where i'm sitting now. although, to be fair, i should point out that the road also led through several miles of sewer pipes.
that guy sleeping behind me. he really makes it look like fun.
a fine suggestion. medical fields, in general, are complicated. because of privacy issues. however, if i can find a way to make the trials & tribulations of a heart / lung machine manufacturer compelling... i'll be there.
1) typically, i don't use words like "favorite" to describe dirty jobs. but in general, the best ones are always the ones with the most interesting people. bob the pig farmer. jane the marine biologist. frank the bridge painter. there were 300, and to be honest, they were all pretty great. regarding number 2, the only novels i presently narrate are of the pop-up variety.
i do. i'm a big fan of unexpected juxtapositions - in life as well as on television. to burst forth with a few bars of puccini or verdi while crawling through some nameless river of shit is precisely the kind of thing that creates the cognitive dissonance i strive to infect my friends and viewers with. also, i find that quoting famous literature in equally absurd moments and situations can bring about the same effect.
to be perfectly honest, this is only the second time i've been here. in fact, this is really the *first* time i've been here. my previous amas was video, back in 2008. i've been a supporter for a long time. i'd say in general - i'm kind of late to the social media party. but over the last year, i've taken the facebook thing pretty seriously. and based on the staggering wit and intelligence i've seen thus far in queries like your own, **i recon i'll be back.**
someone had the good sense to post his picture on the interwebs. someone else had the poor judgement to forward that photo to me. there was something in the dog's eye that caught my own. the rest is... canine history.
they are! i'm... well i'm not mike rowe but his parents are pretty active members of the church i grew up in. they are wonderful people, he looks just like his dad!
there will always be plumbing, wiring (electrician) and welding jobs (among many others far too numerous to mention). the tools and techniques may change but humans will always need people to manitain the infrastructure that makes us civilized. if your son is as it minded as you are, there are plenty of related infrastructure jobs there too.
coast guard represent! never got the opportunity myself to get stationed on a buoy tender, but those crews work hard, party hard definitely.
if you have a poop squishing facility like back river, /u/thepoopmanager is our poop manager, and just jumped on reddit. she can literally put a poop squishing machine in your driveway if you want to watch one work. meanwhile, i need to go explain to a couple of guys who grew up with slide rules what reddit is, and why people on the internet want to talk to them about their poop. they're geniuses who do math that makes my head hurt without blinking. the look they're going to give me when i run this by them is still going to be memorable.
parenthetically, i could say the same about plumbers, electricians, and pastry chefs.
man you just made my day! thanks for the response! keep being awesome sir!
thanks for responding! i like imagining a female god with a booming baritone voice
bam! mike rowe for president... if you're qualified that is. mike rowe for governor at least.
victoria that was a demand and not a question. you better deliver!
i knew qvc sounded familiar! i used to help do technical support for some of the products they sell. i can't go into detail without both being confusing and giving away possibly confidential information...but basically i worked overflow tech support. you will never find a bigger idiot, than one who has purchased it equipment from qvc.
fair oaks farm! absolutely love that place, and stopping there for some killer squeaking cheese curds + ice cream + a visit to the famous birthing station (it's exactly what it sounds like). it makes the road trip from chicago to cinci, louisville, etc... much more enjoyable.
i was hired last year to walmart as a "cart associate" on november 15th. i had to walk miles around to collect our distraught carts. my coworker got hit by two different cars and i was in such a rush that day that my nipples started bleeding. fun times.

the whistling oyster has been closed for about 5 years mike, i think it is time to go back to baltimore and hang out.
he quoted a sat vocab word and sweet brown in the same answer. it gets no better than this.
that is the best reply about "ghost hunting" shows i think i've ever seen. xd
thanks for answering this one. i was bummed that dave barsky was not able to follow. you two had such a delightful dynamic.
i've found most guidance counselors want anyone they think is remotely intelligent to be a lawyer, doctor, professor, etc. or at least start on that track. i understand these are high-earning professions but they're just not for everyone. neither is the mountain of student loan debt.
hahaha! great answers! thanks for making my day :) i always loved that episode where you were harvesting worms and your cameraman fell into the mud. always a fun time!
thank you for not saying "poo" like you always had to do on tv.
indeed. heck, i include it among those jobs now, though i am probably one of the last that entered the field without education so i suppose it doesn't quite qualify as a no-degree thing any more.

i was with a bearing manufacturer that makes the largest bearings in the world. it was the same thing there. when "how its made" was doing a segment on us, people were forced to clean the floor and machines with toothbrushes. figuratively speaking, of course. the working conditions were made to look a lot better on tv than they are in reality. i'm sure they do that everywhere, except for japanese factories. they're just always freakishly clean.
is that a euphemism for the job driving them to drink?
god played by jeri ryan, voiced by james earl jones?
you know, having actually worked 300 disparate jobs, he's uniquely qualified to be president.
let's not go overboard with the nobility thing. discovery canceled *dirty jobs*. it's not like mike quit doing it because he was offended by the network's other programming. but to his credit, they did offer him some other positions in the "scripted but we'll pretend it's real" category, and he turned that stuff down until he could do a show he felt was reasonably authentic.
i'm from a dairy county and was on a dairy judging team and even i had fun when we went there with our ffa team.
yupp. sounds like wal-mart. i've been hit by vehicles three times, have been screamed at, had people throw trash at me (including a lady who dumped her ashtray out on my shoes), have been mugged at knife point, and have found a varying degree of things in the carts, including human feces and dead animals.
they sure did! /r/baltimore had a more mixed reaction.
and in typical mythbusters style, the end result was no cement truck at all and a black circle on the ground.
seriously! we need barsky back just so you can make fun of him. highlight of the show.
maybe because parents are upset that the guidance counselor thinks their little timmy isn't smart enough to be a doctor?
i like chicken i like liver op, op, please deliver
the "have it our way! or else." part made me laugh pretty historically at work when saying it in a wise-guy voice.
its pretty amazing what actually encouraging cleanliness can do in a industrial workplace. 15 minutes of actual, real cleaning (not just sweeping) goes a loooooooooooooooong way in shops of all sizes.
um, i was told too? but all that growth weighs them down more and it can fuck up the paint leading to rust?
the interior of the buoy is not open. but on the bottom of the buoy there are like cylindrical holes that allow water up in there to help keep the thing upright. i tried finding pictures online for you but i failed you!
chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer.
if we're being honest here, my knowledge of the 'party hard' came from my bm1 who was on a buoy tender, who himself, partied hard. come to think of it, he would find any reason to party hard.
we can only hope he does the documentation for his poop squishing company.
no, bit north of there- although it would certainly be convenient if we could help them with poop squishing. we've done poop squishing from alaska to tropical islands, but nothing in the back river plant in our own backyard yet.
the latter is in fact necessary for effective cold fusion. that's why we haven't gotten it to work yet.

wait until the attack ads though... *mike rowe can hardly keep a job, he's had over 300... do you really want a layabout running your country?*
why would you quit a show you believe in because the network has shows you don't? now the network has no shows you believe in and things are worse off all around. change is inspired by example.
your mother speaks the truth. it was april 1st, 1992. i introduced item # j-h20, the ice pendant. it was in fact, an ice cube, dangling from a piece of twine. the most extraordinary fact was not that 12 people actually ordered the damn thing. it was that the people taking the orders at qvc believed the product was genuine. that episode set the stage for my second firing.
...what is he chewing on? ...what is he doing blaire? ...it looks like he's...what is happening?
that's where i lost it! that and "whose cat is that?" not my cat not my problem, that's what i always say.
ah, but the qvc price is only $24.35! what a deal!
"2 of each there. you have to have that for.... breeding purposes."
yeah as i was thinking about it and reading other replies i'd bet it also depends highly on the truck itself. like some may have finer controls, or some have limited entry as someone mentioned that might cut your air hose or power cord if rotated.
mike rowe has a lot of public relations damaging to do before we get up in arms over his self-promoting (if i say so myself), he may be able to get away with a strong-arm robbery and still remain in good favor
i think he was just teasing, we all know mike is wicked
i thought the same thing myself. maybe i'm just a pussy, but i would not be going in there with my face uncovered at the very least.
i've always want to "laugh historically"...you know, for history.

i love my plumber. the guy is amazing at his job, super-nice, and came over on christmas-fucking-eve to fix our heater that wasn't working on generator power. ice storm knocked out power out, but we have a generator backup. the heating system is hooked up to it, but decided it didn't like the arrangement and didn't work. dude bought a part that had been recalled out of pocket to help us out. he is good people and he's getting a gift card to a nice restaurant that also serves hard liquor for christmas this year.
but i've already seen mike rowe jack off a bull, and yet still no cold fusion. explain that one science!
the show he believed in was cancelled. he was offered other shows he didn't believe in and declined to do them.

*oh my god...* i had no idea i'd actually be getting an answer to this. for nearly two decades, i stuck to my guns that this never really happened. that woman has earned some apologies... she'll be ecstatic to hear that her story was validated by the man himself. i really appreciate you taking the time to come back and answer this. even if it means i'm earning myself almost a lifetime's worth of retroactive *"i told ya so"*s after telling my mom.
well i tell you what folks, this is some of the most gripping video we've brought you to date

"all ready mix truck drums have only 2 ways in and out. they all have a man way entry near the front of the cab, and of course where the material is introduced to the drum. in some cases depending on the amount of build up in a drum, you can crawl in the loading hopper and take care of it in a short amount of time. when it's going to take you a day or two or more, you always pull the safety hatch off for better ventilation. in either case, you always take the key to your truck and put it in your pocket, that way nothing happens that you don't want to happen." he also said you don't fully turn the drum when cleaning it out, just 90 degrees at at a time. the info in the quotes are what my dad actually typed. the last is my addition from our conversation.

get some online petition going viral like people did with getting a star like betty white on snl.
there was lots of water vapor in the solar system as it was forming. in the outer solar system, it was cold enough that lots of ice condensed (while in the inner solar system, it was too warm for that too happen). thus, the moons of the outer planets were built from rock, metal, and ice, so they still contain much ice today. at europa, tidal heating can melt some of this h2o to form a global subsurface ocean. -robert p.
bn: was there, or better yet, is there life on other worlds? that's why i took this job as ceo of the planetary society. mars may still harbor something alive today, and who knows what's in the sea of europa!
yes!! we have a plan to send humans to mars in the 2030's- and with work- we can make it happen. --ellen
with the james webb space telescope, we will look at the atmospheres of planets around other stars- taking a big leap towards finding habitable planets! jwst launches in 2018- so stay tuned! -- ellen
we don't know -- it could be anywhere in between! there must be some salt, based on magnetometry results from the galileo spacecraft. but how salty that ocean is can be tested with a follow up mission. -robert p.
we are searching for life on mars and hopefully soon on europa- we are following the liquid water, which scientists think is critical for life. i think the public would be in awe over the ability to answer the question- are we alone, how similar is life on other worlds to life here on earth, and how can we use that information to better understand ourselves! --- ellen
at nasa, we are working hard on this issue- because it is critical to our ability to get astronauts to mars in the 2030's. the mars curiosity rover has an instrument that characterized the radiation environment between earth and mars and on the surface, giving us specific numbers to work with. -- ellen
it was fun! it stretched the science a bit, but that's okay for the movies. it raised awareness of europa, its science, and the drive to explore it! -robert p.
back in 1995 there was a scientific conference on the possibility of an ocean beneath europa's ice shell. arthur c. clark tied in via a video connection from his home in sri lanka, which was a big feat for the day. he gave us express verbal permission to send a lander to europa! :-) -robert p.
bn here: oh, we are working hard on that. sorting several offers. meanwhile, my book undeniable, the science of creation comes out in november. buy a carton or two ;-)
i don't care that the show is aimed at kids, if a new bill nye the science guy comes out you better bet your ass i'm watching every episode.
it would tell us that life could be very common throughout the universe. and we would be able to examine another life chemistry: would it be the same or different from that on earth? these would be huge advances scientifically and to humanity as a whole! -robert p.
i am actually really optimistic! we have a lot of support- like from everyone here today :)), and we use lots of paths- increasing our use of technology to bring up capabilities and decrease costs, more partnering with the commercial sector and our international partners-- so we are getting more creative and leveraging every opportunity. and when you look at all the compelling science there dis to do- how can you not be optimistic! --ellen
we're in an interesting position in our civilization where, technologically, there is nothing stopping us from exploring most of the solar system robotically. the big limiting factor is funding. but nasa is exploring some really exciting concepts right now, including a mission called the clipper that would orbit jupiter and fly by the moon something like 45 times to perform initial reconnaissance. most mission concepts could get there by the early to mid-2020s. if you're talking about humans, a la **europa report** that's a lot different. the big factor there is radiation protection for astronauts, which is a problem pretty much any time you leave low-earth orbit. --casey
neil would crush me. but based on our day of bike riding, i'm pretty sure i can outrun him. phew... bn
one idea suggested is a melting probe that could go down through the ice. it would likely have to be heated by a nuclear power source. but such exploration is difficult and a long way off. fortunately europa appears to bring its innards up to the surface, so we can explore what is below by examining the surface, and perhaps plumes (if they are confirmed). -robert p.
nasa's voyager and galileo spacecrafts have studied the jupiter system, and europa was a big focus of the galileo mission. we have been studying a europa mission, but it is a challenge due to the high radiation environment. but we are close- and just today released a nasa announcement of opportunity to start work on instruments for the next europa mission. we are also working with the european space agency on their next mission to the jupiter system, called juice! --ellen
write to 'em. it was big fun... people like it perhaps because its air conditioned;-) bn
nasa currently states that sufficient plutonium is expected to be available by the middle of the coming decade. but in any case, the europa mission study team at jpl is carefully investigating whether a solar powered mission is feasible. we should know by late this summer. -robert p.
nasa has a very strong budget to explore our solar system and the universe, utilize the iss and develop the capabilities to prepare to send humans beyond low earth orbit, and do research in aeronautics to make air travel safer and more efficient. so if we had more money- i would keep doing what we are doing- just more of it :-) ---ellen
of course, faith is not what matters here -- it is the science and insights that come from exploring these worlds. both show strong promise for being habitable environments: mars near the surface in the past and underground perhaps today, and europa today. both need to be explored to find out if they have evidence of life of past or present life. -robert p.
we're near the tipping point. most people will stop denying it soon. then, we have to find ways to make up and be friendly. man oh man, it's going to be a near run thing, though. humans will live through the big changes in the next century, but it's not clear how many and how well. phew. bn
i understand why you might hope that mr. cage could help us out, but he is playing a character named ben gates. gates: that's the guy you need, but i don't think he's available, as he is fictional and all. bn
every time nasa finds something cool or interesting- we let the public know right away, and this would be no different. we make sure our science findings are sound, and then we bring the public right in with us to share the excitement! --ellen
all the space agencies of the world take planetary protection very seriously- making sure we don't spread earth microorganisms or bring anything back. we want to make sure when we find life on mars or europa, that we did not bring it with us. so we spend a lot of time and effort sterilizing spacecraft that approach the potentially habitable worlds in our solar system, like mars and europa. --ellen
oh my friend, glad you're into sci, eng, tech, and math. the big news is that we do **not** have to drill through the ice on europa to sample its seawater. we can fly a spacecraft through the geyser plumes! it will make the cost of the mission wonderfully affordable. that's why the planetary society joined with nasa in washington today. bn
personally, i don't know -- that's why we have to explore: to find out! but if there is any chance that there may be life there--and there is--it is so important to find out that we should do so. if it is there, it would likely be single-cell organisms. larger critters require more chemical energy than europa may be able to provide. -robert p.
two things: - every person is responsible for his or her own actions. - work to leave the world better than you found it... bn
this is the question i'm waiting to have answered. the distance of europa from the sun really siphons from the idea that it could be habitable for any human life, should we ever be able to reach that expanse of space. however, that is not to say that there could not be species able to adapt to the climate itself, such as plants or other animal species. bill, you've said this is in a "goldilocks zone", so does that also mean that the climate, and the way in which gases are contained within the planet's atmosphere, makes it possible for humans or other species to actually survive on its surface? or are you referring to "goldilocks zone" as in there is liquid water on the surface of europa? thanks for taking the time to answer!
it's not really a ban (i don't believe) so much as a no longer bothering with, to bend a phrase. the evidence is overwhelming. i've been to the uk, and people want to get to work addressing the problem rather than argue about it. bn
nasa has expressed its desire to explore europa--in fact, just this morning nasa released a call for instrument proposals for such a mission! the mission would be an orbiting or multiple flyby mission, as a first step toward exploring this world in detail. -robert p.
we are exploring mars because it had water in the past on its surface-- so it is pretty straightforward to look for evidence of past habitable environments on its surface. and it is the best place to send humans to explore. europa is a bit harder of place to explore because of the tough radiation environment-- but we are working on it! --ellen
that it challenges us by testing our preconceptions. -robert p.
transfer windows from earth to jupiter happen about once every year (about a month long), more often than to mars.
stick with it! sometimes it was discouraging being the only woman in the room, feeling like the work was too hard, and just getting discouraged! but to solve the big science and technology challenges of the future, we cannot leave half our population out! so stick with it, speak up, and ask for help when it gets hard. and don't get discouraged! --ellen
the size and complexity of life forms is limited by the amount of energy an environment has to sustain life. at europa, we might expect simple microbial (single-celled) life. multi-celled organisms (such as animals, e.g. whales!) are not expected. but at this point in our understanding--we cannot be sure! -robert p.
i will give you two- landing humans on mars (scientists!) and finding life on another world- and we will do both in our lifetime! --ellen
it may even be a woman! :-) other than our moon, the other most feasible places to send humans would be asteroids. -robert p.
as ceo of the planetary society, www.planetary.org, i want to accomplish two things at least. - mount a mission to europa to look for signs of life. - get the world engaged in a system to deflect an asteroid. let's change the world... bn
at first i was like "what? life on europa, of course there is!" then i remebered it's a moon and not europe, which is pronounced europa in norway.
and of course, robotic spacecraft are going there now! :-) -robert p.
and what about european extremely large telescope project? i am very curious about that, i read it should allow us to see the exoplanets in bigger detail than ever before.
thank you ellen for your time! looking forward to the day we can confirm life is on other worlds :)
it's really just a question of how much shielding weight would need to be lifted into orbit, right?
i'm a chemist, not an aerospace engineer or anything, but i thought the science in it was pretty solid. a lot better than the orbital mechanics in gravity for example.
man, do i miss sir arthur. *edited for correct use of the title.
as someone who was raised as a yecreationist, and now enjoys a more contextually appropriate view of genesis, i can't thank you enough for maintaining a clear distinction between mr. ham's view of scripture and the views of christian scientists. it was a great encouragement to see you clarify that we don't all believe as he does.
do you think we could travel to these habitable planets within the next few lifespans? how long would it take to terraform them, approximately?
i wonder what the funding comparisons are between the real europa project and the europa report movie..
thank you so much for this comment bill. i teach 4th-5th grade mathsci. there is a real lack of quality material available for this age group. most resources are "dumbed down" to the point of superficial information, and too much of the so called experiments are little more than "gee whiz" demos. this age group is capable of so much more real science when given the chance. how do i know? my students regularly design and carry out their own investigations. professional development and curriculum development is needed. teachers need to experience doing math and science and deepen their understanding. increase opportunities for elementary students, too many eligibility cutoffs at middle school for things like getting experiments into space for example.
thanks for this! 1-click purchase powers: activate!
bill nye went bike riding with neil degrasse tyson? i'm sorry but my doctor told me not to to pop all of my boners in one day.
this is beautiful. this is exactly what i'd love to do! planetary research is becoming more and more desirable, i suppose! do you have any specific tips? thanks!
thank you robert! i appreciate your time and perspective.
to be fair, you guys seemed to work well together. but i agree it's probably about time to get that ride updated.
if history books taught me one thing then it's that isaac newton would rather fight, though.
how cool would it be? minus 160 degrees celsius if i am not mistaken.
so who in the government is forcing you to say you have a strong budget? because i'm pretty sure nasa never has a strong enough budget. these are the space people we're talking about. we need to give the space people more money.
you know what could be really good at blocking radiation? 6 kilometers of ice. i say we send a probe under the ice to measure the radiation levels for ourselves.
thank you for this reply. not sure why i think you may be interested in this: i was watching cosmos (the new one) the other day with my 8 year old. it was the one about the runway greenhouse effect on venus and comparisons to what's going on on earth. at some point my son gets really mad: "why are we doing this? is every one crazy? how do we stop this?" and your reply was pretty much what i told him: you will live in that world. how well and how many of you, will be up to what grownups do today and what you and your friends do in the next 30 years or so. i can tell that he was really inspired by the whole thing.
we need to kidnap him. we need to kidnap nicolas cage!
i would say we need to go away from lithium ion batteries because they seem to be needing their max storage capabilities... any idea on what the next technology will be?
oh perfect! how wide are these geyser plumes? what sort of probe would we send? would we be able to control its movements or would we just send in a noncontrollable probe with instruments to send back data? if we are trying to control the probe, how will we do that given the immense amount of time it takes to steer something around from earth? if there are currents down there its going to be very difficult to know what we're doing
thank you for answering my question bill, it really means a lot. it doesn't hurt that those two pieces of advice are really helpful and two great philosophies to try to live by.
yep. just start. i'm often asked this by people who want to do something like this, then they immediately bring up all the perceived barriers. there are no barriers. just start teaching online. it's really that simple.
my mistake i should've said "mankind" ;) thanks for the response!
europe is pronounced europa in the majority of european languages.
domination victories are boring it's about the tech victory conditions.
can confirm. after 3 years of living in souvenirs_from_earth's closet and eating his leftover pizza, i outed myself just so i could confirm the legitimateness of his three-years-coming upvote.
wait...are we talking mythical greek mermaids or harry potter ones? cause the harry potter ones are creepy.
it's all the way in the gamma ray spectrum so only atomic nuclei will absorb it. no amount of chemistry or engineering is going to help. it's a risk/benefit problem. it's one area where asteroid mining could be beneficial. you don't really need processed material to create a shield against cosmic rays. just lots of anything.
you are right, but the "we did it first" factor is strong. in my opinion we have no business sending people outside low earth orbit until we have mined and refined usable metals and fuel, burrowed radiation-safe chambers, and built sustainable infrastructure including food and water supply. think "minecraft"-ing with robots
99% certain that a new bnsg show kickstarter would out fund the rr kickstarter by a factor of at least 2 or 3.
was thinking the same thing. unfortunately, i doubt $6m would be enough to fund a full series for very long, vs being able to generate the content for the app that rr was doing.
disney takes its copyrights and trademarks pretty serious
why would you terraform it? if there is life there it is an inhabited planet, if we terraform it, it might prove hostile to the poor creatures. to quote carl childers "you shouldn't a done that, he's just a boy."
europa report was a fairly low-budget movie in the neighborhood of $10 m. the new transformers movie, on the other hand, had an estimated budget of $210 m.
i would say currently a human can still do way more then a robot. i. e. the work curiosity has done in it's whole mission could probably be done by a human in a few days/weeks.
europa receives a fatal dose of radiation every day from jupiter's belts. we'd need to come up with a way to shield that if we wanted to colonize europa
we dumb down science but start feeding our kids with the classics of literature by middle school. don't teach kids to fear science by dumbing it down and presenting the real thing as this 'impossible to understand thing'. we need to modernize science education, and we need to challenge kids with real science at an early enough age to make a difference! i volunteer once a year to teach young kids age 6-12 something real from astronomy. in 2 hours, they can characterize morphologies of galaxies or dream up ways for humans to reach mars! they are really smart!
tip: pay attention in your science and math classes! :-) -rp
he may attempt to extract bill's superior knowledge of the 21st century science and publish it it in his name
just replace "have" with "has" and your sentence will be fine!
i saw somewhere a couple of days ago (probably on reddit!) that nasa has approx 0.48% of the usa budget, but the general belief is that nasa has something like 25%.
jupiter's super strong magnetosphere dumps a bunch of radiation there, iirc.
i think it's that there are just enough tumblrinas, 2xcer's and white knights out there to upvote her post based on her gender.
i am very ignorant when it comes to the concept of radiation. i know it's bad and it gets absorbed by some materials, but even those materials have a limit on how much they can absorb before they become an issue themselves. this may even be a misconception i have. is there anything that can be done in the way of repelling radiation before it hits the surface of an object or perhaps making the object radiation "phobic" like hydrophobic materials are with water?
you sure? reading rainbow set kickstarter records across the board.
this seems like a given but as a college student studying chemistry and entering my senior year, there is nothing like having a strong foundation to build from. especially in math and i can't stress that enough.
thats true but i was really just making a flippant comment
better yet, jaden smith. how can mars be real if robots aren't real
not to shatter your childhood memories of grandpa but that sounds like one of those stories gramps will tell his grand kids and kids because it's exciting and not because it's true.
been here for three years, i'm sure he's well aware.
the earth uses its magnetic field to repel radiation. maybe if we figure out some better materials science we could use a magnetic field in conjunction with physical shielding to lighten the load.
of course, terraforming a planet which already sustains non-human life might not be the greatest thing with regards to the local ecosystem...
no worries. america has generated more than its fair share of ignorant ass-holes. and then went on to elect them to office. :/
if robots could speak they would be the most intelligent beings on planet mars.
no worries man! gramps didn't tell me that story because he's been dead my whole life but there is actually a bit of evidence in that, at the time of his promotion to major, he was the youngest marine to ever achieve that title. months later he was killed testing a prototype plane. my grandma fondly remembers neil armstrong and having many dinners with his wife. my cousin has a picture of my grandpa flying the x-15 prototype plane as well. if you know anything about aviation history, the x-1 was the first plane to break the sound barrier and the x-15 was the first tone suborbital. so you had to be a serious badass pilot to fly these things.
there are different kinds of radiation, and some, like gamma, are not affected by magnetic fields.
this topic is getting a little too charged for my liking.
now that is something they would add that would make me pay for a remake. (not that i wouldn't before, but...seriously ndt as deep voice guy)
nasa actually takes steps to ensure that, if probes or people end up on other planets or moons, no bacteria will follow and out-compete possible local life. we already prevent terraforming in one sense, then.
there is no nutrients in our mars, rocks, or robots
just going off of what i've learned here, gamma wouldn't seem to be the main problem, since the intense radiation is caused by jupiter's magnetosphere focusing(?) the radiation on nearby moons.
what if we fuck up the cloning and get a zombie sagan!? you fools were so caught up in figuring out whether you could that you never thought about whether you should!!
it's important to note that they do this to the best of their ability, but that doesn't mean that it's perfect by any means.
true; we may have already killed all the other habitable life in our solar system. isn't that *exciting*?
1. next is all of the data download. it will take ~16 months to download the amazing data. 2.we hope to learn about pluto and its five known moons. the atmosphere, the geology, the composition of the rocks, and much much more. 3.new horizons has seven instruments - alice, lorri, pepssi, ralph, rex, sdc, swap, so lots of data will be coming down in addition to the images you have seen already. 4.today has been great. we all gathered and counted down to the closest approach. i can only imagine how exciting tonight will be when nh phones home. --jillian
assembly was the original answer but i was wrong and the great coders let me know what the real answer was. -jillian speaking only of the spacecraft code, that was written in c using the nucleus rtos. i'd bet there was some assembly in the board support package and maybe some sprinkled here and there, but it the vast majority was written in c. the guidance and control algorithms were auto-generated c via simulink. --christopher krupiarz, new horizons flight software
what a great question! i remember holding my newborn son as the first cassini radar data of titan was downlinked in the middle of the night. the next big mission that can "grow up" with your daughter is the europa mission. this mission will investigate if europa and its huge global ocean is habitable. take her to the launch in the early 2020's when she is ~8 years old, then watch the data come in with her when she is a young teenager. - curt
some of us re-watched that episode earlier this month! we haven't seen any water on pluto yet, but if there is any water, we'll see it when we get our leisa scans. we've known about the water on charon since the late 80s. -az
the first image we should see after the "phone home" comes several hours later, what we call "c_lorri_fullframe." this will be very much like the image released this morning of pluto, but it will be of the largest moon, charon. --sjr
i think most people thought we would find at least one small moon - so far no new moons...!! we will be taking lots of departing observations, really cool ones! we will be looking at the thermal structure (temperature) on the night sides of both pluto and charon - and we will be looking along the lit crescent of pluto to see if we see any signs of atmospheric hazes or clouds. and we will also be trying to image the un-illuminate side of pluto with charon-light. and after all that we will be hopefully be getting distant observations of kbos and also a closer flyby of one object - if nasa approves an extended mission. ~kelsi
unfortunately, the lorri camera is extremely sensitive, and looking back towards earth would have the sun in the field of view and blow the instrument out. voyager was able to do this because the instruments were on a platform that could move, and the engineers could orient it such that voyager's dish acted as a sunshield. --sjr
yay! happy to hear pluto is inspiring the next generation :). new horizons does have the ability to detect new moons - we have been doing careful searches though all of the images and so far no luck. we will keep looking though, and even as we are departing we will look back at the pluto system and that will be our best chance to see any faint diffuse material like rings. ~kelsi
this is a hard question to answer because it changes every couple of hours. you can't pick your favorite christmas present until you are done opening the presents, and we won't be done with that until all the data is downlinked in 16 months. longest. christmas. ever. - curt
i watched those shows when i was a kid too! seeing pluto this morning was pretty great, but it made me feel curious, wondering how pluto came to have its bright and dark areas, and why it's cratered the way it is. we hope that seeing pluto's surface (and charon's) will give us a record of what went on in the kuiper belt, and more broadly, the remnants of the disk in which planets form. -az
three? i'm most excited to see up-close images of "the whale" and "the heart", as well as leisa spectra of those images to see what they are made of. i'm looking forward to images of hydra. with pluto and charon, we've gotten increasingly clearer images that have teased us. hydra has been nothing more than a pixel or two, barely resolved. what it is like will be a complete surprise to us, though we have some suspicion. ditto with the other small satellites. i'm also looking forward to seeing the stereo mosaic we are doing of pluto's surface, which will help us determine elevation. -az
charon, yes. hydra, yes (tomorrow or thursday!). nix, perhaps, but not styx nor kerberos. --sjr
that's a deep question, and sleep deprived people don't do well with deep philosophical questions! but this mission has really shown how far away from home our spacecraft is - pluto is deep, deep out in the black. it will be years before the spacecraft reaches a kbo for a flyby, and then nothing, ever. it redefines lonely and helps you better appreciate your companions. - curt
this observation is sky_lymap! we are basically somersaulting 6 times, hence the awesome animation. - jillian
pluto does have an atmosphere! it is bit on the thin side, 10 microbars compared to earth's 1 bar. it is ~98% n2, with trace ch4 and co. we will be looking at its structure, and its composition - all sorts of good info will come from both the visual images from the lorri images, and the alice instrument. ~kelsi
the light-travel time is about 4.5 hours at this distance. it takes over an hour for an image to be played back because of the very slow speeds over such a long distance. --sjr
no, they were discovered too late. we will be observing them briefly but they will be close to point-like objects and we won't get that data for several months. --sjr
i was 24 when i started on new horizons in 2004. i will be ..hmm... older when it finishes. at least in my 50/60s when the power runs out.--jillian
many observations are being taken during and around the closest approach to the planet and its moons. this includes observations of the night side as well as what we call "sliver" maps which are the very thin crescent images that the craft will see over the coming weeks. sliver observations are planned through july 30. --sjr
there's an envelope of stuff alan has and plans to open soon. we also made another set of predictions this winter that i'm in the process of tabulating as our results come in. we've found that even experts can't predict everything perfectly. -az
well, there is some trig, yes. we actually fit profiles to the limb of pluto. which is a fancy way of saying that we trace around the edge of pluto, which provides us something close to a circle, and then measure how many pixels across that circle is. since we know how many km per pixel, we can figure out the diameter in km by counting those pixels. it sounds straightforward, but the artistry comes in figuring out when you "stop" counting pixels (where the edge is) --curt
well, one of our team members really likes penguins. so ... his office? -az
we're still working on deciding (but we are little busy at present :-p). we'll announce our decision in the fall, and then burn to that object shortly after. even if we had decided already, we won't alter the spacecraft's course until the fall anyway, so there's no rush. the timeline on both objects we are looking at put a kbo encounter at late 2018 or early 2019. -az
we had a good idea pluto was copper, based on photometric color measurements, marc buie's maps and data from the mutual events. right now, we are finishing up taking the encounter images, then we are going to be sending data down. in the fall we are burning toward a kuiper belt object. if we get approved for an extended mission, we'll have a kbo encounter sometime in late 2018 or early 2019. -az
thanks! you ask a great question that has one of the very favorite answers that scientists like to give: we don't know! you have no idea how excited scientists get when our answer is "i don't know." it ranks up there with the cogent observation "well, that's weird..." so no, we don't have any idea how that formed - yet! - curt
we are all very excited. next thing on our checklist is the phone home this evening at 9:07pm et. - jillian
it would not be possible with current technology due to needing so much fuel at launch. --sjr
we have others heaters that use some of the energy that the plutonium produces. - jillian
the computer is a whopping 12 mhz. yes, you read that correctly: 12 megahertz. people are always surprised at how much less powerful our flight computers are compared to their home computers. but we build them rugged. if you bolted your laptop atop a rocket, violently shook it, exposed it to vacuum, and had it endure temperature extremes and radiation, then your vacation pictures might be at risk. but ours will be just fine. - curt
we're using mvic to study charonshine on pluto, but we're using lorri to look at plutoshine on charon. we are taking over 100 observations of charon at 0.2 and 1.0 seconds and then adding them together which is just about as good as a single long exposure, but it has the benefit of the spacecraft not needing to hold still as long. --sjr
we haven't seen any new satellites, and we've got mark showalter, the discoverer of styx and kerberos and one of the most talented satellite finders in the world looking for them. we'll get decent pictures of nix and hydra, and okay pictures of styx and kerberos. we are limited by where they are in their orbits at the time of flyby. -az
at the datarate we have (2 kilobits per second) it takes over 2 hours to downlink a standard picture from your cell phone! that means we will spend the next 16 months transmitting all the data down to earth. and yes, we are considering maneuvering the spacecraft so it flies by a small object farther out in the kuiper belt. - curt
new horizons will never stop travelling. the power will last until about 100 au (around 20+ years). -jillian
we can't possibly choose because it is all exciting!! we will learn so much about the surface, the atmosphere, and the space environment around pluto!! ~kelsi
not a lot of turnover. we have a dedicated team. - jillian
not at present. it would break lorri and be the last thing we did. with voyager, the dish could be used to mitigate the sunlight ruining the camera. our spacecraft isn't built that way. -az
by the time i look at them, our data are "fits" files, which stands for flexible image transport system, and is pretty typical for astronomical images, including those taken by astronomers at telescopes. you can read fits files with a free program like saoimage ds9. -az
we have 8 gbs of storage on each recorder and we have 2 of those. we have to leave some space for compressing and other storage. it isn't a lot of room, so we have to choose wisely. we compress the data as much as we can to store as much as we can. -jillian
very accurate. eyes runs off of spice kernels, which are what the nav teams use, so as long as everything is up to date, it's good. -az
because voyager made four giant planet flybys, it surpassed new horizons in speed (even though new horizons had the fastest launch), and will always be further away. -az
yes. :-) -jillian we had an interesting july 4 weekend.
my degree is applied mathematics with a minor in astronomy. - jillian lots of analysis for the science team, i am off to fly cygnss. - jillian
we upload sets of instructions in batches. for example, the spacecraft is currently executing a load that runs from p-7 days to p+2 days, and it can only hold two sets at one time. so we're pre-orchestrated in a rolling sort of way. -az
the name alice came first. then they honeymooners joke was made. -az
we'll be missing the whale's tail (and much of the whale itself too). when planning the mission, we knew that closest approach would be at time when a big bright spot and a big dark spot would both be visible, but we didn't know exactly what we would be getting in those best images. they will cover the heart though! -az
of the whole ama, for me, this was the "goosebumps" answer. amazing.
you guys rock! we're all very glad to be aboard for the journey.
leisa makes me think of arnold schwarzenegger trying to pronounce "laser"
c_lorri_fullframe.jpg? .img? you upload the pictures in full resolution? or using some compress technique?
248 year orbit? man, it's a good thing we don't live on pluto. measuring age would be really hard... "grandpa died at the ripe old age of .3 years"
that's ok, we already know what earth looks like. onwards toward the kuiper belt!
sometimes the best part of christmas is watching others unwrap their presents!
you mentioned that you are creating a stereo mosaic so you can determine elevation. how are you going to do this?
what is sky_lymap? it seems like the only mention of it online is this thread!
i order a pizza and they tell me 45 minutes and show up at 50 minutes. these guys shoot a rocket at pluto and get there over a minute early. outrageous.
if someone was streaming netflix on new horizons, it'd be a different story....
how do you find out these things without having ever been there?
sun to earth: 8 light minutes pluto to earth: 270 light minutes. we really cannot overhype how amazing an achievement this mission has been.
if you bundle in a phone plan, can you get faster d/l speeds?
better send another probe then :) call it "2 fast 2 horizons"
you must eat breathe and dream new-horizons almost 24/7, it's a major part of your life i presume, are there ever moment where you think, "i've had enough of this hunk of junk in space!"?
amazing. do you know how much, if any, data from the kuiper belt will be gathered?
fascinating, but that also sounds like it is very open to interpretation, or am i just misunderstanding the process? thank you for answering my question.
have you had any "well that's weird" moments during this experience?
pffft, you just need more srbs, and struts. trust me i play kerbal space program.
it was my understanding that waste heat from the rtg kept the electronics at, more-or-less, room temperature. what temperature *does* your computer call "home"?
we expected charon's surface to be mostly uniform and featureless. -az
all images now coming down are lossy compressed and are part of the "browse" dataset to better plan what we want to bring down first as uncompressed. --sjr
is the reddish-orange hue expected, and is there an accepted explanation for it (e.g. iron oxides, natural color of nitrogen snow, etc.) ?
kinda cool to think that the pyramids were built ~18.5 pluto years ago.
the sun on pluto is about 250x brighter than the full moon on earth.
i sincerely hope you are still alive in 16 months.
luckily there wasn't a whole lot of traffic between here and pluto
the fault basically happened because the spacecraft's cpu was overloaded. essentially they were attempting to load up a command sequence while simultaneously compressing science data and transmitting other data to earth. they'd previously done this in a test environment without problem. however, the actual science data was more complex than the test data they used, so the processor had to expend more resources, which resulted in the fault. the team was able to quickly determine the problem based upon telemetry once the spacecraft entered safe mode. basically, they won't have to perform this exact series events again for the rest of the mission, so they're not worried about it happening again.
9 years just in transit, probably closer to 15 years in the making and 20 years including concept designs and proposals. i'm really curious on the fault as well? what caused it? what abnormality occurred and what was learned from it i wonder? :)
all of a sudden, 2.9 billion miles away, someone screams **comcast!!!**
holy shit, the fact that this averages out to something like 5 light seconds per day is still fucking mind-boggling. way to go nasa! that's bad ass, especially since this was over nine years ago!
att has throttled back their transmission rate due to high data usage.
i found my own answer: "so, do the math. 2.5 megabits, at 1 kilobit per second: it takes 42 minutes to return one lorri photo to earth. most communications sessions last about eight hours. that's eleven images per communications session. and that assumes that new horizons is transmitting only lorri data, which it's not; there are other science instruments and spacecraft housekeeping data, too. the deep space network has only three 70-meter dishes, and there is a lot of competition for time on them; new horizons is lucky to get one communications session per day. and while new horizons is pointing its dish at earth, it can't point at anything else, including pluto. it has to choose between communicating and taking data."
the plasma and dust instruments will continue to gather data so long as they work and the mission is funded. they don't need to be near a planet to do interesting science. a mission to another kuiper belt object is being proposed to nasa as an extended mission of new horizons. --sjr
you're right, it is somewhat open to interpretation. that's why we have about 5 people do it independently of one another and compare results. and by "compare results" i mean we lock them in a cage together until a victor emerges. and we did that every day for 5 days. - curt
if we discount the 14 month stop over at vesta, dawn took 6.5 years to arrive at ceres. pluto is about 14 times the distance. it's not that we don't have the technology to do it: we do, absolutely. it's that we don't have the technology to do it within the lifespan of the scientists launching it.
why did you expect charon to be featureless? (if you don't mind me picking deeper into your brains haha)
i just googled c_lorri_fullframe and the only result is this thread. it's really cool that you can go into a much deeper level of detail here than is possible in short news stories.
yet there are locations in the oort cloud with google fiber?! why am i never in the right place?
barely legal pyramids in your area want to meet you
i got like four bucks in my pocket, how far will that get us?
remindme! 16 months "check if /u/joris2110 is still kicking and if so send them a nice cake gif"
yes it would! and that is what i assumed when i heard there might be nitrogen "snows".. i assumed it was analogous to what we see with water snows on earth.. but i dont know.. so hopefully the mission scientists will chime in on that questions for us
i'm wondering. would it speed things up if we put deep space relays nodes in throughout the solar system? have the next probe drop a few off around the belt, btwn the jovian and saturnian systems and maybe, if we have another one going out far enough, out to the neptune system. obviously, the speed of light is the limit, but could we not 'boost the signal' using the relays?
is there any propellant left in new horizons to make a course change?
"i am the new pluto pope." - some intern, probably
well, the direct impetus for the reclassification was the discovery of eris, which ~~is~~ was thought to be larger than pluto.
you wouldn't steal a car you wouldn't steal a handbag you wouldn't steal a planet downloading reclassified planets is stealing stealing is against the law
they say it's pluto, but it's really omicron persei 8
while i didn't physically laugh out loud, this is fucking hilarious.

three milliseconds of exposure on the main camera.
with lorri, it'd be a one-pixel grey dot. even less exciting!
you could get a stronger signal at higher data transfer speeds, but it wouldn't* get here faster in terms of velocity.
yeah, but if it was real, that means that reapers also exist. but then again, we'd also have asari.
true. the discovery of kuiper belt objects similar to pluto is what caused the debate in the first place. but the reason pluto doesn't fit definition of a planet is because it hasn't "cleared its neighborhood". it meets the other two requirements.
the speed of light in a glass fiber is about 30% lower than in a vacuum. another delay in the signal getting to earth is that the pathway is not straight. total internal reflection withing a fiber means that the light goes back and forth across the width of the fiber. picture a drunk running down the street and correcting his path every time he hits a guardrail. with a multimode fiber it should take about twice as long to receive the initial signal but after that it would come at very high bandwidth so the download time would be substantially shorter. there would be lots of complications beyond laying the single hypothetical fiber. the light signal has to be amplified regularly and each time the signal is amplified additional noise is added to the signal. generally in terrestrial applications this isn't much of a problem but on the trip back from pluto you'd probably just get white noise unless you cleaned up the signal regularly on its path.
haha fooled you. it was the rocky orbiting alpha centauri taken by the secret space probe we never told you about. haha fooled you again, doctor johanson took that while orbiting triton. haha fooled you again, it was an artist made depiction.
pluto is still emo over the whole planet thing... although joking aside - anybody know what causes that colour spectrum? is it the soil?
i loved that line in 3 where legion went back to the geth and told them off the reaper threat, and shepard is all "and they just took your word for it?" "yes, of course." "must have been nice..."
i just want to get the war over with so i can start romancing a battle-scarred ex-cop turian.
you're assuming they have vaginas, and plenty of rule34 says...otherwise
i love the archives. that was such a great mission to go through.
oh, so i had to save them? because i sacrificed them. bunch of righteous assholes.
he can't concentrate on you. too busy with calibrations.
the exoskeleton weighs 26-28ish lbs. it is fully modular, it has small, medium, and tall sizes on the hip, thigh, and shank pieces to adjust for a vast precentage of the population.
the best part of waking up is folgers in your cup. (i don't actually drink coffee). the worst part is not being independent. i need help with everything. with eating. getting things. not being able to go to the bathroom on my own.
pretty involved. it's all i did. i worked at a bike shop. i rode my bike every day with friends. went on trips constantly to skate parks or just looking for places to ride
i've had a couple. when i was first injured i had actually no use of any my limbs. i was also on a ventilator. so i couldn't eat or speak. when i was finally taken off the ventilator and could eat again that was a pretty big moment. then i slowly regain use of my left arm. then seven months later came my right arm. and then three years ago i started regaining use of some of my left wrist
i'm c4-c5 complete. if you get the opportunity to use one definitely do it
i just applied to go to vcu so we'll see how that goes as far as restroom, to go pee i have what's called a supra pubic catheter. it's a catheter that comes out of my abs that drains into a leg bag hooked up on my ankle that i have to have someone drain to go poop i sit in a chair with a hole in it then someone shoves a suppository up my ass that makes me go. then if all the poop doesn't come out someone has to reach in with their finger, which is called digital stim, and scoop the rest out. then we roll the chair into the shower and someone bathes me. i do this every other day in the morning. hanging out with friends is just like it used to be except i'm always sitting down
i guess so. i forget a lot of times that i can't feel so sometimes i'll hit my foot and instinctively yell ouch then remember that i can't feel it. i get surprised by my farts a lot too. since i can't tell when i have to fart they just happen. i then look around and see who did that and i'm like oh yeah that's me
i'll have to think about this and get back to you. i want to make sure i give you the best answer i can. i'm terrible at thinking of the spot right now that with all these questions
i use a combination of both voice recognition and typing with my knuckles one letter at a time since i have no use of my fingers. if i'm on my phone though, i have it velcroed to my armrest and i use my thumb to type and navigate.
yeah some people have disappeared but some of my relationships and friendships have grown to a new level that i never thought possible. i've had some friends do more than what's asked of them. i can truly say that i love them with all my heart.
when i'm feeling down i try to remind myself that i'm still alive. i may not be able to do what i used to but i still have a lot of potential. i also have the ability to choose which something that can never be taken away from me. i also have the greatest friends and family the anyone could ask for. they're always there when i need them. i try to stay positive and laugh at myself because if i don't the injury wins
i don't know if i've ever come to terms with it really. i accept where i am now and still trying to move on but i have both good and bad days
my dreams are still the same. depending on the dream i can be paralyzed or not. mostly i'm walking in my dreams. it's really weird because i think to myself oh this is so easy why the hell am i still sitting down.
thanks for doing what you do! i can imagine it's a job that takes quite the emotional toll, helping people and their families at some of the lowest points in their lives.
holy shit i would love to turn your food into poop! thank you! i will pm you in a little bit or you can pm me. whichever
i don't know where i'll be in the future but i do hope i'm walking. i do think technology who do something amazing. some things that i would love to do would be something space related. i love science in space. maybe working at a telescope or something? i also like to give standup comedy try. i'm also trying to learn voice acting so i'd like to see if that whould get me anywhere
1. it's made it very hard. 2. no idea what the future looks like but i'm hopeful for the future with technology 3. well besides bmx i also love playing guitar so that's another thing i can't do. but now i have a huge fascination with space. i'm trying to give voice acting a go. and i watch a lot of tv and movies 4. i just try and laugh at everything as much as possible
sadly no. i haven't had an orgasm since i could walk. honestly i don't know if i can ejaculate. i watch a lot of tv in my free time
therapy consist a lot of strengthening what i do have and also maintaining what i don't. ordinarily i do physical therapy in baltimore at kennedy krieger institute but i'm doing it now in richmond as a test run in case i get into vcu. the exoskeleton is good because it's good for my bones by weight bearing. i also use a fes bike for my legs. i attach electrodes to my muscles and it fires as i ride the bike. this helps keep my legs from atrophying and it is good for cardio
yeah. some friendships were based solely on bmx and sometimes people just grew apart regardless still trying to find new hobbies, any recommendations?
it's hard to explain but it's awesome i can't help but smile when i'm using it. it's so strange seeing my feet move below me and not being able to feel it. i forget how tall i actually am. it holds me up pretty well but i still need three people around me at all times. one person behind me to hold my hips. someone in front to guide the walker. and someone to my side to hold my chest in case i lean too far forward
it's meh. the last girl i dated said the chair was too hard for her. but i can't be mad at her because she was honest and upfront with me and to be honest it is pretty hard. luckily i have some awesome friends that really make me feel loved
it saddens me this hasn't been responded to. please stream it though.
i would love to but it's still in early phases in the us
one horse sized duck. then find a way to domesticate it and then give it to my brother. he loves ducks
i have no use of my muscles from the chest down but the exoskeleton grabs my stomach it holds me up pretty well
do you have any spare spinal cords laying around? just treat us like any other people i think that would be the best way to help
it's usually the first question once the awkward barrier comes down
just laugh and make sure you have people around you that you can talk to
i guess my philosophy would be, make sure to laugh whenever possible, don't be a cunt, and love the people around you
it's definitely beneficial because it's good for your bones and such. sitting down constantly takes weight off your bones and causes them to lose density. so weight-bearing is extremely important
i love classic rock and alternative. my guilty pleasure is katy perry. my top three bands right now are led zeppelin, arcade fire, portugal the man
never tried them. i've thought about it but extremely hesitant. i feel like i would freak out about not being able to walk or something. the only thing i mess around with is marijuana
copy pasted from another comment i have quite a few so i'll just start naming them. conan. i've been watching him since i was 10 myth busters. a show that's really inspired me and wanted me to pursue something in science futurama new girl parks and recreation game of thrones westworld community that 70s show that's just a few i can think of right now
gathering from what was said in other replies, treat them like your friend. don't pussy-foot around just trying to make them feel better as people do that all the time. maybe they just need a friend and not a pity party... that's my take on it, but if he sees the question he can answer better.
as long as they don't fuck up in the second round of the playoffs
i feel like i answered this is another response but if you have depression my advice is going talk to someone. professional help helps more than you think. just keep your chin up buddy
to ask a more sensitive question. do you have any feeling below your neck? do you have a sex drive? one important question this brings up is the sexual needs of those who cannot do anything to get those needs met. i have a friend who used to be a sex worker and she said she would sometimes work with disabled people. it is a good example of why sex workers can be a necessary and good thing in society.
how did your friends react after your accident? and have you found a new hobby since then that you're able to do in your condition?
are you expected to continue regaining use of other parts of your body?
that really sucks; i'm sorry you were dealt such an unlucky hand. was there anthing particularly good or bad that struck you when dealing with the doctors involved in your care? i have worked in spinal injury units, and some of the patients can be so (understandably) hopeless - what, do you think, can be a helpful thing to say/do? you seem to have an awesome attitude. probably doesn't mean much for you to read that from a stranger, but i really admire you!
the man i care for, finished high school, and college and is very successful at his job. he is also a quad, and the person i have the most respect for in the world. good luck to you
quality stand-up material. you've been cracking me the fuck up with your answers.
thank you. please answer this soon, our dear quad.

hey man. thanks for doing this ama. you're a fucking legend! keep on keepin' on.
you are giving so much inspiration to so many people. it's pretty incredible. the world could use a lot more people even half as positive as you are.
lucid dream, my man. then you can fly!* *if you follow the guides and methods like a holy book. i spent three months and only was able to be lucid for 5 seconds per dream at the end of it all. which is nice but i have a weird sleeping cycle and i called it quits since then.
haha my cooks and i are cracking up at that. i'm talking to my gm about it now and i'll email you tomorrow. i really do apologize for the late response. my phone had some stupid storage issues and i couldn't do a back up for some reason. i'm excited though.
hey, look at stephen hawking. he's stephen. fucking. hawking. you can absolutely be successful in the sciences.
sounds like my typical day. i work as an in home health caregiver. mostly with quads but also with clients who have ms and als. they are some of the greatest people i know. my suggestion is to educate your mind and learn new things with all that free time. also get awesome off road tires for your manual or power wheelchair and go on some adventures.
good answer for #4. i'm c5/6; i hate getting asked that question.
so...sorry if this comes up as rude but, no erections?
this is a sensitive subject but you said anything goes. how do you pay for this stuff? i would imagine it gets pretty pricey if you are doing it every day for life. if you're in the states (which might not be the case), are all the insurance issues from the current aca/political stuff going to affect your treatments? i'm really sorry if anything happens that lowers your quality of care for monetary reasons. i have to say you are hilarious and your positive mentality is really endearing. i struggle with chronic issues that leave me stuck at home doing nothing a lot, and it's hard to deal with it. but your comment before about not letting it win really hit me. there are so many people who would gladly trade my constant issues for not being able to move at all. i hope you get to walk again some day. but i feel like you'll make a great life for yourself no matter what direction your body goes in. good luck with voice acting!
start a podcast, especially if you're looking into voice acting. write a book (audiobook). karaoke the first two are things i enjoy listening to, so i'm biased in my recs.
do you think you could get to the point where you don't need other people around you?
hey, it's not going so great for the rest of us too, i promise.
i would wait - later rather than sooner. stem cell transplants are brutal and lots of people die or have life-long complications. i had one 16 months ago and i struggle every day. i don't think i'll ever be the same and i'm 21.
is your brother a popular redditor who magically appears in threads about ducks?
i have a kid who stares, should i tell him not to, or should i tell him to go up and ask you how it happened?
thanks for the answer, this really is a great ama :)
this oddly sad and hilarious at the same time. thank you
holy shit, that is incredible. i had never heard of that response before. how did they figure out it was appendicitis?
i'd imagine you've got a better perspective being in a chair to really appreciate the ass!
the thought of drinking a nice strong cup of coffee and then being unable to move is uncomfortable
he's incomplete, i'm like op, complete and therefore little chance of recovery without medical breakthrough. some incomplete ppl have fully recovered, i've had no improvement since my injury but i've learned how to deal with it.
unfortunately no, but he can continue to work on better using what he's got now. thus, the exoskeleton in pt!
note: it's $80,000, but insurance can cover some of the costs. source: i am a grad student working on the indego right now.
/r/cscareerquestions may be able to help you with this as well. to partially answer your question, for a lot of the really exciting ai (machine learning, self-driving cars etc), you'll want to get a master's.
when i was in my accident, i was told they would need to amputate or else i could die. i ended being very, very lucky and not needing that amputation but i was told i wouldn't be able to walk. a few months later, i was walking thanks to the help of my doctors, nurses, physical therapists and my new best friend: a walker. i wasn't allowed to bend my back, move my neck or my knee. i had to rely on someone to help me with every single day to day action for months. i never realized how amazing being able to hold my own toothbrush would feel, but i was so happy i cried. sometimes i get bitter about not being able to stand/walk for long. but then i just try to remember how lucky i am to be in pain, because it means i am alive. the smallest things are mountains to some people.
you can tell a lot about a man because of his shoes.
congrats to him! what type of job did he have? i cared for a young man who graduated law school! i haven't found out if he passed the bar since he moved but he's very intelligent so i imagine so. he used a joystick style mouse and a speech to text program for all of his classes. it's impressive how people are determined not to let life's circumstances get the best of them!
the new mayoral administration is a lot more responsive so far. i'm sure levar stoney would love to hear about sidewalk accessibility issues and work to fix them quickly.
that sounded okay to me. i mean, my son shits like once a week and he does it entirely independently. he's weird and all, but it's not something everyone does every day.
i'm roughly the same level of injury but it really all depends on the person. each injury is vastly different because the spinal cord controls so much and most of the real damage comes from the swelling/scarring after the injury. for me, i can feel normal from neck up basically but move from arms up(no fingers or triceps). i can feel pressure touching from my head down to my toes but temperature is harder to tell.
this is good advise. my friend is a c6 complete quad for about 2-3 years now, since his accident his been learning two languages and studying philosophy at university. your mind is your greatest tool!
it basically implies you shouldn't be as happy as you are.
that kind of stuff is controlled by the very bottom of your spinal cord. any serious spinal cord injury kills or severely impairs sexual function. also they can't get erections by thinking about/seeing "sexy stuff" simply because those signals can't get through the damaged parts of the spinal cord.
have you also considered public speaking engagements? it's highly likely that are many out there who would love to hear your story. there's also people who might be in the same boat as you. what better way than to make friends and influence people?
he mentioned that he still has trouble controlling his trunk while using it, so probably not. it wouldn't be safe for him to do it anyways. maybe with other tech though in the future
you mean the user formally known as /u/fuckswithducks?
i can't speak for op, or anyone else really, but my brother is paraplegic and in a wheelchair. he would prefer if parents didn't encourage kids to approach him and ask (which does happen). he doesn't mind talking about his health/the accident with friends and family, but he gets really uncomfortable when strangers ask. i think it would be best to tell your kid the truth when he asks about people with disabilities, but not to bother them. perhaps explain that they are people who just want to get around in their daily life. :) other people might feel differently though, so just use your best judgment.
agreed! my friend has a queen-sized mattress on an adjustable bed and never has to turn anymore. plus, it's also super comfortable for when i want to laze around on it too :d
there must be a weird disconnect between participating in online forums like this where your disability is invisible and then going out in to the real world where it is often the only thing that people see when they look at you. it's been interesting to read all of these responses from people in similar situations as op.
if a common problem is bowel obstruction they may have done a scan of the abdominal area to check if it was that and found the appendix to be infected instead
hope you don't mind my eli5 question but how come he will no longer continue to recover usage of his limbs? is there a certain time-limit to when movement recovery stops regenerating, like the control of his wrists? (hope my question makes sense)
as far as i know, concerning american healthcare, everything costs $80,000 before insurance.
yeah that is no where near as expensive as i had thought, makes me hope that in 5-10 years it'll be affordable for your average person.
i need to be reminded more often how lucky i am to be able to go about the things i do every day. thank you for that.
yeah there is a *very* broad "normal" range when it comes to that. from multiple times in one day to once in multiple days.
right, or that we found some formula for the sadness/depression we can bottle up and pass along. being a good sport about funny questions and engaging with people doesn't necessarily mean you got it all figured out, it means you're trying though, which is the best way to start.
thanks for the answer. kuddos for your buddy, i think i've found my new phobia.
don't know if this is the case for op, but i have a friend who is a c4. he can totally get an erection, but has to be manually stimulated.
vertical carbon fiber rods built into it that sense where his weight is shifting and actuators that can let the rods recenter his mass as is moves around.
i think you have to wait until it arrives until the extra protection kicks in ;-)
i don't know if i would call it a disability, but i am actually just a cat
i've read that this has to do with swelling. after a spinal cord (or really any big injury) injury the areas around it are super inflamed and pissed off and the inflamed tissue around it can compress the nerves or something? as time goes by and the tissue settles down you may regain more use of your limbs because those nerves weren't damaged, just being temporarily suppressed. i'm going off memory here though.
depends who you are and where you live. wheelchairs are subsidized 100% every 3 years for my son in canada. im sure if it drastically improves quality of life it would be just as subsidized as a power wheelchair, which can be *very* expensive also.
the guy with the wicked side burns? that's all of northern alberta... and everyone has a truck at the bar. please narrow search to less than all of alberta.
that's perfect, and you don't have to be in the know to get it. it's pretty obvious. /-s
i run the morning announcements at my school. is there a version of that which lasts around a minute?
and does he feel anything down there? op said that he tried to touch his dick, but it felt like touching someone else's dick.
can also confirm. i'm married and my wife always gives me shit for going on dates. seriously tho, i was down and out for a long time. she showed up when i quit looking, after a few years of one night stands and dating websites i just gave up. never lose hope, but don't feel like you always have to put yourself out there. stay busy with friends, it will happen naturally.
occupational therapist here. this is true and in cases of spinal cord injury it is called spinal shock. usually lasts up to 6 weeks. after this period you can strengthen muscles that are still innervated to increase function and make various adaptations to environment and task to increase the person's independence.
i am in one, it is here as well. though in america, ridgid frames are mainly covered if you have private insurance, if you are on public(medicare) you have to fight for a ridgid frame chair or else you get a hospital style wheelchair. it's every 5 years in america...
thanks for the confirmation. i tried to google to double check but was having a hell of time getting the right search terms together to confirm what i was pretty sure i'd read before. :]
most people don't actually believe that i am ryan reynolds, they just doubt that it's actually my name. i get a lot of "seriously?" or "really? wow" comments. that said, when you become a mayor your first name just kind of changes to "mayor" and that probably helps the situation.
i think a lot of recent developments in government are the result of the baby boomer generation's last hurrah. they feel strongly about certain things and have come out in full force to voice their opinions recently, while a lot of young people have taken a lot for granted the last few years. "politics" is always about who's talking, who's communicating best and who's got the strongest, most effective message that relates to the most people. i am hopeful that more young people will step up and take stands for what they think is right in the future. but something that's absolutely vital is that no matter who you are, that you educate yourself and get the right information. being the loudest in the room doesn't make you the smartest or most well rounded. it's important that people educate themselves, view things from multiple angles and then put their thoughts and views into action and make them more than just facebook rants. anyone can make a difference, especially at the local level.
i first ran for office in 2008 when i was 21. i ran for county legislature and i got my butt kicked, but i met a lot of local residents and learned a lot. i ran again in 2010 and lost again, but worked even harder and learned even more. shortly after that election the mayor of the village at the time called me and asked me to join the board of trustees when a member had resigned due to a serious accident. so i served on the board for several years and then ran for mayor in 2015 when the sitting mayor decided to retire.
running for office as a young person certainly comes with its own set of challenges. but that said, there are other people who get excited that a young person is running. so it has its pro's and cons. there are certainly people who doubt your abilities at first but you can't let it slow you down. educate yourself on the issues, be honest, listen to people, relate to them and work hard. you will eventually prove to people that you mean business and you're worthy of a chance to succeed.
29 is pretty young for a mayor. what were you, like 18?
geez, you went right from lighthearted small talk to fucking depressing
i'd recommend attending public meetings. attend your village board, town council, city council, county legislature meetings. whatever the area that you're interested in, go and educate yourself. speak your mind where you think it's necessary. and then don't be afraid to take ownership when it is needed. a lot of people often have this mindset that someone will roll out the red carpet for them to run for office. it doesn't usually work that way. if you want to do it, you should do it, no matter what anyone else says. call your local board of elections, call your local party chairman and ask for help running for the office of your choice. it can be done and if you work hard, it will happen. you just have to stay vigilant and always keep educating yourself. show that you care.
i go to notre dame and pete buttigieg is the real deal. i think he would be an amazing force for the democratic party and the change they need to re-energize themselves.
ryan reynolds was also green lantern before deadpool but no one remembers that. or maybe they choose not to remember that. anyway, just like any job or jobs, you develop a routine. i'm really big on making good use of my time, planning out my days, sticking to my schedule, etc. even if its something like "i am going to play overwatch with a friend from 8 to 10est", it's important to me that i stick to that plan. the other thing is, i don't have children yet. i have a serious amount of respect for everyone that does. yes, i'm a mayor and that's a big responsibility but so is caring for a human life and being responsible for their development. i often see friends from high school and they'll be like "wow, you're the mayor, that must be so much work!" and i'll reply "you have three kids, that has to be just as much, if not more work!" it's all about perspective, priorities and efficient use of time.
i think that the us-cuban relationship needs to improve and that we've seen some signs of it bettering during the obama administration. obviously cuba has some work of their own to do but being that they are so close to us geographically, we need that relationship to get better. and i think we can achieve that by opening more "normal" channels of communication and commerce. let cubans see what our country has to offer. i probably dodged your question here a bit by not addressing the specific policy that you referenced, but i've felt for a long time that us-cuban relations should be something to be addressed and thawed out.
i haven't done enough research into safe injection sights to be an authority on the topic. but there are two things that are certain; we have a serious addiction problem and the "old" ways of fighting drugs and addiction aren't working. we need new solutions and i think svante and the crew that helped him devise the plan deserve credit for thinking outside the box whether you like the idea or not.
best question in this thread. this is how political amas should be.
well op, answer the man. how do you, as mayor, plan to use your power to convince hugh jackman to team up with you in a movie? i imagine there is a law that could be passed. possibly some tax breaks that could be given?
that has never crossed my mind, although we have pursued a skatepark in the past. being a rural area, youth have to make their own fun a lot of times which gives us a fair amount of skateboarders and bikers. i used to be one myself. i've always believed that if you give people a place to go and somewhere to practice their craft and be constructive, they will do so. the challenge is finding a suitable piece of land and funding. thus far, we have not.
i went to college at ic actually so i'm very familiar with ithaca. svante is 3 months younger than i am. i actually turn 30 tomorrow. he and i have had lunch once and we've attended a few of the same meetings. he's a very down to earth guy. you never know, we may partner on something someday. as for the spring, i've never actually got water from there but i know a lot of people swear by it. but i use the village water since it is part of a system that the village manages...i'm probably slightly biased there.
i forgot to mention that i did play simcity when i was very young, but haven't played it in a long time.
well i haven't met any white walkers and i don't have a direwolf so...in all seriousness, politics doesn't play too big a role here at the local level. it's about getting things done for people. things like fixing the sidewalk on this street, helping connect this family to a resource that will benefit them, etc. there isn't too much drama or deal making or anything like that at the local level. village government really is street level. you can walk outside and point to the things that your tax dollars are going to. streets, sidewalks, water service, sewer, fire service, code enforcement, etc. i like that element of it.
my election was actually very intimate. someone who i consider a friend and colleague was my opponent and the election got very tense. my first thoughts when i won were along the lines of getting the ball rolling. i ran on a platform of achieving certain things for our community and i immediately got to work trying to make those things happen. i am very lucky to have a great number of people who have supported me, helped us achieve our vision, moved projects and initiatives forward, etc. i can't communicate enough how grateful i am for the things that people do for our community, for our village operation, for each other, for me, etc. but all in all, those were my first things. "it's time to get to work."
i would generally characterize my reaction as disbelief. i have always considered it a great honor to serve the public and something to be generally honored and respected, even when you disagree with the people serving. as long as they act in a respectful manner and try to do what they believe is right, i can have some basic level of respect for them, even if i despise their policies and proposals. what scares me now is that there is a person in charge who has no consistent way of thinking. he's short on patience, has no experience making decisions that effect a large pool of people and has never been accountable to anyone but himself. sometimes i think its good to upset the apple cart. sometimes a radical shift in perspective or tactics can be good. but i don't have confidence that this is the shift that our country needs and i'm not sure that a lot of people will understand that and/or the repercussions of it for years to come.
i definitely want to keep serving the public. as long as i am passionate about it and feel that i can be effective, get things done and make a difference, i will keep doing so. i often get asked about future opportunities and you never know. right now i'm loving my job as mayor, focused on the tasks at hand and taking everything one day at a time, trying to run the best village government that we can and do the right things for our greater community.
i think that's absolutely true. upstate new york has a lot of really beautiful natural resources, sites and cities. i just visited thousand islands for the first time a couple summers ago and it was a great, relaxing, tourist/vacation spot. i personally still have a lot of things in ny that i want to see and i enjoy the more relaxed rural life style of upstate compared to the city.
if all i wanted to talk about was my name, i wouldn't be here. i don't consider it an asset. it's just a designation. my mother actually named me after the actress meg ryan which i have always chastised her for.
jon snow. i think dany will take king's landing and ultimately (finally) realize that there won't be 7 kingdoms to rule if they are decimated by the white walkers. she'll go north, help in the final battle against the white walkers and die (probably sacrifice herself somehow). most characters in asoiaf don't get what they want or set out to get in the beginning so it would be the ultimate irony that she has been so set on winning the iron throne and then dies before she "really" gets to rule. i think jon will become the reluctant king in the end. it's not what he wants, but it will be what he does.
i don't think so. whitney point is a small village where most of us know each other. most people don't go to vote in a local election of this size and vote without knowing who they are voting for. they make a conscious decision to vote for the candidate of their choice. that's my opinion anyway.
that's a debate every year. technically whitney point falls in the southern tier region. i personally consider everything outside of nyc to be upstate ny because they're two drastically different environments.
the village of whitney point is fairly small, that is correct. as of the 2010 census we had less than 1,000 people. however, many people view "whitney point" as a much larger area as our school district spans a large geographical area. as a municipal government we provide services outside of our borders such as fire protection (we have a volunteer fire department which the village manages) and we also provide water service for hundreds of properties outside the village, as well as some sewer hook ups outside of our borders. in short, our scope is service goes far beyond our borders.
jaime lannister. i think he's one of the most morally gray characters and i love his arc in the books. i'm still a little salty about how they've handled it in the show but i hope they can get it on track in season 7.
we have a lot of great places to eat. aiello's, sparky's, dominic's to name a few. we do need more entertainment. for both youth and adults. that said, i would recommend visiting dorchester park and ford hill golf course. two very underrated assets.
well the route 26 bridge is currently being reconstructed as we speak. the route 11 bridge is one of the next major projects on nys' books as far as their infrastructure goes, locally. for me, i'd like to see sidewalk built on the east side of nys route 11 and on railroad street. in addition to the new fire station which will be built on west main street if you count facilities as infrastructure.
probably jon snow. at times when i am stressed i think about jon's decision to let the wildlings through the wall, despite his own brothers' opposition to it. jon knew that he was making the right decision and he went forward with it knowing the risks. he was ironically murdered for it but in the long run we see that it was the right decision to make and by fate, he breathes again.
i don't have a lot of knowledge about the problem but i've heard that the plan has shifted for a number of years and that a number of different proposals have been floated. i once heard about a proposal involving a series of tunnels if i remember correctly. i'm sorry that i'm not an expert in this area but 81 is definitely central to the health of a lot of communities. syracuse, cortland, whitney point, binghamton and more come to mind. at my "other" job we've recently seen our road go under construction for about 2 years and it has significantly affected us. it is indeed a challenge and there are definitely implications but there are also certain realities that infrastructure needs to be maintained and updated. you just have to hope that the people in charge of it make the right decisions and minimize the impact to existing businesses, organizations and residents.
in the grand scheme, i would say that whitney point if homogeneous. it's a large majority of white middle class residents. my graduating class was around 120-130 and i think all but two of us were white. i think the lack of "politics" in our community has more to do with size. we all know each other, we see each others' kids playing in the lawn, we know what time joe across the street goes to work every day, etc. it's a shared sense of community and belonging. it's nice. that said, i do think people should seek to broaden their horizons, look at things from others point and view and understand that the world isn't so peachy for everyone.
kim and the daycare provide an essential service here in whitney point and they often go above and beyond the call of duty. if they call, i will answer. there's no doubt that whitney point is stronger thanks to the preschool and daycare program and we want it here for a long time. that said, i do work closely with several youth groups including the broome county promise zone, which kim is also allied with. it's an awesome organization!
i never even played skyrim. i know that will freak a lot of people out but its true. i really dislike definitive lists because there are so many different eras in gaming to consider. here's a list of the first games that come to mind though. - halo 2 - yoshi's island - gone home - world of warcraft - the last of us - hotline miami - metroid prime i could make a list of 100 games probably but there's so many to consider. from the nes to know...just too many.
oh jeez, how do i escape this one? i have to say that i go to the scoop more often. take note of the signs for the three consecutive nys field hockey championships while you are there. our field hockey program is amazing and our girls' dedication to it is a serious inspiration to us all.
i don't know, he was very aggressive in green room...
it does get stressful at times, but all of our lives do right? we all have our own challenges, strengths and weaknesses. my general routine is that when i work in the afternoon and evening at my "day job" i spend the morning working on village business. or the reverse. when you're a mayor you're always on the job. always emailing from your phone, calling this person to move something along, that kind of stuff. modern technology has really helped the whole "on the go mayor" thing. it's not so much a job that you just sit in an office for. you're always going.
right now i think the biggest problem with college is that a) it costs too much and b) there are programs and degrees that simple aren't worth the time or money. granted, it's each individuals decision to enter the program of their choice but i don't think many 18 year olds grasp the notion that "i will owe $100,000 when i finish and i will only be getting a job that will pay $25,000 a year." it's difficult to understand that's not tangible until the bills actually start coming. so i think we have to find ways to reduce the cost and debt load that students incur and somehow encourage responsible selection of schools and programs. i think colleges do a lot of great things and aren't "evil" by any means but that said we do have to consider how far "for profit" can be stretched before it becomes a problem.
earlier in this thread i mentioned that i think we need to open the door to completely new types of businesses. the casino thing is one new development. the hemp and medical marijuana industries are a discussion. fireworks have been brought up from time to time. i just visited my first vr arcade right here in broome county. i think that's the ticket. we need to look forward and open the door to new industries instead of focusing on trying to bring back old business models.
i'd say being guild master in world of warcraft was more similar to being a mayor than sim city. it required the coordination of large groups of people for raids, constant communication, direction, decisions on the fly, etc.
i hope that's not connected to the internet in any way. support (security updates) ended april 8, 2014. maybe you should switch the local government over to linux. you'd get a lot of press for it. good luck, please don't use windows xp.
i'm also pretty sure you can get a free upgrade from the microsoft website as long as you use the accessibility programs.
wow! that's so surprising. it's so good that they have someone as passionate as you as mayor. what's your other job? how many hours per week would you say you spend dealing with mayoral duties?
is that why you became a mayor in the first place?
when you first ran for office did you do so with prior experience in the towns politics or did you just fill out the applications to run? as someone who isn't active in local politics how did you initially get into to it?
crazy weather we're having. so how about that triple homicide last night?
how about jj's diner? bet you don't have those. not so smug anymore, are you?
my college (hartwick, in oneonta) just started a center for craft food and beverage to help support primarily local breweries as local production of hops and barley will have to ramp up significantly in order to comply with new regulations about calling the beer a "local" product. the idea is that the college can help support the industry in its growth and therefore contribute to job creation in the area. they're the only local facility that offers quality control testing and real-time crop growth advice (when to harvest, etc). so, not hemp, hops. ;)
still really surprised about the dedication to overwatch, but very impressed as well. i never really compared being mayor to being a parent, i don't know why, but thank you for that. p.s. we know about green lantern. we don't want to talk about it. or the fact that he was deadpool twice, but the first one doesn't count either. third times a charm.
as a canadian political science student around your age, watching the us from our northern armchair, reading your rational, reasonable, well-thought out responses gives me hope for you, our brothers down south. just wanted to say thanks for being a great example for people to follow and look up to.
thanks for your answer. i appreciate your thoughts. i hate terms like like "progressive" and "conservative. because they seem to instantly divide schools of thought, so i will borrow yours. do you consider yourself to think outside the box or try to improve existing avenues when addressing community concerns?
how many amas would even respond to a question referencing a failure/failing grade, let alone a screw-up? reynolds4prez
someone do a hugh jackman & ryan reynolds ama request and ask them to come visit whitney point. i will be glad to give them a tour of the village and help them coordinate filming here. disclaimer: i am cautiously optimistic about logan.
my town (kennesaw, ga) built a skatepark in the local park and you would not believe how much it has changed. you see kids out all the time exercising and socializing, and a small economy has built around providing gear for kids at the park. it's been a positive addition for sure.
thanks for answering my somewhat ridiculous questions, i'm an ic alum as well, go bombers! i highly recommend trying the spring, i would fill up my water bottle whenever i drove through the area.
destiny! glad to see some love for my favorite game. what was your favorite expansion, and your favorite raid?
you should play cities skylines sometime and create a 1:1 rendition of whitney point! it's finally possible and the game is well worth it.
that actually sounds satisfying and kinda fun to be honest. i wanna see problems like potholes and tell people to fix them
how is your friendship with your opponent after the election? i'm really hoping you guys are like roommates or something now.
i spent a ridiculous amount of time reading each of your comments. you really express yourself well, in a well thought out and non inflammatory manner. do you have any plans to move onto the house or senate (obviously not now but maybe in like 10 years time)?
i grew up in the oneonta area, and went to school at oswego. it'd be a downright awesome place to live if there were more jobs. gotta love the snow though!
if your mom named you for meg ryan, shouldn't your name be meg(atron) reynolds?
this is the political representation the us needs.
a fair question and a fair answer. most of us are used to larger scale politics, where that sort of name recognition would probably be a bigger deal than it is in a small town.
i totally agree. whitney point is upstate, but more specifically, the southern tier.
judging by the look when he came back to kings landing at the end of s6, there's a good chance of a jaime redemption arc pretty soon in s7. subscribe to r/asoiaf for more tinfoil
dude, you left out that you guys host the broome county fair! i saw a lot of sick demolition derbies there as a kid.
hey, you might have to make that kind of decision if the white walkers ever take over canada.
switching to linux isn't free either. most of the costs as far as i know are support, not the licenses. kinda weird they can't update their computers though, though that might be coming back to the support costs.
yeah, god forbid the chinese find out how many hay bales will be used in this year's harvest festival.
that's probably illegal for organizations, ms really likes locking organizations into software agreement contracts and pushing windows 10 enterprise.
i am a store manager at my other job. over the years i've also written for a few gaming sites, namely xbla fans. i'd say on average i spend around 20 hours a week directly dealing with mayoral duties, but its always changing. sometimes its more, sometimes its less. and i never really stop thinking about it. even when i'm at home or at my other job, i'm always thinking about some program, some law, trying to solve some problem. it's all internal. and that is full-time.
dude that's an awesome bonus for very little work aside from staying a little after school and maybe help to organize a field trip.
yes there is a tank. source: i drive through there regularly.
that's great. our program isn't mandatory, it's optional. we recognize that not all non-profits can afford to contribute to the village's operations but we're asking and we're hoping that the program grows over the years. i think it means a lot that any local tax payer can see where their tax money is going and i hope that tax exempt entities who can afford it can feel good about helping to fund the local fire department or sidewalk repairs, etc.
deadpool 2 needs a scene or three filmed in whitney point. this is precisely the kind of mayhem deadpool would be into.
let's hope the bob lob law blog doesn't get wind of this.
looking for an obvious pop culture reference from a series enjoyed by millions is weird?
from utica/rome area. i've always thought it works this way: when you are outside nys or speaking to an audience outside nys, you call everything north of nyc "upstate". when you are in the upstate region, you call it your location central ny/hudson valley/southern tier/western ny/etc.
no jj's, but they're building a charlie mulligan's steakhouse. checkmate.
i don't care what people's vice is, some want a nice local brew beer and i am sure there will be college kids to drink it, but if you google drugs harm to self and harm to others and click images, alcohol is the top for harm to others and harm to self. marijuana can create all kinds of jobs as well be a good alternative to opiates that get prescribed by the ton. there are so many edibles, strains, ect. plus the tax revenue is amazing. so why not both?
the first wade wilson definitely counts. the first "deadpool" didn't happen.
this. and thanks canadian stranger. a lot of us consider you guys our sensible northern kin, as well.
what if we did a gofundme to raise a little cash for the town? just like $10k?
wow, you're a pretty swell guy. i'd like to have a hip young mayor like you one day.
that's great to hear. that's how i envisioned it happening as well but i'm glad to hear evidence of it actually working that way. maybe someday...
i feel like the taken king was the best expansion all around. it brought destiny forward in just about every way possible. i think king's fall is also my favorite raid. i really like the scope of it. although i did just do wrath of the machine for the first time and i like that it's so different from the existing raids. i do find it disappointing however that we didn't get much background on aksis. he seems like a really intimidating and scrupulous foe. really looking forward to destiny 2. i think bungie has been extremely limited by their game engine and that when they apply the lessons that they've learned with destiny and it's expansions, destiny 2 will be a greatly superior game.
i actually did play legion for a bit. i took launch day off and leveled for like 14 straight hours. i think legion is the best expansion in quite some time. i'm interested to see where the story goes from here. hoping for an old god expansion next.
this is the kind of transparency we desperately need in politics.
dude i read this and thought the same thing. let's go run a town together.
it's good. we work together very well and i think we truly respect each other's opinions and contributions more than ever. i like having him on board because he has a different perspective than i do and if i'm overlooking something i can count on him to point it out.
yeah. in a county, state or federal election, names would likely come into play a little more. it all just depends on the name and the electorate at any given time.
we have a large dam system and flood levies that were authorized by fdr back in the 30's. for that reason i have sometimes referred to ourselves as the "watchers on the wall." when water levels are high and there are threats of flooding down stream in places like binghamton, we can stop water in our dam here until things calm down. well, dec and the army corps of engineers can. the night's watch of broome county!
do customers still call you mayor at your store manager position? or do they treat you like any other store worker?
on the other hand, when boston asks various entities to pay a little more "voluntary" tax, it comes across as them shaking down organizations. "pay us or we shame you and make life harder for you, legally."
by saying this, you just made politicians seem so much more relatable. like, i did all that stuff. you're a mayor and i've had similar fun experiences. ty
that would be awesome. someone get my ryan reynolds' agent.
it was just created, maybe they're planning to negotiate a sale.
try our peppy pepperoni pepper poppers - only at your local socal low cal calzone zone!
uh, i guess not. i felt weird but now i don't. maybe i need to interact with people more.
i went to high school with him. fun to see people take their complaints about potholes, etc. directly to his facebook.
yep. and if youre from further north than the utica/rome area then your so far upstate your not even in ny and you just call it canada edit - so excited to see upstate ny so i clicked on it to see a piece of home then was like wtf that's southern tier area and was super disappointed. then saw utica/rome and was all yea! give my love to utica, shes a shithole sometimes but shes my favorite shithole and godfuckingdamn i miss home :'(
yeah seriously, wtf is that guy talking about? obviously we call it upstate
you're... oh, you're done? the comment is over? guys, should i be the one to ask for an explanation?
i'd like someone like him as our mayor for at least a year
the tony hawk foundation is a great resource for funding.
i game pretty heavily, never played destiny. should i jump on now or wait for destiny 2?
slow down there mayor, d.va is only as good as her supports. nerf the real trouble maker nana.
breaking news: mayor reynolds takes holiday to play video games!
just wait till we find out he has actually played candy crush. mark my words candygate will be the biggest scandal of the century.
ryan reynolds 2020: he's not deadpool, **but** he doesn't play candy crush.
imagine if he wasn't the manager? i'd love to be the one in charge of the mayor lol
a $3,600 salary at 20hrs/week for a year equates to about $3 and change/hr. i assume very good benefits but even if he got paid double, he still wouldn't be hitting nys minimum wage.
yeah but that's boston and not a smallish new york town. it's obvious the mayor means well and the funds have a clear cut purpose/destination.
except he's more qualified and people voted for him in support. all you have is us.
i love halo 3 and own multiple copies of the game, but it is my least favorite of bungie's halo games. the story doesn't really progress that much until halfway through the game, and the sense of sacrifice and loss that was promised in the trailers wasn't really delivered imo (reach did this much better). also the lack of enemy elites made combat less interesting to me, although i'm glad there were multiple brute types to make up for it. however, i still love the game, and am always down to play it. in fact, i think that "the covenant" is one of the best missions, if not the best mission in the franchise.
even just a flash of a newspaper as deadpool sits in a loungechair giving the introspeech to deadpool 2; talking about how he decided to run for mayor in a small no-nothing town for funsies. his opponent? mayor ryan reynolds. ( turns out, he is terrible in a fight. )
he seems like the kind of dude that would go for something like this. tag him, i'm too lazy. this is your chance to be a part of reddit history.
leslie i typed your symptoms into this bar up here and it says you may have "network connectivity issues".
315 represent! from what i understand (i moved away a few years ago), mayor barlow is doing pretty well for himself, especially having brought in a major grant to upgrade some of the downtown properties.
central new york is north of upstate and south of it.
if you can find destiny: the collection for like $20 i would go ahead and jump in now. it is a ton of content for that price.
there are a lot of bad genji players out there. my only claim to fame with genji is that i have that scan from the nexus challenge in hots. and i have it on xbox one where it's not very common.
"so please, vote for your local candy crush denier, mr not-deadpool."
live in town of 1000 can confirm 10 computers would be 1.5 computers for every staff member across town. server haha they use the isps email domain i should one day upgrade them to thier own... one day. they're talking about joining the whole area into a sort of city which if we take 100 miles by 60 miles will net us about 3000 people. then watch out we will be practically a city. kinda
as someone who had it "fix" his intenet connection yesterday for it to just do the same (reddit loads, gmail doesn't) today (which i fixed myself by using google's dns) that's not exactly an extra problem compared to win systems. having people that know the system is what makes the difference.
imagine being an irate customer who is angry at the mayor and insists the manager fire him, and the manager is all like "i can't fire our towns mayor, it would be bad publicity" or some bs like that.
if he was in the military he could be major mayor
most small town mayors don't get paid at all. i live in a town of almost 40,000 people and our mayor doesn't make a dime.
everyone means well. boston needs the money for infrastructure repair and construction, solving backlogs of crime, helping the homeless, and so on. they don't use extra tax money to buy themselves yachts and light cigars with hundred dollar bills. still, it might not be a good thing.
he lives in bedford, which barely counts as upstate. but still, pretty close!
where are we doing this mayor meetup bar crawl? armory? tipp hill?
i went to buffalo for grad school. took me 10 days to figure out what wny meant.
i mean, like no shit... of course, the fucking public servant is the kind of person who plays support. keep doing based science's work son.
yeah, i was hedging my bets, but the town that size that i have relatives in has like two computers.
"let me talk to the manager!" "i'll do you one better. here's the mayor."
"major major had been born too late and too mediocre. some men are born mediocre, some men achieve mediocrity, and some men have mediocrity thrust upon them. with major major it had been all three. even among men lacking all distinction he inevitably stood out as a man lacking more distinction than all the rest, and people who met him were always impressed by how unimpressive he was."
no benefits at all. i can almost guarantee. our small town pays slightly more, but definitely no benefits.
as someone who actually lives in upstate ny, bedford is not upstate. westchester county is only "upstate" to people who barely ever leave manhattan and long island. peekskill or rockland county is about as far south as you can get and still be even remotely "upstate."
maybe ernest is just an outsider who is concerned?
it's just gonewild. girls gone wild is a series of vhs tapes sold in the 90s and early 2000s of women flashing the camera on spring break, primarily sold late at night on tv via mini infomercial.
i am 99% sure he is in the new york state local retirement system, and as such is in the state system and when will have a small pension when he retires. source: i work for nys and have experience in dealing with retirement in small towns and villages
it essentially guarantees the spot will always be held by someone who is independently wealthy, but i like our current mayor so i have no complaints for now.
many a young man's first experience with fapping matterial, those ads. i wouldn't be surprised if more than a handful of people commenting here right now couldn't rattle off the channels & regularly scheduled timeslots for those infomercials. like maybe ch.62, 1:30am on saturdays, or something like that.
i dunno but comedy central after 11pm west coast got me a bunch of times. step up from the sears catalogue i used when i started, i'll tell you what.
there was one where i went back to nic cage's house, and we'd had a few drinks, we were playing pool and he accidentally knocked over his prehistoric cave bear skull and smashed it. and he was really upset about it, and the next day went and buried it in a field.
it was an accident! and we were just slipping around on this boat, it was in los angeles in a studio on a boat on rockers, hydraulics, there were wind and rain machines, it was very slippery and chaotic conditions, and it was just an accident, he just slipped and whacked me in the eye and i had about 35 stitches inside and out. just out here, and in here. so the next day we carried on filming and they shot me from the other side in profile to finish the scene. they gave me a suit at the end. i suppose that's compensation.
i once walked onto the wrong set. i was doing lady chatterley's lover, this was in the 90's, and it was like a studio, i had just had my lunch break and i walked back on set into the enchanted garden set, everybody was dressed in the same clothes, i sort of realized i was on the wrong set and wandered off. i was a little bit tired. i just saw all these actors that i didn't know, and i was like "*wait a minute"* - because it all looked the same, except it wasn't my film.
i can't remember any crashes, because we had ex-grand prix racers driving the cars and they were brilliant, some pretty hairy moments going down sidestreets with just an inch next to each side of the car, fast... thrilling.
oh, it's good, it's *great!* especially because it's so popular, it's like, quite unique really. it was such a big hit. but i think i've seen him. i think my head looks a bit square innit.
i've got quite a few, actually. i like chocolate. yeah. i do like chocolate. and i guess it's that and tomato soup.
robert baratheon. he's from yorkshire. that's why. why not aragorn? if robert got ahold of you, he'd crush you. you'd be careful not to get caught.
i'll tell you what i would infiltrate: camden council in london. to find out their plans...
yeah, that happens on occasions, you know? but fortunately there's been nothing too drastic, but they're usually very well-choreographed, very well-thought out. and there are stunt guys, a great bunch of people, very talented bunch, and they know exactly what they're doing. and i feel very safe with them in their company. but yeah, it's good fun, that. someone stabbed someone in sharpe, and it went through his body. that was on film as well! it was one of the early sharpes, eagle or rifle, maybe, in russia in the crimea, and the sword actually went like that *gestures to midsection* he was alright but it was a pretty shocking moment, because there were no hospitals around there, no ambulances, so if you got injured, it was pretty bad. but i've cut my hand open, you just kind of get on with the job, i split my knuckles open and got 5-6 stitches in them, on a set, and i went back and got back into the scene. i mean, that's not a big deal.
i wasn't familiar with it really, i'd heard of the writer and his books, but it was kind of a new experience for me. and i read the books, and i guess that was it, really.
we did a good scene with me and viggo, where we just sat together chatting about our past and where we grew up and where we came from, you know, discussing how much was at stake at that particular point in the film. i always remember that. i enjoyed working with viggo very much, i enjoyed working with everyone, but viggo and i got on very well together.
i think it was all a dream. i didn't die? that's probably why i don't remember.
i still play the piano a little bit, not very much, i wish i had kept it going you know? but it's just time i suppose. but perhaps i'll get some piano lessons when i get back to london and see if i can resurrect the little i did know, i'm not very good, but i do try. and i guess chopin is my favourite, chopin and j.s. bach.
hahaha! they've not, i've seen people with t-shirts on, and i've said it myself. wait, i guess they have. a few too many drinks, and one says "one does not simply this" or "one does not simply that." it's a line i say in lord of the rings, innit? one does not simply walk into mordor. it's a great line because you can apply anything to it. it's immortalized.
as a student at the university of sheffield, broomhill friery holds a very special place in my heart. you haven't lived till you've bought a boromir burger at 4am absolutely smashed.
i got a watch, they gave me a watch at the end, an omega watch, which needs repairing in case anybody out there... and it's inscribed on the back "issued to sean bean, 006" and i think it's 1995. yeah! and that's right on the back.
yes. boromir. i kissed her, but i think i was her enemy? sheffield united f.c.!
probably in the woodlands, in a wood. i kind of like gardening, i like being outdoors in the garden and nature around me, wildlife.
i guess the humor, the people, and the particular blend of humor more than anything.
probably - you just reminded me actually, i need to trim it tonight. well i do! probably every 4-5 days.
i think villains are kind of the more juicy parts, you can kind of get way with murder (literally) but it's been fun playing martin in legends because he's a bit of both really. he uses quite brutal methods to achieve his aims, but he's a good guy.
i've got a couple of swords, quite a few swords actually. one of my favorite ones is my sharpe sword, which is an original cavalry sword from the late 19th century.
yeah, that'd be good. that's be good fun. i've never ridden a dragon before!
i used to get his fan mail, actually! i think they had the wrong address. i have gotten a couple of letters meant for mr. bean aka rowan atkinson. these letters would say things like "you're so funny, you make me laugh, with your big rubbery face" and i would say "you can't mean me!" whenever i call people up and they say "who's calling" and i say "mr. bean" and you can hear people giggling on the other end of the phone... he's got a lot to answer for, that rowan atkinson.
1) neck of lamb, which has been kind of stewed for a few hours. that's what me mum used to make. it's *gorgeous*, very kind of tender and just melts in your mouth. 2) superhero, oh god... i was thinking thor.
1) i did apologize to frodo, didn't i? or i told somebody to tell him i was sorry. and fuck jon snow. 2) that's a terrible question! i want to stay alive, and thrive!
i suppose the closest i came is a horses' hoof landed on my head. and it did actually! when i was filming sharpe. and i injured my neck, and i was pretty close, yeah. you can see it on film, yeah. it was a series called sharpe, yeah. sharpe's justice, i think.
oh that was one of the most exciting experiences of my life! it was a real, just, it was unbelievable. it was an incredibly fantastic just to be on the pitch wearing a sheffield united kit, trying to score penalties! my grandad and my father were there, in the crowd, so i was kind of waving at them. sheffield was playing manchester united in the fa cup, and we all went onto the pitch at halftime to kind of play a bit of foot and take some penalties, it was full of 45,000 people, and i think the teams were waiting to come on after the sendoff, and they couldn't get me off the pitch. i was so exhilarated. so we were holding back sheffield united and manchester united. the referee was getting a bit pissed off. i just didn't want to leave the pitch. the crowd was good, yeah! especially from the sheffield united fans, and i am eternally grateful for that. and the manchester united fans were a good lot, a good bunch.
i don't know, ongoing hopefully! you should tune, *all* of you!
i guess that would be sharpe, you know? the napoleonic soldier. and thank you very much!
well, it's a complex story, of a man trying to discover who he is, where he's from, what his previous life was. he gets flashbacks and he's trying to put the pieces together. and i guess that's why you see him in various different roles, various times of his life, and he's been told that he's not who he thinks he is. it's a psychological thriller with action. it comes from the characters, it's not action for the sake of action, people find themselves in very desperate situations. it's a very fast moving thriller.
i guess mark addy, i see him on occasions. it's a funny job actually, because you're all thrown together for an intense period of time, and then everybody goes home, it's a strange business in that way. but we always bump into each other from various productions, on the same kind of circuit.
yes, that was great, a great experience working with the wachowksis. because they both direct together, you know? it's fascinating to see them work. it's just a wonderful world they've created, very surreal, magical sometimes, corrupt universe. it's very detailed. it's difficult as i've not seen the finished product yet, but it was a wonderful experience to work on! it comes out in february, i think.
it was a bbc drama called joey and spansky. i was about 23. yeah.
occasionally we bump into each other, you know, doing our rounds. yeah. i bump into viggo occasionally, or orlando bloom.
i suppose as victoria said, someone's approached me in a pub and asked me if i'd come and live in their house. i said "when?" glasses, wallet, chapstick, moneyclip. i'm not reading any books at the moment, which i don't know why, because i like reading books, but i'm probably going to go and buy one now. and me favourite book, it's an old book, called the world of little foxy, by norman smithson, and it's about this young lad, you know, young kid growing up in yorkshire, all the fun and frolics he gets up to. just a really nice, cheerful book.
i filmed in the crimea, which was in 1992, which at that time, i think, the berlin wall was just coming down, so it was quite a turbulent time, so many good memories there, of all the cast and crew that i worked with. it was quite a wonderful experience. it was pretty basic, and you'd get home at night, and it was like staying in a sanitarium they'd converted into a hotel, you'd find a lot of cockroaches in your bath, yeah. and we'd get food parcels sent out, suitcases full of food, because the food was so... i don't know, just a load of slop, like dog meat, you know? so we'd send out for biscuits, these meals that kind of astronauts have in foil packets and we were surviving on that. it was really 'ard but really funny at the same time. i was there for 6 months every year for 3 years. i guess i lived there for 3 years. i sometimes see daragh o'malley and john tams. i don't see them as often as i'd like to, but they're good pals. we went through a lot together.
no, i did know i was going to get it, at the end. and i signed on anyway, because it was such a good part.
i don't know?! i mean, how am i supposed to know? does anybody know? i don't think he's *mine.*
did they just sort of walk in? it's 'cause they're so small.
yes, i think that was a possibility some years ago, but unfortunately it never came to fruition. but it would have been interesting, and very exciting.
i start from scratch, yes. i guess you draw upon life experiences, people or characters that you've met in the past, it comes from lots of different areas, but the idea is to draw upon endless ideas. i think there's a bit of everyone in everyone, you know? we all take things from other people, and they all kind of rub off on us.
i guess they're different mediums, they both have their pros & cons, you know? but i would like to do more theater, it's just that sometimes it takes quite a while and it's very intense, but it's a big thrill, it's exciting doing live drama. and i did perform in romeo & juliet, i was tybalt, but i didn't have any leather on. that was hugh quarshie. but it was a modern day production, yeah, and that was at the royal shakespeare company back in 1985, 86, sometime around then.
it was a bit strange, yeah, a bit creepy. we just kicked it around like a football!
if i played dungeons & dragons... i'd come up with my own, yeah.
that would be interesting, but mr. bean would need to be 20 years younger.
that's going to confuse the hell out of an archeologist someday.
at least it didn't happen when you were about to shoot a nude scene, right?
and tinned custard. with bananas. and i guess that's it really! i love milk, as well.
not fat robert though right? i mean he probably has a pretty good body slam but that's about it
i'd be more shocked if they actually had any plans.
hey, thanks for the response man! much love and good luck to you!
it was only in the extended editions. i was so glad boromir got more scenes in the extended editions. he was the most interesting characters out of the fellowship. he was conflicted, and i felt bad for him, and at the same time, he was a badass who could take on a ton of orcs and die a good death.
ah yes, that legendary kind of family tree of the starks.
one does not simply approach sean bean and say 'one does not simply'
"nasty shock" nominated understatement of the century
/r/watches would *kill* for a couple pictures mr. bean.
thankyou sean. you can't beat yorkshire folk eh? well you can but they'll beat you harder.
official petition for undead ned to ride a dragon in ados. sign below.
"yeah, sean? good to talk. we'd like to see you in our upcoming film, 'the odyssey.' yes, we think you'd be a great cyclops."
sean bean just said "fuck jon snow". why does my life feel so complete right now?
well thank you. i'd also like to ask mr. bean if it's weird to be called mr. bean...because of rowan atkinson.
the irony that sharpe was just about the only thing in which you didn't die
top man, it looked wicked fun. i remember the crowd going wild everytime you scored one - i did too, and i'm a man utd fan!
one does not simply ignore an order from sean bean.
thanks for being sharpe. i enjoyed being one of the sharpe chefs, and made good friends all because you were sharpe.
so it's the bourne trilogy with sean bean? cuz i'm fucking *down* for that.
i hold that that boromir death is the best scene of the trilogy
have you ever bumped into pierce brosnan to have a drink "for england"?
what i've learned from this ama is that sean bean should host a cooking show.
if you could smash bieber with the horn of gondor, would you?
and we're all glad for you taking it! i couldn't imagine anyone else playing ned.
of course jon snow isn't his son, else he would be jon bean.
that's the problem with hobbits, they always try and walk it in....
of course he knew. when does sean bean ever survive for more than one season?
and milkshakes. mmm. mashed potatoes. *yeah*. meat & potato pie with gravy. like a cornish pasty. with henderson's relish, *yes.* that's very important to me. it is!
yeah, the robert during the rebellion was massive and a beast.
in the brad pitt ww 2 tank movie, "fury", an actor accidentally stabbed a stuntman with a bayonet. apparently, he thought it was a dummy.
i mean, with that description i was able to know exactly which tree sean was referring to.
watching him in sharpe is really surreal. there are so many instances where sharpe *should* die, especially since he's played by sean bean--but he doesn't
i can't upvote this enough. i could get big points with my husband if i could show him *sean bean's* freaking watch!
i'm at work and just said *yessssss* with a fist in the air.
don't forget troy! still waiting on that adaptation of the odyssey with sheffield's finest...
we have pasties in michigan (of the cornish variety).
what was gandalf thinkin' sending in frodo that early?
this makes all the chain comments about food that much more hilarious. "wait a second, can we go back to that question about ice cream? i need to change my answer."
let's make this easier. what do you not consider to be a comfort food?
well, geez, i don't like stupid people either but i don't go around stabbin' 'em.
gotta be the only club in the world you need a dedicated pair of shoes for, ahh sheffield, hoping for more of the same this year
karl is from manchester and i guess you can call him a typical northener.
that's also why he keeps saying "innit" and ends his sentences with "yeah" and so on. we seeing a transcription of the way sean bean talks, i doubt he would include those (so much) if he was typing himself. it's pretty neat though, it feels more like a tv/radio interview than a text one.
"was that the one with the little guy with the ring or the little guy with the whores?"-sean bean
and the real reason why the internet loves sean bean comes out. he is a cat in a man's body. this might also explain why it sucks to watch him die so often :(
i'm not sure what i'm more unsurprised by. the fact that somebody did an asoiafbot command here, or that somebody faked a legit-styled response. either way, i love both of you.
"my cousin thinks nedders wouldn't do that so it's clearly not his."
he's died in movies so many times, he's immortal in real life.
there is a huge fan theory going around debating who are the real jon's parents and the theory itself is pretty solid with a ton of proof, and now sean has confirmed it in one of the answers below. so yes, ned did raise jon and love him but jon's also a lie ned's been living with for 14 years. pm me if you're interested in the theory.
yes, but you've got to step it up if you want to beat john hurt!
that would be a good hook to it. he dies in his kitchen at the end of every meal in a unique way via various kitchen implements.
the graphics were amazing for it's time. the game was from 1997 and well, there wasnt much better than a brand spanking new n64 in that time.
this is correct. such a nobhead, and he looked like richard ashcroft which annoyed me because i liked the verve
tinfoil hat wearers? it is the most likely theory.
goddamnit george, enough with writing about manderly's meals
somewhere in his attic he has a portrait of a mangled corpse that once resembled his face. it bears the marks of all the times he got shot, stabbed, or decapitated on screen.
these are english words but why the fuck can't i understand you?
also, the shortened version of his first name is thor. that guy was literally born for it.
i'm american and have been married to my english wife for six years and i still barely understand her. when she's angry she sounds like yosemite sam saying harry potter spells.
the fire of my hatred burns bright and long. it's been...hmm...16 years. i still hate that guy
this is my favorite description of anything ever. i would pay good money to hear a voice actor recreate this.
i hate him because of your passion, fuck that nob.
1. i have actual plans and policy to solve our problems 2. i in now way shape or form intend to shut down the internet 3. i have way better hair
it would just be paul 2016, saves space, we're trying to be conservative here.
well rand paul is very against the nsa program but not sure how he feels about whistleblowers.
the national debt. it's why i ran for office. it's why i'm running for president. we have to get it under control.
i come from an intellectual tradition that values liberty. i love reading hayek, mises, and rothbard. i started a reading program for my interns in the senate with books from these thinkers. we sit down and discuss them as a group each semester.
yes, he sponsors legislation in the senate to declassify the 28 pages.
it should bernie vs paul. i'm afraid that it will end up hillary vs trump. which is a lose lose for most people.
fighting for liberty does make you really hungry so yeah we do.
thank you! the first thing you have to do is have a plan. i've written detailed 5 year budget plans that have spending cuts in every department. we have to reverse what's going on in congress. the left and the right make deals: the left gets more welfare spending and the right gets more military spending. it's going to take the leadership of a president who isn't afraid to cut spending across the board.
i would remove prohibition of cannabis from federal law and give authority back to the states to decide.
so thankful that he didn't debate in the undercard, seeing him on the same stage as fiorina and santorin struggling to stay relevant would have broken his campaign.
eventually with socialism you run out of other peoples money. also, what bernie seems to not realize is that all of these new programs, taxes, and regulations have a real effect on everyday people and their wallets.
glad to see this question. one that i think all candidates should be pressured to articulate, preferably not in an environment where they're going to be interrupted like a televised debate.
when the gmo scientists refuse to make 100 duck sized horses.
rand paul said earlier that he is in favor for some level of environmental regulations but does believe it does go too far. he said on the daily show if he could vote on the cleanwater act he would have voted for it today.
i'm running for president. i hear the current president didn't answer this vital question. we should expect more out of the next president. obviously the answer is 100 duck sized horses.
if you are a student and only working a part time job your federal withholding tax should be minimal and most of it returned to you as a refund when you file.
how hard was it to only come up with 3 key differences?
so you don't like their pool parties at our embassies? are you anti-fun?
double the fun, double the excitement - double the paul!
i think you're the only candidate i've heard mention the national debt, which is incredibly sad. it's a huge issue. big fan btw.
id pay good money just to listen in on those discussions, that sounds amazing.
hmm. two politicians of character debating policy and fact? never gonna happen.
to be fair to bernie the democratic national committee banishes him from all future debates this cycle if he does a non-sanctioned debate. the two party system is all kinds of messed up.
i love that this is the first thing he responds to.
the 3 best congressmen we have mike lee is up there too!
that's because both parties work together to give the general public a giant enema
crimes were never meant to be addressed on a federal level in the first place, the fact that this was a law in the first place is a joke. love you, rand
so those rumors were true? lmao i think you might be more frugal than anything else
ironically i find other republicans who accuse you of being isolationist, like carly fiorina who would stop lines of communication with foreign countries, isolationists themselves.
in an age where brash political comments garner a lot of press, i'm a little sad to see that paul didn't trash talk fox, the other candidates, and the debate to some extent in order to make a bigger splash with his exit. if you see this, rand, you are a very polite and intelligent man, and our country desperately needs someone like you to reform it, but sometimes i wish you'd be a little more forceful with your campaign!
bold move coming to reddit and saying that. i like it.
hey senator, i really appreciate you doing this ama. i actually just started medical school back in june of last year, and i have started getting more and more exposure to the healthcare system since. one thing that has really stuck out to me is that private insurance companies seem to be getting between doctors and their patients, and higher co-pays are a barrier to a lot of people trying to access the care they need. my question is: do you think that bureaucracy and interference from private insurance companies are equally problematic as government interference, and if so, what would be a good way you would like to address it? anyway, like i said, thank you for doing this ama. i really appreciate you fighting for what you believe in, and you are a breath of fresh air in american politics, even if i don't always agree with you. thanks :)
yes, it was mandatory or face a fine and discipline. that rule applied to every speaker who came to lu, i should mention, be it cruz, sanders, or other politicians, pastors, etc. thankfully they just changed the rule so you can skip.....once.
you answered the duck/horse question. you're officially a cool ama reddit guest.
all you'd have to do is switch her position on abortion, and she'd be a middle of the road republican in the 90's.
if you want to know more about rand paul's tax plan, we have a mega-thread coming on /r/randpaul with that information
i also have a part time job and am in school, and i get all of my income taxes back. not sure what this guy is talking about either
it must have been very hard. his first one literally covers the fact that rand is qualified and understands what is going on, and trump like his hair is all air.
he seems that way because he's actually smart enough to know a little about his audience before doing an iama.
he's supported awbs and stuff in the past. he's just saying what his party wants to hear these days; there's no reason to believe him on this issue and every reason to doubt him.
more than a few people just google'd *"isis pool parties at us embassies"*
trump has actually; i don't want to be that guy, but he has talked about it on numerous occasions.
seriously. record the sessions and post as a podcast. i'd tune in every quarter!
to be totally honest, the bush/gore 2000 debates were actually pretty substantial on policy.
i disagree with paul on a lot, but he is the best damn republican up there.
pretty sure the gop does that as well, something came up when cruz challenged obama (?) to a debate on immigration.
it would be the most refreshing political debates we have seen in a long time.
he clearly understands the intellectual depth of his audience here on reddit.
sen. tammy baldwin of wisconsin, a democrat, was actually the only democrat who voted for it. bernie sanders is officially an independent.
it's complicated, but some crimes were meant to dealt with at the federal level, for example things involving interstate commerce most likely were.
that's what a good politician should do. it's not about pushing down the other parties and creating an enormous rift in the country. it's about bringing ideas together and working on a solution to better the country. the people. our government has become a fricken show on mtv. it's a joke. disagreements are good in a lot of cases, but to lie and deceive and attack other politicians to push your sole narrative? it's downright pathetic.
i would love to see discussion between the two camps, personally. i'm a bernie supporter but i like rand, especially as a kentucky resident. his office has helped my dad's va case when they were giving him the runaround countless times. i think a middle-ground debate would do wonders for this country. everything is so toxic and over-the-top. i want to see two politicians who care about the people talk. i want to see them hash out a plan that works for everyone instead of just saying, "my way or the highway!" would love if /u/randpaulforpresident would check up again on my dad's va case, while i'm bringing it up! so much incompetence costing him his mental health.
marco rubio literally endorsed torture and rates higher than him. ted cruz said he'd commit war crimes with indiscriminate bombing and he's second place.
if you like rand, come check out /r/randpaul where there is daily discussion and news about him
we're going to build a wall and we're going to make gondor pay for it!
wait until you're in practice, have to deal with 20 insurances, each with different reimbursements, worry about which medication works with what insurance for a patient, whether you should be sending to this or that specialty pharmacy, god damn
he really wants to reduce spending across everything. i don't think he wants to increase spending on anything....
would you expect rand the man(d) to drink fake bourbon?
parents will love it. people who pay for college themselves will get little to no benefit since most of us don't make enough to be taxed anyway.
yeah, hugging a member of the opposite sex and r-rated movies were just allowed this semester. tells you all you need to know.
missed kind of a golden opportunity for /r/andpaul didn't you?
follow his twitter, if you don't. rand definitely has his social media campaign on point.
rand paul naive, inexperienced on defense. our military experts agree that one horse sized duck is the better option.
chris christie probably has wet dreams about eating a horse sized duck.
inevitably, one of them would get there last, and normal sized trump would call him a loser and then say he's fired, while all the tiny ones start shouting "you're fired" on a loop like the anchovies in spongebob.
yeah, she's not far off. she waited until the last possible second to finally decide "oh, the people are clearly in favor of gay marriage now? ok then, me too! forget everything i used to say, i'm totally cool now, right?"
yeah, he comes off as human and not just paulbot3000
not only did i just google that, but i did it by copying it from your comment. /r/fightthesystem
he actually hasn't talked about the debt being huge, he's talked about it being yuuuuuge!
because the numbers are high, duh. haven't you ever been to usdebtclock.org ?
yeah, make it one of the interns jobs to set it all up and post the episodes.
it would literally be a republican billionaire debating socialist democratic.
how is that even legal? we should absolutely have an opportunity to hear these people argue politics without it being scripted by main stream media
yeah tammy! as a born and raised madisonian i was very happy to see her go from my representative in the house to one of my senators. now if we could just get rid of that jack ass johnson.
if i'm not mistaken, rand has actually sponsored a bill that makes reading mandatory before voting on a bill.
the thing is, you shouldn't need a law to do things like that. freedom isn't granted by law.
technically not legalizing, just allowing states to treat it like alcohol.
have a little faith, in canada we had the same with trudeau, and well, he did win with a majority!
trump is saying the only bad thing about our nuclear triad is that we don't use them enough.. all the rest are all hawks also
we're calling for a temporary ban on uruk-hai until we figure out what's going on.
lots of people delete their own comments if they start getting down boated into morrowind. i'm pretty sure unreddit isn't exposing the thousands of agenda-driven deletes the mods are making (while wearing eye patches and twirling their black pencil-thin mustaches, of course).
the dnc and rnc are private organizations, they can allow whoever they want to their debates. you can call it unfair, but it definitely isn't close to illegal.
woah, you must really dislike singer-songwriter music.
the original didn't seem that bad when i saw it. basically it gave the nsa authority to collect specifically on foreign targets- not u.s. citizens. i mean if you want them to collect on legitimate, hostile, foreign threats, then they need legal authority to do so, and this was the document to provide that. that said- and i'm not a legal expert- but they've seemingly intentionally misconstrued it and overstepped their bounds.
ultimately, the only thing government does is give back rights it took away.
probably better than alcohol. iirc the federal government has a lot of strings attached to highway money regarding state alcohol/tobacco laws.
trump also called out iraq for being a mistake and said he'd be willing to work with putin. he also, along with john kasich, refused to say he'd tear up the deal with iran (although claimed he'd "get a better one"). trump is too unpredictable to ascribe anything to him.
rohan? let's talk about rohan. i love rohan, but rohan is beating us in everything.
why were they built with a gate that opens from the inside?
the thing is: we might seem as some kind of utopia because on the one hand, most people are used to just rely on the government(s) to fix everything while on the other hand, we enjoy the innovation that free markets like the usa introduce to us. i personally believe (might be wrong, but empirically i think it's pretty obvious) that things like facebook, youtube, google, or even reddit could not have happened in an economic environment like the one i live in. so in some messed up way we have the best of two worlds.
a bigger question would be why is politics in america governed by two private entities?
yup, states can have a lower drinking age than 21, but if it's lower, then they lost 10% of their highway funding. i think a few states tried to hold out, but they didn't last long because of that lack of funding. in my opinion, it's absolutely ridiculous for the federal government to essentially coerce the states into doing this.
'cause they didnt, asatj needs to bone up on his magic wall building. sauron built it.
best of two worlds except that your economic sysrem, as you pointed out, does not incentivize creativity or hard work and the only real job is with the government. that sounds like hell to me
what is a combination of the electoral college and first past the post voting? mr. trebek!
i think the states should individually be free to do what they want with alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana. i agree that its pretty unreasonable for all the power to be in the federal governments hands.
tell me about it, i'm the one actually working a government job, when people come to me for shit i feel like the mob. "either you play by our rules or i'm sending my boys (police) to fuck your shit up." it's getting to me.
unfortunately, congress uses the interstate commerce clause to do all sorts of things which are technically constitutional, but shouldn't be. this is an example of one of those things.
do you have a pitchfork that i can drink wine out of?
my all time favorite sketch for key and peele would have been *michael jackson halloween*. it was one of the first sketches where we just kind of said, "alright, let's just do it." it wasn't about the lines so much as it was about literally making jordan laugh, and then hearing him pepper these one liners back at me, which was really just very free pure joy. i really enjoyed that sketch.
my man ozmataz buckshank. or ohshank as our friends call him.
it just happened two minutes ago. i came out of the bathroom on our break, and someone just yelled it. and i said, "what is your name sir?" he said, "bartholomew." so, very often. it happens very very often. it's interesting when people just say it, because i go "that's not my name..." but they feel free. it makes them feel good, so who am i to stop them?
question 1: you know, it's such a mess. this election is such a surreal dystopian fiction, that i don't know if we can bring any more absurdity to what's going on already. so i'm actually glad that we got out when we did. otherwise, we would have to be watching everything and i don't...i can't watch this stuff.
yeah, i mean we were very nervous going into it because we were such big fans of the film, and it's kind of like, why would we be in this? why would you put key and peele in this? would we not be distracting? and when we got there, noah hawley - the guy who created the show and is the showrunner - he's such a genius. he has a real patience and poise to him. i think we kind of figured it out as we were there. now as far as stories go, we were in calgary, and it was freezing.
first off, well integrated, based off some of the themes that take place in *keanu*. i don't think that there's a risk. we're gonna be together for a long time, but we have already made concerted efforts to go out and do things in our own voice. i'm not too terribly concerned. the things that we're doing that are different than *key and peele* are so varied, and so different, that you've got to understand that we're two separate entities.
you know, it wasn't as calculated as a lot of people think. there's definitely the fact that the movie is a love letter to movies. we do love keanu, we love movies like *point break* and *speed*, and we wanted to put these characters in an action world. really, it all came a moment where when we came up with the idea of the kitten it was the first name that came to my head, because i love names that only have one connotation. once you say you're gonna put a kitten in it, and the kitten's name is keanu, from that point forward it's a done deal. it wasn't too calculated.
it's hard to measure. we'll see how rewarding it is when the checks start coming in!
well last night i was so exhausted when i fell asleep, you know what i'm talking about? i fell asleep, just gonna say that. i slept so hard, like i slept so hard. my slumber last night really put the pussy on the chainwax.
we really wanted to make a movie for us. we didn't pitch this movie. one of the key & peele writers, alex rubins, and myself wrote this on spec. so, we basically created what was to us the perfect key & peele movie and we wrote the whole thing, the first draft, without a kitten in it. and then we realized we needed something to bring us in and bring the heart to the movie, so we came up with this idea of this kitten that wears a do-rag and we put it on the poster and everybody who doesn't know key & peele would hopefully have to go see the kitten do-rag movie. besides that, any movie that we've ever really laughed at is a movie that we've cared about the characters. so, keanu is a way for the audience to reaaally, reaaally root for our character through the whole arc.
that's a great question. seven kittens were used in the film interchangeably. neither of us adopted any, but of the seven i understand that three of them have been adopted by members of our crew, and then the other four as far as i know now live on the farm where trainers live with all of the other wonderfully intelligent and well cared for stunt animals.
as with all amas, the best question is sitting right in the middle. never to be answered.
not a lot of pranks! we're sorry to say that we've never had a big enough budget to screw around! never had time to screw around. we just get right down to it.
are cats really big on reddit? is that a thing? i'm not quite seeing the connection, but, you know like we said, we wanted to...there's a lot of gangsters that have exotic pets; this is a phenomenon. apparently, there was a guy in the bronx who had a tiger in his bathroom, and so that was some of the idea we were jumping off of to make method man's character cheddar be a guy that collected a bunch of animals. he also has a snake in the movie. he has a boa constrictor or a python. and then he has keanu, who is of course the least fierce animal. but, put him in a dew rag and a gold chain, and he's a badass.
and if you say peele and key really fast, it kind of sounds like *peelenke*. which is probably some russian word.
i always appreciated that the first two guests to arrive were ted and annette. cool little ghostbusters shout out.
remember that one, where he was in the jungle? and that dude came out with the dreadlocks and no mouth? and the vagina face? that was my jam.
as an aaron i just want to tell you you ruined my life
i would go with martin lawrence and steve martin. steve martin lawrence.
not necessarily. what if keanu is part of the rescue party in the sequel? "that's my friend, biiiiiitch!"
twelve degrees below zero, all day every day, to be exact.
i think either one of us could have had a show on comedy central, and when we realized that the other one was also down to do a sketch show, we realized it was a force multiplier. so...no. not afraid of that.
get down to principal oh-shag-hennessy's office and tell him what you did.
i know a jake who works at target. red shirt and khakis are the uniform. that poor guy.
insubordinate and churlish is a common phrase in my house. if my husband and myself start to bicker, tossing that out there pretty much always relieves the tension!
we'll say that batman, no servo suit. it's good old-school batman.
oh come on the name was a joke at john wick. a guy single-handedly takes down the mob because they killed his dog? it just screams parody movie! please confirm if john wick had anything to do with the naming.
no, it's extremely rewarding to have made a film. we're huge movie fans, as you can tell from our show. we constantly love to move between all the film genres that we adore. the press for a movie is a real whirlwind, and it's a little bit like touring in a band for a couple weeks.
and i would say a thought process for comedy is always think in juxtapositions. you have the most vulnerable, fluffy, cute thing in the world and the majority of our movie takes place on the gritty streets and in a dank, grimy strip club with a bunch of gangsters. so, you're taking kittens and gangsters and mixing them together. or you're taking nerdy guys who have to pretend they're assassins, guys who've never handled a gun are pretending to be the two greatest assassins in the world. so, you just take opposites and you smash them together and you use juxtapositions to make people giggle. to make people say, "oh my god that's ridiculous, how's that happening?!" so, if you're writing comedy, to think in that way is always helpful.
and tiffany haddish, she plays hi-c in the film, is one of the adopting parents of the cats.
as with all reddit threads, the best username is a raunchy anus reference
and also, not to be too calculating, but the most popular thing on the internet is cats. and cats doing crazy things. so, in a manner of speaking, the movie could be looked at as a two-hour cat video, with even more extraordinary things taking place. so hopefully, that would translate into millions and millions and millions of people coming to see the movie. that's the most commerce-driven answer i could possibly give.
was it hard working with the kittens? as hard as, say, corralling a herd of cats?
it is russian actually, there's no direct translation to english but it roughly means, "don't put the banana peel before the solution. "
do you have a link to a completely legit buying source? i may be in the market for one
you know man, i like the one where he was the second one when he was the computer monster, and he was talking about, "i'm here right now, but i will be back as well." that's like the greatest line that was ever in a movie ever.
at this point i've just learned to live with it. everyone calls me a-a-ron and that's what i respond to. i will forever be known as a-a-ron. my friends even introduce me to people as a-a-ron. k&p don't know how much they have impacted my life.
i'm going to go on a limb and say that nobody wants a stranger's finger, who's previous location was unknown (ear, nose, butt, etc.), in their face.
yeah, i remember the first scene we shot was our first scene in it, where billy bob is going up through the building shooting, and afterward we find that somebody's been thrown out of one of the windows on the ground. and between every single take, the guy on the ground had to get up and go warm up off in a van; it was *that* cold.
we're doing well. and we've been on our press tour promoting the movie, but right now we are buoyed, our energy is buoyed by the presence of reddit. so i think we're feeding off of their energy.
he should change his name tag to "heard it already."
like adam west batman? he's gonna make ironman laugh?
they were writing the movie before john wick even came out
plus the internet loves cats so you're tapping into a huge fan base just because of the cat. i mean i'm going to be honest and say the cat is the main reason why i'll watch the movie.
i don't know that it's even in my top ten, the keanuosaurus.
they were driving very far away to say biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitch
if the beginning and the end of the scene did not exist, i have no qualms about living in negrotown for the rest of my life.
i believe the closest english idiom is "put the pussy on the chainwax."
"i don't know, uh, googly-eyed gremlin?" "but you do know, because you talking about a gremlin whose sole purpose in this film is just that he looks stupid as fuck? yes it can be in the movie and it definitely is in the movie!"
but it says at the end of the sketch that those things were all in the movie.
ha! but really, he caught his wedding ring on something and degloved his finger. totally gross. :/
can i just say it's awesome that you guys are answering questions even 9 hours later? one of the coolest amas in a while.
i got mine off of aliexpress. never had a problem with them. have ordered a few times. just takes like 5-6 weeks to get to you.
haven't even passed the first section of the top comments, already my favorite ama
i remember there was one point in time where this poor gentleman was on the ground shaking because he was laying on the bare cement, twelve degrees below zero, and the director walked up to him, and was very kind, but he said, "i am so sorry, but is there any way you can not shiver when you're laying there as a dead body? i'm gonna need you to not shiver." which was crazy!
trying being a guy sharing the name of a jewelry store and a child molester now. hahhahah he went to jared haahahah fuck.
i'm thinking michael keaton batman; robert downey, jr., tony stark.
no but check out keanu reeves's new movie "mittens", april 29th.
i got up, i got some coffee, i filled it right up to the perfect brim. filling that coffee up with the pussy on the chainwax.
that is not a thing. i just googled it, no results.
bobby lee was always down to do the obnoxious physical stunts whenever mad tv had some big tough action star or wrestler on the show,it made for some great comedy 24 with john cena, high school wrestling against triple h, and the flag football with shawn merriman were all classics
i would have to say my favorite dinosaur...i'm gonna have to go, trike. triceratops.
but, they did say it right? they said ... biiiiiiiiiiitch?
i thought it refers to the trouble-making third pump.
i just love these guys. the back and forth responses make it feel like a bonus.
the other thing that i thought noah did that was so elegant and so wonderful, is that he simply made this new story peripheral to the original story. i think everybody was thinking, "why would you just remake a really great movie?" what he did is, he moved everything about 40 miles down the road, and it was such a simple, ingenious decision; it made all the difference in the world. then it allowed him to do these cool things where he's paying homage to other characters; because the culture is so homogenous, it was just a new story in a homogenous culture that he just moved down the road. it was such a simple, simple answer; such a simple, simple thing.
the heat was on in my house from last night and i just woke up from a nap i'm sweating profusely and it makes me feel anxious and bad but reading that comment, in this state, was like being a part of something so much greater than my lack of comfort.
boy, that's a good question. i'm gonna still go with - if it's regular old batman - i'm going with ironman. more evasive power, always perpetually has armor, and he can attack from far away. and batman's only got the batarangs, maybe he uses the car to his advantage at a certain point in time.
after learning the truth about the mythbusters' offscreen relationship, this is refreshing and makes me happy
you had that surface tension on the top of the cup? brother, that's when you really put the pussy on the chainwax.
i am now, and have always been a fan, of the stegosaurus. i like the little plates on his back.
jordan has strongly encouraged me to start watching "naked and afraid".
the front runner in one party mixed up 9/11 and 7-11, and the front runner in the other party made a joke about "colored people time". ... and that's just within the last week and a half.
i mean, let's be honest. really this is a corporate war. both billionaires.
it's rewarding in a different way. i'd say that there are things that have happened on the show that we were trying to achieve a specific goal and we achieved it. that's something that's very fulfilling. then here, it's the same thing with the cat. so, i'd say that it's apples and oranges. it's equally as rewarding.
i just googled that phrase and there's not a single result. why you lion dog?
oh yeah, we had one of our crew members come and dress like the aerobics meltdown characters, and start dancing with us in the middle of the sketch. but you gotta know the guy to know that that made perfect sense.
a baby riding a kitten that breathes fire. the baby, not the kitten. and then we're just gonna throw tyrion lannister in there, just for good measure.
i think that scene does have an ending because the next step after a display on one's head is the entire store. we know that an entire store on one's head does not end well.
which is good. that's actually not bad. that's the top tier of what i'm puttin' down. then there's *family therapy with dr. jen*. abysmal programming. like a fine wine that's been fermenting in it's own...uffff...
well put, jordan. wayne industries versus stark industries?
it should say something that we left our show to do movies.
yeah, not a lot of practical jokes. the jokes themselves were practical, in as much as that we were taping them.
you guys are joking, but i'd so totally pay good money to see that.
this is one of the best amas of all time due to it. it's like zac braff and donald faison levels except turned up to 11.
i don't know about baby horses, they kind of look creepy when they come out with their little pin legs.
that's true. what we're getting out of maybe making a social point and people saying to us, "hey, you represent us," or, "thank you for making this show. it's made me feel less lonely," or, "it's made me feel like i have something to identify with." that was rewarding. and then here, saying that we can bring some awareness to the plight of animals and hopefully having people adopt them. that's rewarding in a different way.
maybe the most elaborate was convincing keegan that we actually had a show that aired on television, and every wednesday night i would have to go to his house and put a dvd in his television of the stuff that we did.
its like you two are taking this ama as an opportunity to just talk with each other. totally appreciate that actually. still comes out hilarious
that means a lot of people had a lot of free time.
i would like to spread awareness about brain tumors. support the fight against childhood cancer. may is brain tumor awareness month. i'd like for people to support it more especially during that month
just try not to think about what you have. let your family or whoever take care of that. just focus on being a kid. you know who i got that from? m. o. m.
i feel like i get depressed and alone but i always remember that i have people to help me through those moments. and when i remember that, it makes me feel peppy again. that there are people out there that are cheering for me and it helps me not feel alone and conquer what i'm going through. from michelle, keeping him involved with people with similar conditions. like coachart. when you do things with coachart, there are families and kids with similar situations and we get to be together as a group. creating opportunities to share within the foundations we are involved with is an outlet for him to share. it creates a support network gray says i like coachart because it helps me meet people who know how i feel and it makes me feel better because other people really don't know how i feel
hi! just the fact that i'm still here and still going. any time that i'm feeling down and having a bad day, i remember that i'm a brain tumor survivor and that's not by luck. it's a little luck but we've fought hard
just going through treatments one after another after another after. every time i have an mri or surgery, i'm wondering "am i gonna make it or am i gonna die? sometimes i wonder if this is the last one." mom said hardest for gray has been the anxiety and anticipation of going through treatments. that's always been the hardest.
that touched my heart, thank you. skip bo, monopoly deal, and uno attack. this is from joe, i can tell you first hand gray is savage in skip bo
yes i do. the patient is always right. the patient and their parents are always right. listen to your patient's parents and also listen to their parents. don't look at them like they're crazy. just trust them. they know what they're going through more than you would know because that's why they came to you
from michelle, something seemed off. i would say motherly instincts. something seemed off that i couldn't figure out and i would take him to the pediatirition. it was pressure in his head that would build up at night and he couldn't sleep. he would wake up very disoriented. after he would be up for a while, he would be fine. anything that is persistently off, he was symptomatic at four. i didn't get him diagnosed until six. you kind of have to go by developmental milestones. but it's hard to tell at that age and you don't want to take him to the hospital all the time from gray, people thought my mom was crazy. but she was right
i used to feel like god chose me to pick on me. i sort of still feel that way a little bit. everything happens for a reason but i wonder why god chose me to have the brain tumor? michelle says "one day gray said, you know what mom? sometimes, bad things just happen. and not for a reason"
rock and roll! my favorite song to dance to is "i love rock and roll" he just sang out the chorus, too
from michelle - he has diffuse fibrillary astrocytoma throughout the brain and spine. he is not in remission, we do the best we can to manage tumor growth and all the effects through chemo and surgeries
from joe, i actually have a classic gray story. he was beating me pretty bad in skip bo one day, i was completely out-strategized. i said "gray, you know that you are really smart, right?" he responds, "well, i do hang out with a lot of neurosurgeons."
from michelle - mom here. i think the best experience that we have had is when the doctors came in together and reassured us that at that point they did not know for sure what was going on (fever situation) but they were determined to figure it out and not giving up on him. just to let us know that they care.
to not worry. that you're in good hands with your family and your doctors. make sure your family knows that they need to trust what they believe in and not always trust what the doctors say. and your family will always take care of you no matter what you go through
my favorite thing right now is cauliflower rice mixed with eggs and bbq spices. yeaaah
from mom, we actually tried it like five years ago. had to get him a card. we didn't try it as a treatment, we tried it for anti-anxiety and neuro calming effect. at that point, they didn't have all the blends so the amount they were giving was so much that he would be knocked out. that prevents us from being able to maintain accurate neuro status and that's very important
dodgers! i have friends that play on a little league dodgers team so that's why
i have a home schooling teacher that comes to my apartment
i half think people just associate me with cancer. but mostly i think people think i'm a normal kid and look like a normal kid. part of it is because i don't have the typical signs like losing my hair and stuff. it's feels bad when people give me a weird look like they're scared of me when they find out i have cancer. sometimes my doctors focus on the bad even though i know they are just doing their job and trying to make me better. sometimes i don't like being at the hospital because of the negativity. sometimes i feel poisoned with negativity. outside of the hospital i feel like i can breathe. the negativity is like smog and i'm breathing in the smog. it feels nice and good not to have negative thoughts
donate all to brain tumor research. to find cures for brain tumors
super mario bros for the nintendo ds. i play food games on my ipad. cake mania is one
that's my bling. the bracelets remind me of a special moment or special person. the ring i made out of a milk carton cap. every pirate has rings so i have to have a ring
my mom did the same thing. i just wanna say i personally support your decision completely
just listen to your patients and make sure that you do things the way they want them. every kid is different
from michelle - mom here. i think what i have learned to do is feed off of gray's mode. if he is angry then i use the anger to fuel good things. fight fire with fire. no pity party. focus on what he can do to encourage positive momentum. acknowledge a bad day for what it is whether physically or emotionally, but then move on. sometimes all i can do or say is "i am sorry you are having a bad day" or "what can i do to help?"
i've got a single friend who works in hospice, and you guys are the best. it's a job that i could never bring myself to do, but i have the utmost respect for you people. keep fighting the good fight.
zootopia for movie and young justice for tv show. it's like the justice league but they're kids. so like, martian manhunter's daughter and the flash's son
the thing that nurses do right is to listen to their patients and how they like things done. nurses do wrong talking about medical stuff in front of the patient instead of talking to the family outside the room. that's my preference
i know a brain tumor can kill me. but knowing that i'm doing so well and better and can beat the brain tumor. it's like being in a war, you can't win the war but can win the battle. feels great to get better. like a miracle
if you watch the video, you'll realise that he has the mind of a 6 year old. i don't think he is/was competent enough to make this decision.
let's make some of that come true and upvote u/drunken_economist post to the top!
fantastic answer. i can imagine how a kid would feel like they were carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders.
this is super touching. no questions from me but this inspired me to donate to coachart today. i'm sure many others are going to do the same based on this.
neuroendocrine cancers (carcinoid tumors) are notorious for metastases... although the melanoma is probabably unrelated (but i haven't worked in onco in years). my guess is the internal cancers were all metastatic carcinoid and the melanoma is just bad luck. always always always wear sunscreen and avoid overexposure to uv light!
we've tried with sporadic success, but more often than not it doesn't really do much for her. no chemo/radiation for her, the most was sandostatin, but the nausea is a thing due to the damage from the surgeries. phenergan doesn't even work.
another answer from mom here - gray did have the oral temodar. it was not effective for his tumor so we only did it six months. it was hard to tell at the time because he was having so many pressure issues if the nausea and vomiting was from chemo or hydrocephalus. because his tumor could not be completely resected and he was not a candidate for radiation we have almost always had to rely on chemotherapy agents. temodar was not easy but it could have been everything combined. wishing you all the best in your journey.
that number is incredibly scary. keep fighting the odds and stay strong. you're an incredible inspiration.
fortune favors the bold. gray, you truly are an inspiration and i have no doubt that your positivity will have a huge impact on not only your friends and family, but this community and countless others as well. keep being an amazing person!
thank you. hugs to you and especially your mom. she must love you a lot!
amazinggray. i want to say your story really touched me. it is truly incredible the heart and soul you possess. thank you for this post. anyway, i see you have an interest in games. well, i do not know if you are aware, but there is whole new world of modern board games. many of them pirate themed. i would like to send you one, for yourself and the other kids in treatment. i think you guys could have a lot of fun with it. if this interests you, please send me a pm. i can try and have it there by christmas.
i dont really have a question, but want to say your story gives me hope. my dad is getting his first dose of chemo as i post this. he has stage 4 colon cancer that has mets to his liver and peritoneum. good luck with all of your endeavours and merry christmas.
two of my biggest scares as a younger nurse were when a mom told me "something is off, this isn't normal for them." in both cases i ignored the concerns and placated the parent as i could see nothing concerning, in both cases the patients nearly died, i've learned to listen when family sees something i don't.
from michelle, gray had a doctor that was one of the first to treat kids with chemo first instead of radiation. it was much less invasive. he wanted to try less invasive treatments first. he used to always say that he was "cautiously optimistic" which was very comforting. his current pcp is great
it's so interesting to me that for most people i talked to the early signs of cancers and illness is a general sense of feeling "off." before i was diagnosed i remember just feeling really out of it, tired all the time, not much of an appetite, etc.
i've gone through a rough year too and for what it's worth i think i've just come to the realization that the only thing that really matters is our spiritual health and what's going on in our souls. our physical health and what happens in this plane of existence really doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things, and you can grow spiritually from bad experiences just as much as good experiences. you're probably a lot more "spiritually healthy" than a lot of people who have the privilege of being physically healthy.
omg that's awesome! that's me and my mother's favorite song :)
oof, can you tell gray that i myself was diagnosed with grade 4 glioblastoma four years ago? there's hope for all of us, and we're all in it together.
that's my favorite story from this thread so far. what an awesome dude.
my lovely lady found a recipe for a boiled cauliflower and sweet potato mash. if you find the recipe... don't get your hopes up. just stick with the riced cauliflower and eggs. ;)
so since there has been more research/improvements/possibilities, would it be something you could maybe look into again? mom? gray? i would be interested in hearing from both of you what your views on the subject are.
this is a really sweet response and i think you are a really cool dude :)
that's a great answer bro. if i had that kind of money i would donate it to leukemia research.
did you hear there's gonna be a new season of young justice? i'm so excited for it! you've got great taste in shows, friend!
st. baldrics supports childhood cancer research.
thank you, my silly deaf ass was having trouble understanding!
michelle mom here - honestly this is what keeps us moving forward. if we can share our experience with others, then it creates a community, our support system. and it is always important to keep a positive mentor and role model in gray's life to remind it that its all about the fun too! that is joe!
i'm 22 and fucking hate everything. this makes me feel shit
seconded. i don't want to be rude, the audio quality isn't great and, as someone who isn't a native speaker, it's hard to get the hold of what gray is saying.
he didn't say he wanted to meet a porate, he wants to dress like a pirate
eye patch cutlass parrot beard mug 'o grog fancy pirate hat and a nintendo switch when it come out
please don't fail him reddit. send him a shit ton of pirate gear.
it's about waaaay more than just pirates. one piece is life
this has been a good advertising day for coachart.
damn. the promethazine with the pot was my go to on a bad day. i'm so sorry to hear it didn't work for her. zofran kept the nausea down but had bad side effects.
do i upvote or downvote you? i dont wanna upset your username
mom's have a truly amazing 6th sense about their kids.
thank you for your reply and thank you for doing this ama.
just wanted to say so sorry for your loss. the words you wrote above are beautiful.
although cauliflower drizzled with balsamic vinegar broiled and topped with parmesan cheese is amazing.
as a grilled cheese lover, i too would like to know where, and are they covered by my insurance?
green lantern: first flight is really good, too. i think my favorite of the new dc animated films is probably batman: under the red hood. if we're discussing every animated film dc has ever made, its definitely batman: mask of the phantasm. that movie is a masterpiece.
man, this kid has reallly got shit figured out. he's happier than most of the people in our generation and has faced death so many times.
it wasn't just "deafness." op was difficult to understand because of the toll that his medical condition has taken.
why? it's not like they don't realise his speech is sometimes hard to understand. joe has probably listened to it so much he recognizes different words. i think it's great someone took the time to write it down so everyone can understand gray's thoughts. i think he has a great attitude to life we all should learn from.
don't man, make it want to change your situation because you can.
*i feel like i can express it through art, without having to use my words. you could say "he's not really saying anything, words are just words" but in my opinion i can really express how i feel. like if i'm feeling anger, i'll do it- i'll put into my art all that negative energy and make something positive out of it.* **and what are you doing right now?** *we're doing christmas crafts!* ----- i'd like to point out this probably isn't perfect, but it gets the point across. stay strong, gray :)
a real pirate will know where to buy the best gear though.
mom and i don't get gifts for each other for the holidays because we thought it would be great to adopt families for christmas instead of exchanging gifts. it's nice to get gifts but my favorite gift to get is spending time with people
i had one last month and the only thing i could think of is that that was the most sovietic experience of my life. it makes sounds of old machinery that you listen on the cold war movies or something. it's so strange because it looks super high-tech but at the same time they can't do much to lower the sound of it. it's like you're inside an engine. i slept through most of it, though
on the other end of the spectrum, i've seen munchausen by proxy first hand. pandering to that kind of behavior is dangerous
adding some bread crumbs kicks it up a notch, too. but, heck, a little olive oil and a broiler go a long way with cauliflower. you can season it with just about any savory flavor.
good luck. hope the best for yall. you are all very strong and encouraging.
the sandwiches are $200, but if you have a prescription and you're in network they only have a $30 copay until you hit your deductible. then the copay drops to $20.
i think his trials are precisely why he is so happy. as a society we see happiness as dependant upon circumstances. we question how joy can be felt in the midst of hardship. however, we recognize that the people who pull through their trials see things differently than those who do not. these trials challenge us to answer the difficult question, "can i be happy despite my circumstances? is happiness something i can control?" in fact, many of us ask: "how can my circumstances make me happy?" or "what will make me happy?" *the answer to happiness lies within the question we ask ourselves and how we see the world.* gray has chosen the path of internal locus of control (we can control ourselves despite our circumstances) which leads to fulfillment and joy despite circumstances. many of us choose the the external locus of control (we have no control over our fate or behavior) a little philosophical, but worth thinking about...
and if life doesn't give you lemons, plant some trees and make your own lemons! if there's a will, there's a way.
i don't know why but i really respect the way you phrased that.
also great for those of us who can't watch the video at the moment
some chronic illnesses won't kill you, but they narrow your life down to sitting in your room, alone, counting the seconds. and you can't make meaningful changes
thanks, man! i definitely have to check gray's pinterest.
a real pirate would just be able to help him secure some booty.
christ i'd never heard of it being referred to as the afterlife, now you're just bringing down my mood man
i found out that one place near me only takes 15 mins to compete the mri. it's like $200 more then the other places and because i was in a time crunch and they had an opening i just said whatever and paid the extra. omg if you are anything like me and can't stand those things this is worth every single cent.
my mom was accused of that once when i was feeling pretty sick. i kept passing out, was dizzy all the time, and just didn't feel right. i also craved ice to the point where i'd get furious if my parents threw it out. we went to this one doctor like 4 times and for some reason she never tested my iron. i heard her talking shit about my mother to a nurse while i was there saying she just wanted attention. i went to another doctor and the first thing she did was test my iron and she said she had never seen iron levels that low. a couple months of taking iron pills and i was completely normal again.
from my experience the happiest people i have encountered are those who have spent the most time introspectively getting to the root of their unhappiness.
he is totally right though. there's no need to sugar coat it really. the only way to bring awareness is by truly understanding the toll this takes on a human. it's sad to think about, but all we can do is continue to donate. :)
well, i do know how it feels to have chronic pain, but hopefully that will change, and i'm sorry that fuking sucks but dudes like op give hope and its rad.
well what else are you gonna do? i always see my cat or animals and they just fucking live their lives. i wonder what they think about, albiet its probably basic as fuck, but maybe we should be less critical and more basic... find something that you don't hate doing and do it a little more (hobby wise).
i've never heard this phrase and first thought that i had is afterlife
i didn't really mind mine too much, except that i was laying flat on my stomach, one arm extended (the bit of me that was getting mri'd), the other bent and my chin holding up my head, which got kinda sore. once i got used to that, i think i fell asleep for a bit. but i cannot imagine doing that regularly. my mom did when she had cancer, and her claustrophobia affected her too. fortunately, mine didn't kick in. did you also have some irrational fear that you had metal objects/shards in your body that you didn't know about? for some reason i had the strongest worry about that, even though i knew i never had any metal lodged into my body.
jesus, does the original doctor know that it was iron now, at least? i'm still too petty to imagine not calling up and telling her how wrong she was
honestly, i'd like to learn more bushcraft and fuck off to canada and live in the wilderness 9 months of the year. but that's not gonna happen.
implying people usually don't cry while they poop.
no worries! keep doing your best, good times are ahead.
no that is a bit odd! but just for future reference they ask you that regarding larger pieces or a pacemaker, these things can be dangerous and/or effect the results. something like a sliver of metal in your skin or something like that isn't going to make you explode when getting an mri. i don't want to downplay the seriousness of it, but unless you have a pacemaker, a single large piece or a ton of small pieces, you should be fine.
no, i wish my mom did. i was only 13 at the time so i wasn't going to do it. however, i still feel like i want to call her and shut her up. wish i knew who she was! lol
that is horrible. :( i'm sorry you both had/have to go through that. i don't know why anybody would work in the medical field if they didn't actually want to help people. i hope you are doing okay despite the crummy health lotto you were given.
i'm not sure what it is. but it makes people crave things like dirt or ice. i'm assuming its the body trying to force our caveman brains to lick rocks and get minerals. lol. and pregnant women are commonly low in iron so that may have been a concern.
the hospital will still have the records most likely. call them up and call her out!
i was hoping he'd answer this but it seems like he's just ignoring it.
my fiance is in the exact same situation but with wilson's disease and other complications stemming from that. there are times where she wants to do something to earn money whether it's an actual job or just freelance work/etsy stuff. she can't. and if she does, she looses support for the 50k+ medication she needs to take to keep her alive.
perhaps this is my cynicism but the idea of compromise see to be missing from both the bernie revolution and the tea party.
to be fair tisa and ttip have not yet been released. it's tough to be opposed to something when you've never seen it.
yes, and i believe i answered this in a past ama.
true, i am not running for dnc chair and certainly don't expect to be made chair. what should be done at the dnc? ban corporate lobby donations to the dnc (wasserman schultz had reversed pres. obama's 2008 ban) and get rid of super delegates, many of whom are corporate lobbyists. have the dnc work with all state parties to press them for universal registration and open primaries. and to ensure that the votes cast are the votes counted, real monitoring of the software of voting machines and tabulations. i have heard a rumor that some democrats want to offer the dnc to bernie sanders if he does not get the democratic nomination. perhaps that would help unify the party, i don't know. like many, i am still hoping bernie will get the nomination at the convention next month.
from most of what i've read outside of reddit, dws seems really progressive and decently liked in her district. it seems most of the attacks levied against her have come from outside her district, mostly by angry sanders supporters. hillary won about 72% of the vote in the area. what are the realistic chances of those remaining percentage being able to convince the rest that she's not a good option?
here in south florida there's alina valdes, she doesn't have a primary challenge as far as i know, and she will likely be running in the general election against mario diaz ballart, a republican congressman in what's been a republican district. thanks for all your support! redditors have helped our campaign tremendously from day 1!
is there actually a surge? i know bernie urged supporters to do this, and many on reddit responded favorably. just curious if this is a real thing or you're just guessing based on the feedback here?
so far it has been 1) tpp bad! 2)what is a trade deal?
i am running as a democrat and i am committed to reforming the democratic party. if i win this race, i hope i will be in a position to push for such changes. is this going to be the best way? i don't know. we all know that the election system is unfortunately really stacked against 3rd parties, and that's a big problem.
no, i am not at all concerned. in the 1st quarter, about 10 percent of our fundraising came from donations within florida. wasserman schultz also raised about two-thirds of her money from outside florida. my donations are an average size of $17. she's taking a lot of money from pacs funded by corporations based outside florida, a lot of delaware chartered corporations. and i had more individual donations in florida than she did!
convene a bipartisan caucus of house and senate members committed to overturning citizens united, committed to publicly financed elections, and unwilling to accept corporate money. i would support the brand new congress in challenging those who refuse to get on board with these reforms.
why would anyone other than the person who took out a loan need to "tackle" that loan?
yes, i was quite hesitant. establishment political operatives tried to talk me out of it, tried to frighten me in a number of ways.
i believe edward snowden did this country a service. in a democracy, the people should know what their country is doing with their tax dollars and in their name. yes, i've heard about the leaked dnc files, and understand that it shows some internal dnc memos from last may that strategize how to promote the hillary clinton campaign and stifle her opposition within the party.
you hit the nail on the head about one side being fully militarized and highly active, while the other is just sitting on their asses. not that most dems are any less corrupt than the republicans, in their own ways. who knows, maybe it's by design?
daiya cheese, black olives and spinach: at least that's what it's been lately!
why does he have to? and to hit what you are implying, why do you think bernie has to support clinton. if he doesn't support her policies and/or the fact that she is owned by corporations, why should he be required to support her?
thanks and sorry we didn't get to meet at the blue gala. i think open borders become a safety valve for failed states south of our border, and often it's the us (both public and private sectors) that are propping up corrupt oligarchs that don't take care of their people, who then undertake the often dangerous migration over borders and into the us. i suspect there are some democrats like dws that like to talk about comprehensive immigration reform, but never push it as a top priority. as long as the problem is unresolved, it continues to be a grievance against republicans. democrats who talk the talk, but don't walk the walk are the real "moderates." i don't see myself as moderate on the issue because i think this is another issue that has to come up for a vote in the first 100 days of a new administration.
so it took us all of 30 minutes to figure out this guy is just as deflective and unresponsive as every other politician out there. welp that was quick.
saying something is "full of holes" is not the same as saying it does more harm than good and shouldn't have been attempted. i don't know anything about canova's stance on this though, so i can't speak to that directly.
well, it depends on how much money she is raking in from etsy. under a certain amount for hobbies or self employed doesn't really need to be factored in. if you are making bank though, you have to declare it correctly and would be less eliglble for benefits. so, if you want to make a few bucks, great, but unless you are going to get to the point where you can afford 50k for you own medical treatment through that, then it seems like you should just do it as a hobby, or volunteer as others have mentioned. unless you are prepared to fully join the workforce and get a job that ideally would include great benefits themselves.
though that is good personal advice, it doesn't address why the system is set up in some odd situations to disincentivize finding a job.
compromise isn't a dirty word to sanders supporters. but you compromise on solutions, not beliefs. bernie is good at compromise, he pushed through lots of amendments in congress with bipartisan support
oregon here. we are not harassed or oppressed and our votes count. i've seen no flaws in our voting system so far. i can't believe every state hasn't adapted to our way of voting.
i don't know why so many people jumped on this answer. he's just acknowledging that this issue has come up before and he's been consistently on the side of the reddit majority opinion.
if bernie was to get the nomination next month despite hillary winning the nomination via primaries, what do you think the larger implications are? how will this affect the democratic party, the general elections, and the foundation of the system as a whole?
i'm also in her district. while i voted for bernie, i don't discount the fact that dws is well liked in our district and that nobody has any idea who tim canova is. he's a non-threat to her.
"i wasn't there, but my totally unbiased supporter said it was super embarrassing for my opponent. so it's probably true"
in los angeles, we have more than a dozen bernie volunteers who ran for local city offices this year or are running in the next 2 years.
i believe the main hindrance to a 3rd party is the electoral college. i also believe this is the main reason why abolishing the electoral college, a mind-numbingly antiquated system, is not talked about more by party elites. if elected, would you support abolishing the electoral college?
comparing sanders & clinton, it seems people assume candidates with name recognition don't need their money; whereas candidates without insider ties are much more dependent on grassroots money, anything that increases a regular voter's contribution budget should help them.
you should run an ad: "90% of my donations come from people who have never stepped foot in this state. vote for me!"
how do you believe a caucus of congress members can overturn citizens united and enforce publicly financed only campaigns? my understanding of this issue suggests we need a supreme court who interprets the first amendment differently than the court who decided citizens united or that we would need to change the first amendment.
black olives?!!? sorry, i can no longer support you. just kidding.
anyone claiming obama could have negotiated for single payer with the congress he had to work with is either straight up lying or is just plain delusional.
actually, he himself replied to the iran question. if you scroll down you'll see it.
you didn't really think he was going to answer any substantive questions did you? this is just a fundraising call.c
has your view changed in light of the substantive thoughtful answer he provided?
agreed. i also think it is full of holes, but it was the best option he had. rejecting the deal is akin to saying "it's cool, we'll just invade them in a couple years." i will always choose diplomacy, even if a plan has holes, over worsening tensions.
well, that's a deal breaker right there. another politician supporting apartheid israel, shocker. /s
he's a symptom of how frustrating the sanders campaign has become to people who care about actual progressive reform and change instead of just bernie sanders. dws has not done a great job as the dnc chair, i'll cop to that. she's also on her way out of that position anyway- dnc chairs pretty much never stay for longer than a single cycle. her actual legislative work, however, is reasonable progressive. she is not a moderate in any way, but 2+ milllion dollars of progressive money has been spent on a fruitless primary challenge against her in a district that bernie couldn't even win to begin with. that money could have gone to challenging actual blue dogs or pushing for wins in vacant gop house seats.
there are a couple different amounts you are allowed to earn and still get benefits. for 2016 anything above $810 triggers a trial work period. in 60 months you get 9 months where you can try working, earn as much as you want and see how it goes, after you've used those 9 months you can earn no more than $1130 a month in substantial gainful activity (sga) and still get your ssdi. even if you do this for years, if you want to earn more, you can do so under ticket to work's period of extended eligibility. it gives you 36 months, during which time you don't get ssdi if you go above sga, but you don't have to reapply for benefits if any months fall below a certain amount. the monthly thresholds are higher if you are blind. source: i've been working at sga for 8 years and recently went into extended eligibility with a full-time job.
i believe a warhammer youtuber had to stop making videos because she was beginning to earn more than was allowed and would have lost benefits
it's a tricky situation and set up like it is to stop people from taking advantage of working while getting free medical care. it would be really hard to draft laws allowing people on assistance to work to their ability based on their conditions because it really is different from person to person. i think the ideal situation would be universal healthcare from the government so people like ops sister in law would be able to work when they can and still get the benefits they need.
it most certainly is. passing an amendment is incredibly easy, they are often adopted by voice with only a few people in the room while only the really controversial ones go to recorded votes
having a fptp voting system is certainly a flaw. there's always room for improvement!
i won't speak for anyone but myself, but the hope that bernie could still get the nomination is one in the same as the hope for an fbi indictment will come down on hillary. the implication is then that dispite winning she is unfit to run, nothing more nothing less.
for bernie to get the nomination, it would likely mean that clinton has recused herself due to an fbi criminal case against her.
one of the ironies about a "more democratic" primary process is that it heavily favors the establishment candidate. we had a simple popular vote all on one day across the nation, hillary would have won in a landslide in both 2008 and 2016. her name recognition would have been enough. bernie never would have got a foothold if not for the caucus states. same story for obama.
"i don't care about voters unless they agree with me" ~guy running for election
you should check out /r/timcanova there's a couple of interviews that tim did that i think you'd dig
i don't understand how increasing yield and profit while reducing the use of chemicals and need for maintenance and labor is bad for small farmers. farmers overwhelmingly choose gm crops when the option is available.
getting rid of the electoral college is not enough. even if it went to a popular vote, the winning candidate must have 50%+1 of the vote to become president or else the decision defaults to the house of representatives. so unless a third party can also make enough headway to make the house also vote for them, they still won't be president. there are several layers of barriers to a real third party success both constitutional and otherwise.
honestly, we'd probably need a constitutional amendment to significantly change things
the pizza question again! anything with daiya cheese!
if he was vegan he would have led with that instead of stating he was running for congress.
unless your value system includes the health of isreal and you believe this plan is in direct opposition to that belief. i don't have a dog in this fight, at all; i'm only providing context.
it comes from the warhammer 40k universe. the god emporer rules all mankind.
debbie wasserman schultz is certainly a viable candidate in fl-23, despite the fact she supported the iran deal.
well christ i figured if he was any good as his job he'd be able to stand up to at least a couple hours of questions from reddit in the middle of a weekday. this is like the cushiest hour to be hosting an ama because all professionals are at work so you don't have too many heavy hitters in the comment section, mostly just college students (who can be tough but are much more agreeable to a progressive like op). frankly the reddit demographic is predisposed to liking him, but between his curt answers, shitty attitude, and blatant ignoring of the tougher questions, he's manage to in short order piss off what should be his cheerleading club. frankly a politicians job entails answering tough questions and effectively navigating the media while seeming personable and identifying with people. the fact he can't do that in a sheltered environment on the internet is embarrassing for him and damaging to his candidacy.
i'm not saying this particular deal is bad, but not all unfavorable deals are better than worsening tensions. see neville chamberlain.
funny thing is that before the election she was getting criticized for being too progressive for florida.
this is the flaw with hero worship in politics: youll quickly find out your hero wasnt all they said they were.
well i guess this leaves me confused as to why i had my checks garnished for working 9 months and earning more than 860.. then lost benefits for a short time afterwards.
why not just disable ads while continuing to make the videos? then later on when your ad revenue can overcome your benefits, use that instead.
maybe if we stopped tying healthcare to employment like many other nations that would help
i'm running for state legislature in arizona. regarding donations, since i'm running under public funding provisions - a stance i feel absolutely committed to - i am not soliciting or accepting donations from people outside of my district; i will be asking for volunteer assistance in voter outreach later on, once i have access to a solid and workable registered voter database. definitely one of the drawbacks to running as a third party.
i agree that's a huge, glaring flaw, but i think he meant there aren't any flaws that only oregon has due to their policy. fptp is garbage, but we have that in the whole country.
i was also wondering this. cory booker is seen by many as a likely future presidential candidate. tim canova is...well...going to be lucky if he's still in the political picture in 5 months.
it was a yes or no question and he answered, the extra bit there at the end is just a bonus.
which, let's be frank, isn't happening. if something materializes she's getting a pardon faster than nixon.
i'm sure tim is a good guy, better than dws at least (really not a fan). but i hear ya. that's why i chose to run in the first place, because the vast majority of politicians dodge questions and give vague sound bites. no one wants to risk details, yet it's those details that make or break any policy!
that is the inevitable end result of countering the bernie sanders circle jerk.
none the less his job would be to represent individuals from his state, specifically his district. the fact that he has more donations from out of state - whether individual or corporate - is still a sign of a lack of support from his constituency.
even when politics are involved, the man stays consistent!
see, my problem with statements like this is my way of refuting them is to say 'grr, annoyed vegan grumble grumble' when that then proves your point... even though the majority of my friends don't even know i'm vegan... grr...
it could be that he's using this to drive a wedge between her and her constituency.
yeah, but... he's running against dws. an inanimate carbon rod is a better candidate than dws.
okay, "always" was a bad word to use. but generally, unless you're dealing with a hitler, diplomacy is a better option.
yep, and he's not running to be commander in chief, there is so much good he can do by championing his other positions that his foreign policy stances don't matter as much i'd say. plus, i think dws only voted for the deal in exchange for some favors from obama, so there's basically not much difference between their real positions here.
why should someone have to work for free to skate around their benefits though? they're obviously ready and not only willing to work, but are already working. why should people like this feel like they're going to be punished if they continue to try to provide for themselves? what happens after a year and the youtube money dries out and they're left back at square one, trying to get back their disability? are they going to have to wait another 2 - 3 years to get their benefits back? people like this shouldn't have to feel concerned that they're going to lose their benefits because they found a niche market for their skill set. and nobody wants to gamble on *maybe* becoming hireable again when they've fought for 2 - 3 years to get disability in the first place. i wouldn't want to risk it either, if i fought for 3 years to finally get disability, just because for a few weeks/months i've been making a decent amount with adsense. who knows when that's going to dry up?
i know, i'm just making the point that although they have a functioning fptp system, we could seriously improve it with a ranked voting system.
or it's a way of showing that he has at least a bit of consistency on the issue.
you can't get a pardon without a conviction and an indictment is a far cry away from a conviction.
look elsewhere on the site. it explains everything. there need to be 50%+1 of the available electoral votes combined from states that passed the legislation. at that point it will activate and all the states that have passed it will bind their electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote rather than the results of the individual state, which means whoever gets the most votes in the election will always get the majority of electoral votes.
i'm a bernie fan myself but it's getting outrageous.
that's funny because literally the only thing i know about you is that you're vegan
i don't know why reddit thinks someone in their first term in the lower house of a legislature is going to be a critical actor in foreign policy.
but you also shouldn't be running for president with an indictment
and if she accepted that pardon, she wouldn't go to prison, but she'd be the weakest candidate in the history of the united states.
she would actually give trump a chance after this horrible week of his
you'll probably never see this comment. my girlfriend is japanese (she was born here in the states) and had some family memebers in the camps and we went to see allegiance (george takei) musical yesterday at the movie theater for a one day special event. it really struck me how bad america treated it's own people just because of skin color and how ignorant we as a country were back then. i'm sorry america did that to you.
this is pretty interesting. seems like japanese americans were also treated better than blacks back then. i'm not 100% sure, but i can't imagine anyone letting a black man drink out of the white only water fountain, even if he was in uniform. anyone else have any insight on this?
great aunt: i don't know. i was 14. i didn't care at the time grandma: haha. you could be like my chinese neighbors that wore a sign that said "i am chinese, not japanese" great aunt: i don't know. i never really thought about that. it's hard to give an answer. when i was older i thought, you know, they shouldn't have done that. but when i was 14 i was very naive and i didn't think about that grandma: i thought it was totally unfair because i am an american
my great uncle says it was fun for him too. he lived on a farm far away from anyone japanese. suddenly as a teenager he was surrounded by all these japanese friends and japanese girls his age. he had a blast.
not op, but my family owned land/operated a farm in central california. when they were ordered to leave, many families ended up losing a lot of their farmland. my family was one of the few lucky ones; when they were ordered to leave, my great grandfather's neighbor, a white man, promised to look after their farm and promised to return it when/if they were ever let out. when they finally left, he returned the farm in full.
**grandma**:there's a lot of people who never knew about our situation. a lot of people didn't know about it like my neighbor. whenever i mentioned "camp" she thought i meant summer camp. **great aunt**: that was the guy on star trek right? i noticed him because they finally got an asian guy and i used to watch star trek. i think i saw wevery one in a while in the pacific citizen he would say something. one time he came to the crocker art museum and i was like "oh well there he is" **young aunt:** well they don't know about social media. so if they don't ever use social media they don't know him. **great aunt**:i'm not a gopher. i just want to lean back and let everyone else do the work **grandma**: maybe if i was an advocate of something. but no one is going to listen to me now
good lord. i can't even imagine being told i can't see my family when i'm granted leave. that's honestly one of the most heartbreaking stories i've ever heard of. let your family know, the u.s navy has much higher thoughts of japan and their service to our branch now. and are grateful of the base they graciously allow us to station over there.
**grandma:** i'm sure we were happy because it would mean we would finally leave camp because the war was over. for some thing tule lake had more pro-japanese people than other camps. that's why most of us were in tule lake. we were there because we were all from sacramento. we went from walerga to tule lake. there were a lot of people in there because they were pro-japan. very few though. **granddaughter:** weren't you also no-no though? **grandma:** yeah i was no-no. but that's not how i felt. i wasn't going to send my parents back to japan where they didn't know what the conditions are. just because they are japanese doesn't mean they'd be okay there. in other words we would be going just to protect them. make sure bad things don't happen to them.
tule lake. well first i went to walerga temporary detention center 18. i didn't because i went right back to japan town. there was no discrimination there. my parents bought a house for me and my sister and they lived in an apartment across the street. [my parents] rented out space in the house for isseis (first generation japanese americans) so they had a place to stay. my mother cooked for them. i think my parents did a good job. i am very proud of what they did.
**grandma:**i don't know anyone who actually supported japan. you're talking about people like me born and raised here? there were a lot of dual citizens too. born here, sent to japan to be educated.
**great aunt**: whatever you do when you're 15 or 16. you go to school. we just kind of hung around and i don't know. i'd go over to my friend's place. **grandma:** did you live in the same block? **great aunt:** we met in high school and we lived in separate blocks. during the winter when it was snowing we'd just see each other in school and then go home and do homework. they used to have dances and we used to go. (*granddaughter: lol sorry the answer to this question is so short. we got interrupted by the news that the kings traded away cousins. my family are hardcore kings fans.*)
**grandma:** i'ts hard for the govt to decide what is the right thing to do. but the govt had no right to decide we should go to camps. if they were bad people around we'd go live somewhere else or whatever. but the japanese isseis were very good at making money however they had to, so my father wouldn't let us starve. besides like i said my dad was so good. my dad always found jobs for other people and found places for them to live. at least he was doing what was good there's ups and downs in any life and you have to do your best to overcome it. and help others if they need your help as much as you can
how could anybody possibly believe they were as bad as german death camps?
if they don't answer, i can say my dad, who was in the camps, felt some resentment. he went back to japan after the war for about 15 years before coming back to the u.s. he would talk about how much they lost. they had a large farm in a nice part of california and the kids were all doing well in school. anyway, there's a lot to it. i'm sure everyone was different but my dad and his brother's definitely felt resentment.
**great aunt**: i don't know. who cares? i'm 14. i don't care. but later on they say that it was political. so you should check into it and see how political it was **grandma**: but it was sure hard on people who had businesses and whatever. sometimes people just disappeared and you didn't know until a few years later. the government would just take them.
**great aunt:**no. i mean life in camp....we were fed and we had a place to live. if there isn't someone young in the family that could speak english and make a living you wouldn't be able to make it. if you left a camp in germany you could kind of blend in with the population. if you left heart mountain or amache or tule lake you'd stand out like a sore thumb. i don't remember anybody trying to escape. maybe they were but i don't know
**grandma**:i think the president at the time think he had the right to do it because japan had attacked pearl harbor i don't understand why he connects japan with japanese americans. japanese americans had nothing to do with what japan did. even my parents were shocked when it happened.
i just saw this headline in /r/todayilearned "til of colorado gov. ralph carr who during the japanese interment of wwii was the only gov. to open up his state to japanese-american citizens as a safe zone to avoid interment. the move cost him his political career."
**grandma:** well nobody was happy about roosevelt letting this happen to us. i don't know about any real animosity. i think it was something we accepted. i wouldn't say it was something roosevelt felt that he had to do. but he did it. i guess it was for the safety of the country just in case there were japanese living in america that would do any hard to the community or whatever. i guess to protect us too. yeah. we didn't own any property. we rented our hotel. if anything my father left his car. we had a lot of dishes and pots and pots and pans and sheets and linens that we needed to run the hotel. we had to leave all of it. you could only take one suitcase and if you had young children you had to carry their things in your suitcase. so actually my father lost his car, his business.
**grandma** i guess money. because we made hardly anything in camp. just barely any money. we were left with just the money they had saved before the war and my father fortunately did so we had something. and my father didn't have to worry about my older sister and i. we found work and places to stay.. cleaning houses and domestic work. he didn't have to pay.
**grandma**: i did for a while. this caucasian. mari hannon. her father was one of the judge in camp. he was attorney general in california for a while. we kept in touch a while after camp. i don't know. we didn't have tv. i think we were able to get newspaper. i don't know word gets around. we had radios. i don't think everyone had radios. you would be taking a chance if you brought it in. my father threw away our radio. he didn't want to be suspected as a spy. he threw it over the tower bridge. we were very upset because radio was the only thing we had. we'd listen to hit parade.. music. every body would listen to hit parade. it was the only good thing to listen to for young people.
**grandma**: it was sudden. if anyone told us anything like that was going to happen we would have never believed it.
granddaughter here. it's still legal. the supreme court just determined that in the case of the japanese americans in wwii it was wrong.
**great aunt:**where would we go? **grandma:**i'm an american citizen. where would i go? japan? i would have gone to japan if my parents insisted but they didn't want to go back.
i see and thank you for your comment. your voice has been heard. have a great day!
blacks were never allowed to drink from "whites only" fountains, and the rest of the fountains were labeled as "colored" because this same rule applied to hispanics and native americans. not having seen a japanese person before the locals probably had no idea how to react/classify them so they just said "whateves". source: family that came from the south
how were sentiments from the american chinese and american koreans towards the american japanese?
so some people were sympathetic to japanese americans?
i can just imagine them stuck in the camp and him being like, 'hey ladies...'
this happened in the pacific nw too but many very successful farmers/orchardists today owe their wealth to stealing productive land from the japanese who were interred
my family was interned. they said you were only able to keep a certain amount of money going into the camp, a few thousand. beyond that you had to give up your money, property, and take what you can carry, unless if you had a very trusting non-japanese friend to look after it for you. plus, a couple decades or so ago all japanese people that were interned were entitled to a small compensation... i think it was like $20,000.
thousands of people are listening to your grandma right now and i suspect more will want to.
yeah like how cuba graciously allows us to have gitmo... oh wait..
some were forced to move from the coast of brazil to the countryside, but not to japan. if that happened, i don't think it would be a problem, since the japanese people at that time were isseis and nisseis. they actually lived in a japanese culture inside brazil, they speak japanese with more fluency than portuguese, used to play baseball, sing karaoke, gateball and the elders even prohibited their children to marry a non japanese decendent. things are different with sanseis we still preserve a lot of traditions but we are more mixed and barely speak japanese.
wow, so cool that they owned 2 homes so that they could help others! how many first generation japanese americans did your family host? did new people come in as the other ones left (kinda like a typical bed & breakfast), or did they mainly rent it out to just one family for a really long time?
that's alright they're grandmas, they have bedtimes.
as a celtics fan, i'm sorry for your loss :( nobody should have to suffer from a front office that bad lol
scary thought: how would the internees have been treated had the war started to go really badly for usa or there had been actual japanese incursions on the mainland or (and as i understand it this never happened) japanese americans had been caught spying or aiding the enemy in some way? the world was a more brutal place then in general and i think the internees always had worries like this. it is good that nothing like what happened to jews in europe happened to the internees but it is not unimaginable.
you should look to jews from ww2 and go after assets stolen by the government. clearly this is a major violation and shouldn't be taken lightly.
"so you should check into it..." i love that your great aunt is wise enough to know that researching something is always better than hearsay. critical thinking is so rare these days. (_)
so she was in a camp in oregon? or was this a klamath falls somewhere else?
it's not the sort of story the professors would tell you.
this really makes me question the legacy of fdr. he is our hero on the left, but this action by him, to victimize people based on their skin color is just disgusting. weren't we supposed to be fighting hitler for doing the same thing? i'm a huge fan of socialism and the new deal, but this is just too disgusting to handle.
i read obasan in highschool and thought it was quite good. it should really be something that all canadian students should have to read and discuss either in english or history.
you have a great day too! matter of fact.. all of you have a great day. keep smiling and keep on keepin on.
actually, they weren't always sure how to handle hispanics either. a "mexican" category was added to the us census in 1930, but before that they were legally counted as white. and then roosevelt wanted better relationships with mexico, so he declared that latinos would be considered white again. my grandfather got a full ride to u. alabama in 1950something as an international student from guatemala. he looked more like my kitchen coworker than ted cruz. i'm not sure he ever had enough facial hair to grow a beard. but when he arrived, no one knew what to make of him. it's like what you said- no one knew how to react to him. according to my mom, the fact that he was a foreign student gave him some degree of exemption, and he made up the rest of it by making friend with the entire football team and cheerleading squad. once the football team decided he was white, he could drink from whatever fountain he wanted.
generally speaking, very little sympathy. lots of fear of misunderstanding. remember, this is 1942. five years after the rape of nanking and *during* japanese imperial control over korea. standing up for fellow americans was one thing, especially when you had few tenuous rights yourself. standing up for people who were directly related to those who were actively slaughtering your family back home was quite another. an easy way to get disowned by your family at home and abroad... then *mistaken* for japanese when government came for round up.
uh.. i think as a male teenager, any opportunity is taken to be like 'hey ladies...' -source, was once a male teenager.
for this exact reason, i interviewed my grandmother - video and audio. it truly fascinates me and keeps me optimistic during these times. plus, it's a memory that will live on for my family and for future generations. it's sad to say that within 5-10 years, most of these stories will be buried forever.
i find it very interesting how this part is glossed over. the japanese are the only racial group to receive cash reparations from the us govt.
i, the granddaughter, can answer most of this question. they hosted a lot of single men that would work in the farms and send money to their families. they did this before and after the war. new people came in as other ones left and my grandma and her siblings would cook the food and clean the rooms.
there was a japan town in sacramento and that's where my grandma lived. there's only a couple left - la, sf, san jose, and seattle i believe. after they were evacuated others took over the buildings and many were unable to return to their homes after the war. then governments built freeways and other sorts of projects through the middle of them. after most japanese folks settled in a different area of town, the government decided to build a freeway straight through it.
yeah my grandparents were mildly horrified to find out about that uncle, again they're very patriotic. also back then, it was pretty old fashioned with the whole family association. you know the classic, if you have a "bad seed" in the family then the whole family is bad. so i can see people trying to cover a shame such as a japanese pilot in the family under tight wraps even if no one in the us personally knew him.
i would argue it's many, many steps behind. if germans stopped at the rounding up part it would be a footnote in history instead of the largest tragedy of all time.
it's interesting that i've heard about the japanese internment camps numerous times throughout my life but not the german camps. they were created at the same time.
tule lake was right on the border of oregon and california. so we're talking about the same klamath falls
i mean the way they saw it back then was an entire race of people were going to war with america, they attacked without provocation or warning, and then the above incident saw that people that were native to that land but living in america aided their former countrymen.
the decision to start japanese internment during the war makes a lot more sense now, but it was still a terrible, terrible idea.
this is the grand daughter here. yeah i know. i was pretty confused. most days my grandma gets it and is pretty mad about the racial profiling (we even went to an anti-islamophobia press conference together). today she didn't seem to remember anything that prompted all the racial profiling of muslims. they were trying to say that they didn't remember why people would be so hateful of muslims. i guess 9/11 and stuff totally slipped their mind.
i always wonder why fdr largely gets a pass on this. my grandfather was the son of german immigrants and grew up in a german speaking household. they didn't get uprooted and put into camps.
you know that's one thing i realized with japanese americans who experienced this era of racism/fear/hatred. they never really held grudges, more shameful (not sure how to explain it in better words, its not shame but similar?) but with such positivity to make best of what was given to them. their perseverance and will to live through it strongly is so, so amazing.
and they only just apologized about it, as they continue to allow them to live in third world conditions.
they still don't know how to classify us. sometimes we're our own thing, other times we have to choose white or black with hispanic ethnicity and other times still we get our own section and can pick any race. it's kind of funny, kind of annoying.
east asian skin tone can change quite a bit based on exposure to the sun. we can get to obama skin color quite easily.
many don't really want to hear these other contexts, it didn't happen in a simple bubble. americans and brits living in japan were put on boats and sent away regardless of their rights or status under japanese law. americans knew about increasing mistreatment of westerners in japan in the 1930's, and the internment of westerners in china, so there was already a lot of fear and animosity.
i was an assistant teacher of holocaust education for a year and from that experience, i agree completely. it's very easy to assume we can google whatever we want nowadays and get to the truth of the matter. sadly, many more stories will go untold or lost simply because we don't have some record of it. the rate at which this specific age group is dying out is astounding and terrifying, given our current geopolitical situation. history has a way of repeating itself...i just hope we're smart enough to learn from the mistakes and successes of our forebearers.
they could, but it would take a lot of work, given that their constitution says that the us army is their army too.
amazing. your family has touched so many people's lives & welcomed them into a community in america. so so sorry for what they had to endure, very glad they seem to have such a positive outlook on things & don't seem to have a heavy heart burdened with anger for what they unjustly had to go through. thanks for the reply!
"japan town" in la is called little tokyo. and it is indeed little, but there is still a huge japanese population between la, orange, and ventura counties. there is another one in santa monica called "little osaka." i grew up in camarillo, ventura county. a lot of the farms there were owned by japanese before the war, and precious few got their farmland back after the war (although many farms retain their japanese names). it's a fucking damn shame that happened, and little tokyo in la has a nice touch where the streets will have plaques saying what businesses and families used to be there and who were forced to move because of the war.
oh totally. but i don't think anyone in the modern day would believe that fact about your uncle to be anything but fascinating
if the government knocked on your door right now and sent you to a similar camp, would you really feel confident that nothing worse would happen?
there was kind of warning. we were providing the enemies of their ally with weapons for 2 years before the attack. that's technically an act of war.
even then, it still doesn't make sense to discriminate against all muslims for something a minority of them did, terrible as it is. it's not encouraged to discriminate against white people for all they did, such as the slave trade and eradication of native americans. it wouldn't make sense because not all of them were responsible for it.
the conditions of many reserves are absolutely terrible, but there's no easy fix to that. the reason it's so fucked up to begin with is because of the horrible mental situation they were left with after years of government attack. so many turned to alcoholism, drug addiction, and violence that ended up preventing or squandering all the proposed quick fixes like "give them more money" and "build them all new homes". what the government's been doing for a while is attempting to remedy that situation so that the simpler solutions will actually stick and help. government subsidized higher ed for example. nowhere near enough has been done (people want lower taxes more than they want a repaired indigenous population), but it's important to understand that it's not something with an easy fix we just haven't done.
white racialists or white supremacists typically have some respect for the japanese/chinese/koreans because they have high iqs and low crime rates. the arguments they make for black inferiority can't be used against the japanese/chinese because they outperform whites in school etc...if anything, they are seen as at the opposite end of a spectrum to blacks. plus the japanese are light skinned. strictly speaking, white supremacists are kind of north east asian supremacists on the criteria they seem to think are most important...but then they argue that asians are too naturally conformist to have developed the advanced civilisation of the west on their own, or something along those lines, so they find a way back to saying whites are the best lol. just reporting what i've noticed about those ideologies. those impressions and feelings probably go way back.
just because imperial japan was acting like a bunch of crazy fucks doesn't at all justify the internment though. context is fine but it doesn't lessen how incredibly poor a decision it was by the us government to lock up its own citizens.
for many years the us has wanted japan to build up a stronger force. article 9 of their constitution has been a big hurdle that past american administrations have come to regret (basically saying japan can't have its own military). there's nothing in the constitution stating that america is their military, but there are treaties basically to that effect (that the us will defend them).
it probably was. the only countries i'm aware of that have ever asked the us to put bases there are south vietnam and south korea. the rest of them are either joint nato bases or from peace treaties as far as i'm aware.
except he wast rounding up only people of a certain religion? he just killed whoever wouldn't surrender peacefully.
not the ones at my high school. roughly 13% of my class subscribed to white supremacy views enough to get nazi tattoos. when my mother was debating with one such kid she said, "my son, your classmate of 10 years, is japanese. what would you do if hitler came to power again?" he looked her dead in the eye and said, "i'd kill him".
i think asians assimilated better than white people.
yeah seriously. this may be ignorance, but there's a very narrow set of peoples i'd picture when i picture "mexican + latino + south american." asian is russian + chinese + korean + indian + turkish + filipino + ....
there's a big difference between the chinese who've been living in canada for that long, who are mostly cantonese, and the more recent immigrants, who are more likely to be mandarin speaking and mainlanders. also i'd definitely attribute the housing bubble in the gta and vancouver area to the chinese population. not even overseas investors; i just moved into a new home and all the neighbors i've met so far are chinese. source: parents immigrated to canada 16 years ago, live in fairly chinese community.
i agree, i would say most of the first generation chinese i know voted for trump. ironically these people dont think about trump's anti china comments. however as of right now they are kind of vindicated cause you know lower tax and trump has been pretty pro china after the election.
not necessarily. peru, for example has a huge japanese population and even had a former japanese-descended president. they still refer to any non indian asian as chinese.
pretty sure poland requested a base there. but it might have just been a term of the missile defense treaty.
genghis khan (10-15 million killed) and timur the lame (17 million killed) may have bested hitler.
he's/she's forgetting to mention that there were riots involved during the hosting of the south african rugby team, which ended up being a pretty big deal for new zealand politically. the springbok riots if you're interested.
that doesn't even make sense if it's remotely true. japanese were germany's allies. i feel stupid for even pointing this out.
my wife is cambodian-american and i am white. we travel a lot and get a lot of funny interactions. my favorite is traveling in central and south america. i know spanish well and she doesn't know any. but the locals would always come up and talk to her thinking she is from the area because of her skin tone. she would just look at them confused, and then look at me, and i would translate back to her and the local. they would always look at her like she was the stupidest person they ever met. it happened all the time.
europeans didn't assimilate, they conquered and took over.
they tried, but we threw their tea in the boston harbor! america!!
sure, there are lots of wealthy chinese people who have immigrated to canada who have bought homes to live in which contributes to higher prices. generally speaking, i don't take issue with that. i do take issue with people who buy property and don't live here, i take issue with people who move here and don't disclose their foreign income and assets to the cra, and i take issue with the quebec investor route to immigration because it is clearly taken advantage of. i don't take issue with every ethnically chinese person i see just because i can't afford a house in vancouver. but a lot of people do. and that's a problem.
which is ironic, because if your parents came roughly 30 years ago they would've been a part of the wave blamed by white canadians for the housing bubble then.
last year the chinese government had an affair and issued a warning for chinese americans not to tell anybody about it
the joke is on them. most first generation chinese don't make enough for trump's proposed tax cuts to significantly help them, if they are ever even passed, which is far from certain. moreover, all it will take is one perceived insult from the prc for trump to lash out at ethnic chinese to the fullest extent he can. demagogues are always looking for a minority group to monger fear against, it's the only way they distract from their failing policies while robbing the country blind.
heck, my peruvian friend refers to her non-asian son as "el chino" because he has narrow eyes
i just want to note that as a southerner who's made it a point to not be an asshole to people, i'm kind of bummed out about being lumped in with the lot you're describing. guess this is a small sampling of what's it's like to be the target of prejudice. maybe more white people should experience it so they can be more empathetic.
can you elaborate on how aa men fair better in the south or midwest? it seems 99% white there
i agree with your comment and the one you're replying to. it's insane to deny that it's impossible to separate race and southern culture/politics/whatever. but it's not *everybody* down there. not that you said it was everybody. you just said often. which could have a ton of definitions, and would ring too creepily true some places, and less true others. i just don't want someone coming to this comment chain and being like "look at these ignorant or horrible liberals" :
caucasian has two meanings, the one i was referring to is the biological taxon not the caucasus people.
this weren't genocides though, they were wars. mao killed many through famine and so did stalin. these aren't concentrated killing of people they are wars
29 countries also boycotted the 1976 olympics because the ioc wouldn't ban nz for the all blacks touring south africa.
i'd argue racism in general doesn't make sense. i'm guessing you don't have to see a group of people as equal to ally with them. and you don't have to see a future with them in it to be partners in the present. as for the validity, i can't say for certain it's true. i heard from a second hand source, my mother. i trust she didn't lie about it.
chinese workers were used as slave labor after civil war. there's no 3/5 because it's 0/5. chinese exclusion act was the only federal law that discriminated against an ethnic group or a race (it's still part of the u.s. codes). chinese americans didn't reach legally full human status till wwii when china became part of the allies. separate but equal? that's an upgrade until very recent. not going to start the which group has the worst past contest but it's wrong to overlook what any group has been through. the whole idea of america is taking the unwanted and making them part of us. of course the chinese were lucky: wwii and the cold war (chinese americans were strongly anti-communist back then) gave a huge political boost.
reminds me of the time i was visiting canyon de chelly in arizona and our elderly trail guide addressed a group of south korean tourists in navajo. they weren't wearing typical tourist clothing and they had tans, so it was a fairly easy mistake.
i used this argument talking to my trump supporting family while discussing the recent immigrantion issues. they said if the native americans had been smarter they wouldn't have let us. that's some real cognitive dissonance right there.
maybe alabama. i live 2.5 hours from atlanta and it gets backwards pretty quickly the farther you get outside i-285
it definitely happens. i was staying in the flatonia, tx area for training five years ago. my trainer told me point blank she was shunned for talking to the hispanics working at her plant. "you can pass for white, so you should be ok" she told me. my husband couldn't pass for white, and shit got really dicey because we looked like an interracial couple. if looks could kill... eventually the cleaning staff explained it would probably be better if we stayed in the hotel rather than explore the town. i grew up in san antonio. it blew my damn mind that there was a town less than three hours away where this shit happens. where i work it still happens. i've had people up and quit when they found out a black man was going to be working with us. people astound me.
if you read my other comments i've talked about how it's inaccurate to generalize everyone in the same pool, and in the original context i talked mainly of jim crow, but with the knowledge that many of the same attitudes carry over today. i'm not trying to lump all southerners into the same racist basket, but i do see other comments in the thread that imply just that, and for that i apologize.
no, it's not everybody, but as someone who has lived in both the south and the northeast, it's a far, far, far, far, far, far, far, far, far larger segment of the population. far.
discounting the ones that died from disease, you are still talking about 60 million dead.
the people that the mongol warlords killed were civilians who happened to be living in the realms that the mongols were at war with. but anyway, i wasn't comparing mao and stalin, but hitler. hitler was definitely fighting in a war.

but who is us? present day united states was settled by all sorts of european and asian countries, and what we have now is still a combination of originally many countries. if it wasnt "us" that conquered and took over, another country would have done it
right... ive lived in ga for awhile and traveled all over the state, little towns included, and i find a hard time believing this. maybe if they were trying to get a room in a fucking trailer park with nazi flags all over it..
had to pass through vidor, tx a few years ago with the youth group i was chaperoning. out of 50 kids and adults, we had 5 who were white and all the asians were filipino. so aside from looking super ethnic, none of us asians were an "acceptable" shade of yellow lol. we went through a couple fast food restaurants before deciding on the two places that had mexicans working in the back. it was sad experiencing the blatant racism to our kids. people either gave us dirty looks during our time there or hastened to leave when we entered. that was unnerving.
assuming this is the proof for the key on julian dead man switch after they cut off his iternet.. is he alive? i'm scrolling g through thread now for proof of life.
we are concerned about anyone that gets access to the mass spying system the us has built. we will be happy to publish any documents on changes/abuses/policy changes on these topics and others from the trump administration.
this really needs more attention. wikileaks' information has always proven to be genuine, but the nonsense posted to their twitter account makes it quite clear that the leaks are being curated to push an agenda.
this question is most interesting to me. why has wikileaks' social media been so silent, letting people go days and weeks speculating whether or not assange was dead or alive, when a simple tweet could have quelled everything?
this is an excellent question. "well we have private communications we don't want people to see."
we have an editorial policy to publish only information that we have validated as true and that is important to the political, diplomatic or historical. we believe in transparency for the powerful and privacy for the rest. we publish in full in an uncensored and uncensorable fashion. we have had to, and will have to, take risks ourselves (the secret grand jury that began due to our 2010 publications continues to this day) in a number of the publications we do. but we are not risk adverse and will continue to publish fearlessly.
yeah. my guess has always been if they released it all at once. it would quickly be forgotten.
this has been my biggest gripe the entire month leading to the election. if they had this info on dnc/hilary why not release it earlier in the year when the primaries where in full swing. it would of evened the playing field for bernie to be the nominee. they say they release info as soon as they get it so it could of been unlucky timing but part of me wonders what could of been.
well, i can think of two reasons why. one, they didn't have it yet (the dnc email group proceeds beyond the primary), and two, if what's released is vetted for propriety, that takes time and manpower.
those are insurance files for next leaks. if assange dies, dead man's swich will activate and relase private keys to decipher insurance files. and truth would be still leaked...
our submissions system is based on the concept of sources being as anonymous and protected as possible. we dont want to know who our sources are for their protection, and ours.
the encrypted files we released a few days ago are insurance files. we have done this before. insurance files are encrypted copies of unpublished documents submitted to us. we do this periodically, and especially at moments of high pressure on us, to ensure the documents can not be lost and history preserved. you will not be able to see the contents of any of our insurance files, until and unless the we are in a position where we must release the key. but you can download them and help spread them to ensure their safe keeping. to download them you will need a torrent client (like transmission or utorrent for example).
this is a damn good question- if wikileaks is publishing information by groups with the soul purpose in mind of effecting elections, etc what are they doing to ensure they remain largely unbiased?
that link to that the_donald thread, was just an organized list of podesta email links right back to wikileaks website.
for the last 5 days we had a non-stop attempt at basic syn flood. what's worse, a lot of traffic, about 20tb burned in the same time.
no, they won't release info on the opposite side. this organization is clearly one sided and driven by factors we are unaware of. the claim that they are a noble cause setting free the people by releasing confidential information is a lie. they have a reason for doing what they did; if they did not, they would release information from all sources, not just information from one side which clearly influenced our democratic process. this organization is not a noble cause; it should be condemned, and i hope some government, somewhere takes them down.
could you elaborate on this? is this in relation to the comet pizza/human trafficking post above?
no proof, no pgp key. he may well be dead or captured.
no, there is just a hell of a lot more of that sentence. he also goes on to say that he doesn't hate hillary clinton and that he believes she's someone who was "eaten up by her own aspirations."
that's a mealy mouthed answer. it's trump who is going to get access, not just 'anyone'.
hasn't trump expressed interest in executing snowden? or imprisoning him?
they basically helped trump win, where did they think the fury would be directed?
not to mention the antisemetic echoes tweets posted there a few months back.
this ama is a total farce. wikileaks has lost all credibility. it's basically the "headline news" to rt's cnn. it used to be legit, but russia got it's mitts on them, so now assange's stooges do the work of the kremlin.
they're a corrupt sell out. i have no interest in the election but their bias is becoming blatant and pathetic
it would need to be submitted. they don't actively hack or persue.
because they want people to talk about wikileaks. if they confirmed that assange was fine and just playing skyrim se or something, they'd lose some publicity
i'm not one of those people who thinks he isn't alive, i just felt it was odd that there has been little commentary on the situation by anyone close to him. thanks for explaining.
wikileaks is as corrupt as hrc. the one sided release of dnc information only served the interests of assange. assange used this organization to influence the us elections as revenge on the obama administration for his 'incarceration' in the ecuadorian embassy. wikileaks long ago stopped acting in the interests of the average person and have been brokering the info they posess for assange ' own interests. anonymous should burn assange by fully exposing his machinations.
i mean if you're releasing other people's emails indiscriminately and without regard for people's privacy...
then why did you carefully time releases to damage clinton, rather than just publish it when you received it, months ago?
as far as i know, wikileaks say that part of the service they provide to their sources is for the leaks to have the optimal impact. the way they hope to achieve that is to release documents in digestible chunks rather than in one huge batch. they also said itt they can't leak things all at once for technical/financial reasons.
what is this "dead man switch"? some heart sensor connected to ifttt? if assange(0) instruct gmail to email all passkey?
i read it. fuck that was thorough and i think he's right, wl is not being honest about its agenda.
but you defend your sources as being non-russian even though you purposely make sure you couldn't know one way or another?
please don't recommend utorrent. recommend something else, like qbittorrent. utorrent has become more and more shady
please continue to dig on your end. we know this stuff exists in the world, the least we can do is make it hard for them to get away with it. thank you.
no its important, the leaks were definetley viewed as assange vs hillary by a lot of many americans and most agree they had a some if not a large impact on the election. this can easily be construed as partisan in many eyes, especially since the leaks were almost all one sided, and things like trumps tax return stayed hidden and his financial ties around the world relatively ignored. did assange just want to throw a grenade into the whole process? because that's what it feels like to a lot of us. also if you get your leaks from russian hacks, aren't you just playing into russias schemes while they can use you as a middle man/scapegoat?
he wants to execute snowden, yes. he never spoke on assange. also assange can't be a traitor necessarily because he's not american.
i wonder if assange and the team would be comfortable with their social security numbers and other sensitive information hitting the web. can we find this anywhere? has it been leaked already?
a mouthpiece of the russian government has intervened in the american election to help sway the outcome towards their preferred candidate and the republicans could not be happier about it. so many words i never thought i'd say.
so no one in the world thought to hack donald trump?
damn it! if only there was a way i could get locked in a building and play skyrim 24/7 with no responsibilities.
they have so far ignored any question that could indicate defensive or culpable behavior.
it's a timer connected to a reset button. you press the reset button every so often to prove you're alive. when you stop pressing the reset button, e.g. if you die, or if your internet access has been severed, the timer ticks down to zero. when the timer hits zero, something happens, in this case probably the release of decryption keys.
maybe just a few simple questions, then? why did you threaten russia with leaks, and then go to russia, get a tv show on russian government funded media, and never release information on russia? and why do you now appear to refuse to say anything negative about russia and even defend/dismiss accusations against them? or even simpler: where are the leaks you threatened russia with and why aren't you releasing them?
quite a bit, he's the inside source that was talking actual shit about russisa ties. daniel schmitt was much tamer in his wording.
we are not withholding that information. we publish as fast as we can. the insurance files contain the publications we are working on, as soon as they are ready we will publish them. however, we are under many attacks at this moment and so, to ensure they are not lost, whatever happens to us, we put out these insurance files.
it's either acceleration or an agenda. it's possible they believed the people had to be pushed into direct action because they did not organize around the snowden leaks. this is what i want to believe, because if not this entire situation is more fucked than i thought. we have the equivalent of cointelprov2.0 on our hands and if they're in line with the state, the resistance is fucked.
i know this is divergent from the original point, but do you have any idea what hatshaped food you [would] eat? i suggest a hamentaschen, but it's not my mouth.
i think the answer to that is pretty clear from their past actions.
i'd like to see their email correspondence. what are they hiding? or would it simply be embarrassing?
there's also an element of cowardice there. you can fuck with liberal democracies all you want; people will support you, the governments won't try to kill you, and the sordid details they're hiding (which i don't like personally) are actually surprising. much harder to leak chinese and russian secrets, esp when apparently the russians are your primary source of material. can't bite the hand that feeds you.
this is the thing that everyone should be concerned about imo...including those that voted for trump. now what, russia's going to be gerry-rigging all future elections since they have that much sway now?
the problem with wikileaks is julian assange. an egomaniac who must put himself in the forefront of everything having to do with wikileaks. we need a team of people who manage a wikileaks type site, but have no interest in publicity themselves. and who change regularly, to avoid corruption.
its not the source that desires the impact, it is wikileaks.
they severed his internet but luckily he got the mods already. 3 cheers for no bethesda always on drm.
and half their answers sound like what you'd expect from politicians.
sounds sort of like a black box from nikita. but seriously, logically what you're doing makes sense.
eh, if i was a legitimate business and i found out i'd accidentally designed a logo identical to a pedophile symbol, i'd change it. i don't think it's that damning.
shush it's a global underground pedophile ring conspiring to undermine donald trump, who is the only chance for the worlds salvation.
is this how cloudflare and the like work? they are able to better handle the multi handshakes?
why, there's no benefit? and i'm not talking benefit for them, or benefit to pursue a political agenda. there is simply no editorial or journalistic benefit to doing this. there is no free speech war or open information battle to win or lose by publishing something as insignificant, and useless, as a random citizens personal information like that.
this is so true it's amazing. they think it's acceptable to lay bare the guts of an organisation, where the hell is the transparency for wikileaks? if they don't have an agenda and aren't doing anything dodgy or lying let's see their e-mail correspondence.
welcome to our world. you are one of the unlucky ones that watched something and realized the most fucked up thing on earth is basically unknown or disbelieved by society.
yes, and also they have algorithms that attempt to detect and disallow illegitimate traffic.
bunch of hypocrites i say. it's only fine when it's other people who's safety/livelihood they're putting on the line.
that is only certain for emails received from gmail accounts. the sent emails and many of the received emails have no dkim signature.
keep digging. it's crazy. we know it's crazy. but it's something. and the shills we've been complaining about, on a scale of 1-10, they cranked it to 99.
the uk had one, the catholic church had one, hollywood had one. would anybody be shocked if us politicians had one too?
and what's even worse: the syn packet contains the sender's ip. but if you never actually want the connection established, you can write any address in there, and the server will send syn-ack there. so you can't even find out where the traffic is coming from, unless you control the network.
which basically explains the exploit. the syn flooder puts somebody else's ip address, which won't respond because it didn't initiate the request. this is a flaw with the current ip (internet protocol), ipv4. ipv6 doesn't have this flaw, but we are probably 15 years before "the internet" even starts considering implementing it.
yes, apolitical ddos is usually a response to a site owner not paying blackmail, since the cost of the blackmail is less than the cost of the expected fake traffic and lost income from the service being slow/down.
i mean... what leads this to being about a child sex ring though? i'll admit it does seem to indicate something, but i'm not sure what.
i love you too! and i don't know, if there is...*chuckles* a definite answer. i love that it's open to interpretation. she gets on that bus, and... i hope that she's going somewhere good. and i loved working on that film. thora birch was incredible to work with, and scarlett johannson, and terry zwigoff, they were really smart and very funny, and paid attention to every detail. the director would get obsessed with people in the background. sometimes, after thora and i would finish a scene, we would see terry walk up to us, and we would think he was going to say something to us, but he would walk right by us and give very specific directions to the background actors, telling them "okay, let's do this again!"
i have not seen the tv show fargo. but i hear wonderful things about it. i do hope to watch it... someday! someday i hope to watch a lot of shows, haha, that i don't seem to see.
well - maybe people will realize by now that i don't feel very comfortable doing these things, so i guess i don't put a lot of thought into - to be honest, i'd rather not be answering any questions. i guess if i *had* to think of a question - um... you can put "long pause here" - i don't really have one.
um... i love elvis costello, and i think one album that i go back to of his is "get happy." but he's done a lot of amazing work over the years. same thing with tom waits. you know... "mule variations" is an incredible album, as is all of his work. i'll always go back to "abbey road," even though i haven't listened to it fully in years.
just his enthusiasm, you know? he was so excited to be making a film. and... to be directing his first film. in rehearsals, the rehearsals were just as exciting as the filmmaking! he would set up - this whole improvisation of us robbing the jewelry store, so that we would improvise and act out what went wrong. he just had, you know, has a lot of joy, in him! and it was - it made all of us also feel like we were working on our first film.
um... goodfellas is one that i always stop and watch. just recently i was... watching tv with my brother, and we came across casino, and we had to watch that. pretty much... any scorsese movie, haha, i think i would stop and watch! and then a movie that i've always loved but i hadn't seen it in years because i'd watched it so many times that i didn't know if i could watch it any more is it's a wonderful life. also... let me see... fat city, with jeff bridges and susan tyrell... any john cassavettes film...
yeah, trees lounge was something that - took everything out of me! i so wanted to write something, and direct something, and write something that i could be in... but i never necessarily saw myself as a writer or a director. i had been doing work with a good friend of mine, the actor mark boon, jr. - he plays the character of bobby on sons of anarchy - and we used to do a lot of theater together, throughout the 1980's on the lower east side and in the east village - and so we always created our own work, and that's what i was trying to do with the film, too. you know. to write a part for myself, for boon, for my brother michael who's a wonderful actor, and for friends of mine, like rockets redglare, who's a wonderful comedian and actor... so... i've continued to direct sometimes, and sometimes i have a hand in some of the things i've directed in, in the writing, but yeah! maybe in the future.
well, uh, for all the deeds fans out there... french fries and oreos, definitely.
you know, i really would go back to the 40's. i'm not saying it was because of boardwalk empire, but i always used to dream about, you know, being on the set of a buster keaton film. i think that would've been really, really cool.
favorite boardwalk *food?* um... well, i always like a good pretzel. but i guess i hadn't really thought about the food. it was mostly... about the clothes on that show. and those amazing sets. it was a time period that... i think that they really put a lot of thought, you know, into what, what they wore! and it was just a great time for fashion.
as far as roles go, i don't tend to hold onto that stuff. if i passed on anything, i think it was for the right reason. top 3 favorite books... yeah, you know, there's this book called you can't win by jack black (but it's not the jack black that we know of today - this was a guy at the turn of the century, who used to ride the rails, and led the hobo life, and wrote about it as a cautionary tale - he drank too much, he did too many drugs - but it's hard not to read that book and not want to live the life that he led! it's a book that really inspired william burroughs, and actually, he had two books i really love - he's got a lot of books - but i really loved his books junkie and queer). junkie really describes the life that william s. burroughs lived in new york - his life of, i guess he was writing about the 1940's, and then queer is when he lived in mexico city, and jack kerouac's on the road has always been a favorite too.
*what would i do...* just watch tv, or read the newspaper. drink a cup of coffee. go walking in the park.
i would tip you after one cup of coffee. if you're nice.
wow, til steve buscemi used to be a firefighter on 9/11. i'm going to go make a til post about it.
the weirdest one? um... i dunno. sometimes people will say "bushoomi" or if they pronounce the c as a hard c - i guess it's hard to describe in print - like "booo-stemmi."
*to keep myself calm, hmmm.* there's different songs that would pop into my head. it depends what i'm listening to. right now, diana krall has a new album out that i like a lot, so there's songs on there i've been humming in my head. she does some really wonderful interpretations of songs that i knew from years ago. one of them is alone again, naturally. or the jim croce song operator.
yeah, i like homemade soup. i like chicken soup. i don't like canned soup.
um... i guess either a reese's peanut butter cup, or almond joy.
my spirit animal. so tell me what a spirit animal is? *yeah.* maybe my spirit animal is - a - monkey.
well, you know, a few years ago, my good friend stanley tucci and i decided to start a production company, and we found a wonderful producer in wren arthur. she used to produce with robert altman. and so the 3 of us started this company, so that stanley and i can direct films, but we also decided that we should develop other things, tv shows and such, and... we also decided that it would be good to maybe look into the documentary film world. we did make a documentary, called a good job: stories of the fdny, for hbo, that liz garbus directed... and then the filmmakers dana flor and toby oppenheimer, i'm not quite sure how they knew wren, but they told her they had been shooting in dc, this gang of kids that they thought were pretty incredible, and they showed us some of the raw footage, and wren and i were really excited by what we saw, and we thought it was an important story to tell, so we wanted to give them as much support as we could, so we are co-producers.
i don't think he's weird at all. i think he is who he is. and i'd love to do con air 2 with him.
well... where would i go? i don't know. i don't think about traveling that much. one of the most beautiful places that i've been to, though, was sicily, and i'd like to get back there someday. *where would i go?* maybe south america. i've never been there.
you know, i have to be honest. it's these questions that make me nervous. i don't know why! i think it's a very personal thing to ask! you can say that: i'm kidding. but yeah, i don't know why these questions make me nervous. hahaha! but they do!
i... obviously, i think it's clear that i've never done this before! and it makes me extremely uncomfortable. and i don't go on the internet a lot.
well, i'm very partial to billy madison, because that was one of the first films that adam did on his own, as part of his production company. and the film that we did before that was called airheads, which was directed by michael lehman, and that was the film adam and i met on, where we played brothers in the band, "the lone rangers"... and i always have a great time working with adam. i loved the character i played in the wedding singer. i just worked with him again on the western that he's shooting now called the ridiculous six. but yeah, i would say... i don't know if i have a favorite, but i really do love the character in billy madison.
well, i can tell you the one that i probably had the most fun *making* was stanley tucci's film the imposters. this was the movie he made after big night, and we were all on a ship, and i played a character named happy franks, who was a sort of a suicidal lounge-singer... and it had an amazing cast of stanley, and oliver platt, and libby taylor, and elizabeth brocco, alison janney, tony shahloub - we had so much fun making it, and it's a very funny film as well. billy connolly is in it as well.
*hmmm.* i guess i don't read enough philosophy to answer that question.
it's very good but i feel like nucky thompson would have fixed all of the problems there quickly.
i think if i saw you and john turturro bowling together i'd be unable to be convinced that i wasn't hallucinating. i'd have to leave the bowling alley, because walter's about to start waving the fucking gun around.
i'll take honest uncomfortableness over singleminded shilling every time. big fan of your work, mr. buscemi; have a good one!
"abbey road" and "mule variations" are my favorite albums by their respective artists...i have something in common with steve buscemi.
he was a man who loved the outdoors... and bowling, and as a surfer he explored the beaches of southern california, from la jolla to leo carrillo and... up to... pismo. he died, like so many young men of his generation, he died before his time. in your wisdom, lord, you took him, as you took so many bright flowering young men at khe sanh, at langdok, at hill 364. these young men gave their lives. and so would donny. donny, who loved bowling. and so, theodore donald karabotsos, in accordance with what we think your dying wishes might well have been, we commit your final mortal remains to the bosom of the pacific ocean, which you loved so well. good night, sweet prince.
til that tarantino made them do the robbery scene even if its the one thing we don't see in the movie... interesting.
i have recently discovered that i will stop and watch goodfellas even if there's no sound.
trees lounge and lonesome jim were both spectacular. thank you for making interesting movies.
heh, brit here, literally all we remember about your performance in con air was your amazing caricature as a pedo. you nailed it. feel free to join our political parties.... edit - didn't mean that as a slight, love your work, and thanks for the boggly eyes and the cross-atlantic entertainment. there are not many people that can do that. edit again - i'm a brit, and i thought that guy was the best actor in conair. despite cage... edit thrice - cheers mate, from all of the uk.
that was a film i did with adam sandler, years ago, and um, my character likes his pizza with a lot of different toppings on it.
you can't win is now out of stock on amazon. reddit...walletofdeath?
if you tell yourself you're the real superman, you can fly too.
what's nice? take you in the back and suck your dick?
would you mind if i repost your post about it in a few hours?
buscemi is my last name too - although i pronounce it bu-see-me. i have cousins who pronounce it bu-shay-me. i guess we're just a confused bunch of people haha :)
steve i'd like you to know that you are my spirit animal.
i would so watch con air 2. you sir are one of my favorite actors, period. your character is just legendary. i always love what you bring to the table each time. thank you for being you.
you can come crash at my place in argentina. we can eat asado (best grilled meat in the world), have a beer and watch 50 shades of grey.
lol i'm sorry about that. any sandwich, any day, there.
i really enjoyed that character too even though i felt so sad for him.
quickly? no way. he would ignore them and let them fester over the course of a season, showing annoyance instead of decisiveness. at the end, when forced to act, he'd come away with a partial victory.
i completely forgot about that movie! must watch again soon.
"dave, can you get me off the hook? for old time's sake."
the tap-dancing cameo was supposed to be random, john was showing the audience how to get viewers in 'random' ways without advertising dangerous supplements. the 'i'm the best damn inspector' cameo, though, i agree on, it being a bit unexpected
take mr. buscemi's advice: don't take mr. buscemi's advice.
now imagine how much some people would pay for that tape, if it exists.
people in the upper midwest have fargo-fest all the time and don't even realize it.
see this? world's smallest violin. playing just for her.
no need for sound. i could overdub that movie. terribly, but i could do it.
he killed his wife and wore her face in a fit of rage. it was actually a caricature of "the bad criminal". the real bad guy was once a professor, not the guy who attacked his wife and stole her face in a fit of psychopathic rage. and who's to say being a pervert has anything to do with being a criminal at all? there was one rape guy, and both sides hated him.
actually, you just have to throw yourself at the ground and miss.
i don't think victoria is gonna want to read that back to him...
steve may get onto me for misquoting here, but i remember something about multiple orthodontists offering to fix his teeth and him saying that if they fixed his teeth he'd never be able to act again. not sure if that answers your question but i figured i'd throw it out there.
okay i'll post it again in a couple of days to make sure everyone on reddit becomes enlightened with this knowledge
exactly what i was thinking. barton fink is a movie that everyone should watch.
holy crap, con air is about 18 years old. jeez. felt like i just watched it "a couple years ago".
he was leaning towards honey nut cheerios no doubt.
he was happy at the end though, so it's all good :)
the old man basically says he's waiting for death. eventually, the bus shows up and takes him away. there are no other passengers on the bus. it isn't on a schedule, labeled in any way, and doesn't indicate that it is going anywhere. she then takes the same path he does. she doesn't have to wait for the bus, it comes to her exactly when she wants it, implying, to me, that she caused her own death. she also did all the tell tale things that people do before they commit suicide, like giving her things away, and forgiving everyone. there are other more subtle clues, such as the bench image that i posted that says, "life, not in service". at some point in the movie, she says, "if so and so happens, i'll kill myself" and that thing happens. she sort of said it jokingly, but i remember it having a weird vibe. i remember there being other things, but i haven't watched the movie in a few years. i'm definitely going to go back and watch it again soon.
haha ok, boardwalk's version of al capone would be the quick one.
it's on netflix. just rewatched it a few weeks back. so good.
his comment really pulled the thread together man.
i've met smokey quite a few times. super nice guy but a little reserved like his character. he's still a touring musician. he services his car in austin where i used to work and was friends with my manager. i had pics but lost that phone :(
i am telling the truth. the last sentence was a lie.
i mean fargo is at heart a traditional great drama film that appeals to adult audiences.
yup, there was a lot of press about it along with all the oscar nods and things. it was a big movie in 1996.
how do you like your steak.....medium rare.....huh. an aristocrat! oh i smell a fan dub haha
if the option to not is there then i will not because i find the notion ridiculous.
i've read that it was either tough in the beginning or the roles were a real drag. i loves me some steve buscemi.
true... it was the scene and the way the music fit in it really well.
being that we just heard how particular the director was, i'd imagine the man's position on the bench in your picture was intentional. leaving the words "life novice." i haven't really extrapolated that thought any further yet, but maybe there's something there. like while her life may be going nowhere(not in service), she still young and inexperienced, and has much to learn. i dunno, it's 3:30 in the morning.
and the threads are literally what tied the rug together.
i seriously taken aback by the sheer dedication of /u/walter_sobchak
and so many of his perfectly placed comments woosh right over peoples heads, only to get 1 or 2 upvotes. this novelty account just made my day.
yeah, but it's so understated that it's on a parallel with comedy but what really makes it a masterpiece is that because of that understated drama and understated comedy it somehow borders on the absurd.
i enjoyed it, but it wasn't like shaun of the dead or anything.
.95 now nearly 40 min after your comment. he's raking it in.
his appearance, speech, and mannerisms are an accurate representation of a common sort of man you might encounter in that location
yeah people look at me like i'm crazy when i tell them it's a black comedy ... i think many of said people don't realize that it's not actually based on true events
i don't think much will ever be like shaun of the dead.
i thought it was supposed to be implied that her innocence cures him.
my fiance and i watch a lot of tv shows and movies with subtitles on, and when there are small typos, i think i literally "follow along." we were watching some movie recently where they talked about "tulle" and the captioning read "tool" and i was like "doh!!"
wait... are you the same jimmy tango that made the fatbusters with vibrating heat beads?
i know the two are different films, but i preferred how over-the-top hot fuzz was to shaun of the dead. it was definitely unique though, and i love everything about it.
this is the correct answer. it was a redemption story, i don't know wtf these people are thinking.
that's what i thought, however it clearly wasn't well done if the general consensus was that he was gonna do stuff to her
i thought it was supposed to be a little tense in the "is he going to fucking eat this kid or what?!" sense. everyone is saying pedo, but he's hyped up/secured in a similar fashion to hannibal lecter.
i don't know why this is so below. this should be engraved on every toilet. flushable means "yeah it can go down the water hole" but it also means "we can't assure you it will deintegrate into smaller pieces so it will eventually clog your pipes if you flush this too often" and it's a pain in the arse for water treatment plants. piece of advice for those who doesn't know this yet: condoms shouldn't be flushed. listen to the plumber: toilet paper and human waste
to expand on that; i teach at our local apprenticeship school, if we could find guys/girls that have a good attitude and the willingness to learn that would make my job so much easier. i teach skills that no one can ever take away. sit in class, appreciate that someone is taking their time to teach you how to do this work, and be prepared to take the reigns and prove that you want to do this work. i don't know what scale is where you're at, but it's good money to be made and benefits on top in most places.
household plumbing only gets into specialized tools once you get behind the walls. everything else is channel locks, dope and teflon tape.
the anode rod in the heater is bad. it can be pulled out and cut off to fix the problem but i recommend calling someone to do it as it can cause problems and you need special tools for it
define shower handle. i'm assuming you have a store bought hand held shower head. and it doesn't swivel properly so when you shift it to wash yourself the supply line comes loose. buy a better quality head
im 34 and my helper is 30. i started plumbing when i was 19, i don't see any young helpers anymore. kids are not getting into this line of work
absolutely the worst thing you can do to a drain line
as long as people are alive we will need plumbing. it's not a trade that will go anywhere. it pays quite well and we need young blood
remove the trim of the faucet. the circular disk that is right against the wall hides the shut off valves. sounds like they didn't open the hot side. it'll be a flat head screw
that's because they didn't drill a hole big enough. the only way to stop it is to find the tight fit cut the pipe out and make a bigger hole. you're 100% right that it's expansion. probably sounds like water dripping in the wall. cheapest route is to just deal with it. it won't cause any problems
i had to lay an extension ladder on the ground above a sewage leak under a house and crawl on top of the ladder to keep myself out of the sewer and fix the leak
yes. the fork may not have made it out of the toilet. take a big wad of toilet paper and flush it. if the toilet stops up the fork is stuck in the toilet and will continue to cause problems. if you are able to flush multiple wads of toilet paper i wouldn't worry
i've never heard it called brown friday but for big residential service companies it's one of the busiest days of the year. i used to clear 8-12 backed up kitchen sinks the day after thanksgiving.
no you moving the water closet has absolutely no effect on your drain. it might have broken the wax seal, but you would see water on the floor if that happened. a gurgle in the toilet is a sign of a partial stoppage in your sewer line. if i were you i would let it ride until it stops up. but i can fix my own issues. if you have another water closet in the house, flush it and then go back to the problem closet. if the water in the bowl is moving that proves you have a stoppage. you can either rent a sewer machine and be very careful while using it (the machine can break you, literally, it can put you in the hospital) or you need to call a professional.
i've never heard of the water just not working. sounds like there's debris in the stop valves. take them off and clean them out
you don't need a new toilet, only new guts. very easy, take a picture of the inside of your tank and take it to the hardware store, they sell kits with everything you need, new flush valve and new flapper. your issue sounds like the flapper but if you're going to get in there might as well replace the flush valve too, very inexpensive, will take about 15-20 minutes. if your shutoff valve is stuck (sometimes happens, especially in older homes) then start with the flapper. if the shutoff valve is stuck usually easiest to shut the water off to the house unless you are capable of replacing the shut off valve.
there should be a r/askplumbers sub. i'd be up for helping people out from time to time.
you need to replace the washers on the stems, possibly the seats too. for more diy instructions in need a photo of your faucet and you will need to purchase seat wrenches (possibly)
yea, many times. have been called out to a party then asked to stay
yes get a new one from a hardware store. the beveled washers that come with it create the seal, the nut is tightened down to push the washer into place. get it hand tight and then give it a 1/4 turn with a pair of pliers. don't over tighten it as you can break the nut
there should be a tall loop in the drain from the dishwasher to your sink. if it is just laid on the bottom of the cabinet then that's why the water is pooling
my father told me a story bout when they renewed the wiring in a hotel. after 2 weeks work everything is finished and the plumbing is live / charged. after a few hours looking and not finding how it can be they turn off everything and the plumbing was still live. the problem was in the building next door and the power traveled trough the main waterline.
yes, you'll need to open the ceiling. bite the bullet and do it sooner rather than later, because you're likely getting some crazy water damage up there. rotting wood, growing mildew, the longer you put it off the worse is going to be. it might be that a simple small hole will suffice to fix the problem. but the longer you put it off, the worse it's going to be.
if it's being replaced with the same basic type (single handle, two handles, whatever) it should be pretty much plug and play. so to speak.
use toilet paper. wipes (much like tampons) should not be flushed. (ignore what the package says, they aren't going to pay for your plumber if there are problems)
hmm i don't know about the weirdest reason for a call. but i once had to tell a man his wife was cheating on him and then charge him for it.
yes and no. i had a woman who i promise wanted to get a good pounding. but i couldn't act because of sexual harassment shit. if she had grabbed me it would have been on
all of the o rings on every flush valve i've seen have been fixed in place. that sounds like a play it by ear situation.
not an expert but it sounds like the valve the pushes the water between the faucet and the shower may be broken allowing for water to just spew out of both the faucet and shower head.
he replied: the ring has nothing to do with the rock. it's the floor that's not level. get some toilet shims from a hardware store and put them in the back of the toilet. never the front.
sounds like you need a new wax seal on your toilet.
more importantly - what's your local plumbing codes thoughts on air admittance valves? in many parts of the country/world they are allowed (in addition to the main vent stack usually) but in still plenty of places they aren't allowed or are only allowed in specific circumstances. know if they are legal locally, first, before doing anything :)
yes, it can, especially if a long-haired person uses the same shower as the wanker. stop thinking about this clog right now because it is nasty. go read the next comment instead.
perhaps the stop isn't open all the way. it's definitely not the shower head clogged
what about that pyrex container of pasta-soup that i should have dealt with months ago? note: it started out as just pasta.
i've used a few things. a pot of boiling water and a bit of soap will clear most stuff in a line. if you have frequent buildup, that green gel with enzymes does a good job. if you really want to clear it out, use the drain cleaner that is essentially lye or sulfuric acid. they get hot in their reaction with water (like boiling water) and have an extreme ph so it melts everything (like boiling water) that's in the line.
liquid or mostly liquid? grease is also a liquid and is bad for drains. you need to specify more.
once i started living on my own & having to actually pay for things, i figured out it was way easier and cheaper to take the time & try to fix something before calling in for help. i taught myself how to do some basic sink fixes and i am an absolute pro at unclogging drains. i know how to jump my car (this may seem like an easy one but a few years ago i knew *nothing* about cars, now i know a little bit) and will be taught how to change a tire soon. (ok ok i know! i didn't have a car for a long time!) i find this sort of work (plumbing, hvac, fixing cars) so interesting & useful. i'm 29 and female and am seriously considering taking some classes or workshops on more useful skills.
this is true for tankless on demand gas water heaters?
as an engineer: i love how you're getting clarifications on everything and listing assumptions.
meanwhile in canada in my plumbing class right now there a about 75% 19 yearolds
because, in fairness, there is really nothing to stay for, despite our psychotic "open for business" governor.
appliance guys are taking a hit from youtube as well. when you can order parts online and there are dudes showing you how to disassemble your refrigerator or change a dryer drum, harry homeowner winds up with decent success rates. then you get called in for fuck ups and make out a little better on that call, but with small ones going away.
that just means you will corner the market in a decade.
my wife's hair clogs up her bathroom sink and drains slowly. if not the liquid chemical stuff, what do you recommend for clearing a slow-draining sink?
... on a similar theme, how many tools do you need to function ? thinking along the lines of how much easier it is for a brickie to travel abroad and set up shop as opposed to a carpenter.
thanks, i was just about to start taking it apart to see for myself when i saw your ama. now i feel more confident. will report back with results
or, if you can get to the hole that the pipe runs through you might be able to fix it with some ptfe sheet. order some off the internet and cut a piece big enough to line the inside of the hole. if they have cut the hole really small, you won't be able to do a thing about it, but if it's just big enough you made be able to slide it in and it *may* improve things.
see stuff like this is why i hate plumbing. i can do most things but just plain don't want to. thanks for letting me pay you to put up with this shit (heh).
i had this exact problem, only my wife hadnt noticed she dropped the plastic fork in there. snaking didnt move it and i replaced the toilet. after getting it outside i smashed it open and found the damn fork.
how does one locate a stop valve? i'm on a well and the hot water to the master is very slow. i regularly find sand in the line when i take the shower head off. if there is a spot earlier in the system i could fix this, i would be so happy.
...but did you stay? please tell me you stayed
only 6/10 offer coffee or water? that's mandatory in my house. if you are doing any sort of service in my home i will offer you coffee/water/soda the second you start.
i just had this happen a few weeks ago but it turned out there was access to the area through a bedroom closet. the second plumber said that the tub/shower is placed so that it's not reachable by opening the ceiling. the first plumber that came quoted me over $1k to do the work which is why i called for a second opinion. the second plumber charged me for an hour (minimum charge) and $4.50 for parts - basically a seal and some other metal part i can't remember what it was called. but anyway - i'd always check for another access now.
caveat: if your tub doesn't have an access panel (many homes don't) a portion of the plug and play may involve demolition. ymmv
this comment is written exactly how i imagine a blue collar plumber talking in a sitcom, and i love it.
it's basically digested by now, it's basically puke
try a welding intro course - half the men in my class dropped out but i've never seen happier women. a lot of it doesn't apply to anything in a normal home, but it opens up a world of sticking things together with fire. melt stuff : )
can confirm: poked through 100 year old pipe. $450 later...
you have to get the right one. the one i got was specifically for toilets, the snake had a ~3foot plastic tube around it with a bend in it to get past the visible part of the toilet. basically you kept the snake retracted in to the sheath until it was inserted passed the entrance off the pipe, then you push the snake through the sheath to go further so it never touches the porcelain.
no, a tankless water heater doesn't have an anode rod. if the heater is more than a few years old, it may need to be cleaned or flushed to remove scale buildup.
me too. i hate asking questions in developer forums and having everyone refuse to be of help because i don't know the exact techie jargon.
ontario here, i distinctly remember wondering where the thousand kids who all wanted to be plumbers were going to find 1000 plumbing jobs at the exact same time and why 50% of the curriculum wasn't plumbing since there's no job that makes more than a plumber according to everyone's mental math (the mental math always comes down to making your own hours = infinite hours / unlimited money)
i mean no offense but you kinda got fucked cause you have two almost useless degrees
to an extent i agree. i'm a millennial that has stayed because i love my home. our business environment sucks and our population is dying off quicker than we can replenish it. i hope things brighten in the future but for now i stay for my family and because i enjoy the beauty and isolation of the state.
can confirm. repaired my own refrigerator myself by watching youtube videos and replacing pretty much every control part sequentially until i got to the hard one i was avoiding replacing but did it anyway and now the thing is good for another 20 years. total parts cost under $100. labor would have been three times that and replacing the whole fridge would have cost at least ten times. but i'm calling a plumber for pipes and sewer cleanouts.
i sit on a computer all day. some days i wish i went to trade school as i enjoy woodwork and building things, then we get 20 inches of snow and i like being inside with my databases.
that means when my dad retires (hes already 60) ill probably be a 30 something year old guy telling 50 year old guys what to do. it will be weird for me.
there's a thing put there called a zip it you can shove into sinks/showers/tubs and grab the hair. it's a long flexible piece of plastic with some tines coming out the side.
it's been 3 hours op. i'm not mad, just...disappointed.
i'm the same way about working on my car. i absolutely despise having grease on my hands
why is everyone but me using a plastic fork on the toilet??
i was in one of the stalls at work doing my daily shit, when i hear someone move into a stall a few down. after rummaging for what seems like an eternity, the guy spills out peanuts all over the bathroom floor, swears, and then that's when i heard crunching noises.
also stopping after baby: sex, sleep, civility, joie de vivre, will to live, mental wellbeing. unless you're rich or one of you stays home.
you joke, but that's basically the thinking behind all baby products: repackage existing product in "special for baby!" marketing and sell at 30% mark-up.
i'm not afraid to admit i've thrown out containers before due to being too afraid to open them. i don't think i'm a complete slob, just the back of the fridge tends to hide things.
anyone that gets in an accident in an older car will become your new best friend once you can weld their bumper back on for them. if they're in a new car, then you won't be able to help. my car, for instance, is basically layers of tinfoil over sponges, so there's nothing really there to weld.
i agree that you can save a lot of money on many car repairs by doing it yourself. oil changes just aren't worth it though. even an oil change at the dealer isn't expensive enough (about $40) to make it worth the effort of doing it myself. same with swapping tires. i can pay a local garage $20 to do it in 90 seconds. but replacing an alternator, or starter....definitely do it yourself if you can. also, the biggest scam is paying to replace the cabin and engine air filters. don't every pay anyone to that. on most newer cars you can do this yourself in 60 seconds without any tools.
for some one that's claims they aren't handy you are doing great. i grew up in construction, i still second guess myself when it comes to plumbing. if you do something wrong it can cause a lot of permanent damage.
are you kidding me? it was that cheap? it cost me amost that much just to get my drain snaked by the plumber.
the pipe could've burst. what we did was visually inspect first with a camera to see the problem. a lot of the times with that we'd see roots growing into the pipe usually around a fitting. but if it looked okay overall we would give them the options to hydro jet the line, or replace sections. some houses even had orangeburg pipe, which is heat treated tar paper. that shit would crumble if you looked at it the wrong way. when you say lateral though, are you saying they hydro jetted the line in your bathroom going into the wall?
the last part with the manager telling you to stop was probably because at the start of the day it hadn't been resolved yet, so he wasn't sure if they'd take them back (maybe the error was on his end) so in that event it would be better to get a jump start on the physical correction rather than sit idle waiting for a response from the supplier. it's just good management in a bad situation.
or in small towns like mine. we only need one plumber...but we don't have one. the last plumber was the town plumber for like, 40 years. he finally retired and now we're having trouble getting stuff dealt with. the problem is, it's not exactly a great area to move to, and it's not like you'll *make bank* here, so...yeah.
at this point, at least on reddit, plumbing has almost become a meme. yes, it's a good job, but like any other career path *it's not for everyone* and *there can be too many plumbers*
i'm canadian and went to school for hvac in 2013 at 30 years old. soooo many kids. the school is just pumping them out with no regard for what the work force looks like. half of my classmates are not in the industry or going back to school already.
to be fair, we were told "get a college degree, it doesn't matter what you get, it matters you have a degree." so, some of us more silly ones studied what we actually love and wanted to learn more about. now, the narrative is stem because the goal posts for our generation's success keep moving farther and farther away.
yeah, the beauty and isolation bit is what keeps me around for now, but looking to the future... i always feel our business projects start out as very earnest attempts to bring more activity in to the state and end up as sort of sad jokes
i like to think i could've been a great baker but if i was a baker i would wish i was an it guy. i keep my hobbies separate from my occupation and i'm happy.
i'm in my late 30's. i went to college and am now taking hvac classes. stick with it.
i was a union pipefitter and was made general foreman on a major job when i was 26, shortly after my apprenticeship. dudes in their 50's really don't like being told what to do by someone half their age. but it paid around $115k not including overtime so i didn't mind.
"oh yes i'm very sorry sir, i know you would like to use the toilet but you haven't yet ordered the #2 deluxe package. that burritos will just have to wait."
but human excrements is no problem. this is the same level as people refuse to eat the brown part of a banana. but have no problem giving oral. the human brain keeps surprising me.
you haven't wiped properly until you've tried a plastic fork.
i always run my own saw cause chicks dig a guy in assless chaps
bingo! there was *no* hole at the front of the bowl. completely clogged. all better now.
there is a market for crazy pregnant ladies buying stupid shit, because 'baby'. source: been pregnant, am crazy
i have always been afraid of that. i work customer service in blue printing. i have grown close to a lot of people working for several companies in many trades so i'm hoping to use that network to get my foot in the door somewhere.
dont let the assholes discourage you. you're going to meet alot of intitled old men who think you need to bend at the knee for them whenever they are around. learn from them, take what you can, and after when you have a solid exit plan. fuck them
i go to a welding comunity college i tink i heard my teacher say 8% of welders that go there graduate with an associates. they end up getting there certs amd leaving so they get jobs asap
depends on the oil change. i have an old audi that costs me 60-70$ for a shop to do because i have to use full synthetic oil. i can do it myself for 30 bucks and half an hour of time.
youtube is great. since i watched tutorials on there i have replaced a timing belt, radiator fan, radiator, multiple sensors, thermostats, altenator, water pump, 3 different fuel pumps, brakes, tires, multiple lights. i would say over the last 10 years i've saved well over $50k in repairs by doing mine and my families cars.
thanks! as i mentioned, it just takes me a long time. the toilet thing was 6 hours. the drain assembly was 4 hours. i wish i was joking.
oh, i don't disagree with the idea itself.it was a smart idea. the things were shipped in from china, and it was all about time management. he needed the things a couple of days later, and would not have had time to wait another delivery from china obviously. in the end i assume they were able to get it from a closer source. that didn't stop me from wanting to take that blowtorch to his face after being told that all my work was useless though, paid for it or not :)
the problem with small towns is that everyone's uncle is a plumber.../electrician/carpenter/hvac guy. miraculously without being able to do any of those in any professional manner.
we saw the shit storm coming, so we decided to try to help. who better to deal with a shit storm than an army of plumbers? but we underestimated the speed and ferocity it would hit with, and now we fear it may be too late... sorry.
this is every trade school. within the first week you can tell who is taking it seriously and actually has a basic mechanical aptitude/interest. these guys go all the way through and generally are successful now. you can certainly tell who signed up because of parents or straight up just a whim.
i have a degree in history and work in investment banking...
not to mention that in a lot of stem fields wages are stagnating, a masters is the new bachelors, and science funding (if you go the research route) keeps getting cut. let's not forget "publish or perish" leads to a lot of burnout in the industry and corporate funding means a lot of what is available to work on may run counter to your own moral or ethical stance, and if you're doing anything environmental or on the green tech side of things there's no guarantee you'll be making more than 15/hr for years. i have a stem degree. i graduated in 2009, which was coincidentally the year all the grads two years ahead of me lost their jobs and the industry saw a huge downturn.
i actually have some optimism for the future, at least for southern maine. the portland area is a much cheaper area than the boston area, but putting an office there wouldn't add too many logistical difficulties. also, i think that as working from home becomes more accepted, maine's "quality of place" will attract high-income professionals. unfortunately, both of these scenarios might be far off.
baking and cooking are like the "never meet your heroes" of turning a hobby into a job. my love of baking did *not* survive contact with a year of professional cake-making.
to be fair, 26 year olds don't really like being told what do by people twice their age.
yeah this is the only thing that touches my real concern. i know already none of these guys respect anyone elses opinion. theyve been doing this so long already. most have owned their own business at one point. they think they know better. its hard for my dad to get them to follow instructions unless its the most fundamental "this must get done to code" kind of thing. otherwise its not like they are going to take tips on like how to make their job easier or anything. its really annoying really
i'm literally dying at work trying to hold in my laughter from all of this
i've been plumbing for 14 years. and i've yet to get shit on me
perhaps it wasn't wiping, but that they were trying to 'start' themselves like a ketchup bottle...
i think i need pictures, but that is a very strange request to make. ah, fuck it, can you diagram this? like, were you head-down in the toilet to see this hole?
thank you for the truth. currently i work at a blueprint shop and deal with many many men as far as architects, constructions workers, project coordinators, electricians, etc. all know, including my boss, i am not a woman to fuck with but i am extremely pleasant if you are. i am there to work, nothing else. i have prepared myself for certain comments i probably will receive but, bring it on. i'm not easily offended nowadays, i've worked through that because there is no point to it if you want to succeed in this profession. id rather my work speak for itself. to be honest, i have never had a hard time with men. all have been very nice and with time, i have convinced even the ones with a hard shell. just let me work and i will help you as well. which i find, is the objective of most men at work.
seriously. you can't even work on them without a bunch of bullshit monopolized certifications from the state. every time someone comes in with a fast and cheap fix, the government is all like "you're running a prostitution and black market organ ring, so we're going to sanction you."
yeah, and the next time you do it will take a lot less time. not as short as someone who does that type of work on a regular basis. it's the difference between having to think about it versus having it in "muscle memory," so to speak. point out to your step dad that if you were experienced in it, that you'd be the one laughing every time he has to get help with computer-related problems. nobody's an expert on everything.
probably the manager was pissed. he'd just paid you to do nothing productive.
much of that is out of necessity. it's a hardship out here for many families to hire a professional.
we can tell when a shit-storm is coming. you know what a shit-barometer is? it measures the shit-pressure in the air. you can feel it. you hear that? sounds of the whispering winds of shit.
it works great for corporate owners to have a disposable workforce they can mistreat and underpay.
cool, i was just giving some examples of how it can be a good degree, if you do your research. there are many paths, but it is your road. i have one too, and i have found the most beneficial part of a history degree was learning how to analyze data in bulk.
i landed a remote job this year and now my goal is to leave atlanta and move to maine. i surf zillow 5 hours a week and daydream! can't wait!
or half their age! bossy 13 year olds are the worst!
and a mask. nothing's worse than having clogged drain gunk fly up onto your face when it finally gives way and comes out.
my wife has long dark hair. *she's* the one who clears the clogged drain.
check out the ridgid faucet & sink installer. one of the best tools i ever bought. i've used it to replace maybe 5 faucets (and supply lines to match) and this thing makes it so easy. i hate spending time on my back under a sink!
gloves work great on grease, and much harder to accidentally have the glove fill with grease like you can with sewage... definitely take grease over sewage.
i'm an emt and i'm the same way about lung butter.
what are we coming to these days. can a man not run a prostitution and black market organ ring in peace?
exactly this, my dad had to replace our external power conduit (breaker box was fine) after it was ripped off the wall after someone hit the lightpole... and we had an estimate by professional electricians that estimated like $2k+ do redo the pole and main wiring... we ended up doing it ourselves for just the cost of the material about $300 and it passed inspection...
i'm fuckin scared ricky! what the fuck is a shit rope? is it some sorta shitty rope?
better advice, more direction, less pressure to go into college immediately. i have an english degree, too, because i enjoyed it in high school, saw that my english teachers were happy, and was discouraged from going to music school. if i'd had time to get experience in life and discover what i would really not mind doing my whole life, i would have just read all those novels on my own time. it took me 10 years total between college + work experience to get a full time tech support job. i could have gotten the same job in 4-6 years by taking 2 years off before college and then studying any computing field to get an associate or bachelor's degree. when i meet younger kids and can hear embarrassment in their voices when they say they're currently doing gened, i encourage them and remind them that it's a much smarter idea than jumping into something because it was the least boring class in high school.
thanks man. guess that sink is getting fixed tonight. i love reddit.
the reason the electrician quoted so much is because fuck working with the mains. fuck. that. one misplaced hand or tool... glad no one got hurt.
i wish something like a gap year or apprenticing for a while before college was common in the us. it is infuriating to spend years of your life and piles of money only to find out you should have gotten any other major or gone to tech school or just begun working, either because there is no job market or it looked a lot more fun on tv ("enhance!").
that's the great thing about house centipedes. they're nature's exterminators and only appear when there's an actual infestation of some other insect/bug. once the infestation is over, they leave in search of more food.
aww *hail* no. i don't fuck with *any* high torque rotating machinery, no fucking way. guy in high school was fucking around and ended up with his entire forearm wrapped around a lathe like a fucking spaghetti noodle because the sleeve of his hoodie got caught in it. also heard some horror stories from old co-workers about an unfortunate incident involving a cement mixer and a man who ended up at least ten feet longer than a human has any business being before the machine was shut off and stopped moving. ever since then i've had a *very* healthy respect for anything with an exposed driveshaft. something that's designed to twist a steel cable through all the twists and turns of your plumbing? fuck *everything* about that, i don't even want to be in the same room while that thing is running, much less operate it myself.
i started with a long handled screwdriver and tapping with a hammer (be *very* sure you're not hitting porcelain), then had to switch to a shorter screwdriver jabbing around by hand. your hand/glove will have to get down in the water to poke up into the hole, so give it an extra flush first and disinfect everything after.
anyone with half a brain will have the mains disconnected by the power company. any electrician that doesn't, isn't going to have a long career. also note, the power company should disconnect the lines for you for free at request and reconnect them (after passed inspection)
what about internet centipedes? there's an infestation in a subreddit, and no matter what the admins do, they aren't leaving.
i meant high torque relative to a power drill, it's not that strong. it won't pull you into it but it will wrap you like a python and squeeze hard enough to stop blood flow. it's easy to prevent, of course, i don't mean to overstate the danger; just be mindful.
oh man, that's a tough one! because each scene is so good, you know? the coen brothers wrote such a brilliant script - i don't watch many of my movies on tv, but whenever i'm flipping the channels, and i'm a big flipper when i watch tv, when lebowski comes up, i think "oh i'll just watch a few scenes" and then i get sucked in, because the scenes are so funny. i particularly like that scene where i'm in the car with the big lebowski and he hands me that toe.
that is true! and the costumer for the big lebwoski (and also true grit and many of the coen brothers films) came over to my house, and went through my closet, and there are quite a few articles of clothing that they used for the dude from my closet. the baseball shirt with the famous japanese baseball player on it i stole from my brother beau, that is in the movie. and there might be some other ones, but nothing is coming to mind, i would have to look at the movie and see.
so glad you got this question answered. i so love fisher king.
you know, it changes from time to time. i am headed out to comic-con right now, so tomorrow when i get there, i think it will be a good dozen people. it changes from day to day. when i'm at home with my wife, it may never happen.
i'm not sure there's really a difference. i don't really see it in black & white. we all have good & bad aspects to each of us. i don't really approach them that differently. i enjoy playing both.
well, you know, certainly those 2 movies qualify for the home movie aspect of watching those movies for me. where i remember all the good times i had when i was making them, what i had for lunch, what i did after work, those sorts of things. and so the first tron, i really have fun memories from it, it was such an innovative movie at the time, it was shot in 70 mm black & white, and then hand-tinted by a bunch of ladies in korea, the whole thing, to create that world. it was very innovative. and then the other movie was fascinating too, it felt like a lot of it i was actually in the tron world for real. i think i was one of the first actors to have my whole body scanned, so they could make me look young, they actually, you know, put my body into a computer, i remember having that process done and it felt like i was living the tron world for real. and good. well, i'm glad that you had a good experience with the first tron and i hope you and your dad dug the second!
open at your own speed, but open. dig what's happening to you. by "dig" i mean get into it. there are lessons for you there. and when it gets uncomfortable, that's an important time to open and dig. there's treasure in them thar hills.
not really, the widely is my main camera. my only camera, really, i'm not too much into the digital thing, i will take a photograph on an iphone occasionally but i am mainly an old school film camera guy with a wide lens.
i also love starman. i thought you did such a great job playing a "newborn" to this world. very awkward, but observatory- like a bird or something.
well, i often use my father in my acting quite a bit. i kind of conjure him up and invite him to come into my being, and so i'm sure he was with me a bunch when we were shooting the giver, or i was with him, however you want to put it. like i was saying, so many of my roles, i think of my dad - but this one was a little different for me. i think about my dad all the time when i am working, and maybe with this role it was a little bit more.
oh, it was terrific. we've known each other for years. our kids used to play soccer together. yes! we met briefly during those times. and i admired her, as most people have, for so long, and was eager to work with her, and was so happy that she was onboard for the giver because she's just a really remarkable actress. she brought a realism to this whole fictitious world. and i was just amazed by her freshness - it's like, she's been doing this so well for so long, one might think she would get complacent, but she really cared so much about the movie, and was so engaged and that kind of enthusiasm is contagious, and it spreads throughout the company, and whenever she was on the set, everybody upped their game and rose to the occasion. it was great to be able to do it with joy, you know? you could sense the love of her craft, you know, her art.
iirc paraquat is an herbicide that was sprayed on marijuana fields in mexico by the us gov in the '70s. a lot of the pot was subsequently smuggled into the states and smoked- leading to concerns about toxicity and health problems. in other words, a total bummer, man.
i loved tron! i honestly think it was one of the best looking movies to ever be made. maybe there waiting on daft to have some free time?
another comedy? well, the comedic aspects are in most movies i do, i think. i did r.i.p.d. which came out not too long ago, and that was a comedy. i think they really screwed up the editing of the movie, we had a wonderful time making it, with ryan reynolds. wonderful time working with the director. but the suits just cut it against the grain, and i thought, screwed it up. but it's got some funny parts in it.

i always like to drink my white russians with a little straw!
you need to do more westerns. you as either of the lead roles in a lonesome dove remake would be awesome.
it makes me happy to know that jeff bridges enjoys the big lebowski as much as the rest of us.
holy shit beau bridges is your brother. how did i not realize this?
your wife never calls you "the dude"? shocking! :-)
i believe the best movie villains are played by actors who think they are playing the hero of the film.
everything is better when hand-tinted by a bunch of ladies in korea.
i hope someone writes a book based off this ama, "jeff bridges' wisdoms"
those are good burgers, dude. i am a huge fan of lox and bagels also. yum.
that's wonderful. thank you so much mr. bridges. good luck with the film and everything else!
smart. you can't lock yourself down to one style of peanut butter.
although you aren't the dude himself. far out man. thanks.
obviously she's a female internet user from kansas city.
not sure if you'll even get this, but i certainly found this movie to be pretty funny. i feel like there are a lot of hollywood movies that just aren't 'cut right' i'm glad you didn't try and defend a bad decision. make more comedies, i (along with many here) think you're hilarious and we appreciate the entertainment you provide. thank you!
what is love? jeff bridges just told me, just told me, oh lord.
i appreciate your thoughtful response to jeff bridges coupled with your username.
bartender here, i think if jeff bridges, came into my bar, and ordered a white russian, my head would explode.
duvall killed it but a jeff bridges augustus mccrae would be awesome
m. night shamalan would have hired you. he looked at me and said, "you've got a face like a monkey. i'm gonna put you in a movie." i said "ok"
i know! a lot of actors will try to really separate themselves from a single role that they are well known for, and try to put more emphasis on newer, more obscure work. jeff bridges never seems to shy away from the dude.
brandt's face while lebowski says that is the funniest part.
i work in sales and i am always worried some one would catch my reference. when some one is being a jerk and asking me to do something or they are mad about something i just say "you're not wrong" and leave it at that. makes me feel like i called them an asshole without even doing it.
as great as jeff bridges is, the greatness of the film is ultimately due to the genius of the coen brothers and i think he knows that.
yeah, blew my mind when i figured that out - avid stargate fan. but once you see/hear it... you cant undo it. their speech patterns and tone of voice are really similar. i would have flipped all my shits if jeff bridges cameo'd as a goauld
have ya seen adventures of baron munchhausen? my favorite gilliam film aside from fear and loathing. loved it as a kid. still do. up on netflix now.
this comment made me feel as good as, if not better than, mr. bridges' answer. good job, op.
i didn't realize that was a stigma for poor kids. all my friends and i would do that just so we had 15 minutes to hang out and eat at the beginning of the day. it was nice.
at our kids' school they make everyone come at 7:30, breakfast time (all the buses arrive by then) and then they all sit in the cafeteria until 7:45. breakfast is served and anyone can eat or not, without any stigma. hopefully more schools do it that way now....
the best villains are the ones that paint themselves as the hero. handsome jack in borderlands two is one of the greatest villains in my mind.
the guy in front of me at the theater absolutely exploded in laughter when the scientist responded that he was not tony stark. i mean, it was a funny line, but the guy cackled for a solid twenty seconds.
well it's based on a comic, so you can think of it in the aspect of panels. things happen, but dialogue is secondary. you can make it outstanding, certainly, but the ultimate plot is already known.
korean ladies: making everything better with custom hand-tinting since the first tron
it's like this one and john fogerty for me. i feel like that shouldn't be a surprise.
good work! that was some fantastic stuff he just revealed.
i'm now confident with saying i like both types. i will link to this anytime someone questions my choice of smooth pb
while this reveal will be neat, on the whole i'm actually nervous about how this movie is going to turn out. i was so psyched about it when i first heard, but then the trailer came out, and it looked like just another futuristic dystopian world like every other movie coming out right now, instead of staying true to the book. don't get me wrong i'm excited for it to come out, and will pay good money to see it in theaters...i just don't know man.
iwannahearjeffbridgesdefinewhatloveis/i want him to showww me
i don't know, i heard every word of his voice through that. you sure it isn't a recording?
what's funny to me is that jeff and i have met on several occasions at various premier parties and media events because of my wife. both he and his wife are wonderfully welcoming and pleasant people to be around. i recall at one party there was a group of 10 or so of us around a table, a slow song came on, and his wife said that dancing sounded like a good idea. she grabs him by the hand to lead him away and he looks at everyone else at the table and says "awww hell" then finishes his drink, winks, and took his wife out for a dance. it looked like they were very much in love with one another.
if you get the proportions wrong......god help you.
yeah it would be hard to beat duvall in lonesome dove.
i am so jealous that you have time in your life to prepare for an ama.
the way i heard it is "john wayne plays john wayne. jeff bridges plays the damn character".
gotta respect the work that basically makes you a household name, not to disparage any of his other also awesome work.
brandt's face any time the big lebowski is talking is just absolutely hilarious.
this is so totally true. one of the biggest, best things i've learned from being married. it is soooo much better to be kind than right. it is so much better to be compassionate than to try to hammer your point home. what matters is the relationship, not the circumstances.
munchausen was my favorite movie as a kid growing up in the 80s. i rented that from the video store every time my parents would let me for many years.
an ejaculation of poetry, erected on the fly, penetrating me deep into the vagina of my soul.
uh you mean, _not_ tony stark? _this comment no longer applies, future-dweller_
next time just take the doors off your car and send them. it's cheaper to ship, and as an added bonus, your car is still drivable in the interim!
i think individual player comparisons might be more informative. they both seem like midfielders to me, elevating their teams' play as much by their astute choices and subtlety as by any flashes of brilliance. i don't have any gut feelings about who's who, though. i guess if streep ever headbutted anybody i'd say zidane.
haha, i know, right? so far every single one of his answers has been interesting and thoughtful. man, i have new found respect for the guy. he's awesome.
"you like crunchy, too??? eewww-" "the dude abides!"
agreed. what is with the call for remakes? lonesome dove is a classic, no, the classic.
he's like james lipton only without an actual job.
john wayne never did play anyone other than john wayne. which is perfectly fine if you like that sort of thing.
yeah i actually thought that girl deserved an oscar she put on a fucking hell of a performance, in what i imagine was a pretty difficult role
when bunny says she'll suck his cock for a grand... :)
think what the world would be like if everybody lived by that.
clu from tron: legacy is another great example of that, actually. he's just trying to do the right thing for his people. the character is actually noble, in his own way. it just comes out a little... differently.
become an ordained minister of dudeism. i did a few years back.
since you seem like a pretty big fan of his (like me), i'll share this quickly: i saw him in a small santa barbara movie theatre a year or two ago, and i fanned out too hard to be able to approach him. he was just standing there waiting for his wife (as i was for my girlfriend), checkin out the movie posters on the wall, and it was a perfect opportunity to strike a quick chat, and i wanted to talk with him so badly, but i completely froze. i guess my point is that, when i saw him in person, i realized how much i really looked up to and admired him for what he's done for culture. my impulse was to want to just ask him questions for hours on end.
it's ultimately a testament to how genuinely good of a person jb is. he's like the dalai lama of western pop culture.
what would you guys think of an ama with the author?
he played the perfect kiss-ass trying to weasel his way into an old rich guy's will. brilliantly understated role.
didn't know the person until i googled it. had a hearty laugh. thank you.
wtf fingerprint scanners? we had student ids with a bar code.
i felt like clu was kind of a tragic hero. he desperately wants to do what he was created to do: create a perfect, completely controlled world. and he's so angry at his creator because he feels like it was flynn who betrayed him, not the other way around.
the guy he yelled that at played ralphie in a christmas story .
i got really high and watched the big lebowski and looked it up wikipedia and then found dudeism and looked it up and looked around the site for a while and when i woke up the next day i read an email that said i was an ordained minister and i was like "did i get so high i became a dudeist priest on accident?". yeah, i did.
dangit! i know what you mean. the freeze is so annoying. like, imagine all the stuff you could talk about, if you could only get past it. somehow i think that would have been a very interesting conversation! but anyway, thank you for sharing the story. and yes, you're right, i *am* a big fan (to the extent that the first and the only time i made the reddit front page, it was a post about jeff bridges). uh oh, now i seem some kind of stalker. being a fan is hard. : p
maybe the movie will be good. maybe it won't. but the damn trailer pissed me off. that reveal was mindblowing in the book, and whether or not its gravity could be captured on the screen, to play it up as a quirky little gimmick in the trailer is infuriating. downright vulgar, i say!
i get it now. thanks for the comprehensive reply man.
brandt is essentially a bad actor. he's in on the plot with the big lebowski, and has to act like he's playing the dude straight. he's just really bad at it. when he's mourning the loss of bunny, he's acting sad, but snaps right up to attention when lebowski asks him to hand the dude the note. really bad actor, brandt. exceptionally portrayed by psh.
bar codes?!? back in my day we had these long pins we had to punch in on a number pad.
can you do weddings and stuff since you're an ordained minister?
no, stop it. you're not a stalker. it's great to respectfully admire and be interested in people.
always, always click on "more comments" there's a lot of dirt, but that's where the best gems are found.
looks like *you* picked the wrong week to quit amphetamines.
yes i can. i am a damn convincing dude as well. i haven't done one yet but i'm supposed to preside and abide for some friends in a few months.
sniffing glue.. i named my dog glue. so when he start sniffing around i can say, "you sniffin', glue?"
u/iamnotevensorry, yes there are lots of things i would not do. i only ever really do something if i find it hysterically funny. and i have a mental problem, which is, i don't see the consequences of my actions. so, i will often come up with something in the writers room, with me and my colleague, and not really think through how i'll feel when i get to the day when i have to shoot it. so, case in point, the naked fight seemed very very funny when i started talking about it in the writers room, but it got to the day, and when i was confronted with a naked 260 lb. man, who had not cleaned his asshole for 25 years, the joke suddenly did not seem very funny.
it was very nerve wracking because i almost got killed two nights in a row. we did the first one in texarkana in arkansas, and that ended up going very badly. they started throwing metal chairs into the ring and a huge sterioded ultimate fighter ended up jumping into the ring and attempted to beat me up. so i had to escape. we drove through the night to another town in arkansas and did the cage match again for the second time and it ended up provoking a riot in the stadium. but luckily i had built a trap door in the cage which led to a tunnel that was reinforced, and at the end of the tunnel there was a car that was running with its door open, ran out, and me and my co-star got off scot free.
u/limbodog, yes the producers of the oscars were upset, but they've been upset with me before. i assume i will not be invited back.
this reminds me of youtube comments where they believe borat or bruno are a real person. it's hilarious
trump is a misogynist and i think it is disgusting the views he has on bitches.
it would probably be nobby from the new movie, *the brothers grimsby*. he's a family guy, he gets drunk, and he does a very sensible amount of drugs.
yes. i did used to do a comedy character on the circuit who was called the mujahideen, and he was a very nice fundamentalist terrorist who just wanted to be loved and deliver stand-up comedy lines. in the end the character was too divisive. fine by me, i then came up with ali g.
yes. there was something that i regret not doing, which was, i was on this australian late night talk show, and the talent booker had made a massive mistake. he booked the australian prime minister on the same talk show. i was doing *bruno*, and i had a strip tease routine fully planned, including tearaway pants and this g-string. and my intention was to lap dance the prime minister of australia, and stick my crotch in his face. it would have been an international incident, and probably would have got me barred from australia. but, unfortunately, i wimped out of doing it, and eventually was also barred by his own security.
u/rekips, i tend to do whatever i want when i'm publicizing a movie. in cannes, it was my idea to go in a green thong on the beach and surround myself with some girls. and when i was publicizing *borat*, the studio did not want me to stand outside the kazakhstan embassy and deliver a press conference, but because i own the characters, i have the freedom to do whatever i want with them. so, i managed to avoid the normal boring press junkets that other actors are forced to do. and of course, pretend that they enjoy.
yes, most of the movie is impossible to show on tv. i just came off *the today show*, and they complained that every single clip that we've submitted has been barred from the mpaa. i'm personally slightly suspicious that the mpaa have got it in for me, now that i've revealed my tactic of submitting scenes that are much longer than the scenes that i want actually to go on film. but yes, the movie is a collection of very outrageous scenes that so far people are absolutely loving. but i would warn you, if you are a donald trump supporter, don't go and see the movie, because something very bad happens to him.
u/thevegetamonologues, when i make a film, i'm really just making it for the hard core fans, not the broader audience. my aim is just to make them laugh as hard as they can laugh in any movie theater. so whether it appeals to the masses is not really my main concern.
yes, there are continual fights with every movie. luckily, i managed to get something into my contract years ago which is something called "final cut", which very few people have anymore; ...scorsese...tarantino...fincher...which means that if a studio buys a project, ultimately i can choose what goes in. but still, there are fights. and even on this movie, there is a scene where something very bad happens to donald trump, and that became a bit of a challenge. the studio wanted me to put up a disclaimer saying donald trump is not hiv positive, which i was reluctant to do since i've never seen his std report. after all, donald's been quite a promiscuous man over the years and there's no stigma attached to hiv anymore. but, in the end after a long struggle, we managed to come up with a compromise.
uh, u/tall_and_thin, i will not. i explained why on howard stern yesterday--check it out.
if i remember correctly he dropped it a few times when his character was doing something particularly underhanded/stupid. it was pretty funny thinking back on it.
pamela was the only real actor in the whole movie that was in on it i remember reading
a nipple-sized anus is what i want to have, and what i do have.
i read an article a while ago where the jewish couple said they actually laughed at the movie and thought that sacha was very talented.
i know i'm meant to say yes, but he wasn't. to be honest the guys i really loved growing up from england were peter kirk, peter sellers, and peter sutcliffe. that's a name joke because he was a mass murderer.
in germany it is called "the spy and his brother".
25 years of preparing for that fight. truly committed to the role.
this is the greatest ama answer of all time. "or breathe in the rancid air from my costar's rectum"
i never realized the lengths you went to for realism, that's pretty admirable. no wonder you get such genuine reactions.
i live in texarkana, and this is heartbreaking to me, because bruno is so fucking funny.
what a way to go out, though. i thought your bit (and angela bassett's jack black bit) actually gave the academy an impression of having a sense of humor. all of their serious attempts at addressing it seemed waaaaaay more awkward.
i thought you were great in hugo btw, and les mis. do you enjoy doing the 'straighter' (for lack of a better phrase) roles?
it really changed the way i viewed youtube comments when i realised a huge proportion of them are written by children, many of whom don't speak english. i'm so grateful that my awkward, terrible prepubescent thoughts took place offline and won't haunt me forever like the kids currently posting on facebook and youtube.
the best part is i could totally envision ali g saying that... it's no more outlandish than "why did jesus go around with all them reindeers?"
probably wouldn't have been so patient if he wasn't 4 feet from a camera
hahahahahaha. this would have been pure comedic gold. but i think you would have been killed by somebody for sureeee.
you would've had to face a serious booting for that
admiral general aladeen going on the daily show was so entertaining! we appreciate your style of press tours!
what about a mockumentary about a musician named johnny venus?
strength to strength? i mean, not to knock the other band members, but all of their best work was done when mercury was alive. the average person couldn't name a queen song that didn't feature his vocals. you could arguably *end* the movie with the band moving on triumphantly after mercury's death, but to have his death halfway through the film is a disgrace to his memory and his importance not just to the band, but to music in general, as if to say, "oh, that doesn't matter, we're just fine without him". fuck. that.
does it also explain why we'd sing "throw the jew down the well"?
it's wonderful how it comes in and out during "master of the house." proper and french in front of the wealthier guests, and low-class english in front of his friends, or when he loses control. it's wonderfully executed.
the prostitute was a plant as well. she's a stand up comic
that must have been scary, considering ali g is black.
and still in english i guess? that reminds me of the movie taken which was called 96 hours here. the sequel, 96 hours: taken 2
didn't one of the borat segments also take place at four-states arena when a gun show was going on? i had just moved back to texarkana a few months before the wrestling scene went down. i remember hearing the radio spots nonstop...and the subsequent fallout after. best.troll.ever
til the real ali g was killed off by the krays and sacha is just an impersonator.
that's the only explanation. "cheese! it's all cheese! from here to here is cheese. c. h. e. e. s. e. anything with this word on the package is cheese. what the fuck is wrong with you? you don't deserve to live. go somewhere else far away. we don't want your business, fuck off!"
same here haha whenever the missus and i are getting dinner ready i always hold the cheese to her and say "what is this?" in a borat voice. she hates me.
nah, probably just a fine. most likely 900 dollary-doos.
i would have to assume that it was kevin rudd. i believe he was the prime minster at the time of bruno, and also that he loved to go on talk shows.
adding to the other replies, i sort of remember one of their ministers publicly embracing the character and the film, basically saying that while it's an absurd character that in no way represents their country, that it was at least a character that **loved** their country and was proud to be from there, and that this type of generally positive, if absurd, portrayal of their country, in fact *any* portrayal of their country, had never happened before, and that people there generally love the character *for those reasons*. an irl "at first i was like... then i was like..." meme.
i didn't even know queen was still active following freddie mercury's death. til.
well to be fair, it probably paid for most of their holiday homes.
i have that book and i have to start reading the first page after maybe two years. it's so big. and i never seem to find the time.
the silence after "hot guys in the world" comment looking up at the stars is breathtaking.
iirc she was the only person there in on it, all of her security and the public had no idea.
well it would be hard to forget a 270 pound man's ass all in your face. i mean how does someone even eat so much they weigh 280 pounds? it's fucking ridiculous to be 290 pounds.
how do i shave my asshole? it's like a dirty wookie's face.
"oh i just hate those homos so much i would fuck them right in the ass! right in the ass i tell you!"
they're the pinnacle of "i can't believe this is happening"
i thought it was very... philosophical? metaphorical? like its meant to show how people love violence but are violent towards love. genius
perhaps not the one we need, but certainly the one we deserve...
2006, even. we are in the twilight of the decade of borat.
"there's a white, one-legged, bus boy that wouldn't wouldn't want to switch with my black ass" - chris rock.
this man gains ten pounds every time someone mentions the 280 pound man...
freddie dies, john deacon fades into the background, they put out a shit musical. the end.
the doors were active after jim morrison's death too.
they did a rap version with a british boybands called 5ive around the late 90s / early 00s sums up their output since freddy died
it is a really dense book, and it actually works well to read a chapter and digest it for a while. i think you get more out of it if you don't try to read it all at once. the book challenges a lot of the standard ways of thinking and of viewing the world. definitely worth the time.
that what such a incredibly genuine moment of comedy. i dont think daniel day louis could act that good.
i'm pretty sure her security knew about it, or there would be more violence.
ali g was and still is absolutely huge in britain, the queen herself was apparently a fan, he was a cultural phenomenon that everybody did impressions of and it was pretty certain that mohammed al fayed knew what he was getting into.
"just thinking about it is making my cock hard with rage!"
yeah i loved how that one dude is just sobbing close to the end of the scene
i'm sure chris rock is ecstatic to find out you would happily violate the parameters of his physically impossible joke.
do you think terrorists do the airoplane sounds when feeding they're kids?
jon stewart is apparently germophobic, so seeing him play off kissing his ring so calmly was damn impressive as well.
iirc the mars part is due to him being called "out of this world".
imagine if in the movie jim morrison died half way through and they followed the rest of the doors careers. that would have been terrible.
i've been digesting chapter three for over a month now. maybe it's not the book that is dense...
he should ask a bunch of questions about lorne next time he has an snl alum on.
hosts a lot of tournaments. developing his own game. was once a quake pro. was pretty big in the dota scene and starcraft.
the meme is strong in my family. it was in my father, and my sister. its you, you are my sister.
actually, pretty sure he gave that option cuz he said something like (i am paraphrasing), "hell, you white people wouldn't trade places with me and i'm rich!"
yeah, but they don't wait for the kids mouth to open, they just slam it into their face.
how about we settle this over a game of knifey spoony?
to be even more fair, this time for freddie... they must have had a really shitty manager. that would be like oliver stone killing off morrison half way through the movie, so he could then show us an hour of the doors playing music, after he died. or better yet, how about a documentary of the hendrix experience without jimi. freddie mercury was *the* queen. that's why they were named queen, because of him. it's sad, but true, the band should have gone separate ways posthumously.
that was a really good move to cast drew barrymore. there's a meta thing going one when you watch a movie that says, "oh, she can't die, it's drew barrymore" and that movie really exploited that well.
even straight outta compton didn't kill off eazy with aids at the middle of the movie.
i know the running joke, and it is funny, but honestly the lorne stuff has died down since he was on the show and they squashed their (marc's) beef.
i wish gabe loved his customers like kanye loves kanye.
like having sean bean survive until the end of something.
i wish anyone loved me as much as kanye loves kanye.
i just went to iceland and tried to do a small expedition across the glacier and we didn't make it. we had to be emergency evacuated as there was a white out blizzard which i got to take a poop in. it actually freezes before it hits the ground.
i'm sure exactly how long. i hit the h and a for a long time before i realized i could copy and paste. i'm not the most tech savvy person around but it did become a lot easier and faster.
k get ready: it's very complicated. bread, white. peanut butter, not crunchy, creamy. grape jelly, double portion, more than you think should actually fit on a piece of white bread. bread. and then some cheetos shoved in there, and then you're good to go.
it's really hard to not want to be joffrey on game of thrones. my favorite thing that i've seen yet wasn't on tv, it was on youtube. it was called kung fury and it was the best thing i've seen in a long time.
this is probably going to be superlame but my golden rule is the golden rule. do onto others as you would have them do onto you. and that's about it.
how about a magical seashell that's always filled with bourbon. and i would like a magical palm tree that had a lot of shade with instead of coconuts there's just peanut butter jelly sandwiches with cheetos underneath. and my wife that is always happy and possibly naked.
always a hard question. i think a lot of people of people say how lucky they are. and i don't think people really understand how lucky i am to even be in a conversation like this right now. it's nuts. i mean, i somehow made a lot of right decisions, i'm sure i made a lot of wrong decisions, but i don't even know the constellation of events that led to me getting there. just how crazy it is. looking around and seeing how many ridiculously talented people i'm around everyday.
haha "for a friend" i do not do full frontal but i can promise you when you're standing in front of a bunch of people in a very small thong it doesn't leave a lot to the imagination. your "friend" should be happy.
i'm kinda boring. i just like peps. pepperoni and cheese. i'm not a very adventurous eater. i like what i like and stick to it.
i would actually love to play genghis khan. but john wayne did that. and it wasn't such a good idea i think.
the last picture i took on my phone i was going into a meeting and there was a tv on the wall playing cnn and they were talking about jurassic world shattering box office openings so i sent that to my buddy pratt. i'm just really proud of him, happy for him. it also said something about southeast texas weather pressure. that's what i was really trying to tell pratt, to make sure he was aware of a pressure front coming in.
hahahahaha! i guess you need to see it as many times as it takes you to realize how bad my acting is in it. and fast forward to the dancing parts after that.
i wish that i could make anyone at any point just happen to be naked. not for the reasons that everyone thinks. because people get really nice when they get naked. like okay, i can't be an asshole. people aren't assholes when they get naked (for the most part). they are thinking about what they look like. shitty answer, i tried to do something funny and it didn't work.
kendrick lamar is dope. i like kinda everything. i listen to ben howard a lot, i mean i love anything pop and i really love old stuff. i'll put on nina simone pandora and let it rock. i like everything but polka music. no offense to the polka community.
oh fuck. god let's see. no one has anyone said let's go to the alley and fuck or anything like that. it's kinda shocking that no one has said that. their behavior gets bizarre and that's the strange part. also othing that anyone would ever say to me would be worse than what's going on in my head.
oh man. i love pinterest. swear to god. just to not think about all the shit i have to do or what's going wrong, i just go and look at pinterest. or flipboard.
absofuckinglutely. no matter if you're a man, woman, cat, hamster, you will get lost in matt bomer's eyes. i don't know what they are made of outside of dreams and rainbows and amazingness but it truly doesn't matter. and when he sings. it's like god gave with both hands and then grew a third hand and graced him with more. he's crazy talented.
gilbert gottfried, danny devito and ray romano? i'd fuck danny devito, as i was saying earlier it could be fun. i'd marry ray romano, because i think he has a pretty solid perspective on marriage. i don't know who would be the male or female, you figure it out. and i like gilbert gottfried but i wouldn't mind killing him.
that absolutely was me. because i love chili's. and no one believed me that i got into an airport without my id. i just wanted a beer and some chicken crisps, and i actually couldn't get either of them for a while, because i remember you guys didn't have chicken crisps either! what's a chili's without chicken crisps?
we finally found someone that i really do believe wants to make gambit, it will be the second standalone character. and i just really think because gambit is not the most popular or the biggest hero, i think there's a really unique opportunity. marvel's done a lot of great movies that have made a ridiculous amount of money, and it's always good to figure how to change the form.
she's the man. and you can go in a few different creative directions with that and you don't actually have to change the title at all.
i was just given a bear for my 35th birthday by a friend joanne and it was a bear with a heart on it. the carebear cousins were my favorite. there was the lion and the fast rabbit. those two were pretty awesome.
did you mean confused? i think you meant confused.
hahahahaha what! that's like a psychological profiling question. yeah, why not. i like to eat. let's just be real about it. jonah is one of those people who if you just sit back and just watch him you in no way shape or form can understand how he's doing what he's doing. he's the fastest most quickest wittiest person i've ever met. and i think people when they think of comedic actors they forget that they are people with a point of view and experiences and depth. and jonah is one of the most sensitive and deep people i know. and that's why i think he can be a comedic actor and a deep actor asd well.
i did see it and if i understood it i might be able to reply with my own response but i'm not sure i actually understood it.
i wish i could say i love the everly bros but that's not why we named her everly. the simple story is my wife was driving down the street one day and heard it in her head. so happy wife happy life. and yeah, i do get nervous to act, it kind of depends on what it is really. doing snl was by far the most terrifying thing that i've ever done, because there is a lot of reading involved, and i don't read that well out loud. i get terrified and freeze up. so it really depends on what kind. if i'm really super prepared and i'm off book, i'm not nervous. there's no wrong way to do it, just different ways to do it, because you never know what is going to work.
hahahaha what? no. but i fucking wish. that sounds like an awesome story. because i don't hate pizza. if that did happen i would respect anyone that punched me because i wore that shirt. because pizza is awesome.
oh that's tough. it would be a very hard turndown. but i don't know. there is a very strong strong voice inside that tells me james bond probably should always be a true united kingdomer. i'm all down for changing things completely but the true nature of 007 is i feel just very innately english, it shouldn't be an american putting on an english accent.
it has really really made things wildly more in perspective. i have a very very large appetite for working and doing things and when you put it into the framework of am i going to be proud of telling my daughter i took time away from her to do this project is kinda my gauge right now. it's taken away a lot of the bullshit.
i don't know. i wish i could come up with something funny for this answer. my mom is beautiful and my dad doesn't suck either.
it would be a messy fight. the light would probably bounce off of his pectoral muscles and blind me.
oh man. if you eat it and it makes you happy you probably shouldn't have it. and if you do it and it sucks you're probably doing the right thing. but you can't have one with out the other. a lot of people just work out and don't actually diet and they wonder why they aren't getting the results they want, and some people do the exact opposite and wonder the same thing. i really think you have to do both.
can i just fight a danny devito sized danny devito because i think i could take him and i would be on top or i could just use him as a spinner as i'm assuming we're going to have sex after we fight if we're naked.
the funny this is about xxl it is such a movie that is made for women but if i pitched the movie like it's the movie road trip then guys would see it. truly it's just about a bunch of guys being friends and hanging out who just get raunchy with some women at the end of the movie. everyone will have fun with this movie.
i hope he uses that same accent. i would definitely be in the theatre opening day, all day.
first i went down to the amazon with my creative partnet reid carolin and the founder of runa and we stayed with this tribe called the sapara. i just had never been so deep into a tribe and it just became so apparent to me that we don't understand of how intertwined they are with their environment. the jungle is their supermarket and their pharmacy. and no one is studying what they use to heal themselves. there used to be 200000 of them and now there's around 600. their knowledge is dying with them and we want to help find conserve it.
i am not even joking about this. kevin nash. i've always wanted to know what it feels like to be tiny in his arms and thrown around.
offer her something that she wants if she doesn't want that. and two it can't be a double standard. if you want a threesome with a girl then you have to offer her a threesome with a guy. it's all equal opportunity. so be careful what you ask for.
does this mean where i fell out of a car or where i took a dump? please clarify! haha
i'm not scrolling anymore this was the greatest answer ever given.
doing a fine job on this ama without victoria here helping.
can confirm delishisness. used to do this in grade school. the key is adding the cheetos right before sandwich consumption for max crunch
haha thor was about fucking hilarious in that, look at my pecs
that makes me so happy to hear. if 23 jump street were just you two sitting in alone in a blank room in the middle of ohio i would go see it. you're relationship is adorable.
i've never thought this hard about what i want done onto me.
i guess the daughter doesn't make the cut. lol but yay for bourbon
you seem like a nice guy who appreciates what he has. that's great
or i would just go to sandra bullock's house as i'm sure she has all that stuff because she's dope and kick-ass.
but you put cheetos on your pb&j and that means the world.
i know how we pull this off. but it involves another bill and ted's excellent adventure sequel.
guess where i've hid some cookie dough for you, channing.
you're so caring. can you tell pratt he is sexy. thanks.
you definitely have improved as an actor. you're a brilliant comic actor with impeccable timing and delivery. you kicked ass in foxcatcher, too. can't wait to see what you do next and your inevitable directorial debut.
i'm pretty sure you already possess that superpower!
ben howard omg.... channing tatum you are awesome. not that i needed any reassuring.
channing can we go fuck in an alley? please its for science
you should try www.reddit.com actually, you should probably stay away. there are some weirdos here.
you should've tried to call the sequel magic mike 2 electric boogaloo in honour of your dancing origins
confirmed, channing tatum wants to kill gilbert gottfried
hey, at least you got your beer! you were an absolute pleasure to have there and were very kind. plus the girls working there were fangirling for days after you left.
i loved gambit since i was a teenager. always wondered why they never made a movie with him in it playing a big role. have you any idea as in when gambit should be coming into theatres?
when you were in australia promoting 21 jump street with jonah you did an interview on triple j. it was much longer than the average radio interview and felt like some real personality was coming out of each of you. it was fun to listen to, i hope something like that happens again sometime.
you're snl answer surprised me. your skit with jimmy "eww gross" had me in fits and in all honestly changed my opinion of your acting.
i'd like to point out that the last batman, the last superman, and the last spiderman (sort of) were redcoats. stealing bond from them is more than justified.
just from your answers i'd pin you closest to the character you played in 21 & 22 jump street, but probably a tad bit more serious/ambitious. no doubt you're just an all around fun and chill dude to hangout with.
you fucking gave her your username, didn't you? rookie mistake
channing, you're a good guy. i hope you know this. used to be super hot from rugby and football. lost a large amount of family members in a very short while and sorta let myself go. girlfriend at the time was upset at me for letting myself go - not understanding about what i was going through. it hurt when we broke up, but in the long run it was way better for me. now i'm getting back in shape, and it's for myself, not for someone else; that makes it so much more satisfying.
i feel like when anyone asks this question of, "what do you do to be so in shape?," they expect the answer to be something other than eating healthy and working out. it will always be dedication to eating healthy and working out... every damn day. simple as that.
nice. the specific name for such a sexual act is actual called "dan's devito." not making that up.
tell him to just take a girl, he may even get laid afterwards
yes!! thank you!! reciprocation. full reciprocation.
i'm pretty sure his answer will be on a glacier during a blizzard.
ok, channing, real talk. does your wife get jealous of all the time you spend having sex with danny devito?
with ice cube yelling at them in front of japanese jesus.
thought of it in less than a second. however, as a heterosexual male, i am not sure i would actually want to see it happen.
why would he want his daughter to be stranded on a deserted island?
yeah my respect for channing has skyrocketed ever since he started to show his funny side in public. this just solidifes everything. every. thing.
he's a man of great contrast. an onion of personality, if you will.
for real. dudes probably seen more titties in person than i have seen on the internet.
take me with you. i'll just sit by the dumpster and watch, i promise.
in 80 years, two terribly aged men cross paths in a whole foods parking lot in modesto. a spark kindles to life in one man's eyes. "i remember..." he half thinks, half feels. the man, he lifts his arm; heavy with age, leaden with illness and malady, his arm creeps upward, anemically caricatures a pointing gesture at a pale cement alleyway starkly lit by the merciless solar voyeur. he chuckles, arm weakly gesturing more at the baked pavement than the alley filled with dumpster, haunted by the few stray forest green carts -- "channing... i'm... i'm going to buttfuck you, right in this alley, just as i foretold."
if he actually tried reddit, he'd stop being an actor and be funemployed.
and you couldve used the broom from fantasia as a prop.
**channing tatum's top ama questions, you'll never believe number 7**
wait.. you need to have id to get *into* an airport?
i always loved gambit too. he had cool hair, cool costume, cool magic explodey cards. he was easy for me to pretend being him. cyclops is out, you can't pretend to shoot stuff from your eyes. wolverine is out, my folks didn't let me run around the house with knives. gambit though, i could throw playing cards all day.
to be fair why wouldn't he? he's an actor not a politician giving an ama
how do you think canada feels? one superhero that anyone cares about, and that aussie hugh jackman has kept him all to himself.
that's why you gotta pick a name you're not even comfortable saying aloud to people.
seriously, people make it so damn complicated. no, you don't have to eat a specific "superfruit" that burns fat and builds muscle while you watch tv. the process is easy enough to understand, it's the commitment and people never want to commit. or they assume it's only possible with steroids.
i thought about that, but the pickings are slim around here.
that's exactly what i'm going to tell people who look at me in a judging way when i'm sitting in the theater. "what are you looking at? channing tatum himself told me to come see it. seriously!"
when the sidepiece is that famous no one can get jealous.
today dozens of redditors discover that what they are doing is called funemployment
korean jesus doesn't have time for your shit! he got korean things to worry about!
it's channing tatum. be honest with yourself, of course you do.
i think she was the female lead in step up 1? someone correct me if i'm wrong.
i want your life goal to be to see more digital breasts than channing in real life.
you can video tape it too so i never forget and can show my grandchildren
he literally was like i want to answer the weirdest questions.
beans....now there's a name i haven't heard in a long time...
most celebreties dont answer such questions or at least not honestly. i guess it hurts their business
i feel like there's a whole circle of cultural of appropriation to be answered for. i can't imagine scotland is happy about no scottish actor ever playing scotty.
i'd seen bale in about 6 different movies before being told he was actually british. the guy is insanely good. wouldn't have any other batman.
i think i told someone my username once. it didn't go well for him...
dozens? i think you're short by a few dozen thousands.
well first we need a ballpark from /u/channingtatumhere
i... you guys... guys you're embarrassing us in front of channing.
the dude who asked this question clearly did not grow up in a small town...
i don't fucking care how attractive you are, having multiple wives at the age of eleven is just fucking insane.
jeez, he makes a drawing and makes a relevant channing tatum pun in the same thread? fucking hell
i don't, but i do consider it for a split second and then i go "i can't do it." it's like watching your home movies, it's just me watching me. it's weird, don't you think?
we have a new episode of comedians in cars coming out with jim gaffigan, who i love, and in the episode i tell him about this joke i tried to do about, when you drop your dry cleaning off, you can go to any dry cleaner you want, but when you pick it up, you can only go to one. which i always thought was very funny, but nobody gets it.
hope all is well with you too! i don't do movies because i think generally the size of that content does not lend itself to great comedy; it lends itself to people saying, "hey, i made a movie." to me, the funniest things are shorter, so i think tv series or comedians in cars, i think i have a better chance of making you laugh.
i believe in detailed notes and jokes, and *also* winging it onstage. but, not for your first open mic. for your first open mic, my advice to you would be to make sure you have what you're gonna do memorized, to the point that one of your friends can gently slap you across the face, and you'll still be able to get it out of your mouth.
i think the best seinfeld episode idea i ever contributed was that george pretending to be a marine biologist would find kramer's golf ball in the blowhole of the whale. believe it or not, we were doing both of those stories without seeing any connection that kramer was gonna hit golf balls at the beach, and george was gonna be pretending to be a marine biologist. and it was in the middle of the week that it suddenly hit me of a way to connect the two stories. so, i think that's probably the best joke i ever thought of on the series. but, i love when people say "regift" or "giddyup", or "yadda yadda". the real and spectacular...i was a very big fan of the show.
our relationship is great. we have dinner, talk on the phone, and laugh as we always have.
we actually have just begun to entertain that idea. i'm kinda feeling like ccc should have that carson feeling of charles nelson riley coming on repeatedly, and it kinda becomes a little club that you have to get into. so yeah, i think we are gonna do it like that. it's never going to be six unknowns in a season.
there's tons of those. chaplain, george burns, george carlin, joan rivers... believe it or not, the idea has been explored to do some kind of cgi effect, using footage of dead comedians to get them in the car, and then we would write dialog around it. it was a total disaster, but you're not the first person to think of it!
i actually have quite a bit of it, and we're looking for a museum that wants to display it. i have the couch, i have the two blue stools, i have the table and chairs; the coolest thing i have is the door, which we never repainted in nine seasons. it has every scuff mark that kramer put on it with all those crazy entrances.
the best drive, of course, is the taconic, other then that anything in westchester off the main highway is pretty good. i just love driving honestly, i don't really care where i am.
least favorite...i once had a cadillac escalade in a very metallic beige, and the color made me sick. i liked the escalade, but a car must be in a good color, or it's useless.
i still say "hey" to greet a lot of people like we did on the show, and i still will do thumbs up, like kramer did. and i still say hello to people the way i said, "hello newman."
i place no limit on the amount coffee i can drink. i allow myself an infinite amount and i like it hot with cream. sometimes cappuccino, sometimes americana, but nothing fancier than that
not jerry but... make yourself a schedule. bar exam starts at 8:00am, goes until noon, 1hr break, goes for 4 more hours. make that your study schedule. you're up at 6am, you eat breakfast, get dressed, go to the library and you're hitting the books by 8am sharp. you get your break at noon, then back to the books. getting yourself into those motions helps so much. otherwise you're going to be exhausted mentally, physically and emotionally during the bar.
that was the most fun i ever had. the coolest part of that episode, that you couldn't see, was the head of the secret service explaining to me what was going to happen if someone started shooting at us. what they would do to the president and where they were going to throw me in the back of a van. that was really exciting bourne identity stuff.
why are the memories more important to you than the show and the laughs? i think the laughs are the most important part. but if you prefer to just remember the laughs, then have the laughs. that's your business! i do often talk to the cast, but not as often as when we were doing the show. remember when you were in high school? remember those people? it's like that.
larry david and i discovered that we were both obsessed with superman and admired him and also found him very funny at the same time, so that is why he came up a lot. are you related to the hot dog kobayashi in coney island?
i don't think he did have serious health issues at that time. we certainly wouldn't have made all those death jokes if we knew that. but it was really wonderful that we got to be together that one last time.
i was just there for the one night to do my favorite thing in my life, which is standup comedy. you, on the other hand, have chosen to spend your entire life in reading, shouldn't i really be asking you what the hell are you doing in reading?
i will say raisin bran crunch, but that's just for today.
bee movie was definitely my favorite movie that i've starred in, because i've always wanted to be a bee. they seem to have the most organized society on earth, and they make honey! which is a pretty amazing product.
please do. i love conan, he is legit the only person in late night i truly enjoy.
give him a weird look like you're concerned, act like you're about to say something, then stop and walk away quickly. it will bug him for the rest of his life.
what's the deal with homework? you're not working on your home! *boooooooooooooooo*
i'd let 90's julia louis-dreyfus playfully push me around.
would love to hear jerry's response to this. i thought he did a good job and like he said, what did paul expect would happen by hiring a comedian who obviously doesn't need the money and isn't going to suck up to anyone.
hi, glad to talk to another bee fan. what the bees can teach us is that no matter how small your job is, if you do it well, it makes a big difference. why don't you go back to your job?
jerry should play the chief justice of the supreme court. i'm not sure why, i just want him in that role if he appears on veep.
first, that is not a correct usage for the word "iconic". advice cannot be iconic. the best advice i ever got was from rodney dangerfield, who when i asked him a question about something in comedy, just looked at me for a second and then went, "you'll figure it out."
i liked the ones that i was in. i felt i brought a certain something to it. i have a lot of favorite episodes. the pothole, the marine biologist, the yadda yadda, the soup nazi, the contest.
"funniest" is completely personal. whoever you think is funniest, is funniest. for me, i've really enjoyed all of them, honestly. there's something different, or weird, or interesting that seems to happen every time.
probably where he realizes that he is a super wealthy person?
imagine if it were the episode where the gang is watching the "jerry" pilot on tv. it would be you watching you watching you.....
that's a great strategy on stewart's part. he only really has to tell the story on one late-night talk show, but then all of the thousands of hotel employees who have caught him at his secret shame over the years will nod knowingly and think, "oh, so it was just one of those weird one-off things." this is the story i'm telling myself now.
i had a similar, underappreciated, thought. i find it funny that a city will ticket a car over and over, basically saying "please move your car. please move your car." until one day they decide they no longer want you to move your car and they throw a boot on it.
i think a lot of comedy movies do tend to cause fatigue after enough jokes. an hour long standup special is probably the longest amount of straight comedy i can take.
i assume you will find no shortage of friends willing to give you practice slaps.
from the moment george says "the sea was angry that day, my friend" to the moment he holds up the golf ball is the funniest minute on television. i still laugh at that scene every time. thanks
so you're saying your relationship with larry is "pretty, pretty, pretty good?"
my masters thesis for such a class would be to answer the age old question of whether superman, in fact, has a super sense of humor.
i calculated the odds. i would never have had the opportunity to bang that waitress ever again. i had to
the david letterman ccc episode is my favorite and i'd love to see a followup with how he's doing since his show ended
that sounds like such an awful idea that i can't possibly believe anyone would seriously pitch it.
brian regan is the best. we see him every year. my husband laughs at nothing. but he cries at brian regan shows.
seeing parts of the set that i watched on tv would be quite surreal. i support this.
the taconic parkway is a dream to drive, especially in most of the cars featured on ccc.
ugh granny color. but you can't get it in black or everyone will think you're an uber driver nowadays
i legitimately laughed at this. you should be a comedian.
i would say that's a good goal, but it really depends on your skills and personality. i put i a solid 6 hours of effort every day, which is a lot for me, with probably 2 or 3 hours of productive work. walked out of the exam an hour before the end and bought champagne to hand out to the later finishers. passed.
i picture jerry like a little kid with this huge smile, eyes wide open, leaning in for more, saying things like "yeah? and then what? and what if they shoot over here? and do i get a gun?"
tell me about it. julia with the non-stop baby picture posts on facebook. "you gotta see the baby"
thanks for the answer jerry. i've always said that seinfeld is the most intelligent sitcom i have ever known. always will be my favourite! as for hot dog kobayashi, i'm just a distant cousin i believe... i am actually a character from a book by haruki murakami.
that had me laughing and crying, it's actually so human and such art.
thanks for the reply, it was a fantastic show. and i actually drove in from philadelphia, that was my first reading experience and should be my last.
well obviously, the natural progression would be sea movie. something about sea lions?
for that reason, i'd want the episode to be filmed in an old school vw bug.
i would let 2030's julia louis-dreyfus playfully push me around.
my favorite rodney dangerfield story apparently happened on the set of caddyshack. he is doing one of his first scenes and when he finishes he goes up to one of the actors upset. he says "oh man, i bombed. i got no reaction to any of my jokes." the actor says to him "rodney, it's a movie set, they can't laugh while the cameras are rolling."
that's exactly why it's great - i'm sure countess people have tried to pitch to jerry, but how many people have been asked & closed the door on him? not many.
kram feel left out of imessage group chats, so he get ipod touch "jery i'm out there facetiming and imessaging and i am loving it"
just thought i would tell you that i'm a big fan and my wife isn't so much. i called her to the tv last night claiming "this is a classic seinfeld scene." it was the scene at the rental agency where you're explaining how reservations work. she asked "aren't they all classic?" implying that every scene in the show is quotable/recognizable. coming from her, a non-fan, i think says a ton about the show. she and i do enjoy ccc together, though.
it would be a dude, watching a dude, playing a dude, who's watching a dude that's playing another dude.
with the right comedic timing this joke could work really well
sight gags ruined by the trailer, material you've heard before spun into movie lines, comedian being paired with a serious dramatic actor that makes the comedian's acting look poor, comedic films pretty much always get trashed by critics - so many reasons not to do a movie if you have something else working.
i remember one louis ck interview where he said his stage notes are just point form because it comes out more like it's the first time he's told it if he doesn't try to remember his exact wording. but, i think you have to be really experienced before you can depend on your natural story telling style to be funny and concise enough to pull this off.
the metaphor..."like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli." always killed me. great visual.
of course he does. how do you think he rescues a plane full of people all of whom came within seconds of dying horribly and cap it off with a nonchalant quip about how flying is still the safest way to travel? superman has seen some dire shit. his super sense of humor is what keeps him going.
i loved that moment when jerry said "we don't own the place" to which dave replied "but we could, right?" such an open, candid moment that you don't see that often.
it'd be funny for them just to have a segment of them trying to drive back into the white house, only for the guard to say "i'm afraid i can't let you do that sir" and have it be a reverse of the previous bit.
i bought a doughnut and they gave me a receipt for the doughnut; i don't need a receipt for the doughnut. i'll just give you the money, and you give me the doughnut, end of transaction. we don't need to bring ink and paper into this. i just can't imagine a scenario where i would have to prove that i bought a doughnut. some skeptical friend: "don't even act like i didn't get that doughnut! i got the documentation right here... oh, wait it's at home... in the file... under "d."
one of the few clean cut comedians you can take your kid to and still laugh your ass off. love him!
you hear that, jerry? the goatfucker supports your cause. he's a goat fucker, jerry! a real, live goat fucker!
gotta watch out for deer and speed traps though, especially at the i-84 interchange!
totally true. everyone needs to study their own way. i think the most important part of the schedule is being awake and ready to go at 8am, and waiting until noon for lunch. if you're half-awake at 8am on test day, ain't gonna be a fun time.
teacher: "time for a pop fuckin' quiz!" students: "omg the teacher just said fuck omg omg"
oh man... i'd love to see that scene play out with mac from always sunny.
*sounds of reading, pa redditors sobbing in the distance*
i don't think he is. it seems to me like he's trying to "play along" like after a roast, but he's just too stiff in his delivery and not very good at it. maybe he was supposed to pretend to be annoyed and he actually became annoyed at some point and he played it too stiff?
what's the deal with parking boots? they don't want you to park there, but then they make it so you can't leave! it's insanity!
imagine how many takes there were over the years too. dude had a lot of practice. i wonder if he found himself at the time (or finds himself even today) accidentally entering rooms like that.
i saw one of seinfeld's shows about a year ago. at the end during his audience q&a, he called on somebody who just quoted a memorable line from his show. jerry basically lectured him (humorously, but very seriously), on how he doesn't find that funny in the least because it's his own joke from his own show, and it's been quoted to him so many times he just finds it annoying. and of course, the next person he called on said, "no soup for you!" and jerry just looked exasperated and said, "did you not hear what i *just* said?!"
this 'script' really seems to fit the characters well. for some reason kramer watching jerry's show on an uncomfortable stool gets me. i can see him hearing a joke, laughing really hard and going for the knee slap move, and then hitting his knee and flailing all over the place like three times in a row it's perfect physical comedy for michael richards also bob sacamano... perfect.
they want you out right up until they never want you to leave. it's like living with my parents all over again!
every episode and intro has a unique bass line. it's made to match the rhythm of his opening standup.
he probably does it on purpose every now and then. who wouldn't?
i bet that second guy had a really good question ready until that lecture started.
seinfeld is just one of those shows that if it's on, you have leave it. unless it's the bootlegger one and we have to watch elaine dance. i can't handle that.
it's like something you'd see out of old silent films, from a tumbler like buster keaton or something.
it's kind of in the same era as seinfeld, but i've been watching 3rd rock from the sun lately and both french stewart and john lithgow absolutely kill it with their physical comedy.
not only that, i think larry sprung it on him basically right before and he said he could memorize it in about 30 mins. shows how great of an actor he is that such a smart, talented guy could so convincingly play george costanza
some of the funniest parts on that show are when you can tell one or all of them is about to crack. there's something so endearing and genuine about it - it makes you feel like you're a part of the joke.
if you can be considered classically trained in slapstick, i'm pretty sure michael richards is.
hahahaha... and then like two other dudes rush into frame. "whoa... heyhey! who was on patdown detail." "see. you need the occs man, i'm tellin' ya."
hey that riff was custom made for each episode to match jerry's stand up at the beginning.
you can hear george (jason alexander) bust a gut when elaine (julia louis-dreyfus) throws his toupee (fake hair) out the window in one episode
in the episode where george shares a bed with his father, and his father is eating soup, george actually has to put the pillow over his face to keep from laughing.
no. we divorced while i was in prison for personal reasons not related to my crimes.
one teller skimped out on me and didn't give me all i had asked for, and i told her, "you can do better than that." she just shrugged -- palms up like a little kid -- and said, "that's all i got." pretty ballsy on her part.
lmao. actually, yes. and they know about my criminal history because i went to high school with one of the girls that works at my bank. i keep a minimal amount of money in the bank for obvious reasons -- usually less than a thousand bucks or so. i actually think my account is pretty close to zero for now. bank of texas. :)
that depends on the situation. if it was just some random guy trying to be a hero, i would have probably gone to any extreme necessary to get away because that's a challenge. on the other hand, if it was a cop or a security guard of some sort, i would have probably let them win. probably.
1) only the internet. i studied countless reports of other robberies that had gone wrong and people who were caught. 2) no. i never told anyone what i was doing. one of the main things i learned from research was that an overwhelming number of people are caught because they didn't do it solo. so i never let anyone (not even my wife or best friend) know what i was doing. 3) yes. i still acknowledge what i've done, but the process and experience of going to prison and finding myself (as well as a purpose in life) has really made it all worth it, relatively speaking. it's hard to regret something that has turned into something so good. 4) i was working in the oil fields until recently. now i stay at home with my boys, and i am trying to get a book published and turn that into some sort of career, if at all possible. i've been on a few shows, and people seem genuinely interested in hearing more, so that's what i've decided to do.
not that much, honestly. probably around $5k per bank.
i researched for about five or six months prior to my first one. i studied mostly the things that people did to get caught, and i just tried to plan around those things. it's hard to know how people get away since those details rarely make it to the news, but studying how people get caught was incredibly helpful in knowing what to avoid. once i did my first bank, very little planning was needed for subsequent banks. i never really scoped out a particularly location other than to make sure there was parking that was out of view from the bank.
i was calm and controlled, but it was incredibly intense at the same time. it's like having sex while taking the sats. you have to focus on both 100% even though that's not totally possible, and that's why it's so rewarding when it works.
it was scary the first time i tried, but i left and didn't do it. i returned the next day and wasn't scared. it's not really something you can do if you're afraid. fear gets in the way of clear thinking. the police were very professional. they sent the swat team to the hotel where i told them to come get me, so that was pretty shit-your-pants scary, but they didn't fuck me up or anything. once i was cuffed and cleared and all that crap, they all talked to me like i was a rock star or something. it was really strange. they asked "why" and all that stuff, but it wasn't like the cop style of "why." it was more like a fascinated curiosity.
[copied from another reply] basic outline: - stand in line like a regular customer - wait for the next available teller - hand them an envelope and tell them to give me their $50s and $100s (usually this was written on the envelope rather than me verbally saying it) - turning around and walking out like a regular customer no gun. no threats. no hollywood drama. no mask. no disguise. nothing. just a regular customer. in and out in the same amount of time as if i was making a deposit. ----- no dye packs. nothing like that. i never entertained any ideas from guys in prison who wanted to get together on the outside and do more banks. i did just fine by myself when i was still doing it, but i had also decided to quit for a reason. most guys in prison all did it the same way. the walked in with a gun and tried to be bonnie & clyde. ...which is how they ended up in prison.
no, i never worried about stuff like that because i was always long gone before the police got there anyway. and nobody ever saw what i drove because i would always park behind another building that you couldn't see from the bank.
could be true, but what about when an officer is heading back to the station for one reason or another and they hear a bank just got hit or happen to use that bank while they're on or just getting off duty? i'd be much more comfortable being far away from a police station if this was my line of work.
it was for everything but the money. it was fun, exciting, and addictive.
lol, that's funny. but no. that's the kind of thing that'll get you on the news (if you're lucky enough to get away in the first place). so even though i'm sure that's a joke, i'll treat it as a real question and say a big hell no. :)
i wrote a book, and a friend of mine suggested that i do an ama on here because people apparently like this kind of shit. i wasn't so sure, and i figured i had nothing to lose in coming on here to see what people would like to know. ultimately, my purpose is to just tell the better part of my story about how i'm not the guy i used to be and that it's never too late to get your shit together and put your head on straight. i was a real piece of shit once upon a time, but i'm not anymore. i'm very happy with who i've become, and i'll do anything possible to reach those who are walking down the path that i walked down a decade ago. so if it's just q&a to a thousand people and i still reach that one person, then that's good with me.
basic outline: - stand in line like a regular customer - wait for the next available teller -hand them an envelope and tell them to give me their $50s and $100s (usually this was written on the envelope rather than me verbally saying it) - turning around and walking out like a regular customer no gun. no threats. no hollywood drama. no mask. no disguise. nothing. just a regular customer. in and out in the same amount of time as if i was making a deposit. i generally chose a time of day when i thought the cops were on shift change, which was usually around 3pm. some cities actually publish that for whatever weird reason. i usually went to chili's or somewhere to eat and chill out.
i think most first-timers do it out of desperation for their own personal financial problems, but career bank robbers -- in my opinion -- do it for the rush or the thrill rather than financial reasons. doing one successful heist just makes you feel that much more confident, and eventually people let their guards down and stop being careful like they were in their earliest crimes. for me, i treated every single one as the most important thing in my life, and i went to great lengths to make sure i didn't let myself get into a position to be caught.
if all you have is a picture or video of someone, that's not really useful. as long as i didn't make it to the news, i was good to go. and nothing i did was newsworthy because nobody got hurt and i didn't make a scene. no dye packs or anything like that. getaway was crucial. i only robbed banks that were in parking lots or something like that with other businesses around. i parked my truck out of view from the bank so nobody could see what i was getting into.
i never kept it, but i did pay it back after prison.
imagine you'd never met me or saw this ama (or anything about me anywhere). now imagine if they sent you the video of the bank jobs i did. would you be able to find me? :)
no and no. i'm sure i scared a few people just by the nature of what was going on, but i never assaulted anyone.
10/10 on this question. i'm going to say 100 duck-sized banks.
- give me all of your $50s and $100s - don't look at me - this is not a joke
to not do it. the majority of bank robberies are solved because people don't know how to not get caught. it's very hard to get away with, and i don't recommend it to anyone. it's exciting at first, and it's even addicting. but like any addiction, you always want more until you realize that more is never enough and you're left feeling quit empty inside. a serious answer to a (probably) funny question, but that's what comes to mind for me when i read it.
did she discover that you only went to prison to avoid changing diapers? just kidding.
plot twist: he robbed the bank of texas 3 times then took the stolen money back in a week later and opened an account with it
so hang on, you were willing to put people to the sword to escape, but turned yourself in when you hung up your boots?
why did the tellers give you the money if you had nothing to threaten them with?
how many pounds of shit, would you say, were in your pants while walking out the door?
why didn't your wife react to the money that just "showed up"?
hm. doesn't sound like a whole lot. how much would one teller even carry?
what is the total amount you made before you were caught? did you keep the money?
i know raising a baby is hard, but was it so bad you went to the police station and were like " take me to jail!! i can't do it anymore!!"
is there a reason you didn't go to the police station? i would be scared that a swat-type situation could get out of hand. if i'm a police officer responding to this situation, my nerves are gonna be on edge because i don't know what i'm walking in to. i can imagine that you could have done something wrong and been really harmed by the cops who were likely also afraid you were up to something. so why not just go straight to the police station, say "i'd like to speak to an officer and turn myself in for committing a non-violent crime" and avoid the danger?
i don't get how you didn't get caught. did they not have cameras in the bank?
did you use your normal car with your actual license plate? that seems extremely risky. i feel like it'd be better to use your car, but use a stolen license plate or something. then when you get a few miles away. stop and swap plates. obv driving with a stolen license plate for too long is stupid and could get your pulled over. but having your real plate seems super risky. if someone follows you to your car and gets the plate number, you're caught.
the us bank in my city is literally 4 minutes walking distance from the police station (google maps). it has gotten robbed at least 3 times since 2008.
can you still get arrested for a robbery you didn't mention?
i still don't understand. sounds like no one was on your trail and you could have avoided arrest altogether. did you have another motivation - such as wanting to quit 'for real'? how did you turn yourself in? go to a defense lawyer first? seems like a very daring move - you could have gotten 20 years in prison for it. did you have any idea in advance how much time you would actually wind up serving?
hello. i'm not sure if you are still answering questions but my best friend i've known for 10+ years has recently got himself into shoplifting. he talks to me about the thrill of it and how addictive it's getting and how he practically can not stop himself at this point. is there anything i can do to help him? i really would hate to see him get arrested.
well we got the retiree, now all we need is a sensible young black man and a psychotic redneck.
honestly all this ama has done for me is make me want to rob banks with your template
what was your go-to, post-robbery meal at chili's? the triple dipper?
i took a criminology course that had a large focus on bank robbery and i am finding it amazing how your answers seem straight from my textbook.
the bank probably did the best they could to make sure nobody knew they got robbed. these days, this happens over the internets.
depending on how the teller handled it, you might see a change in his/her demeanor or a change in the way they handed you the money, just scooping bills out and stuffing them in an envelope vs meticulously counting it all... but as you said even if they cam identify "mr. robber" they have no id for you and can't track you. the small amount of money you're taking (and thus the low publicity) doesn't warrant a full scale man-hunt. good plan. keep your enemy small, yourself smaller.
if your telling us this inticed someone into robbing a bank how would you feel about that?
truly cool username for a retired prison chaplain.
no. figuring out what the fuck was wrong with my head that made it where i couldn't function like normal people in society.
*hands note to teller: give me all your 50s and 100s and don't be fucking stupid. bitch.* *takes money* hi, thank you for your cooperation. i'd also like to open a savings account. *hands over drivers' license and ssn card*
you really think someone making barely more than minimum wage is going to bet their life on whether or not the person demanding cash has a gun?
she probably was fired. her doing that put the entire branch safety at risk. at least in the heat of a robbery, banks still consider human life worth more than money....or perhaps its just the bad pr of a customer hurt is worse than lost money...
i hope she was fired, she could have just put everyone in there at risk.
i don't believe there is such a thing as legal stealing. you either steal or you don't. i'd be happy to respond to a specific scenario you're talking about, but as a general rule, i don't think it's wrong if two people willingly enter a contract even if one side benefits more heavily than the other. as for me, i think morality is very subjective. i wouldn't steal from an individual person because i'm not comfortable with that. the banks, however, consider this kind of theft an acceptable loss, so that was okay with me being part of the loss that they consider acceptable. part of my process did begin with how poorly i thought rich people handled their money. i'd always thought, "if i was that rich, i could change the world instead of just piling up cash." i don't use that to make bank robbery "okay" but that's what made it okay for me at the time.
i'm writing my own non-fiction, actually. facebook.com/bluechipstore if you're interested. there are some excerpts there. rumor has it i can write.
in their top drawer, it was usually less than $10k. i probably averaged around $5k per bank. but it was pretty low risk that way, so that was cool with me.
no threat. i just told them what i wanted, and they complied. this is how it works in america because the amount of money a bank gives up ($5-$7k on average) per bank robbery is infinitely less than the amount of business they'd lose if shit got wild in a bank full of customers. they just want to give you what you want and for you to get the hell out of their bank.
my sister worked at a bank. they had pretty specific instructions to just do whatever a robber asked and offer no resistance at all. as far as a mask, maybe he had lemon juice on his face?
$300 in court fees, and payment in full for the amount i stole.
of course they had cameras. but then what? nobody knew me. what good does it know only having a face and basic description?
do it like steve buscemi in fargo. go into a parking garage and have at whatever plates you wanted.
there's a statute of limitations. the years depend on the crime. i'm not sure what it is for robbery, but not armed and small amounts probably means it's not super long (10 years?).
book deal. he can't publish a book on how he was a bank robber without having jail on the record.
plot twist: he hasn't robbed any banks. he's testing reddit with this strategy to see if anyone can poke holes in it. double plot twist: the photo he posted is of some guy he doesn't like. that guy will get the blame if the authorities ever tie a string of robberies back to this ama. by that point he'll be sipping pina coladas in buenos aires and the fall guy will have been through the runaround.
i don't like or dislike the questions as much as i enjoy the ability to put myself out there and perhaps cause a spark in someone else's imagination to do something productive with their own shitty circumstances.
listen dude, let's try not to be ignorant here ok? any real chilis aficionado knows you get the triple dipper with boneless buffalo, south western egg rolls, and sliders.
i know exactly what you mean. unfortunately for me, it took a second stretch inside for me to get straightened out. i never did anything like banks, i was only in for a few months for theft each time. i still don't feel like i function the same (mentally, at least) as other people, but i put on a damned good act now. just the fear of going back a third time was enough to break the habits that got me put away.
put the money in the bag. put it in. will that be out of your checking or savings account? uh, savings.
it's not just that. if someone even slips you a note and tells you to give them money *or else* (you know, something threatening), the employee has to comply. in one of the robberies i've been in, the teller directly next to my window got robbed and i didn't even know until the robber was gone.
all of the money is insured, so being a hero and potentially getting people hurt is not advised.
thank you so much for explaining that! i'll let you get to your other questions :)
how is this low risk? i'm actually amazed you didn't get caught. what about cameras? or a description from the teller to the police?
yup. i was a teller who was robbed an i got in trouble for pressing the trouble button before the robber had left. they didn't want the police showing up with the robber still in the bank.
i've worked a bunch of retail and in a lot of places we used to get similar instructions - if you get robbed, just give the person whatever they ask for and don't offer any resistance even if they don't seem threatening. mostly just because they're insured for loss through theft anyway, and you never really know how dangerous/crazy someone will turn out to be. much better to just file an insurance claim than to have to deal with an employee getting hurt or killed.
he stopped robbing because he knew he'd get exactly 3 years, which is just the right amount to dodge all the shenanigans with his baby. it was a long con.
superman: lex, why did you steal the cakes? why, you maniacal fiend? lex: two reasons, superman. one? i'm a criminal mastermind. two? *nobody was looking*.
its adorable that he did that for her. but sorta counterproductive when you think about it.
makes no sense. you don't need to know a person to identify them. so your description never made the local news? what's going on here.
"not really" is a pretty cool nickname tbh. i wonder what's the shorthand for it
i get the feeling that after this thread, there will be an exponential increase in non-aggressive bank robberies dealing with sums in the area of $5,000.
we are currently showing a balance of $0 and 0 cents... next..
maybe he wants someone to make a movie about him and he's just helping them out with the tag line.
i save my dishonesty for when q&a's are not voluntary. :) and it's my pleasure. someone else suggested i do this, and i was skeptical, but it's actually a wee bit refreshing on my end, as well.
even if it wasn't policy, only a fucking idiot would refuse. crappy teller job is not worth dying for.
indeed, the money is save but your image is a goner after reading in the newspaper that customers got killed after a teller freaked out cornering the bank robber.
:) there's a link in the "proof" or whatever to my book's facebook if you want to read more.
and that video store clerk... was quentin tarantino.
i know man! your reputation precedes you. it's just funny seeing you pop up like that.
there are banks on every corner in america. all he has to do is drive a couple hours in any direction and no one would ever recognize him
really? i think the most interesting way is sitting inside the bank with hostages with three accomplices and fighting off cops while waiting for the thermal drill to get through the vault.
right now a ton of redditors are thinking up crazy ideas.
former teller here. we were trained not to press the button until the robber left. they don't want to create a potential hostage situation by having the cops show up while the robber's still there.
so robbing a bank is like arguing with a genie, if i'm specific enough with my instructions i'll get what i want?
same advice applies if you ever get robbed. nothing you carry on you is worth more than your life. your life is the most valuable thing in the world
stealing $5000 is pretty unlikely to make local news, in major metro areas several people commit that magnitude of theft every day... and if nobody ever sees a gun, nobody is actually individually harmed, and nobody is driven to a panic, then it isn't a huge story. if you drive to a different metro area to commit the crime in, even a photo on the news several nights in a row isn't going to be much help. crime shows give you a weirdly skewed perspective, where they have all of these resources and always catch people. in reality, security camera footage only really helps you next time you see them. you can show it to people hoping for recognition, but even then, even if people know the suspect, many people will not recontextualize this nice guy they know to see him as a bank robber, or, if they can, will not turn him in.
i almost got caught in those doors on my last one. i got out within seconds of them locking them. i was very fortunate.
lmao, good point. i meant robinhood was one of my nicknames. but i'm good being called "not really" though.
honestly i would have done it just to save me from paranoia. fuck a life of hiding and worrying.
and an unexplained increase in business at chili's locations near banks.
well the bank teller wasn't a professional bank robber.
i can just see his head taking up an entire movie poster with explosions reflected in his eyes. my game. my rules.
could anything you say here come back to bite you? you say you only admitted to a few robberies to the police but you admit to dozens now. are the rest beyond the statutes of limitations or something?
when i was in high school my friend and i would go over to our local movie rental store after school because of this quirky guy who worked there who seemed to have this insane encyclopedic knowledge of all things cinematic. he would give us obscure recommendations for films no one had ever heard of but that he had in stock. they were always homeruns for a couple stoner teenage chuckleheads like us. the other thing he would tell us which we just chalked up to him having lofty dreams was about the scripts he was writing. this being southern california we weren't too impressed. sure sure who *hasnt* written a script, man? my old babysitter wrote a script. bfd fast forward some years later the script turned out to be reservoir dogs. our weird, eccentric but genius video store clerk buddy over at video archives in manhattan beach (now gone) was quentin tarantino. dare to dream.
or grow a long beard and hair in preparation for the first bank. then shave it before going to a second bank. actually, if styled right, you could probably get 3-4 completely different looks.
the most interesting way i can think of is to hire a bunch of guys to rob a mob-owned bank while wearing clown masks, then have them kill each other off so i keep 100% of the take.
yeah but i estimate none are actually going to do anything we're armchair bank robbers
for situations where the robber has already escalated the situation. if he's flashing a gun you hit the button and get help asap. if he's not an immediate threat, just get him out of there.
what about cameras? i'm assuming banks have security cams, and you didn't stand in line waiting with a ski mask on. they couldn't do anything with camera footage?
and then it comes back to bite you in the ass later, just like a real genie wish should.
lol, well the dye pack is not kept with the regular cash, in case you accidentally set it off. so you have to somewhat go out of your way to get it from another drawer. if the thief is smart, he's watching you do this. they told us to try to give it to him if it doesn't pose some kind of threat. so i was just using an example, if the guy is pointing a gun at me as i empty my drawer, and he says "don't put the dye pack in", i'm sure as fuck not going to make him even think i'm doing that. this was at one specific bank over 15 years ago, i'm sure different banks have different procedures, and that technology probably got better too.
this is the best sentence i've read in a while. and it could be applied to so many situations. "did you get that pet snake you were looking at?" "no, the new girl got it, along with ptsd and eventually breast implants."
yup. people break into cars in my apartment lot all the time, been happening for years. people cried about getting cameras, so the strata got cameras (which we all got to pay for....). robberies have not slowed down, nobody has been caught, afaik the cameras serve only to deter potential crime and they aren't even working for that.
at the bank i work at, we tend to be pretty specific about people we even let in the bank, but this is a very small bank where we know customers in a first name basis. p.s. i probably shouldn't be telling an ex-bank robber this, but bank employees can't legally hold people between the doors because we can be charge with kidnapping.. i know it sounds ridiculous, but it's 100% true.
you only have to make it seven years not the rest of your life. statute of limitations.
assume the swallow is in the shape of a sphere with negligible air resistance.
can you imagine him showing up to testify? "yes, i did robbed the bank, that's how i know she's a filthy liar" it'd be a very short deliberation
i wouldn't have guessed she took it. i was just particular about the facts being straight. if i was going to fess up to that shit, it was going to be perfect and accurate.
boom- i think that might be it. something seems off.
you haven't seen the fees they charged.. hey-ooooo
i'm not worried about saying the wrong stuff. i know the limits.
rented from him in manhattan beach back in the day. can verify.
seems like the way to go, i mean you could be carrying a weapon, simply walking in and asking for all the money will almost certainly get you it. even if it's small, the risk of someone getting shot at a bank is not worth it, you'd rather be the bank that handed some dude 10k than the bank where your teller got someone killed.
but they can somehow afford to hire a guy with a helicopter and giant junkyard magnet
reddit: i'm going to be a bank robber! loading: payday 2
i might have heard this on reddit not sure. a former bank robber explained how anyone can rob a bank and get away with it, once. you go miles away from where you live or ever plan to visit. go in with no weapons or mask. go to the teller and tell them to give you all of the money in their tray, do not call the police, do not trigger any type of alarm, do not include a dye pack or anything besides cash. tell them to wait 5 minutes before calling the police (they probably won't but might as well). then you leave, walk the 5 blocks to your car and drive away. old saying: never break the law while committing a crime. so drive away nice and smooth, don't speed. then never rob a bank again. you will probably never be caught. people get caught when they are cocky, form a pattern or make a mistake. it is easy to make a mistake if this is the 5th time you've done something without anything going wrong. might all have been bs but seems to make sense to me.
though that would be a funny to explain to the cops. "i just asked very politely, i was quite surprised they handed me the money"
nowadays they have dye bags right next to the regular bags. the bag opening after the switch being set on is what triggers it now. so that's why i asked. now that you mention it being 15 years ago, that makes more sense. but today, it's easy to fool the robber.
did the cameras produce quality photos of the people doing the robberies?
this whole ama is very intriguing for aspiring bank robbers. :)
any more information or link to articles on this method of forcing self identifying limits?
"so our bank robber is in a frictionless vacuum, now we only have 2 minutes to calculate how long it will take him to open the door before he's dead"
so the bank and fbi hadn't previously watched that video?
he says he's been on some shows. i'd be curious to see one of them and if it matches up with his pic, then i guess that's that.
former teller here. i made all of $10/hour. i'll hand you every penny in every drawer if you just ask with a stern voice. that money isn't mine, i don't care if you have it, just please don't hurt me.
that happened to a buddy of mine at a gas station. late at night he purchased a pack of smokes, cashier asks if there is anything else she can get him. he says how about some of that cash (trying to be funny/flirty - hes kind of an odd duck). she opened the register and was trying to give him money and he noped the fuck out of there without taking anything. got arrested 10 minutes down the road for robbery
i think in general though, if the robber has some awareness of whatever technique you would use to foil him, such as a dye pack, or triggering the alarm, and specifically tells you not to do it, we were taught not to do anything that may escalate the situation. i think they theory should still hold to this day.
look up premortems. before a project or major task is finished, sit down and assume it's a month in the future and that project has failed beyond all recovery. spend a couple of minutes writing reasons it failed. this works well with teams, it makes predicting failure something to achieve rather than something to not think about.
they were looking at the robber and missed the bear.
former truck driver here, when i was held up i offered to teach the guy how to drive an 18 wheeler just so he would go the fuck away without hurting me.
eh. its a tempting offer, but i'm going to have to decline.
they had no choice. this was what they were ordered to do, and they studied so diligently because they were obedient. it is a culture where they have to listen to the authorities. but little by little, they would show some frustrations. they found it hard. their dictionaries were outdated, which translated korean words to english, and they didn't like to use english dictionaries for definition. they found different accents by the teachers (many were missionaries from deep south, with the southern accent, or from new zealand etc) difficult to understand. but these were just practical difficulties. their real feelings about having to learn them? they couldn't really show it. they just felt worried that they were spending all their time learning english when their majors were within the field of science and technology
there were so many things. they just learn totally upside down information about most things. but one thing i think most people do not realize is that they learn that south korea & us attacked north korea in 1950, and that north korea won the war due to the bravery of their great leader kim il sung. so they celebrate victory day, which is a huge holiday there. so this complete lie about the past then makes everything quite illogical. because how do you then explain the fact that korea is divided still, if actually north korea "won" the war? one would have to question that strange logic, which they do not. so it's not so much that they get taught lies as education, but that that second step of questioning what does not make sense, in general, does not happen, not because they are stupid but because they are forbidden and also their intelligence is destroyed at young age. there were many many examples of such.
i kept them all on usb sticks which i kept on my body at all times. i erased the trace off my computer every single time i signed off. i also created a document within a document so that my notes looked like a school material. i also created a back up copy on sd card which i hid in secret places in the dark, with the light off, just in case there were camera in the room.
hi, for now at least, i would not be allowed to go back, but more than that, even if i were allowed, which i could be in the future, i would probably not go because it would be too dangerous (in a different way than when i was there undercover for the book) and also because i would not feel that i would learn anything new, unless it could be under a different setting, which would be nearly impossible to find for the moment. and yes, there are more books at work:) thanks for reading.
generally it's the same. yes, the accent is different & they have some phrasings and words that are different or feel quite old fashioned or war-related vocabularies, but in general the difference is almost regional where one has that in south korea from region to region also, but when you are talking about the basic exclamation you cite, (when bumping into things or surprised) they are pretty much not that different.
only those texts allowed in china. all that was pre-approved by the north korean authority. i tried to install my own methods of essay writing and letter writing to investigate what they are really thinking, but that was not a part of the official text, but i insisted and got them approved by the north korean authority called "counterpart".
you know. . .i don't really know. i could give all the usual answers how i was so tortured by the injustice there - which is true - and how i felt horrified watching so many separation that happened to families, including my own - which is also true. but the answer is a far more complicated one. so i recently wrote a long essay on this very topic for lapham's quarterly, which should be coming out any day now. so i will tweet that out when the piece comes out. i think it has something to do with fear. how that society is built on fear, and how fear can dictate us, and how we try to fight that fear in life. . .i know it's maybe a bit nonsensical in this ama answer format, for which i apologyze. . .but the more accurate answer would be that i jumped in there because it was the most scary place in the world for me. . .if that makes any sense.
the average citizen is unlikely to have any access to the "outside world" on a day-to-day basis. however there are smugglers that bring sd cards, cds, etc. into the country with forbidden material on it such as western/south korean movies and kpop.
i am always torn between the two genres. but if i really had to choose, i guess my heart is with fiction. but nonfiction makes my brains flow perhaps in a really exciting way. and my nonfiction in general is literary that i get my fiction angst/fill through that way. i don't know which i "like" writing better. writing is so torturous for me that it's only after finishing it or nearing the end that i can enjoy it:) no, i do not consider myself a korean-american literature writer. that genre is an odd one for fiction writers. i guess one cannot help that in coming up with genres, but especially fiction, to be limited by my nationality or immigration history is uncomfortable. i guess i just want to be a "writer", period. yes, the interpreter -- so many years later, i myself still have a real soft spot for suzy park, so thank you.
i think the biggest misconception goes back to the basic premise. most americans have no idea why there are two koreas, or why there are 30,000 us soldiers in south korea and why north korea hates america so much. that very basic fact has been sort of written out of the american consciousness. by repackaging the korean war as a civil war, it has now created decades of a total misconception. the fact that the us had actually drawn the 38th parallel that cut up the korean peninsula, not in 1950 (the start of the war) but in 1945 at the liberation of korea from japan is something that no korean has forgotten -- that was the beginning of the modern korean tragedy. that the first great leader (the grandfather of the current great leader) was the creation of the soviet union (along with the us participation) is another horrible puzzle piece that americans have conveniently forgotten.
i dont know about cannabis, but i have heard from several sources that meth use is common as it is much cheaper than food, easing stomach pain from starvation, as well as provides energy for a long and tiring work day. i would also like to know the ops comments on this and if its true.
the whole idea for the literary nonfiction on north korea came in february 2002 when i first went to pyongyang for the 60th birthday celebration of kim jong il & wrote the nyrb cover essay. i realized then that an essay was just not enough, and there was just so much more i felt about this topic, also given my family background etc. from then on, it was trying to study the topic as thoroughly as i could, by literally researching it from afar and close, i.e. following defectors through the defection route, interviewing separated families, and situating myself in places where i could either go to north korea or learn more in-depth stuff about it. even my fulbright research grant which allowed me to live in seoul for 14 months in 2009 was for this book. as well as each visit that allowed me to get a different perspective. understanding it from all sides was a key, and i felt that i had exhausted that by the time i lived there in 2011. so all in all, i would say about a decade.
it was an unpaid job. i believe every teacher was sponsored by their church. there is not a danger in teaching in north korea, but this is a gulag nation, and america is their enemy, and there is no diplomatic relations between them, so if you are a teacher from the us, then, yes you are in danger, as evidenced by the recent hostage crisis where two american detained by north korea (currently still held there) are from the university where i taught.
there are americans and other foreigners teaching english in the capital so i would think english is ok. also, there is a lot of western tourism that again requires english in the capital
i wasn't there to teach, so that was not what i was looking for. my students were so busy, every hour of their day was mapped out, so it leaves no time for thinking. i found that world to be without hope. that does not mean that there is no joy in moments. there are because human beings are resilient, and my students were very, incredibly humane and lovely and their youthful spirit was sparklingly beautiful. but there was no real time for them to celebrate any of it. they would relax a bit but the immediately hauled off to their many duties that all had to do with regime & great leader. there was no hope there. so i wrote down what i saw. but i do not know about other teachers who were there to teach, but if you read my book, you will see that the other teachers weren't mostly there to teach but there as a part of their fundamental evangelical missionary purpose.
i can answer this if you like. pfc - pyongyangs answer to kfc. was a nice break from the kimchi.
learning the language of the enemy could probably get you recruited as a spy, allow you to do business overseas for the regime, etc.
are there higher "elites"? there must be a level higher who these people fear?
did you spend all of your time using english? i presume you speak korean, were you allowed to use it with your students? or was that discouraged? how proficient were your students with english by the age of 19 or so? had they been learning since early childhood? how were they chosen for this education stream?
well if the premise is that north korea was attacked, then you can say you "won" if you beat back the invaders and made them retreat back to the original borderline.
oh great, now the next undercover journalist can't use those anymore because you just answered north-korean spys question!
in my time spent in korea in the army, we have katusas, south koreans attached to army squads for interpreters in case shit goes down. whenever we did something to impress them or they like something they would all always in unison go ohhhhhhhhh.....always made us army dudes smile
i was just curious, because i think of those phrases as "emotional" or at least "outburst-like" and i don't really picture n.koreans as "allowed" to express emotions (except for crying when they see the great leader) so it struck me to ask it.
what kind of things did you learn from the essay writing?
was there the risk of your personal notes and documents being taken? how did you write the book?
this answer reminds me of something that dr. jordan peterson talks about: &nbsp; choosing to willingly confront the chaos instead of unwillingly being confronted by it
also note: watching foreign movies caries a death sentence.
thank you for the reply. very interesting. i feel the same way about writing; it's torture. but suzy park is a great character. i always wonder how writers feel about their novels appearing in college course syllabi for "asian-american journeys" or "korean-american culture and literature" or "the immigrant experience" rather than in courses that have nothing to do with immigrant/race/nationality. anyway. i guess we have a long way to go.
why did the allies divide korea to begin with? did the soviets/chinese have soldiers there during wwii?
not 100%, but i'm pretty sure cannabis is completely legal there, just growing on the side of roads freely, not considered a drug. these buds would be seedy though, no good by any means. you probably wouldn't want to have the munchies there anyway..
but you went to teach english with them knowing you were a journalist?
thanks - one last one for clarification and one more out of curiosity. 1. so as a canadian, teaching there should be relatively safe. 2. i feel i've seen people get in trouble for proselytizing. why are all teachers organized through a church if they're against religion? ... think i'm missing something.
what are those duties filling every day of a student in the pretty empty north korea?
it's also the language of international business and diplomacy (sometimes).
it's a satirical subreddit, and people do get easily censored and banned as that's part of the act.
they could also fear those near their social position too. not necessarily higher. people lower or lateral to their position might compromise them to improve their own position.
i am reading 1984 now for the first time and was just thinking the same thing!
a bit late but in her ted she said she wasnt allowed to speak korean!
they worked technical fields - there's a lot more reference materials out there in english than in korean, i'm willing to wager.
you're forgetting that they also believe themselves to be the most powerful nation on the planet. this dichotomy they push of being the single greatest (unbeatable) superpower in history along with the fact that this county only succeeded so far as to merely push the invaders back is where the logic would still fall apart.
yet another is that when kim was trapped, he used a piece of paper, put it on the ocean water and ran away on the piece of paper. pretty funny, and it's sad that nk citizens are brainwashed to believe it.
i never would have realized finland didn't win that war without reading your comment. i had no idea they gave any territory. all i've ever really heard was about the sniper and how stalin crippled the soviet army.
pls no more disgusting saccharin, i'll just be over here with paperweight.
that seems to be the last of their worries, but also a horrific strategy if you want to succeed in the long run. do they not see this immediate benefit as a long term handicap??
not really. they were indeed successful in their defence, so they got to write their own history about it. the saying stands.
it would be wrong to call nk socialist in any sense of the word. absolutely no worker holds control over their place of work or any means of production, and socialism is built out of democracy and consensus decision making. nk can best be described as an authoritarian state capitalist country
don't worry, north korea doesn't have internet so they'll never see this
you can see ir light with your own camera. try using an ir remote and look at it via camera. heat cameras are loud and expensive and big. not good for covert surveillance and glass is not transparent.
ah yes, that's the reddit answer i was looking for. lol. look into tails os too.
it is a totalitarian atheist regime, religion (other than worshipping the kim family) is forbidden and will get you arrested and possibly tortured. the school she taught at is actually run by american christian pioneers but they are not allowed to teach or talk about christianity.
that is an exceedingly amusing image, thank you. this shall serve as a nice substitute for op's reply.
yeah, the documentary is incredibly interesting. i recommend it to anyone who's more curious about north korea here.
lol the chinese do this exact same thing in hong kong!
she explains in the book how she hid the usb...really amazing
yeah, to me it almost reads as a mixture of daydreaming and imagination as a means of escape. it's definitely the kind of thing that you would see in kids who grow up in abject poverty or in abusive situations.
although just like a lot of death sentances for weird stuff in authoritarian states it's more of a threat and political tool. most normal people get away with some way less serious punishment but if they need to make an example or get rid of someone the option is there.
until they get caught watching one if our movies then get sentenced to death.
this is what is so frustrating to me. 'fake news' has been around since humans could talk. people embellish, people tell vague truths, people straight up lie in everyday life. to call actual reporting and investigative journalism 'fake news' is so disingenuous. and even more, to haphazardly call straight up lies a particular media/state organization puts out 'fake news' completely takes away from the severity of lying to the public. people in power have always done it and will continue to do it, but the sudden rise of shrugging off lies as just 'fake truth' is frightening.
korea was japan's. usa and ussr defeat the axis. japan belongs to usa, but needs foothold in east asia. they take the the southern half of korea at the 38th parallel.
that would be taking it out of the context to claim that first great leader was "created" by us. he was a soldier (protege of the soviet), while us participated in that set up handpicking the us educated south korean first president. us had drawn the 38th parallel, and that division was trumpeted by the cold war, two separate gov't formed by 1948 & war broke out in 1950. that is a very simplified version of the history of the two koreas which most americans don't remember and now wonder why they are in south korea today and why is north korea mad at them. if you are genuinely curious, there are many many books on this topic by serious historians.
watched an interview with a refugee about this - she said yeah cannabis and tobacco just grows on the road there and you can pick it and smoke it and everyone does (don't worry, be happy)
2: the school is run by an evangelical christian organization, but they are not permitted to mention religion in any way.
in her book, she sees them do all kinds of things, from guarding the juche study hall to trimming the lawn with scissors. make-work, to eliminate free time.
i think she means a in a more basic missionary sense of helping the less fortunate, not a prosthelizing sense
because north korea is china's puppet, and starting a war with china is a very scary prospect. not saying we shouldn't do something about it, just that it's not as simple as just declaring war.
i know people like to call everything orwellian, but this mutual accountability system sounds pretty similar. you have good cause to fear your peers and subordinates.
as i recall, in north korea society is divided into the privileged "core" group, the wavering, and the hostile. and within the core are the super-elites who are members of the kim family and descendants of notable statesmen or military leaders.
the thing about esl teaching (in asia) is this: if you speak the local language to your (child) students, then you run the risk of being fired, because when the children find out you speak their language, they will not speak to you in english but rather the local language. this is basic psycholinguistics - you have to speak a different language to a foreigner because that foreigner cannot speak your language. source: myself. i was previously an english teacher in taiwan with an undergraduate degree in chinese language and literature.
mormons don't go to north korea or china. they only have programmes in countries that freely let them proselytise.
look at how merciful and just the great leader was! at any time he could crush them!
but the dprk is the legitimate government. it's those traitor south koreans who call themselves the republic of "korea" in an attempt to legitimize their rebellion.
not if their power depends on it. an educated population is significantly harder to govern. it's not that uncommon a strategy, they just take it to an absurd extreme.
i'm really getting tired of seeing people try to label north korea when the fact of the matter is that there is no modern analogue for it. not socialism, not communism, and most *certainly* not capitalism. the closest analogy would be to a medieval feudal society, albeit one based around a cult of personality. there's never really been anything quite like it.
not to mention that many security cameras that have infrared night vision, actually give off some small amount of red light from the ir emitters. it would be hard to see if you just came out of a dark building, but if your eyes are accustomed to the dark you have a better chance.
they have an endorsed form of buddhism under the korean buddhist federation though. there are 60 buddhist temples in north korea. chondoism is the official religion of the north korean government as well. i don't think it's entirely accurate to say that all religion is forbidden.
all that matters is that it made it to your spank bank.
i can't tell if this is sarcasm or a ridiculous number of waxworks...
fun! admittedly nk has been on my list for awhile. caribbean cruise? nah, gimme that oppressive regime. it just seems so much more interesting/exciting.
you know that scene in family guy where they're in the living room and everyone is puking all over each other and slipping in it n stuff? that's what it felt like.
in japanese it's usually uwa and in chinese it's wa. no, these are not made up words. it's essentially their version of 'wow'
i see her explanation more like they lie day to day as a weird sub-level form of communication. it was a lie with no motive, as she said, "not of a 19 year old boy, but a child". you know how habitual liars will lie when they don't need to? seems it was like that, but it was more a part of their culture. like they enjoyed manipulating each other's perception or reality, either to keep others smart and to spot the smart ones out, or maybe its just dumb culture stuff. i bet it has a social purpose though (this is my interpretation, because of how she describes the lying)
their natural resources will certainly be liberated, that's for sure
the kuwaitis are. and the answer to that question would likely depend on if the iraqi is shiite, sunni, or kurdish. the kurds are pretty fucking happy saddam is gone. the shia iraqis don't particularly miss him either.
can you imagine being shot for watching dawn of justice.
the big difference in our current age is the ease of which a single dedicated person can set up a website that looks legitimate and has sensationalist headlines to generate views and clicks. this is what i think separates what you're talking about from the contemporary "fake news". of course some of it will be used by larger entities to create propaganda, but not all of it is just about pushing a message.
my duty is to report the news in a timely manner releasing as much information as i am allowed to without putting any personal bias on what happened. so compare that to mainstream media.
might be too late but were there maybe similarities between what was done with korea and what was done with germany? did we basically split influence with the soviets to avoid immediately starting another war on the heels of wwii this time with a frenemy we were struggling to work with to sort out europe?
oh, so it is not studying or educational content, it's just diversion. thanks, mate.
yeah, that's exactly a 100% proper example of something being orwellian. the members of the party were under much stricter surveillance than the proles as well, so it's similar in a few ways.
they bar me! you wanna know why? for being too good a player!!
you have been made supreme moderator of r/pyongyang.
it's happening in the u.s. right now. anti-education/science/logic/intelligence agendas are currently being undertaken under the guise of anti-elitism. ideological arguments are winning out of sheer belligerence - educated, intelligent people will wind up bending to idiotic ideological demands from sheer exhaustion of hearing "no!" at every attempt from more intellectually limber propositions. garbage can theory. it's a race to the bottom where no one wins. that old saying about wrestling in the mud with pigs? yeah, that's pretty much our current poetical situation in a nutshell. defend education funding. education safeguards democracy like a vaccine against fascism.
agreed, nk is not a dictatorship either. the premise behind a dictatorship is that the dictator came to power through his own actions. the last 2 leaders of nk have inherited their power. noel korea is a " serfdom society ruled by an absolute monarch."
usually those mobile cameras have extremely low resolution (320x240ish) and make clicking noises because they have to move an object in front of the sensor to calibrate every few minutes. you can get cameras with higher resolution for more money but as far as i know the calibration thing is universal.
even the nk elite's tech is from the 80s. china doesn't want to give updated military or surveillance equip to a country hellbent on destroying all the other ones around them, possibly including china
gives literal meaning to when jesus said "pray in secret."
mostly starvation in concentration camps, as far as i can recall. couple dozen folks have managed to get access the china border. they occasionally talk about being so hungry they took a pickaxe to frozen human waste looking for undigested food.
they wouldn't let him masturbate to it. out of respect.
even if it is sarcasm, it *is* nk, so i wouldn't be surprised.
the caribbean cruise i went on had it's own slave labor.
not really nervous, no. as u/swboards said, i'm not a retard. and i'm not american or korean or a journalist, so basically nothing has happened to a person in my demographic since the korean war. and the waterpark is full of chinese tourists and the nk elite. it was alright. everything is weird there: the buildings you go to are mediocre, or 'just renovated', but still somehow seem like they're 35 years old. the decor and design of the waterpark seemed like it was from the early eighties, but it was built or renovated in (i think) 2013.
i went on the wikitravel north korea page and there's ~10 or so links to travel agencies that go to nk. i went through every one and compared itineraries and cost and decided one one, then emailed them. (i was very close to going on the st patrick's day tour, but i decided to go with the kis 105th birthday, and pyongyang marathon tour) they give you a bunch of paperwork to fill out and the deadlines. i booked a flight to china, and that was it. it turns out i went with the same company, with the same tour guide that the guy who recently got put in a nk prison went with. i was in the same hotel where he got arrested.
japanese people go "ohhhhhh" too. "uwaaa" is a girly thing to say.
as an ex cult member the lies are easy once you're used to them. you repeat lies because those around you expect you to. if you deviate then you get ostracized or in some cases like nk, killed. lies become reality. waking up from that, for my wife and i, was an insane process. the freedom you experience afterwards is like nothing else. after awhile you don't even realise they're lies or even if there are questionable things you are saying. you keep saying them because if you don't you lose your family, friends, way of life, social network, job, lifestyle, business contacts etc. it's like formatting a hard drive and starting over. you're still the hard drive but nothing previously recorded to it is relevant any longer. it's a crazy experience. i wish i had the aptitude to write about cult experiences, i just don't. i'll tell you though, it's a mind fuck and if you're in a cult you don't know you are until you're out. which is why telling someone they are in one doesn't work.
i think theres only a small amount of coal there and awful infrastructure so it would cost a shit ton to even get north korea past the third-world level
north korea has active concentration camps every bit as evil as ww2 and they have been active since the late 50s. it is a horror. it is not a movie.
yes, same for north and south vietnam. the us and the ussr don't want either of them to control and influence the whole of the new nation.
perhaps it's changed, but when i was there 2 years ago for about 10 days with koryo tours, i, as an american, didn't feel "extra" monitored or vetted whatsoever. they did pull the guy who had family in south korea aside for extra questioning, though. he didn't list it on his initial paperwork and they somehow found out.
pretty sure anyone who knows the slightest bit of history can tell i'm being sarcastic.
i got that impression thry was only true of the outter party. as a member of the inner party o'brien was able to participate in the same activities that got the main character (i can't recall his name) in trouble without any repurcussions, like how a police officer can buy drugs during a sting without being guilty of possession.
somehow i upvoted this comment before i even saw it
its there plain as day.... they dont hide what it is. its written out by both kim il sung and kim jong il. they both have "written" lots of books on both the juche ideology and songun and they both have "isms" after their names to denote their own god like brand of it. kimilsungism and kimjongilism, you can buy the books of that at the "book store" they take you to when you go. they have it in almost any language. its a huge joke.
if they can get late model mercedes s500's into north korea they can get some nightvision cameras.
i reas a book about someone who escaped their camps and escaped to china and he said (apart from the starvation) that women were raped, some guards threatened to kill the baby in their womb, that there wasn't much sleep but hard labor instead and that everyone had to spy on everyone to get a few grains of rice...and the person who escaped was hung over fire and burned forhours, i don't remember for what exactly. also, if you escape, they kill all your relatives and their children or put them into cocentration camps too.
the umbrella has beachball colours though so it's possible
please don't go to north korea and give them your tourist dollars.
reminds me of east berlin when i visited as an exchange student to west germany back in 1985.
that's the thing with ideology, it can take many forms, some of which are insane.
i think that it can also be even more widespread, and so mundane we don't even notice it. for example, as someone who seems to be on the autism spectrum, i still struggle with saying "fine" when someone asks me how i am. yet most people don't give it a second thought.
if we learned something from history, we wouldn't have to keep repeating it
fuck, a version of call of duty came with a pair of nvgs. they were primitive, but you could actually see in the dark for about 10 meters in them.
you're a former tibetan buddhist? care to do an ama?
yeah, not a very friendly place to its own people.
i read somewhere that the disparity between nk and sk is six times greater than wg and eg ever were. (i don't have a source on that because i'm lazy and don't want to be wrong).
i meant in regard to the buildings and decor, not the living conditions. sorry, should have clarified.
nk actually bought their subway cars used from east germany in the 80s. they still have german graffiti on the windows.
killer cable snap. absolutely sure it was a thing until we started testing. shocked at the result but i stand behind it 100%
well, there are a lot of "mythbusters after dark" myths that we'll never go near but are fun to think about. don't ask me for which ones. use your imagination and rule 34.
my whole life i've always worn all black, actually.
well, going to the moon of course. and putting to bed once and for all that we'd already been there. we'd build our own rocket and keep a live video feed the entire time.
more shop. more theater. more band. more makersheds. more hackerlabs. more programming. less standardized testing.
having my childhood crush marilu henner wait on line with her awesome science-obsessed son to get my autograph.
one should learn that sewing, carpentry and welding are all actually the same skill: joining planar forms under unique sets of rules. that was a sea-change for me.
i very much hope to play with the battlebots folks. there are a lot of old friends of mine in that community. i'm psyched it's back on!!
that is a great question. i think death would be the result but i doubt they'd let us drag crash test dummies through their fountain. but i know the guys that designed and built it... hmm.
i hope so. they're both awesome. dean kamen is one of my heroes.
it's true. that guy drives me nuts. (but i drive him nuts too!)
i'm very happy with the reboot. i love the show we're making now more than ever. btw we have new episodes starting to air on july 18 at 9pm.
that guy is always hanging around on set. we figured let's put him in! kidding, they reached out to us. of course we were into it. they were fantastic to work with. funny side note: after the press went out about the episode, the administration got shit for "wasting time" with a tv show. our entire time with obama, for filming all his parts of the ep, was 13 minutes, start to finish. including taking pictures with jamie and i and our crew.
yes, he'll tear your arms right off your body. be careful.
making that water pump from the scuba diver getting sucked into a firefighting helicopter... i didn't know at the time that i could do that...
you gave him the millennium puzzle from *yu-gi-oh*?
all the miyazaki films. seriously. everyone should watch them. spirited away is on my top 10
we are not doing science on this show. science requires rigorous re-checking of results and many iterations to make sure ones results are free from bias. but we do demonstrate a scientific way of thinking: that is basing our results on the evidence before us. we also demonstrate that science is a deeply creative field, that is messy and full of wrong turns. making this show has turned me into a scientist: it's fundamentally altered my way of thinking. so i defend the show as scientific. i like to say that we don't necessarily stand behind our results (because of the confines of concision and making a tv show etc) but we stand 100% behind our methodologies. if we turn out to have screwed up a methodology we will go back and re-test it. that is the most scientific thing we do: change our minds based on better evidence.
3d printing. because it's currently in a more mature phase. but don't go by my say-so. and thanks for your opening comment. we never intended to be inspirational or educational actually. the fact that we were is incredible. best of luck out there once you have your degree! congrats!
carrot cake!!! with that amazing cream cheese frosting. also: happy birthday!!
i would often offer to build stuff for the cost of materials as long as i could keep the prop or thing that i made when it was done being used. this is a great deal for student films and theater and i gathered many shop supplies this way.
the golden gate bridge. costs a fortune to film there. sadly.
i have many parts that i love. my party will be epic this year.
leatherman charge. and my lone wolf d2 by bill harsey
number 1 and 2 are collectively my favorite questions in a long time. the answer is 1. i can't say and 2. yes.
we're on hulu now. and i don't know the answer to your question: those decisions are made by others.
yes. it's hard to find time but we have plans for many other unauthorized commentaries.
get good at animating. great animators are hard to find.
not yet. but i love that idea. that a frisbee is a size-independant device.
i'm sad that the us is still not on the metric system. but seveneves!! isn't it great!? i loved it and devoured it in one weekend. we're going to do a podcast on it as soon as norm reads it.
i have three costumes this year. no hints just yet. but soon. very excited. some new and exciting changes to adamincognito this year!
this is a common physics thought experiment actually. basically without air resistance you would yoyo up and down through the hole. with air resistance you would still yoyo but each trip back and forth your yoyo will get shorter until you eventually settle in the middle.
we get tons of awesome love for the tested.com vids. i love doing them. norm and will and joey are the awesome. we have many amazing plans for the future.
that's awesome! have you worked on any of guillermo del toro's projects?
100 duck-sized jamies. i'd kick the **** of out those suckers.
that's a good question. i'm not sure! i'll have to think about that one.
happy birthday! i love performing for audiences. it's very different than doing a tv show and it's an awesome education. we'll be touring the country later this year, check out mythbusterstour.com
i keep very detailed notes on my builds as i do them. evernote is my primary tool for that because of it's versatility. (i have a business relationship with them but i used their product before they reached out). note are key to remembering where i was. i'm older now and forget things more frequently.
probably that episode when he wrapped so much duck tape around 2 concrete pillars that when they drove a car into the wall of duct tape they actually broke the pillars, but the duct tape didn't rip.
yes. lots. we also love the odbs and have many plans.
no! getting recognized is part of the territory, and i remember all the famous people i've been lucky enough to interact with (i could barely speak when i spend 2 min meeting peter gabriel!). i want people to have a good memory of meeting me, it's the least i can do for fans. i don't take pictures in public when i'm with my kids. people have been very kind about that restriction. i'm ubiquitous enough in my neighborhood that people are pretty chill there.
i haven't looked at that list in a long time. i will now. thanks for the reminder. still haven't gotten to cheney...
i was 10 when star wars came out. as soon as i figured out that it was a career you could choose i wanted in. yes. spinning things are bad.
long list: richard taylor. peter jackson. rick baker. michael lantieri. neill blomkamp. greg broadmore. mike elizalde. man at arms. terry english. don petit. i want to play with everyone.
no i don't. there will always be a place for practical effects.
broke my finger moving safety equipment in october of 2013. my alien spacesuit: 10 years. i'd love to make that suit!! can't wait to see how it turns out in the movie.
that was a loaner and it's now been donated to a school down south i believe. it was a bridgeport series ii. big mother.
i support them in what they want to try. i encourage hard work over results. i put opportunities in front of them. i don't give them everything they ask for (that would turn them into dicks) but i try to foment whatever fascinations they want to indulge in.
no, that means that orcs are nearby. the running is still good advice.
all the time. someone once asked a classical musician in his 90's why he practiced every day (i think i saw this on reddit!) and his response was that it was because he kept seeing improvement. thats me too.
i do. great source material. great screenwriter. great cast and above all- one of my favorite directors. i have high hopes.
sorry, that honor belongs to moxie crimefighter jillette.
that doc is on my list. he had to retire someday. luckily all of his films are repeatedly watchable.
we totally wanted to do this one. couldn't figure out a way to properly do it full scale.
is this required as proof? i loved that episode. i don't remember his name.
how about the reverse? what were you most positive was bs that turned out to be inarguably true (or at least plausible, if it was based on a specific event that couldn't necessarily be verified)?
i felt terrible watching that. you could tell the crew was totally not okay with it and watching you walk into that was unpleasant.
i can see it now; mythbusters and pornhub.com are proud to present: **mythbusters after dark** i'm sure you guys could even find some jobs for buster heh. /u/katie_pornhub, any thoughts?
hah, i was hemming a pair of jeans the other day and i thought, this is just like welding! 95% prep 5% actually sewing.
what's your favorite bot type? flipper, spinner etc?
i'm sure you could get him to give you the plans to build one of your own, then you can test it and we will all love to watch buster become a bird.
you can feel the moments when one of you is getting on the other's nerves and it really makes those moments special. we get a glimpse at what makes you guys tick and it can be tense and exciting all at the same time. i'm glad you are able to get along professionally though, otherwise the show would not be as popular as it is.
is it kinda refreshing to go back to the "old way" or did you like have kari, grant, and tori more?
people forget that the president - alongside being head of government - is also head of state.
still sad to see them leave the show, but glad you guys are on good friendly terms!
i met you when you filmed the episode in which you rode a bike underwater. i was a lifeguard. you guys were awesome and your production crew couldn't have been nicer guys. not much of a question, but thanks for the good time!
so, i shouldn't be citing myth busters episodes in my term papers?
the best kinds of educational things are the ones that neither party knows are going to be educational.the ones that are so entertaining that you don't even realize that you're learning until it's already happened.
plus, there's the cost of repairing it once you blow it up.
from the live show in east lansing michigan - 'are you aware that jamie is the lorax?'
also with mars soil. not sure how they could test that. but i'm very skeptical of the whole 'growing potatoes in mars soil' feature of the book, even though that's central to the plot.
unfortunately not. hopefully in the near future. just working on a few canadian shows like big brother canada and orphan black. only been in the biz for a year now.
oh... okay. how do you feel about explosions in the bedroom? that's kinda a 50/50 adam/dan savage question.
jamie knew and knows this, which is why when he was asked to do this show, he brought adam on.
i don't remember their age because i didn't really care enough to try, but i'm pretty sure he's alluded to their age on the tested podcast. saying stuff like they'll be driving soon or other vague hints.
autoerotic asphyxiation myths. tested by nutbuster.
material size helps a lot. big plates are a lot easier to manage heat. it's definitely one of those skills where the progression isn't exactly linear. it's more "jesus this sucks" and then after a while, you set something up, and it just clicks and you step up to "that's not so bad".
i just realized how much the types of bots also sound like sex positions.
or it could be good publicly to test it on the actual fountains
it's a credit to their personalities and professionalism that this isn't a draw to the show as it would be on any other reality show.
adam once said in an interview that, while they aren't friends, they do have respect for each other in a professional way. hope that makes you feel a bit better.
and is also a person...who if he wants 13 minutes to do something fun that reaches out to the community, so be it. his job is stressful enough...whether one agrees with the president or not, there is no denying they work hard and have a million things to think about at any given time. people are ready to jump on them for anything and everything. even a 13 minute break.
it was censored by credit card companies because it brought attention to how pathetically insecure rfid is
at the time of this episode (~2008) rfid was a blossoming technology that was being rolled out into all sorts of micro implementations mainly for payment processing and personal identification (passports) and was going up against smart-card technology. today we know how easy it is to break these technologies but at the time there weren't as many resources showing how easy it was. additionally there is a big difference between reading some tech forum somewhere and seeing it on mythbusters. from my understanding the big credit card companies pressured discovery into dropping the episode because they didn't want people to be fearful of the new technology and they could since they essentially control the flow of spending cash in america.
it is a fifth element inspired puzzle box. each face represents one of the elements!
totes. but vince puts everyone at ease. so does aaron. they're both crazy nice in person. i have no idea how vince can think of such dark shit and be such a sweet person.
i just finished my second watch though today, its just as good as i remember.
*bird noises* wot if yer legs didn't know they were legs *more bird noises*
wikipedia actually allows mythbusters tv episodes as a reliable source.
except bill nye. perfect execution from the theme song and in, it's all, "fuck yeah, science and shit. check out this dope beat, bill, bill, bill, bill..." then, "whoa, i just learned something about gravity."
he mixed in some earth soil and poop though, i thought he clarified that those were the only reasons it was viable. but yes, it'd be cool to see someone try to grow using a mixture of martian soil + poop and stuff
i suspect the cable destroys the legs and then they have to be amputated, vs the cable doing the dismembering completely.
he has alluded to it. i know he mentioned teaching them how to drive recently. and, if i'm not mistaken, he accidentally says one of their names on an early episode of still untitled.
autofellatio myth: does removing a rib really help?
i work in aviation and our welding shop can do some amazing repairs welding aluminum, they say it gets easy with practice. they also say that magnesium is always a pain to weld.
i'm pretty sure there are people out there who would watch you learn to tig weld.
flipper, spinner, thwack, wedge, lifter, pusher, reverse cowgirl. yep, definitely.
yeah adam and jamie's relationship is an excellent example of a professional relationship. they don't like each other personally but they put their differences aside for the sake of their work.
for sure. easily one of the hardest and most stressful jobs. have you seen photos of how quickly presidents get grey hair? (i know they're already old and all but it goes gray multiple times faster than normal hair)
how did they censor it? it's not slander/libel if it's true, so it's not like they can legally stop them from talking about their product. did they or their parent companies threaten to pull funding from discovery or something?
you get $10000000, but you have to put your fingers in jamie hynemans mouth every time you pay for something.
this. gavin is a highly intelligent man, his issue is the connection between his brain and his mouth.
if only term papers allowed wikipedia as a reliable source
maybe adam is testing little girls tolerance to scientist's cake.
dude you fucking spooked me, make a spook warning next time
when i was in class, we had a guy who did aluminum as his full time job. he did it backwards (dragging the puddle) but his work was *beautiful*
i was gonna say it. i think just getting to see adam work is like 90% of why i check tested's youtube page.
cowgirl is by far the deadliest, opponents usually last less than 20 seconds
yeah i remember seeing a compilation of images throughout different presidents' time in office, and how quickly they age. it is scary.
of course. discovery is tied by the balls by advertising revenue. one look at their other programming tells you they care way more about revenue than publishing anything close to educational.
a lot of men have this problem to be fair. it's just that many have that brain part not worky too well either.
well mythbusters actually did some original research, albeit not very thoroughly or scientifically. wikipedia is just a collection of other people's original research. it's not hard to use wiki as a source of sources though.
you didn't make the "cut" because a snapped cable can't kill.
look at tory's face *before* adam touches the things. worried face all the time and smiles only once which looks(/is) horribly forced. who 'forced' this idea?
i remember the days before these silly reality shows where stuff that seemed educational was shown.
yeah. its more happy go lucky meth dealing witha few snags here and there.
so, in that case, why doesn't he just build everything.
he said shaking babies, not shooting men in the face.
because his lawyers wouldn't let him blow up the dyson sphere.
since our videos are advertiser friendly, it hasn't hit us too hard directly.. but it was part of what prompted us to build floatplane club so that we and other creators would have ways to make money in the event that our adsense revenue got ripped away.. so it's definitely costing us money, but only because we're re-investing what we're making.
well i'm getting some now, so that should give you some idea :p
firetruck unboxing video. i wouldn't even hate it so much if it didn't have more views than all of the good stuff i've ever done. if it didn't make so much money in adsense from 5 year olds just watching "the next suggested video about firetrucks" i'd pull it down. it's an embarrassment.
i personally really like kickfarted but not every kickstarter product we order is spectacularly bad enough to feature in the series, but we will probably revisit it.
7 gamers 1 cpu was one of the most exciting projects i've done. i'll always remember the moment it worked as one of the highlights of my career. that's really where i get off - spending a ton of time on something, not being sure that it's going to work, and then seeing the end result be awesome. scrapyard wars season 1 will also hold a special place in my heart forever. that was where we began experimenting with the idea of being a "tech top gear" rather than just a review channel and that path we took continues to shape our content (even our reviews which contain more personalities and funny stuff and more little sketches than ever) to this day.
this. i found it really jarring in the final episode of the last season where you had the team talking about finishing their benchmarks and then instantly it changes frames completley and jay is starting to review them. then after about 5mins the winner was decided and it was over. seems a real shame to have this 3hour or so build up, only to have the big reveal over in about 10mins.
yeah dennis and i were both really pleased with it.
probably at some point and so much has changed so there is a lot to show :)
he wants to make this stupid nonsensical movie that is just actually dumb. this was an idea he had 5 years ago and he still wants to do it. super cheese fest with stupid techy nerdy junk.
i think berkel holds the record for most expensive stuff broken... he got out of his chair, which caused the air shock to spring up, knocking over a 34" lg ultrawide back when they were brand new (about $1500us iirc). i was also (somewhat) responsible for taking our sony fs700 out for a shoot in the rain (brandon let me do it, so it's partly on him). it didn't work for a few days and we had to disassemble it to the greatest degree we could to dry it out.. scary times. that was in the early days when we couldn't have afforded to replace it :p
yes. i highly recommended linus brand cable ties. they are available in any colour and style you want as long as you want orange with my face on it.
so when luke, linus, and i would drive from ncix late at night on fridays (we would carpool) the conversations always went: 1) are we friends? 2) linus media group is a stupid company name. this went on for a few months, without fail.
tv. or i guess our own platform, float plane club.
reading positive, supportive comments like this one. i also love spending time reading stories to my kids and playing with them and playing badminton.
being up in western canada makes collaboration a little tougher.. and i'm pretty asocial by nature so i haven't generally gone out of my way to "collab" - especially because many collabs are just blatant subscriber swaps "hey sub to me and sub to him/her and get a chance to win" but i've also known a lot of the people in the tech tuber scene for years and really enjoy spending time with them. so it's nice to have an excuse to hang out and make a video. i'm not like sending them dick pics on snapchat or whatever though.
eventually, and completely. it will be it's own building.
depends how the first one goes. if we lose buckets of money, then no. if we lose a little bit of money, then probably. if we break even or make money, then game on!
i want the wireless logitech mice. do you hear me, logitech? give them to me.
we will be making a video about that very soon :p
my favorite camera currently is my fuji xt-2, imho its the best stills camera i have had the pleasure of using day to day
i prefer 'guided' where you have an arc planned out and you have the meat of what you want to say written but it's not word for word
i suck at it :p but seriously, i have no social life, so it's just work/family, which makes it a bit easier. i get one night a week to go out and play badminton and other than that i go home and spend time wiht the kids. i've also significantly cut back on the time i spend working on the weekends. so it's not too bad at this point.
i want to make a movie trailer. not a movie. just a trailer. but with badass high production values so it would be a ton of fun to shoot. it'd be basically a bunch of sketches back to back without having to deal with the boring parts of making a movie like real dialogue and a story arc and character development. i just can't figure out how to fund it other than stealing $100,000+ from the lmg coffers and putting it in a firepit...
it's not that i'm not spending time making content, it's just that i'm involved in overseeing the process rather than actually doing it.
for most of us at the start, it took a lot of hours, low pay (so linus could afford to keep us going), and corner cutting. actually, it sounds like not much has changed. nevermind. for my hire so far, and the people i hire in the future, i don't really hold chasing fame against them. motivation is motivation.
i am, i've been very busy with other projects and there are a lot of windows only apps that i need so i will likely be splitting my system in half with unraid.
one of them is literally fused in there.. i"d have to cut it off. so... no...
lots of things... if i ever stop making tech videos, you'll see them.
ehhhh kinda but it's easy to regret things with a project like scrapyard wars. its an insane wrap up of rapid fire decision making and prioritisation. by design not everything will go perfectly.
i'm trying to make sure that they don't. =) that's my job.
they are maxine's nails she is the newest shooter on the team
'we're a media company that makes videos for the internet'
that's actually the sentiment every year when looking back.
i want the nvidia shield portable to get updated. it's frickin awesome. as for tech that needs to stop.. fitness trackers need to stop or start being accurate. as it is now they're just jewelry imo.
they were broken down and put in the pile. a lot of the stuff is engineering samples so we can't sell it or give it away, but it's still functional so maybe we'll find a use for it.
everyframeapainting, wisecrack, nerdwriter1, philip defranco i have a huge respect for all those guys.
no. i am seriously considering going to school part time for project management however.
it's growing much faster than expected, i'll still be around tho!
no plans. trying to recreate the magic of an earlier video by making it again is rarely a successful formula.
t'would be lit af, but no plans for that at the moment. i don't want to mess with the purity of nicky v's vision
i get to smell him on a daily basis. sometimes he doesn't notice and sometimes he just pretends not to notice. so far, the same amount. xd things don't get easier, we just try to do more/different things
they can call it "linux with linus (but not that linus)"
there are positives and negatives to both but ultimately where we are now imo is better than its ever been in many ways.
put all my parts under mineral oil then it failed to post. i fixed it.. but damn..
its dope, they do a lot really cool stuff with blocking and composition and i liked that they try to keep the show somewhat grounded in reality.
he doesn't really wanna answer our stupid questions
new shows and ideas are a constant thing that we think about so always looking to do new challenging ideas. keeps life interesting
knowing linus they will be able to go down whatever path they want and he will support them ferociously.. as long as it's productive, has any possibility to succeed.. and isn't being a stripper.
tech for the sake of tech is lame. i kid. gaming is awesome.
the end game is to make videos with people i love working with. and no i want nothing to do with physical inventory. i played that game. it's no fun.
hello friend. it doesn't offer nearly the range of capabilities that we plan to offer. this is the short and simple answer. fpc isn't just early access video. more will be clear on launch. :d
tech is great that way. there's always something new - sometimes great and sometimes terrible - to get excited about or crap on. we're really lucky to have so much inspiration.
actually quite a lot. if someone here feels strongly enough about an idea it will be questioned and examined but generally if they persist they will be allowed to do it.. thing is i'd the audience doesn't get on board fairly strongly you'll just never be able to do it again. which is fair. its actually quite a lot of freedom, ive taken advantage of it a lot and don't take it for granted.
i have a video review on the red 8k helium cameras that we got, should be on its way mid july
infrastructure is doing very well. design and front end dev is not. we are quite a few months from launch because of this.
how's floatplaneclub going? better or worse than you expected at this point?
one of the reasons the community respects and trusts ltt: you are not afraid to call out companies regardless of your relationship with them.
estimated earnings for the firetruck video is 12 grand. i can see why xd
any plans on doing any videos on crowd funded items that were actually good?
evidently making a pile of cash and getting loads of exposure is against their brand values...
"tech top gear" i'm imagining linus and luke being dropped into the bolivian jungle and having to build pc's out of sticks and snake carcasses.
yeah i felt the same way. build up was great, climax was too fast
so no big reaction to how they just won against a watercooled 980ti?
i kinda missed an overview over what ended up being in the machines. felt like i had to write it down myself while watching.
not sure if you frequent reddit, but there has been huge support and want for a "tech talks with linus" sorta thing where it is just down to earth discussion
just 'cause people have asked, i'm not going to schedule it.
you've told me enough. i want to see it. start a gofundme
linus, i've literally just put my tissues away from crying about the loss of berkel. why must you re-ignite such fresh pain. *sobs*
it's too bad there's no way to filter the supportive ones from the "we hate your thumbnails. unsubscribed!" ones.
"i'm not like sending them dick pics on snapchat or whatever though." umm... that's... oddly specific...
this makes me feel as if you two are breaking up :(
as someone from the east coast.. i really hope there's at least a second year.
i'll assume it's to future-proof, and with 8k footage you can digitally zoom in a lot (assuming good sensor quality and low iso, to keep grain and whatnot down) and still maintain 1080p or 4k quality. but to be honest i really don't know. i'm just taking a shot in the dark. but knowing ltt it's likely for a very good reason.
linus free styling on wan show is probably my favorite thing on the channel, when he starts pulling chipset development history out of his ass it's amazing. luke does the same when talking games, and did for vr too, till oculus hurt his soul.
i don't know man. they may be good buy your videos still have a unique charm to them.
is work still pretty social for you? or has the corporate growth caused you to distance from some of your staff from a friendship perspective?
you're producing children? for linus? i am so confused.
that's fair enough i suppose. it not only appears to be an amazing work environment, but you get to be "famous" too! on that note, what are the basic qualifications you look for when you do hiring? who was the least qualified to be on your team before joining?
maybe virtualizating windows through iommu would help you? i'm going for a new setup with ryzen and definitely going that way
it's a valid concern and i'm happy you take that into account.
a common misconception. that series was a ton of fun to make and generated far more views and notoriety than we could have possible hoped for. huge success.
as someone with an m.b.a. and a assortment of certifications for business management, i would recommend getting an pmp rather then a full college experience.
we all know that [current year + 1] will be the year of linux desktop!
that's one of the main reasons for me at least. if not the biggest reason. never sell out.
it's actually around 64 grand. linus gets around 8 bucks per 1000 views.
instead of james yelling *hamond* it's luke yelling *dennis*
rocket league in real life was really exciting at the time. it hadn't really been done and we thought with some more production values channel super fun had the opportunity to go viral. but it didn't really work out that way.
it's possible paul just got a better overclock still. his card was air cooled, but goddamn that was a massive cooler.
duly noted.. it's something we're considering, but we also don't want to force ourselves to create content because it's "popular". there's a fine line between engaging with the community and pandering. just trying to stay on the former side of it.
i more see it as i'm moving away from home but still visiting my dad a lot.
or add in two spaces after each line like that or just two enters note the spacing.
if you have only one of these boxes, and also got it in a competition as a prize, its "one ex xbox one x box won" /r/wordavalanches
linus has a much more open marriage than i imagined
basic qualifications would be some sort of knowledge of how to shoot or edit (depending on the job, obviously), the ability to speak english (mostly), and being able to adapt to situations that may be out of the norm or unexpected. i think the last one is very important because the turn around times we have. if something goes wrong then we have to move things around so that we can still have something go up and when you do daily content, that means lots of different things have to change directions at the same time. looking for structure in something so dynamic is a bit of a pipe dream. so that's something i'm definitely keeping an eye out in the people i'll end up hiring.
virtualization with iommu is amazing, i've set it up recently and it's great how when i want to play a windows-only game i don't have to reboot (thus losing any sort of work flow i might've initiated) and still keep around 95% of my hardware's power
i think that was what made me subscribe, had seen other videos but, something about the lunacy of standing in a bathtub or something plugged in computer hardware just, i dunno, it was compelling lol.
find a paint colour called "expensive red", paint cameras with it, smash. "destroying expensive red cameras!!!"
it was kind of boring, long, and unstructured. very unstructured. it was all over the place. but also boring and long. also, i ran out of time.
yeah but it's true. right now i could setup a linux box for my friends or parents and they'd have no problem using it for a few days, but once they want to start installing software it will all fall apart. for most of the linux software out there you can't just download and run the installer. i'd have to tech them how to use the distro software repository and even then it may not have what they're looking for. the trouble with most linux developers is that they either don't know how or don't like making things dead simple, and that's what you need for mainstream success.
that but also socks and sandals. how can you not trust socks and sandals
"dennis you knob! that was my garage ceiling! *sigh*"
no. reverse it. top gear has to build a pc and ltt has to build a car. no help can be given by either side. hilarity ensues
yeah i know silicone lottery plays a much more important role and noise levels were completely useless for scrapyard wars anyway. its still impressive though that they even managed to get that gpu
how about "tech walks with linus"? you can talk honestly about tech issues while walking places, climbing over cars, wading through bushes etc.
given his propensity for dropping things, i think linus could still use a babysitter sometimes...
til that i don't need to use two enters
"linus was able to build this in a cave! with a box of scraps!"
oh my god. you're right. that's so much better. we *need* to make this happen.
linus bear grylls maybe linus will end up in a future bear grylls series, dangling over a ravine.
i heard he plans on doing daily vlogs. his first video is going to be "why i left linus media group". should be really interesting.
i love that video. shit was raw emotion. i couldnt stop grinning like an idiot.
jeremy clarkson would make hammond's computer play genesis as it's startup sound
and he has to make a raspberry pi drone to get to the other side
sure, but that kinda feels like the death of channelsuperfun though.
we still got ~~jian yang~~ dennis to keep the show rolling. all jokes aside, i do agree. berkel was fantastic on camera and added that extra flair that made a lot of the videos enjoyable.
he'd have to be a pretty bad fbi director to testify on reddit first.
think you're being rather generous on #3, doubt he'd comment on anything ongoing like that
honestly, i would love to ban them. they serve no purpose when looking for an individual.
he said he'd testify on one condition: it must be public.
for a second i thought you meant steve urkel. i'm a bit slow today.
because they're high school kids with no real sense of how the real world works
it it weren't for collusion between the dnc and clinton campaign than yeah.
i'll bet 10.000+ you upvotes that op knows exactly how the (reddit)world works.
as long as it was really trump for maximum insanity, not one of his staff. actually, scratch that, his staff all seem pretty nuts too
if this post takes out the guardians of the front page, i will delete my account, move to nepal and live as a goat
but but all the reddit karma that he could get if he did an exclusive
what do you, who is definitely not a russian spy posing as comey online, think of russia?
it's not a comment so much as common sense. the idea that congress won't call him in is almost impossible.
he rejected an invite to a closed session (private) and is now offering to testify in a public session, afaik.
hi im james comey here to tell u all the secrets what u wanna know
my vote is option 2. if there's a 5th amendment bot, you'll get the same answers though.
two conditions. they also have to ask him wether he'd rather face 100 duck sized horses or one horse sized duck.
he'll be able to talk about conversations he had with trump, will he not? confirm/deny he asked him to pledge his loyalty, confirm/deny that comey ever told trump he wasn't under investigation, etc.
when several of op's questions pertaining to ongoing investigations?
hey that's not fair! some of them are older middle-schoolers too.
maybe we can do a double ama - trump and alex jones??
i kid you not...(no further validation needed) input something that never happened in the history of never happening things
i'm sure he's plenty aware of that fact and is probably preparing for that, but it'd be incredibly unwise to actually *say* as much. as soon as you go on record saying anything outside the official line in a position like his, it can come back to bite you.
i agree with your take on comey. despite some boneheaded moves recently, taken on the whole he seems a non-partisan, ethical and outspoken guy. i really hope he makes substantive testimony to give us a clearer picture of why he was truly fired and his interactions with the president. apparently, in response to one of the newly elected trump's questions - essentially "can i count on your loyalty?" - he was overheard saying "you can count on my honesty." obviously i'm paraphrasing here but, assuming the anonymous person who overheard is telling the truth, i like comey's answer.
hi i'm 14 years old and i drew a picture of my crush and now its all over the internet and she thinks im weird what do i do??
i cant find the necromicron on amazon. could you reccomend a good vendor from which to purchase it?
he can speak of his conversations regarding trump. they can ask if he actually was asked a pledge of loyalty to trump.
i actually have some alternative facts that say differently!!!!
right when he finished drinking the 4th can of paint.
he did an ama and it was f'n terrible. all his answers were basically 6 words long and gave no content.
the more rope they weave the better. bring it on!
yeah, it wouldn't make sense. jfk was a great fbi director
there's many different types of lawyers that specialize in many things
but maybe the top law minds of reddit can trick him into it. i doubt he has much idea how these things go. not compared to us.
i honestly feel like the man believes he has done the right thing at every step. he felt like the circumstances warranted stepping outside of the boundaries... but there is no doubt he did overstep. still, none of that is relevant to the trump administration's actions. trump has said nothing the deputy ag recommended mattered in the slightest.
really? the necronomicon looks available to me, but the kindle version isn't bound in human flesh and inked in human blood, so... well, it might still be okay, depends on what you're using it for.
he literally gets gold on every post he makes. that must be nice. just come back to reddit once a month and you've got yourself infinite gold.
you see, im a real connoisseur of flesh-bound, blood-stained literature. id like an original of an edition in physical form more so than a digital copy. id also like the know if master cthulhu would prefer my obedience or my mortal corpse as a sacrifice? eithers fine with me tbh.
thanks for the reply! well that's a bit irritating. always been quite fond of him.
very sobering. "oh wow my life has changed". i had to sit down and think about what my life would be like going forward. i am responsible, to a large extent, for the success of the nerf dart gun line. yes
high performance dart guns were originally based on my patents. i hold them in high regard. i'm a nuclear engineer, and engineers aren't known for their humor.
i went and gave a talk at a school, years ago, after the super soaker first came out. i told them that i had invented it, and they didn't believe me. i left the school with them never really accepting the idea that i had invented the water gun.
backpack tanks or hose attachments might be the peak
jammin' jet. it was commercialized. it was a water propelled airplane that was pumped just like a super soaker with water shooting out the back, propelling it into flight. the manufacturer changed the design of the plane to fly in a circle, but didn't adjust the wings so as it turned it would roll and dive into the ground. usually causing the plane to break after the first launch. exciting toy, exciting commercial, disappointing in the end.
i got the idea in '82, had a number of false starts, and it wasn't until '89 that i made the presentation to larami. it was on the market a year later in 1990 as the "power drencher". we changed the name in '91 to super soaker and because of the consistent sales success in both years by word of mouth, larami decided to run tv commercials. in 1992 it became the number 1 selling toy in the world.
your friend sounds like a douche lol. always gotta 1-up, huh? supersoaker was pay2win lol
i wouldn't phrase it that way. i would phrase it as hard-ball, hardcore business. one would like to see businesses operate more on principle as opposed to what they can get away with legally.
i have worked with and been funded by the department of defense in the past for my inventions. it's probably better that i not comment on the specifics of those contracts however.
i went to the toy store one day and saw a number of guns being sold under the n-strike name, and my royalty check did not reflect the number of guns i saw in the store. i took out my contract and did a close review. inventing energy converting technology and batteries that will be 2x better than lithium ion.
having high pressure and a relatively large nozzle. however, as you go to higher pressure and the water comes out faster, the stream breaks up in the air and limits how much further the water travels. there's an optimum combination of pressure and nozzle size.
i once used a super soaker to unclog a plugged up water drain at my home.
i wanted to be an engineer long before i knew that "engineer" was the term that described what i wanted to do. i was tinkering as a little kid. always curious about the way things worked. since that time, what i've done has been to be persistent. so perseverance and continuing to hone your skills is the key to being successful in anything you do.
the monster was the largest gun that larami produced. it was very badass in its look. but the seals around the nozzle had manufacturing defects that were not corrected, and it did not deliver on the promise that the appearance presented. it was a dual nozzle version of the cps 2500, and would've been great if it worked as well as the 2500.
i have in the past. we used to routinely get them when we were focused on improving them and redesigning them. but at this point in time i'm not really active in that sector.
i really appreciate the compliments people give about the water gun. it makes me want to do more to improve quality of life. i'm hopeful that my new technologies will help improve more lives. in fact, the heat pump that i was working on when i got the idea for the super soaker was being made to address an environmental problem.
yes and no. i do have a display of super soakers and i have a display of prototypes we built over the years. my collection is not complete, there are some that got away. periodically i'll go on ebay to find ones out of production, and some are stored away to protect them. the room in the background of my proof picture is the prototype "museum" we have at my laboratory.
when i made the super soaker i was trying to make a high performance water gun. the desire to make a high performance water gun occurred when i was shooting a stream of water from a nozzle i hooked to a bathroom sink while working on an air conditioner that would use water as a coolant instead of freon.
i have an invention on the galileo spacecraft which went to jupiter, and my fellow engineers at jpl were skeptical that it would successfully solve the problem we ran into. it went to jupiter in support of a very successful mission. i also invented an engine that converts heat into electricity more efficiently than perhaps any other engine and it has no moving mechanical parts. super soaker remains what i am most known for. i am confident that history will be kind to me.
that never occurred to me that people would do that with a water gun, but my philosophy is that everyone is an inventor. everyone has creative ideas, and hopefully most of them are productive.
i could be wrong. it'll stick around, but i suspect it'll go the way of the hula hoop.
yes. eventually jtec technology will mature and become widely used. the nuclear community is very conservative with respect to implementing new technology and want to rely on the tried and true. but eventually the performance of the jtec will warrant its use in nuclear applications.
one of the keys to success is realizing that there are many things that can go wrong with a given idea, but my strategy has been to develop multiple inventions to put the odds in my favor. also to persevere. it's important to know when to quit, i'm just not very good at it.
i knew it would be successful because i knew it was a fun toy, but i didn't anticipate it to be a number 1 toy in the world. that's not something one can predict.
i had one that would be a great super soaker in a water war. it was a rapid refill model that when you ran out of water you put the nozzle up directly to a water source and it refilled your gun automatically.
i was designing space craft before i was designing super soakers. that being said, when you present a really innovative idea the general reaction is usually skepticism if it is something they are not familiar with or have seen before. people don't usually accept radically new ideas readily.
the super soaker and nerf allowed me to pursue the other projects that i'm working on.
first off, you can't make money unless someone knows about it. secondly, i was willing to put my idea out there and to lose as long as i learned from the experience. i felt that subsequent ideas i had i would be able to use that experience to become successful.
i know this comment is really late to the party, but we'd love to see you over on /r/nerf. you're kind of like a god to us.
i worked in the nuclear field on submarines for a couple of years. *somebody* has to have a sense of humor to decide to put handwheels in the least comfortable or usable spots
honestly, there's something to these jokes about alpha radiation, they really make me go hehehe
i believed you, lonnie! (i went to school with aneka.)
that's interesting. i had a toy as a kid that was a similar concept but it was just a plastic rocket. you pumped it up for a while and then it shot off propelled by the water pressure. did you have any hand in that?
the name power drencher is funny. it sounds like the cheap dollar store knock off super soaker.
for real, i know it's been a while since the ama, but you really made summers a blast. your story is really inspiring, too. i've always thought they should make a movie about you.
working with dod on top secret super soaker project. not a question he can answer in an open setting. story checks out
are they 2x energy dense as li-ion? capable of high discharge? there are huge implications if that's the case. as much as i love the super soaker, which i do, battery technology is where it's at and will be your legacy that actually matters in the history books!
are compact flow laminisers just too expensive to mass-produce to prevent stream breakup? or is it not turbulent flow that causes the issue?
thanks, now i have an excuse to buy one as an adult and the wife can't complain as thats what the inventor uses them for:-)
i guess that way she doesn't have to hit the shower before she heads back out. super doucher 50.
i just got the wind knocked out of me when i saw you replied. thank you so much for taking the time to answer these questions with real responses.
i would love to see a video series of your guidance and experiences on filling out a patent on your own. any suggested books?
thank you for the response and taking the time to do an ama. super soakers were a fantastic part of my childhood; a favorite, actually.
the super soaker sector is still wet with money, i hear
you already made the world a better place. it's awesome you're still going. you freaking rock dude i think you're my new hero.
wow, is anyone else amazed that the creator of super soaker goes on ebay to find models he didnt get???
a swamp cooler? i always thought the biggest issue was you were pushing cold air in, but never pulling cold air out and the temperature of the cold air going in was never cold enough to make a difference. never any circulation. i grew up without true ac and swamp coolers is all we had.
you're my hero. genius. impervious to outside criticism and jealousy and simply make awesome shit. thanks for doing what you do, it's greatly appreciated:)
napalm can be pretty productive.... rather the threat of napalm can make others productive for you! ;)
what is this solid state battery? and when will it be ready for release? may i buy some stock in the company releasing said battery?
somebody above mentioned there should be a movie about you - and now it's obvious - there needs to be a remake of the hudsucker proxy but instead of tim robbins and hula hoops, it's you and super soakers.
wait, i'm confused; if you received the patent, what did you miss? couldn't you have sued whoever marketed it, since you had ip protection in place?
hopefully quite well, nerf and supersoaker were most of my summers as a kid.
i saw you said you did your first patent on your own. do you have any videos or documents highlighting your experience? thank you for your reply.
it's so you can fuck up your knuckles on angle irons and bulkheads, duh
same here, you would pump it up and then pull back on the little handle and it would shoot up. i know this toy. red translucent top and white bottom/fins.
but they made the punisher game which was one of my favorite nes games.
born in 88 and just had my mind blown. thought these were around for years.
dude's rich and a nuclear engineer. . . they're totally using him for super soaker action. . . /s
good luck; if you want one powerful enough to do that you'll have to find it used. all the new "current-gen" super soakers are pretty small.
stop trying to mail half eaten sandwiches to your future self.
can't help but think of a dedicated scientist working for years to create some piece of advanced equipment only to have some buffoon come along and use it as a cheese grader
a guy named thundercool, receiving advice from a guy who embodies thundercool. that's thundercool, man.
i think everyone can identify with looking at unattainable models online.
swamp coolers are used in arid environments where the humidity is low. the evaporation of the water within the swamp cooler takes its heat of evaporation from air resulting in the air becoming cooler as the water evaporates into the air. in a swamp cooler you need a constant supply of water. in the heat pump i was working on, the water would circulate in a closed system similar to the way freon circulates in a typical ac or refrigerator. in that system the water evaporates because i create a low pressure point within the system and the heat of evaporation is extracted from the surroundings through a heat exchanger.
being on the other side of that for most of my childhood, i actually shuddered when i saw the picture....
i can answer that one. the 2500 is a direct upgrade of the 2000. the 2500 has three different spray nozzles of different diameters. the smallest is similar to the 2000; the largest is genuinely like using a hose. it only lasts for a second before you've dumped the entire pressure chamber, but it will utterly and completely drench your target. small nozzle for protracted running fights, large nozzle for ambushes.
nasa is presently reviewing our proposal for use of the jtec to replace tecs (thermoelectric converters) for powering outer planetary space craft. the tecs that nasa presently use are in the 6-8% conversion efficiency range. the jtec will provide conversion efficiency in the range of 30-40% and thereby significantly reduce the nuclear heat source sized requirements to provide the same amount of power.
the solid state battery uses a solid electrolyte instead of liquid. so it's an all ceramic and metal battery with twice the storage capacity. we are in the process of transitioning the battery out of the laboratory. we have working cells at this point. there are improvements i'd still like to make. we have not yet set up an investment vehicle structure. stay tuned.
the snoop amas are a tough competitor, but i agree that this is a great ama.
let's be honest, hula hoops made a comeback when cute girls were added.
i think he used it as a measuring device, but cds had a different application with substantially similar tech. i think he's saying that he didn't see how it could be used like that when he filed.
i thought you said "i had a kid thanks to your invention" and figured you were using it for some ghetto artificial insemination
maybe if you posted under a different username ;()
i also love this thomas edison quote: "i attribute my success to 1% inspiration, 99% perspiration." also when they asked him how he felt having failed to invent the light bulb after trying thousands of materials: "i have not failed. i have successfully identified thousands of ways to make a light bulb that doesn't work."
**c**onstant **p**ressure **s**ystem probably an unintentional coincidence that works in the end... i hit my friends hated when i brought out the big gun (was the only one i owned) i bruised them more than i would like to admit :d
i just want to say thank you for letting me rapid strike my wife with foam darts from across the room. she'd probably curse your name, but for me it's just fantastic.
but we're not talking about water propulsion anymore
if i hadn't looked up the name, i'd have assumed it stood for **l**onnie **j**ohnso**n**
bingo, me too! my cousin and i launched it in the air a few times and then realized launching it horizontally at each other was way more fun.
i played major league baseball a lot as a kid. they also made royal rumble.
tall person here. i've found that sitting down to pee minimizes urinal backsplash. went to my friends cabin in high school and his mom had put a sign up in the bathroom saying "boys if you can't pee without splashing everywhere then pee sitting down". changed my life.
i wish i still had my cps 2000. loved that thing, but getting shot in the eye point blank with it was not a pleasant experience.
well you want the surface of your cheese to be nice and even.
when you add 'thunder' to anything it makes it cool
i helped a guy working on his phd who was doing work to show that evaporative cooling is efficient depending upon the humidity and the temperature. basically he calculated that in tropical climates, it was efficient and was at the stage of building the measuring gear to prove it.
the kid who had that ruled the yard. none of us could hang with it and yes it stung
isn't the 2000 regarded as more powerful, despite the shorter duration of super soaking?
i am very excited about your battery project! batteries will help save the world, i'm sure of it. do you have any predictions on cost per kwh?
exactly. he's not saying the cd industry did anything wrong, just that he wishes he had thought of that use.
that's not how patents work. if he legitimately had that specific of a patent, he would have been able to force the industry to pay dearly for it
what do you think he needs the super soaker for? gotta clean that dirty d
dude, that's nothing special. we all rapid strike your wife.
i'm not a patent attorney or law student but i took the lsat and agree 100% with this comment because i'm really good at googling and took 2 seconds to verify this information. if you think you have a real winner of an idea, call your state's bar association or pm me for how to google. my rates are fair like my skin. edited because i wanted to.
i have a patent that my employer sponsored. i wasn't allowed to even look at other patents because such corruption could render my patent indefensible. so that's the first thing i think that makes it hard for diy. second, i know very clearly what i invented. i demo'd it nearly 100 times. however, the patent itself is unintelligible to me. i was invited to review it for accuracy and was literally unable to do so. so the idea that someone could, themselves, write a defensible patent with no help seems highly unlikely. in op's case it makes sense because it is clear he is good with details and guidelines. and when i say "good with" i am really underselling the level of genius and capability he has.
isn't this just undergrad thermodynamics? or was he accounting for various higher-order effects?
it's even more entertaining when you fill it with hot (not scalding of course) or cold water. the surprised wtf looks your friends get when they first get hit is priceless. then when they are no longer surprised, fill it with pee and you'll never have friends again! it's the perfect toy for introverts who were forced to go outside and "it's a beautiful summer's day".
after looking it up, it seems i was mistaken about the 2000 - its only nozzle size is the 'hose' size, which means it's terrible for long fights. yes, the 2000 is slightly more powerful and has a slightly larger pressure chamber than the 2500, but in my opinion the versatility of the 2500 more than makes up for that.
theoretically. whenever an independent party tries to sue a company for a patent, all the lawyers shout 'patent troll!' and are immediately in favor of the company, and it's an uphill battle. the worst part is that this is justified. patent trolls are people who own patents, and have no intent on selling or licensing them to producers, and simply constantly sue companies that use those technologies, since it's more profitable to sue than to license. these cases make up most patent cases with an independent party and a company. i think. i'm no expert on this so i probably messed something up.
yeah, new ked limit toy legislations will also get in the way as it is a heavier and denser dart.
from across the room? that's some impressive range and accuracy. *forfeits wife*
you know what everyone who has ever had cancer drank right? water.
i was helping build the testing gear he specified. i knew the broad outline of what he was now trying to experimentally verify, but not all the calculations and reasoning behind it.
maybe it has to do with humidity? sorry, i don't know the maths or full details behind it, only that i thought it was interesting when he explained it to me. to cut and weld pipe, sling a hacksaw and a drill, i left most of my uni level maths well behind me now.
you just reminded me of a memory that i haven't thought of in years. at camp when i was a kid we had a huge water balloon fight. water guns, balloons, water slingshots, you name it. anyways, this kid, jacob, he filled a bucket with water and then he peed in it. and he just went up to some girls and dumped it on them. and then he told them it had pee in it, and then he got kicked out of camp. each move makes less sense.
yeah it has everything to do with humidity. maybe it's just me but i'm used to associating tropical climates with high humidity but maybe that's just because i'm from florida.
lord almighty, this is such a fantastic story. thank you for sharing.
all i remember is that my dad got the bigger one to even out the match against me and my sister. but we always knew the real reason he got the nice one...
that the universe is *not* slowing down in its expansion, it's accelerating. and, do you know why? nobody knows why!
i would emphasize climate change distinctly. the sponsors on that ride were quite nervous about it 20 years ago.
as intriguing as that sounds, i would prefer to be part of the *next* scientific discovery, which i hope involves low-energy desalinization of water, better batteries, or the true nature of dark energy and dark matter.
i'd do reading rainbow anytime! levar burton is an acquaintance of mine. and i'm always looking for a new tv show.
my movie! my movie. it's about a historical figure who changed the world by teaching himself mathematics. i'm very excited to share his story with the world, and the deal is pending so i can't talk too much more about it. but *that's* what i want to do next, and that will be edutainment.
if you are a tinkerer, consider mechanical engineering. if you experience the joy of discovery, look into something called engineering physics. with that said, i love it all! as a freshmen, i'm sure you don't have to decide yet. take some courses and see what you think.
we would have a carbon fee. we would charge everybody who produces carbon dioxide a fee, and that fee would go into a central fund, and be redistributed. this is how it's done, in of all places, alaska. the model for this exists in a very conservative state. so it is very reasonable that we could expand this model to the country and then the world. the average citizen of the us would receive, would get back, about $3,500. oil companies have already *built this fee in*- they are planning for it, they know it's coming sooner or later, it's in all their financial plans. if we could see this moment, we could change the world. the big idea i want everybody in the us to keep in mind, especially our politicians who got elected yesterday, is that the world isn't gonna be able to do anything about climate change until the united states *leads* us. if the united states were leading the world in addressing climate change, it would be addressed in a heartbeat. **let's get going.**
follow your passion. and when you're in that lab, keep in mind that it's all done with molecules.
i would prefer that he had stuck to his original plan, which was to retire. although he doesn't mean to, he's leaving the world worse than he found it.
first of all, we are clearly not doing enough. i want you to invent the better electricity storage device, the better battery, and i want you to invent a more efficient way to desalinate water. if you can do either or both of those things, you could utterly change the world.
michael faraday. he not only made discoveries, he shared them with the world. and like me, he spoke english. which helps me appreciate him.
i'll cross that bridge when i come to it. why would neil step down? neil's a dear friend of mine, so we'd have to take a meeting.
some extraordinary good-looking, charming young man. hollywood must be lousy with 'em!
the different species of bears are a product of evolution. each is uniquely suited to his or her environment. did i mention my book, undeniable? *hahaha*! i crack myself up! although, as a cornellian, i have to remind all of us: go big red bears!
yes! * seek the best source of light available to you. * hold it slightly above your eyeline so your eyelids don't look closed. * if you own an iphone, the volume buttons take the picture: you can do it with one hand.
we don't know! that's why we're going out there. when you explore, 2 things will happen. you will make discoveries, and you will have an adventure. come next july, please tune in to planetary.org.
no plans to bring back the science guy as such. i'm always locking for another television opportunity to do a new and somewhat different show. near as i can tell, kids in school today still grow up watching the bill nye the science guy show. which is very gratifying.
as you may know, i would like pluto to be - instead of the last among the traditional planets - the *first* among a new class of objects we would call "the plutoids." that people get so bent out of shape about this is fascinating. and i would not bother weeding out books in the library. instead, educate library users that when the book is old, the information in it is old. it's not a good or bad thing, it's just the way of the universe.
thank you for your kind words. staying calm is my business. and it seems to me i'm working in it right now. coincidence?
nuclear power has the lowest death toll, probably because there are only 432 commercial nuclear power plants. we have almost killed a heckuva lot of people 3 times. i am open-minded. but no one would get in a car that had a 3 in 400 chance of killing you.
the process of science is a vital idea for all of us. if i understand your question, the philosophy of science is inherent in the process. this is to say, you think critically, you draw a conclusion based on evidence, but we all *pursue* discovery based on our observations. that's where science *starts.*
well, first of all, that's wrong. evolution is the fundamental idea in all of life science. so i've taken it on as an important issue for the future of the us, and for all of humankind. i'm not kidding...
haha. i've thought about it. i've also thought about jumping head-first into a pile of ice cubes from the golden gate bridge.
you know, you can't have a favorite bow tie! you find the right bow tie for the right occasion for the right company (the people you're with). that is the art of clothing. we are very fortunate to be living in a time when so many of us can afford a wardrobe.
although there may be a few, i don't know of any books as specific as the ones you seek. i recommend you get a home planetarium. and just turn that on. and see if it turns him on to science.
i'm recognized continually. everywhere i go in the english-speaking world. it's cool. i prefer "excuse me, doctor nye" to "hey bill."
climate change is the most important issue facing humankind today. a clear but troubling feature of nature is that the earth will be here no matter what you or i do. we want to preserve the earth's ecosystems for *us,* for us humans.
if it's not bitcoin, it'll be something. the future of commerce is going to be all electronic. the gold standard was a fine idea, but electronic changes of funds and credits will be the future. speaking for myself, i want bitcoin in my analog watch, somehow, someday soon. but i want an *analog* watch. not everybody wants that. it's not for everybody!
eddington on the second law of thermodynamics. sit by for this little additional moment of brilliance -- page 20 of my new book. he said "the second law of thermodynamics hold the supreme position among the laws of nature."
watching bees, watching bumble bees, still amazes me. they're pretty small wings, considering how big they are, and yet they fly fine. but maybe you and i could too, if we had anything that could do 350 times a *second.*

when one is on camera, mistakes are made. i hope we can all move on.
speaking of 20 years ago... 20 years ago my mom saw you in a bar. she's a first grade teacher so she was super excited to see you. you were still dressed in your science guy costume (or do you wear that casually all the time?) and you were super nice to her. she still tells her students this story. i just wanted to say you're awesome and because of that little meeting i often was gifted with bill nye movies for chanukah :)
i've recently taken up interest in more distributed and energy efficient means of water desalinization. would be cool to work on solar powered device that is portable to achieve this.
bill nye/alton brown/levar burton mashup. call it good science eats rainbow.
so now you're bill nye the movie guy? excited to hear more news!
fortunately i do have a while to decide, thanks for the advice!
this is the most badass response to that question i have ever experienced.
hate to break it to you but neil degrasse tyson undeniably won that battle.
"you may have breathed the same air that dinosaurs breathed millions of years ago, and if you don't think that's the tightest shit ever then get out of my face" -bill nye
i agree. sulfur taxing worked wonderfully to regulate manufacturing. carbon taxing will do the same.
this really makes me feel crappy as he comes from my state of oklahoma... though i am happy to say he didn't get my vote!
bill nye has spoken. do not denye him and fulfill his request herp_that_derp.
freeze sperm an eggs, create ai educators/caretakers/builders, send them in a big space shit far away. locate habital planet, land build infrastructure and finally grow yourself some humans, train them and build your new world. simple right?
i'm probably having too much fun imagining what you would look like in a speedo with goggles and a snorkeling gear.
let's think big picture here... neil degrasse tyson and bill nye co-host cosmos

you really gotta take it to the next level and keep up with modern times. just start your own youtube channel! you'll get so many subscribers so fast. kids are more likely to watch youtube over tv nowadays anyways. and then you can cash in on that self-publishing dosh $$
as a child of the '70s, losing both pluto *and* brontosaurus was difficult for me to take.
so bill nye also slacks off at his it job by browsing reddit!
thanks. i agree it must be strongly regulated to ensure proper design and safety controls, but it is the fastest way we can remove carbon based fuels from the system and the grid is already well designed to exploit power from these sources. glad to hear you are willing to consider it, i was saddened when cosmos did not even mention it in their climate change episode.
i spoke to my seven year old niece yesterday on the phone, and asked her what she did at school. she said lots of things, but that day science was most interesting. i didn't remember doing a lot of science at that age and asked her about it. she said "in science, we make predictions and observations all sorts of different ways". and then i knew there was hope for the future.
note to self: write in "bill nye in free-fall into ice cubes" on next presidential ballot.
had a planetarium at the age of 7 can confirm he will only be able to see constellations from that point forward.
i tell this to people all the time when they mention we are destroying the earth... no we are not, we are merely affecting our ability to live on it.
kind of reminds me of that movie with justin timberlake where you paid for things in time but when you run out of time you die. this would be kinda like that but with less risk of death.
my gaseous molecules bring no one joy. just ask my wife.
i would start rocking a bow tie at work if they were sold by you. even better if proceeds went to science foundations providing materials for schools.
can i just point out that it is so rare that bill nye just answered a critical question of the nature that is so, so often avoided in amas? props to you, mr. nye, for actually taking it on in a respectful and awesome manner.
if you ever watch albatrosses land on land, it's horrible, they smash themselves all the time, but they land beautifully on water.
are you 20 years old now? is that your origin story?
holy crap, something my job involves got mentioned! i'm currently working with a major oil and gas company to perfect an industrial grade desalination pump. we were testing a concept that involved water desalination, but unfortunately it kept destroying itself after a few minutes of continuous use (turns out, water is a lot more viscous than our current test medium, 5w20 oil) these aren't low energy pumps either (hence why they're industrial grade) but just know that the technology is definitely in the works!
i would pay money to watch a show with bill nye and alton brown, easy.
if you are a casual, consider crew tees or polos. if you experience the joy of warmth, look into something called wool. with that said, i love it all! as a freshmen, i'm sure you don't have to decide yet. visit the dressing rooms and see what you think.
as someone with a family member in the science field, don't do biology right now. stick to engineering, geology or physics. biologist are having a hell of a time getting tenure track jobs even at the top schools right now. good luck!
/u/thesob88 doesn't read answers, he *experiences* them.
ndt was defending nye, though. he won it for the two of them, but it was still a victory for their "side."
our future lies in the hands of.../u/herp_that_derp.
not that simple. i'm more in the stasis crowd, but either way, we've got quite a ways to go before either becomes a possibility. i do like the fact that bill nye's group is working on a controllable solar sail, it sets us on the right path.
and every time one of them stops talking, the other picks up immediately.
it blows my mind when i read something like this. at least now you can go nuts with what reality has to offer. so much to discover when the world is not 6000 years old.
wait the brontosaurus isn't a thing? rip childhood.
i bet we could get enough redditors onboard to make the news during election results.
it made me so happy to see bill nye say what i've been telling people for ages. we're trying to save ourselves and many of the other lovely creatures that depend on a narrow range of conditions to survive. regardless of whether we clean up our act, life on the planet will go on. we just won't be here to see it.
is this really the best comparison any of us can think of?
i'm starting to see why people don't, hot topics like this could turn into an arguement that would take too much time because both sides want to be right. just look at /u/hexaploid 's response this, ain't gonna be a topic that gonna die soon. i would have understood if there was no reply to this at all.
actually if you were anywhere else in the universe it would appear as if it equally expanding from that point as well. so in a sense anywhere can be the center of the universe.

yeah, i was raised in baptist christian environments, and when i started to branch out in high school it felt like i was being intentionally manipulated. i missed out on a lot, compared to students around me. the scientific method of deduction lead me to understanding things a lot better, as well as spending a lot of nights contemplating my mortality and my faith. in the end, i'm a better person, i believe. i'm more invested in doing something to advance and support humans as a species rather than just hiding out in the kentucky woods and avoiding life in the hopes that jesus would forgive me for masturbating.
i would. debate is a method of interactive argument. two people argued their views in a structured, moderated setting. i don't think it matters that the other guy had no sense of reality. what else could you call it?
oh yeah, it's terrible here, since the museum's attendance has gone down, the only people who go are the ones closest to it, so anyone who goes lives around where i am. it sucks and there are billboards everywhere and these stupid commercials, it sucks as an atheist to live so close to it.
correct. its a simple matter of relativity. light travels at a constant speed so we can only see as far as the number of years the universe has been around.
but 9 months still falls within a 12 month year.... depending on the timing, today could in fact be 20 years from the date of conception.
thought you were /u/encyclopedia_kenham for a moment. that'd be fitting.
unless you're bathing yourself in e. coli, you won't smell like it. you probably just smell like the disinfectants and the media.
give me some cole slaw and chili and i'll think about it.
but they were around thousands of years ago. just a lot more thousands than millions.
in fact he probably would have said it worse. at least grammatically.
i'm willing to test my limits to make this happen.
lbr: jesus was a 30 something, unmarried man who hung out with a bunch of dudes and a prostitute. chances are he isn't going to be judging anyone for masturbating.
uh, bill... you weren't there! if you weren't there, you can't be sure! haha! oh, how am i sure? because, you see, there's this book... that tells me so!
if it makes you feel better, it sucks as a christian who believes in evolution that it exists, and that people give voice to that numbskull.
your username makes me skeptical, but this explanation seems plausible.
...goddamnit. ok. we don't know enough to tell exactly how old bill nye's third favorite accident is.
ken ham: something. something bible, something please fund my ark. *shifty eyes*
it's definitely the media. lb has a super distinct smell that i associate with e. coli, but you're right that the cells don't smell much.
new york is inches from londom. many, many inches.
it's how a lot of radical any bodies raise their children. you'd be surprised how many people act this way but don't even actually believe what they claim too.
i'm not so sure about that. as if the universe expanding is accelerating, we can't explain that. which is what we are trying to explain and currently can't. if we are shrinking, then that explains why the rate of expansion seems to be accelerating. i just looked this up on google, and it seems about a year back some physicists and cosmologists started throwing this idea around as an actual possibility. so i'm not the first one to think of this, so there goes my scholarship i was planning to get from u of b. nye.
microbiology is literally the most fun i've ever had in a class in my entire life, i looked forward to that class every single day, i'd wake up in a good mood when i had it, but the vicks vaporub investment almost bankrupted me.
apple sues hoover for have corners and air sucking
yea it's fun but unfortunately my school only schedules it for once a week (well, labs at least) so we don't get to do too much since it's basically prepping shit and then waiting a week. what we do get to do is fun and pippetting makes you feel fancy as fuck. i have also been lucky enough to be going to a community college that offers a genetics course with hands on lab work and an ecology course where you actually go on trips and do field work. going out on a saturday and driving down to the nj pine barrens with some nice fall weather is awesome. or going into a few cold local streams and just taking samples as a class is great... also good chance to interact with the lady classmates.
from southeast asia to india, and spending time in the jungle. i was like a pig in shit, one of the happiest times of my cooking career. i've got maybe the next call for me, in terms of excitement, has to be south america. so i'm thinking of planning that next great escape across south america. off the beaten track. no landmark, touristy, bullshitty, stadiums, just an inside to the culture that i'm trying to learn. great escape is definitely coming back. maybe spring or summer 2018
shortcuts. just people taking shortcuts to undermine the value of doing it properly in any profession. it really pisses me off. there's nothing worse than coming across a young chef that wants to take shortcuts to get the job done quicker. if you have the job done quicker, you're removing the essence and the true passion to why you're a chef in the first place. but just in general, whether it's a plumber, an electrician, or even a police officer, taking shortcuts and getting it done quickly for the sake of it is not the smartest idea. do it properly or don't do it at all.
i am not sure where you are located but in the ne u.s. i can tell you i have had success with; herbs (basil, thyme, rosemary, mint), carrots, kale, lettuce, spinach, sweet potatoes, rutabagas, radish, beets. i planted these from seeds and they took off. tomatoes should grow well but i suck dealing with them because they seem to need to hang in some way i just cant get right.
his pork chops with sweet and sour peppers was to die for and super easy.
it breaks my damn heart that this did not receive an answer.
the f word is my favorite series of his and i really hope it doesn't get all fox'ed up
this country's spoiled. from east coast to west coast to central to seattle to san fran. i took a bunch of mates on my 50th birthday last november, and i was up to my eyeballs in pressure. launching a new restaurant in vegas, *master chef junior* taped at the same time. but on my actual 50th birthday, i share the same day as my daughter, matilda, so it's her 15th. i took a plane out of van nuys. flew half a dozen of my friends over, my best mates. i finished work at lunchtime, flew to san francisco, had a table of ten booked at *saison*, had the most exceptional ten-course dinner finished and then flew back to la and started work the next day. and that for me has been one of the best dinners i've ever experienced. and that was my second time there. in order to confirm how good a restaurant is, first time experience is important, but to confirm how good it really is, is to go back and check it out again. and it was even better the second time round. that's quite rare.
i think one of the most practical knives i've been working with throughout is henckles knives. henckles knives, incredible. i'll tell you why. the secret of a great knife is in the handle. because if you've got a firm grip and you feel comfortable and secure with the handle, you chop, you slice, much better. so, henckles knives, for me, are one of the most versatile and definitely one of the most rounded, but the elaborate handle makes for such a more comfortable chop, slice. it's like driving a car. a steering wheel. it's like putting a pair of gloves on. you need to feel tight and smooth and in control of it. so, it's all about the handle and henckles knives, by far, are one of the most practical.
first of all, you shouldn't be in fucking bed this time of day. jesus. it's midday. secondly, salsa in bed? jesus christ. chocolate dessert maybe, but salsa? vegan, that's a really good question. i would do the most amazing minestrone soup in a way that i would use the best vegetables, the best vegetable stock, and then i would finish that with some of the most fragrant herbs ever on the planet. there's a purple basil herb that grows indoors and it's so fragrant and so incredible. finishing that was extra virgin olive oil. beautiful. but, i'm more concerned about salsa in a bed and in this time in the afternoon. we need to get you sorted.
every time i'm in philly, that's the first thing that i go for. i love an extra mature cheddar on top of my philly cheese steak, i don't want the steak over sliced, sometimes they slice it so thinly that they take all the goodness out of it, i prefer a chunkier steak inside the sandwich and an extra mature cheddar.
everything is getting very it-led. we're having restaurants now that you're going in and ordering off ipads, etc, etc. so, we're missing this sort of personality of what restaurants should stand for. i'm slightly nervous about technical equipment, ya know, stoves, fires, immersion blenders using to cook, if we become over-elaborate with the science and technology of a kitchen then we're missing that human connect. i'm a firm believer in understanding textures and touching and tasting and smelling. so, i've seen a little too much of the sort of ipad scenario in restaurants. and it's just we're missing that element of fun and we can't over computerize the restaurants. recently, the idea of robot chefs, are you honestly going to fucking tell me a robot has got a palate better than gordon ramsay? fucking do me a favor. the quicker the batteries run down, the better.
for me, duh, around my house, everyone's expecting fireworks, for obvious reasons. so, what would i do if i was treating my mate in dinner tonight? some of the butternut squash currently out there is amazing. so, i'd do a roasted butternut squash risotto, finished with the most amazing sort of brown sage butter and then for my entree, i'd do a braised cabbage with a roasted loin of venison finished with a sort of red wine sauce that's been thickened with a dark, bitter chocolate. and then for dessert, i'd go for something absolutely stunning. i'd go for a classic lemon tart. something that is very citrusy. clean and delicious.
a. this is a fucking serious cooking class b. it's me! on my own in my kitchen, so there is no reason to scream because i know what the fuck i'm doing. more importantly, i'm trying to get you the viewer up to speed, so sadly, no screaming.
for the rest of my life, cast iron. the longer you continue cooking in those, the more depth of flavor there is. non-stick, after a while, at least two and a half, three years, it loses that non-stick. but, listen, the caramelization that takes place in the cast iron pan, whether it's an incredible thigh of chicken or roasting scallops or even making the most amazing caramelized apple tarte tatin. cast iron pan will last generations. a non-stick pan will last twenty-four months.
i think jp is back inside one of the actual restaurants and he rotates em out iirc
i've tackled some really key fundamentals across the masterclass because we'd gone from, sort of, a to zed of cooking. more importantly, we've gone more in-depth in the way that, the ultimate cookery was not fast-tracked, but it was a very great series that was, i suppose, for beginners. the masterclass is that we just finished taping is more in-depth because i've combined the journey because i wasn't up against any pressure from the network to create 30-minute episodes. this was sort of uncut, unedited cooking. yeah, there's a lot of beautiful shots in there, but it got me opened up right to the very beginning. when i was on my ass in the middle of paris at the age of 22 without a pot to piss in. i couldn't speak a work of french and it was make-or-break and i had to make it. i had to leave that city with the best knowledge that i've ever had. that's the difference. i think masterclass is raw. i think it's brutally honest and it's uninterrupted.
can't even say it here, must have been a really good one
my cousin's name is nino and now thanks to kitchen nightmares i can't look at his face without bursting in laughters
haha, yea, i mean, the scary thing for me is getting legalized in a different states across the country. i understand the purpose of it for medicinal use, i get that, but i'm slightly nervous that if it's legal without an issue medically, we can have a nation as high as a kite. food wise, i get high off perfection, i don't need cannabis.
i see the rapid growing demands put on restaurateurs and chefs with dietary requirements and vegan/vegetarian alternatives. pescatarian. celiac. we get those requests every day, so in this incredible up and coming *master chef junior* series, launching this thursday, we put them under intense scrutiny to come up with a hamburger challenge. and the hamburger challenge is done creatively, but with no meat. so, give me the best vegetarian burger you could ever think about. i think that it's important to show kids you can eat well as a vegetarian without protein and make that burger delicious. whether it's a mushroom burger done with incredible pesto. just stop using protein and understand that vegetarian cooking is equally as important. i've already incorporated that into this season. literally starting in the next three days.
fuck yes u/wcvechten that was a great question, i'm so hyped for more great escape
you're absolutely right. i enjoy working on cars and i despise short cuts. if you're gonna do something, do it right. in this hobby, you're saving yourself headaches and a broken car.
i checked into this... mr. ramsay finds the lamb fucking sauce in the bedroom closest to the barn. sadly, he still can't locate the fucking lamb sauce.
lmao van nuys airport. did not expect that mention
i will say that your knife should feel like an extension of your hand- the high end henckles knives are are quite heavy and men tend to prefer them, whereas a wusthof knife is a bit lighter (not a bad thing) - and women seem to prefer them more. the person doing the dominant amount of cutting in a family should select a knife. you do not need a whole set- a chefs knife or santoku knife and a pairing knife should be a good start. later you can add a bread knife or carving knife. it's better to spend $70 on one amazing knife than $70 on a set of so/so knives that you won't use all of and are of lesser quality. lastly- learn how to sharpen them and keep sharp as fuck and never ever ever ever put it in the dishwasher.
follow up: where do you go for a philly cheese steak when you're in philly?
gonna happen no matter what. once we get taste sensors, machine learning will do in a week what we can in decades.
cooking for my mates usually consists of throwing a digiorno in the oven.
i'm just imagining the screaming as i mess things up. it's just as effective, and just as entertaining!
we can do a gordon ramsay roleplay in bed later ;)
chef, i've made my nonsticks last 10 years. maybe i should go shopping?
mc is worth more than the price - i highly recommend it to anyone on the fence.
totally on board with this response, but it's interesting that protein equates to meat to chefs. there are plenty of non-meat proteins, so it seems weird to me to think about veg cooking as "just stop using protein". if vegetarians didn't eat any protein there would be issues.
yup, you can see just how greasy it is by how far the toppings have slipped down from the top of the slice.
translated from dutch his username means toilet fighting. just thought you'd want to know.
software design checking in. we are the worst for this. i honesty believe that i have gimped my career to a certain degree by insisting on building robust systems that have an eye on the horizon. everything is so disposable in this world. it gets to be something of an existential crisis at times. ...let me go take my meds.
yeah, but you still have to put in the investment of time and effort to find a better way of doing things. spending 5 hours now to save 50 hours down the line isn't taking a shortcut, it's simply investing your time wisely.
bacon and cheese are great in soup. she should grow those. :d
you are about to have your mind blown. parsnips are fucking delicious.
a contender but teddy roosevelt killed and ate bears.
gordon if you add anything extra to that grilled cheese then i hope you know you've committed a cardinal sin.
i agree. something ive also noticed throughout his ama's and on reddit in general, is that people from the uk (assuming not just gb) tend to be able to communicate more ...passionately? through written mediums (in general) than people from other backgrounds. ive read dozens of comments where i get a feeling the dudes from the uk, even though they dont use any typical uk slang, just from the sentence structure and grammar. i know its a very silly observation to make, but i've read through peoples comments history whenever i get this feeling and i haven't been wrong yet. from the east coast usa.
best of luck to you. enjoy those kids because they're only young once and make them priority #1 and that they know it. they're going to learn everything that matters in life from you and their mom first.
restaurateurs will never answer this question unless they're cornered. the compensation they get comes off the back of hard working line cooks if they're lucky enough open a successful restaurant.
you thought cheese as a snack was weird? what did you think babybels were?
it's a pretty common airport for business jets and charter operations. lax is way too crowded and busy for private jets to be chartered, at van nuys you can just pull up in your car and hop in the jet.
if you have a homegoods near you, check their kitchen section regularly. you'll find le creuset, all-clad and other great brands in there at really good prices. but as to selection, that's hit and miss.
i mean, i would totally give my adress to gordon ramsay but to a random redditor?
do it! i've been running distance for years and it's the best form of meditation you can imagine once you get good at it. for an hour a day, you have the world to yourself and the freedom to focus on anything from your breathing pattern to the mysteries of the cosmos. i broke my ankle rock climbing in november and there isn't a day that goes by that i don't think about the day i can start running again.
i would bet somewhere like tony luke's, they cut thick.
human perception will prevent that. same as "organic", "cooked by human chef" will be seen as the signature of exceptional quality.
because it didn't get answered - you don't have to speak french. most yacht workers are english/australian/south african - most owners and guests are english speaking, unless you get on a foreign owned boat. if you can cook reasonably well you'll be fine, the standard honestly isn't that high - especially if you start as a crew chef or sous.
cooking for my mates usually involves a window and a "what do you want?" to the backseat.
not sure if hungry or horny but something is going in someone's mouth either way
someone just make a soundboard with drops from hk!
i used to think my 5yo nonsticks were in good shape. then i got some new ones and realized how much they had sucked.
it's a weight loss technique - the teflon helps the food just glide through you without being absorbed.
the only difference is, in our case it's often ourselves who get to suffer from our own bad choices down the line. so there is a certain amount of implicit self-education involved.
it's not even a common thing throughout all of the usa. i've never had it where i am in the us.
it's called a fucking melt, don't call them grilled cheeses you bastards
from the way his response was worded it sounds like he's dictating to someone else typing.
marshall's and tjmaxx, too. they're all owned by the same company, but stock varies from store to store, even in the same area. it's how i've bought all my le creuset, though.
which is why i also offered to gift the class (which can be sent to a throwaway email address)
given his name ends in 420, i imagine him eating doritos and salsa, running out of doritos and just carrying on. we've all been there...
also, a cast iron pan is effectively immortal. drop it? whatever. use metal utensils? it doesn't care. rust? scrub that shit off and keep using it. high heat? it's a lump of iron, it doesn't mind. you have to baby nonstick pans *so much* by comparison.
i, too, want to become fascinating by watching this guy's tutorials.
i have had spotted dick and it really isn't that bad. junt kinda unremarkable.
crispy dough and deep fried chicken is healthy. check.
that place was within a twenty minute drive from my home, but i never saw the episode until after they shut down. i wanted a front row seat to the crazy.
my money is on this. all british comments are dictated. but how?
great. now i got the image in my head of gordon ramsay sucker punching some dude in a kitchen store and then running out of there with a set of knives, cursing in british.
what will restore your other part? how about a donut. you come through my city, i'll buy you a donut.
our tj max has never had much kitchen stuff. didn't know marshalls is the same people, never been there. thanks for letting me know.
i got a set of okay knives and then upgraded my main chef knife to a wustof. they are amazing and i have seen gordon using them in some of his videos. i got one used off of craigslist for about the price of the victorinox and then got it professionally sharpened for for a few dollars. made prep way easier.
if you're using the kitchen a lot, you need to have some rags available. i use two: one for clean hands, and another for less-clean things. hang them somewhere accessible like the stove door handle, etc. to clean a knife, just rinse it off as soon as you're done using it and give it one pass through the rag to dry off. then it can go right in its home (magnetic blocks are nice). takes 3 seconds. you use a steel to align the edge. do this for 5 to 10 seconds once a day or so. you sharpen perhaps once every couple weeks. there are a million ways to do this and a lot of opinions, but a simple dual-grit stone and a strop work really well. you can send it out, too, but that's a pain. buy a cheap knife at a thrift store and learn how to sharpen it. unless you want a japanese knife (rusts easier), maintenance is super easy. just don't soak it in the sink or throw it in the dishwasher. some people will say the latter is okay, but they don't know what a sharp knife is.
well, don't drop it. they *can* crack. but with as many ones around that are over 100 years old, i will concede that they are very, very sturdy.
it depends if they have a homegoods nearby, they send it all there. in areas with less homegoods, tj maxx has more.
plenty of good stainless japanese knives out there now, though my favourite to work with are still the carbon steel ones. easy to sharpen to a stupidly sharp edge and holds it a long time
what could you have heard about perth? i suppose nice beaches, clean streets, decent food and an otherwise high standard of living are not everyones cup of tea
i had a 85 year old griswold #3 break on me recently. real shame. i'm considering welding it, but i've never welded cast iron.
to be perfectly honest. you sound much more fluent than your average english speaker. i would never have really thought about you being fluent if you hadn't mentioned it. however to answer your question the best way is to do what you just did. utilize the language on english sites like reddit. it's all about proficiency. the more you use a language the easier certain phrases will come. one word of advice don't try translating idioms or phrases word. for word from malaysian. more often than not the concept is lost in translation. good luck continuing your english knowledge!
perhaps if you make the promise to use the knives for cooking and not assassinating people...
i just mean that as shorthand for high-carbon steel. i use a global, myself.
you've not been beyond mount lawley in a while have you?
oh, i usually have very nice, polite fans. i don't have anything too weird. and i don't want to tell you, because i don't want to give any weirdos any ideas.
"are you tired? you should leave this party and go to sleep." oh, you're right! thanks! bye!
1) oh!! just the idea of connecting with some people, and just answering letters and questions that come in to us. simple as that. 2) ha! well, in very exciting news, there was a moment of time where daniel radcliffe and i were in the same building. and i am a huge fan of his work, and i think he's an awesome actor. that being said, unlike leslie, i have never read the books! i have 2 young sons and i am looking forward to doing that with them soon. 3) adam scott smells like... lemons and possibility. future and peppermint. loyalty and vanilla ice cream.
oh, we had so many good ones!!! we had surprise ones that we can't believe we got, like michelle obama, joe biden and ginuwine. we had great comedy people, like louis ck... and nick kroll, jason mantzoukas... anytime a ucb person comes by, it's always great. we've had so many good guest stars come by, it's an embarrassment of riches.
it was really fun... that was early on in the show, i just remember laughing, just like i do at everything chris pratt does. he's genius.
mmm. oh! well right now i'm eating tortilla chips and salsa while i do this. and i've had a long day, and no time to cook. so life imitates art, reddit.
get some sunlight, go for a brisk walk, take your vitamin d, call a friend, make sure you change out of your pajamas at some point in the day.
ah! well, uh, let's see. i think there's a little bit of everybody in their characters, but we aren't all annoyed by jim o'hare. so when the character of jerry comes around, we all can't wait for him to get out of there, but when jim goes around, we only want him to stay. but joan calamezzo, the character, is based on moe collin's life. just kidding!!!
hahaha! well, you know, look - do i think i'm the best in the game? no. but do i think i'm one of the best? absolutely. do i consider myself better than nas? totally. am i a better mc than jay-z? *we.*shall.*see.* at the end of the day, i'm just... trying to keep it real. from the heart, and spit like a master. yes, adam scott is a great actor, he's a great kisser, has a great head of hair, and if this is adam scott - **i'm onto you, stop fishing for compliments!**
first of all, this person assumes that i would fight nick offerman in a physical way. they are wrong. i would destroy him *mentally.* i would get into that complex, wood-covered mind of his, and rip him to *shreds.* and if this is nick offerman - **nice try, buddy!** i'm coming for you!
um: hmm. well, that's a good one. maybe " pay attention to what people do, not what they say."
oh, i guess, i feel i don't know anyone's history well enough, but i would pick... maybe a suffragette who liked to party?
we just finished a movie called "the nest" that is coming out next year! and i'm also doing a voice in the new pixar movie "inside out" which is coming out in june, and it's a great film, can't wait for people to see it. and catch me as a dungeonmaster in "50 shades of grey!" you can't tell it's me cuz i'm wearing a mask!
i wasn't the class clown. i was a student who liked school and did a lot of activities, and i kind of floated around. i wasn't very shy, but i didn't really think i would be a performer, and didn't know anyone who was an actor or writer. i was a very kind of typical kid who liked to work hard and have a good time. but i don't think you would've necessarily pointed to me and said "darn right."
awww! thank you chile! i love you! and so does horatio sanz, who's from chile! that's a great question, and yes, as we move forward with new content at smart girls, we are excited about opening up in an international way and providing content for all over the world. i love that you care enough to ask that, and i hope to be providing more content for you very soon. rapido!
um... i kind of - i met tilda swinton a few years ago, and i grabbed her a little too tightly. there's lots of people who i am very excited to meet, and they are often not famous. but as far as - yeah. let's say tilda swinton was an exciting one, i'm a big fan of hers. and i still get excited by meeting a lot of people.
1) yes! first of all, rest in peace, lil sebastian, he will always be in our hearts and minds. and smart girls is growing by the minute, we are getting ready to launch new programming in the next few months under the legendary umbrella! and i started smart girls just with the small idea of creating a show, a fun show that started with a dance party and celebrated young people being themselves, and it's grown into a bigger idea, and hopefully, kind of, you know, in its own way, a tiny movement. i was able to collaborate with the creator mike a lot, and we really worked together in many ways to make leslie who she was, and because there's such good writing on the show that she becomes such a great character. and she's like me, but she works... we're like each other, i should say, but i think i'm - i don't think i'm as, i think i've become a little bit more cynical than her. i think she reminds me to keep an open mind and to go big or go home.
i love it! i used to live in chicago, and did touring through indiana when i was in second city, and it's a beautiful state filled with fine people who work hard and love their children!
we have so many funny times on set, we do a lot of goofing around, it's loose and goofy, and one of the most fun things was - we do this thing where we all forget our lines... oh wait, that's just us forgetting our lines. no wait!
haha! um... i relax by running marathons. and i get my energy by base jumping.
oh, it's really really hard, because he's a genius and i grew up listening to his records, and it was really fun to get to work with him. and he's wearing a ridiculous ponytail. i'm always onboard for it.
oh! happy 18th birthday! exercise your right to vote! whatever you feel drunk, stop, because 18 year olds have a hard time figuring out how much they can drink. be with a good friend who can make sure you get home safe, and try one new thing on your birthday every year.
um...my go-to karaoke song is "we didn't start the fire" by billy joel. sung in spanish. and in a very high key.
thank you for asking. :coughs: it already dropped. and by "dropped" i mean "the label dropped it and somebody needs to pick it up and make it." but i got a lot of underground cassette tapes floating around. and any artist will tell you that's where the *real* shit is.
i respect people who go into public service. i love people who are open to the possibility of change. i realized myself that i could never go into politics cuz the lighting is too bad.
thank you, saficus! i can tell from this question that you have a great face too. my favorite breakfast food... oooh, you know what, i don't want to hate on pancakes. all breakfast food welcome!
well, it was really fun, and a lot of special guests come and join me. sir patrick stewart read some things for me, and i'm a fan of his work and of his voice. kathleen turner came in and read sentences from some of my darker periods. carol burnett joined me in the booth for a minute, as did seth meyers, mike schur, and my parents. and lady gaga was also there, but she also didn't say anything!
the dearth of ucb related questions in this thread is disheartening.
well, i was encouraged by so many people (and continue to be encouraged by so many people). in the beginning of my career, there was a woman named charna halpern, she ran the i.o. theater in chicago, and was one of my first, you know, patrons and teachers. and i studied with her and del close, and learned how to improvise, and then i basically was supported by and encouraged by all the great and talented people i got to improvise with. i try not to think about that, because it feels overwhelming. and i just try to do my thing, and it's really really nice to hear you say that, and i *thank you*, but that is the kind of thing that will give me night terrors if i allow it.
i'm an improv person and you definitely should. it's a horrifying cult full of monsters, though, make no mistake about that.
hi i just wanted to say that i love girls inc. and before i became unemployed i donated to girls inc. of lynn from every paycheck. you guys are great!
yep, good thinking. *writing this on my amy poehler wall.*
have you seen those dothraki dudes? they can get it. everybody on that show can get it.
if he writes an autobiography and doesn't choose one of these three smell combinations as the title, i will be sorely disappointed
tier 1 guest: first lady, vice president, ginuwine.
i think amy is still pretending that she did win the emmy. so am i.
omg she even didn't capitalize reddit. a true ama star.
thanks for making me feel bad about still being in my pajamas at 3 p.m. on a wednesday.
are you also a hoarder like leslie? i found that really unexpected
hmmm... "why can't you hear a pterodactyl going to the bathroom?" best i can come up with.
implying jay z is better than nas is fightin' words
i'm sure they can! i know there's a stat out there for how many words/minute they say on gilmore girls.
just shave off his mustache while he's sleeping. without the stache, he is powerless.
a little self-plug for 'broad city.' which is the shit. absolutely hilarious.
are there pictures of that? :) you're the best, thanks for coming to talk with us.
can you explain where the name asssscat comes from?
unless they have a gun. then probably do whatever they say.
i point at every kid i meet and say "darn right!" just in case they end up famous
omg i'm like crying for this answer. gracias gracias amy! esperando verte hablar como sofia vergara :*
watching everyone struggle to hold it together in the "debbie downer goest to disney" sketch is amazing.
you actually haven't met tilda swenton yet. you met conan o' brien.
wow thank you so much for responding! you put the biggest smile on my face. i can't wait to see what is in store for you after parks and rec comes to a close.
"i was born a poor black child" is the "call me ishmael" of comedy movies
i live in chicago now (doing second city stuff) and i agree! can't wait to read your book!!
you can't just *make* cocktail sauce. it fell to earth many years ago in the heart of a giant meteor, just like yogurt, and is harvested from caverns deep beneath the earth's surface.
hmmm. yeah we were looking for more of the get stoned and watch parks reruns on netflix kind of relaxing.
i'm a non-american working in muncie as i type this and... yeah. wow.
i could see that. i'm from carmel... #indyhatescarmel was recently trending on twitter. :(
read that as "rhinoceros ponytail." didn't really question it.
i don't think i've ever been this jealous in my life... meep
amy poehler and i both like blueberry waffles. i eat like the stars!
i need to see this in video on youtube. or better, on p&r!
ahhh yes, all breakfast food is also the correct answer. thanks again! made my day!
yup, shameful. i still have my bucket of truth shirt that you got if you bought season 1 dvds through ucb.
she didn't say you can't be in them now. just...try not to be later.
that was the moment i realized i love p&r. they take the time to really build their characters. i was also very surprised, but then immediately realized it sort of makes sense. i also used to have a problem with the way everybody's always bullying jerry, but then a friend said that that was one of the things he really liked because it's completely realistic. workplace bullying is a thing, and even people who are otherwise good people engage in it. i think he's right, now. it all serves to make the characters more like people and less like, well, characters.
yeah that's absurd. just play ny state of mind to *anyone* and that opinion will be changed.
that show is literally all dialogue. idk how those women memorized all of that.
his mustache is not shavable by conventional means.
i think it's fourth row down, one from the left on that composite above.
in the dvd extras for asssscat, the story seems to be that it was drunkenly yelled during a show, i think by horatio sanz, during an awkward moment when nobody was on stage. then the audience walked out. it kind of means, "this show is for us, and forget if the audience likes it."
yeah, jimmy fallon breaking character was super surprising, he always keeps it together when he's performing
that is one of the best analogies i've seen on reddit. good job.
on the flip side, have you ran a marathon that led to a cliff that you base jumped off of?
i'm a ball state student. so living in muncie, i see the similarities too.
also, they say it's in southern indiana but it definitely looks more like central indiana. it's all flat while southern indiana is all hills.
i always thought of myself as more of a pengwing...
may* never die. get it right or the ironborn may come reaving...
some kid might rearrange the squares and re-form the penis, like a dick-themed version of a slide puzzle.
yeah but now everybody is trying to sneak a peak at skinny pratts penis.
instructions unclear. changed from footie pajamas to non-footie pajamas
or paste them in word and let it count them for you.
le le let me introdush you to to vicky woodfull * she ran she ran over a preshident before his erection * wh when she was a kid a little kiddie her parens think she was like buoyant and she almost drowneded. * shhhhhe was one of she was the first clock blocker in hishory, and her sisser operer operar op.. her sisser ran a broken firm. * her seccon husband was james bond * sh hs she wash very pretty soooo pretty and but she was way into menag menagerie menag.. she did threeshomes
she sounds kind of like me, but less lazy, so i hear that.
also: be the person leslie knope thinks you can be"
you are on to something. i would totally sign up for a race that, exactly at 26.2 miles, flings you off a cliff to the post race medical tent.
it's really weird to see ball state mentioned on reddit
victoria is **very** good at writing like people talk. makes it to where i can hear amy's voice.
and pay the iron price for that reddit gold ya got there
"back then they didn't want me, now i'm hot they all on me." lol.
no, i know most of us have heard the rumors. he apparently has a hideous penis.
don't forget the sleepy time tea and a copy of twilight.
never, ever in my life did i think mike jones lyrics would be relevant
i've heard it looks like a mushroom had sex with a turtle.
oh wow, he really said he didn't need to be saved? so he must hate all this. would hate to think we're embarrassing the guy instead of sending support
this sounds like a conversation taking place at a home where a family is gathering together for the first time since the son got back from a psych ward. i hope he is reading these comments and laughing.
seriously. i highly doubt he'd be down to come over on reddit to discuss his personal life and mental health.
agreed. it's like some people here have never met someone who has gone through tough shit. this post is still condescending and inconsiderate after the edit. people are only thinking of their own entertainment.
he was gigantic in most of our childhoods/adolescence, and then just fucking disappeared.
omg so jealous. seriously i know no other fading 90's actor that still has this much support from fans. he just seems like a decent dude.
i know i'm seriously salty about it. i like the mummy reboot but why change the actor? nothing wrong with tom cruise but brendan was right there, primed for the kill.
same here. and he was super gorgeous in with honors. love that movie. no one really talks about as much
are you talking about chamcham? don't think he's his partner, but definitely some kind of family member.
he had a podcast with pewdiepie so i mean anything is possible!!!
right? i read the scathing replies and couldn't work it out
are you saying that he *didn't* get screwed over by alimony?
it was pretty bad. they were just like "he chose some bad movies. career ended!"
i remember school ties! it had matt damon, ben affleck and chris o'donnell among others. i still have this weird nostalgia about that movie.
he wasn't bad in the affair on showtime, actually pretty good imo.
really? sounds exactly like the parts he played in school ties and with honors so probably.
yea he said it, i don't blame him though. i would say the same thing if i were in his place, it kind of makes it sound like he can't take care of himself and he needs people to defend him. he definitely isn't a huge fan of reddit though, he said he avoids it. can't remember exactly what his words were though.
jose canseco wasn't a debacle, that was the funniest ama i can ever remember.
i dunno man. this comment sure points to you having persecution mania. have you been diagnosed with schizophrenia? /s
are you telling me that celebrities dont want to open up to their personal life and mental health to complete strangers? blasphemy!
try sitting down and writing him a fan letter. a real paper one. mention your genuine affection for his work and your good wishes for his future success. then send it. it would probably cheer him up more than an iama that would inevitably have at least a few people making bad jokes at his expense for the karma.
a guy with voice of 1000 angels who does funny commentary of things
he disappeared after a judge made him pay his ex-wife $900,000 alimony every year. he's had to take a bunch of shitty roles to keep up with it.
i even like the fucking dragon king one, all of those movies, every single one, (yes, i include the scorpion king movies) are so great. it's like indiana jones but instead of harrison ford it's brendan fraser!
wow, i must have missed that. what happened to him?
yeah just like the guy who "ate" a picture of gal gadot for wonder woman getting over an 80% on rottentomatoes
one of my favorite episodes of scrubs, and favorite story arcs from that show. that twist really hit me, made me cry.
its not a reboot though, its a completely separate thing with the same name.
no, it was someone on reddit. and it was very obvious they were together, she mentioned them traveling together for the bollywood film and how he mostly took the job because it was only a couple weeks of filming then he was free to travel india as a sort of payed vacation.
there was school ties, where they hate him bc he was jewish, and then there was the one with joe pesci playing a bum that he gets a college paper from.
introvert here. i bet i could guess. being around people is awesome. being around people that idolize you is probably terrifying. what if you say something stupid? what if you dont measure up to expectations? if i were famous, id probably never reveal it and stick with my 15 upvotes a week.
i know when i get depressed i hate people constantly reminding me of it. literally had a trainer tell me they were concerned cause i had 'no light' in my eyes. i wanted to smack her. still. so many comments are about how much people liked his work and want to see more of him. maybe we should be pushing that angle.
to be fair, its embarrassing as someone who isn't brendan fraser
that header is fucking awful, but if you read the comments people genuinely like and miss the guy. i'm new to reddit too. look, lets be honest, he's aged drastically and clearly went through some shit. i didn't need a 4chan meme to be concerned. i saw his last three interviews and i freaked. seriously thought he was going to be another robin williams.
wow...idk about all that. i liked him as a kid in movies like the mummy and blast from the past and bedazzled, but he wasn't the greatest actor in the world or anything. now, i do believe that mel gibson deserves a return to thr spotlight. he made some great movies.
or, he has dissociative personality disorder and it's one of his other personalities trying to reach out to him!
this is a really good idea. how do you go about getting actors addresses? i feel like its not something that just gets handed out left, right, and centre.
definitely. could be a sasquatch enthusiast, sees either a real one or a survivalist mountain man hermit in furs at a distance, killings all fit his research profile, but he can't talk about it to the other cops until one of them sees it while on an unrelated call. bf then tries to convince said other cop that it's sasquatch. * something tells me he'd play contained frustration/semi-convincing "i'm not crazy" vibe really well. *2 he absolutely has to not be a cop. firefighter or something. maybe a paramedic.
voice of a 1000 angles and nipples that can cut glass.
and from hurting his back which then caused him to lose most of his income and alimony remain unchanged despite his income changing.
pretty much same. the only time i see all that come up is on reddit. otherwise i'm like, "the fuck happened to brendan fraser?"
his wife forced him to pay $900k a year in alimony, and he doesn't make what he used to, so i think you can imagine having nearly all of your income being taken away, along with having a much harder time getting jobs.
they should've waited at least a few weeks after the release. those advance reviews are often weighted favorably.
yeah it's actually the start of a reboot to an even older franchise, universal's monsters.
a stalker following him around could just as easily be "traveling together" with him... just saying.
you misunderstand. i was poking fun at the british accent == serious movie suggestion.
15 upvotes a week! what are you a rich actor or something?
that's a great way of looking at it, and probably the right way. i know some people really like to hate on "lesser" celebrities, but there are so many of them that just went on to lead normal lives. like they forget not everyone wants to be in the spotlight. shit, i'm sure a good bit of them are still living very comfortably. ain't nothing wrong with that.
hell, i'm happy with what he's given so far. i just wish i had a way to thank the man for all the laughs he's given me over the years, from encino man all the way up to monkeybone.
you're off to a great start with that username, man.
it's been established that it wasn't actually woody, but probably some poor movie promoter who's never been on this site before.
i would mail it to his agent. they will forward it to him.
this is the part i can't understand, why wouldn't it adjust if his income has gone down. can't he appeal this?
i swear some women only wanna marry so they can get something out of the relationship after it has ended in flames. aka alimony.
i've never seen/heard of that happening, got any good examples?
she isn't a stalker. she's a chef. do you like doughnuts? her latest post is all about doughnuts.
nope. just william shatner. (shatner sometimes goes on /r/williamshatner
but brendan wasn't a lesser celebrity until his personal problems completely eclipsed his potential. this guy is so insanely talented (physical comedy, drama, action-adventure) plus his leading-man good looks, he should have at least been on the level of school ties co-stars like matt damon and ben affleck. anyone who looks at the timeline can see how much the divorce affected him. its a fucking travesty.
*sigh...* see, i said there's no getting to him. he's too deep in.
that's because nobody actually gave a shit about the movie.
yeah, the bureau of land management called dibs probably.
no idea. all i know is what the articles post and who knows the accuracy. but he went to get the alimony adjusted and i guess the judge denied it or something like that.
his story gets so much worse then that. the podcast with joe rogan is really good and he talks all about it. he had to live seperated from his wife for a year (required by law for a divorce here), while she spent all his money going on lavish trips and just overall spending out of control. nothing he could do except watch either. poor man, i feel for him.
i like the chris rock bit, though. just because you're *accustomed* to something doesn't mean you're entitled to it. as chris said, the man is *accustomed* to having sex with his wife. she's not going to be forced to have sex with him after a divorce, because that would be crazy right? so the idea that being accustomed to something and are therefore entitled to it doesn't really hold any water.
that's funny because she is literally a nobody. her most known film (aside from the pity role in george of the jungle) was reality bites, which she isn't even credited for on its imdb page for her stupid 2 lines.
fantastic beasts was touting 100% but it landed in the 70s.
holy shit that's amazing. he posted to trek and had like 67 upvotes
true. so was it not even him? was it a pr guy just trying to get publicity for the movie?
it's amazing that his wife has the legal right to maintain a certain standard of living but he doesn't. it's so sexist, like you're a man provide for yourself. you're a woman, don't worry your ex-husband can do it at great personal and financial cost.
did you disown your mother. shit like this ruin lives.
as a woman, this fucking sucks. i hate women who do this shit. fuck you if you're like that. i wish i was a judge. i'd be so fucking fair in shit like that. smh oh, your husband makes x amount and you don't have a job? too bad. go get a job. i'm not giving you 900,000/a year. it only costs 250k from birth to 18 to raise a child." fuck bitches that do that shit. :
yeah. i mean, i can understand if the child is in some high end school, it can make sense to continue payments to maintain that level of education or whatever, but if your husband is famous and you're not, it makes no sense why you would get to continue living in mansions after you get divorced. you're separating yourself from the breadwinner, you get no bread. it used to make sense ages ago when society had women more dependent upon men and losing your husband meant you lost your income but today it's super outdated. it might even make sense to argue that she became a housewife instead of a career woman and now it's too late to make up for lost time or whatever but to assume she could have raked in ~1m a year or to factor that in but ignore his change in income is ludicrous.
i guess mark where ww is now and check in a month or so.
dunno. i really didn't buy it, given that most accounts say he's a nice, humble sort of guy in person.
i would add - also as a woman - there seems an underlying bias suggesting women are helpless/incapable of supporting themselves in these kinds of decisions. i mean, i'd understand if the relationship was horribly abusive or the husband walked out suddenly. in that case, the wife is going to need some time to sort herself out. plus, i completely support the equal division of marital resources as an acknowledgement of the behind the scenes labour a wife (or stay-at-home-husband/unicorn) does which makes their so's extraordinary achievements possible. but paying $900k a year *after* the marriage for another decade or something... there should be a provision to help the partner get on their feet, but this is insane. what else can it say but "you're nothing but a trophy wife and have no hope of surviving on less than $1million a year"?
alimony doesn't even cover child support. that's a whole other mess of payments.
no it's not true, he was dealing with the divorce in a connecticut court.
ah, okay. i never knew about the whole thing until recently. i agree that he is incredibly talented.
that too and i understand it's a case by case issue. however just because some one is awoman doesn't mean they should get special treatment and have to live off of some one else's hard work etc. his wife is a disgusting human being.
i was wondering when someone was going to pint this out.
very long hours. because i love to sleep. i like sleeping more than most of my siblings. so staying awake and working long, long hours is very difficult.
freezing cold. but the people are lovely, so that makes up for it.
the one time was in series 3, episode 8, when i was supposed to laugh anyway - when arya cracked up laughing at the news of her dead aunt - and i was watching funny videos on my phone, so i giggled endlessly, and they liked it, and so did the audience.
season 3. at the season 3 premiere, we went to the chinese theater in los angeles, and stepping out of the car, with hundreds of people screaming my name, is when i realized that this show completely changed my life. it was very, very daunting - i found it quite scary - but it happened gradually, so i had time to get used to it.
being recognized in the street. i used to enjoy being quite anonymous, and now i have to kind of be aware that people know who i am sometimes. rory is quite similar to the hound before breakfast, in that, if he hasn't eaten, he's kind of grumpy! haha! but i love 'im regardless.
not yet! but i'm hoping to steal one in the future, so i can keep it for myself!
ehm... oooh, if i was the queen of westeros, the first rule... i would make everyone a wildling, because i think their costumes are really cool! it's probably the most shallow answer *ever*, but it's true.
i don't get to see the dogs anymore. but after my dog (who played nymeria) finished playing nymeria, she actually went on to play shaggy dog, and they dyed her. she was the best behaved dog out of all of them, so she ended up playing all the other wolves, even though she was mine originally. yeah. it's cool!
there's actually a scene in the coming season... which was my most difficult scene to film. and i think fans are going to be really excited about it. more emotional than we've seen arya in previous seasons.
i like jazz, because it doesn't matter what shape or size or length your legs are, you can use this dance to benefit you. yeah. it's good for all shapes and sizes, i guess.
no, that is still definitely the weirdest fan encounter that i've had. i tell people about it all the time, it was so funny.
audrey hepburn. and i don't know if i'd even want to do anything? i'd probably just want to sit and stare at her for a bit, because i think she's really cool. i'd be starstruck. embarrassing stuff, really. but it'd be worth it.
my favourite subject when i was at school (apart from the usual drama and english) was mathematics, and it was really hard to juggle school & work. and... i sort've... this is a tricky question - school took a bit of a back-seat, and i took my opportunities in live, and hopefully in the future, if i go down a different back, i can go back, get my grades, my certifications, and go and do something else if i want to.
all the time. i thought taylor swift's new song said "something-something-starbucks-lovers" when it actually said "i've got a long list of ex-lovers" and that was news to me. and i realized i'd been embarrassing myself for like 2 months!
i've watched a walk-through with my brother, and our next mission is to play the game, and i'm really looking forward to it, because the walk-through was *insane.*
me and my brothers enjoy playing a computer game called "amnesia" which is *really* scary! we haven't completed it yet, but we're close.
i'm allowed to watch the show. i'm not around when they shoot the more adult scenes. but yeah, i watch the show, i enjoy it, and i feel like i'm a bit of a fan of the show.
because... it's kind of the only song that anyone can sing, no matter how good or bad their musical talent is. and it's just really catchy. and i just like doing it to animals. and they quite hate me for it, but it's funny. like, i did it with a ladybird in a vine. and immediately afterwards, it flew away. which was very sad.
i haven't read the books. and i didn't read them before i got the role. i do want to read them but i'm going to wait until the season is finished. but i can't wait to see what really happens to arya! yes!
we are very close friends. i saw him when i was at the sag awards at the week-end, and it was really nice to see him again, and i hope that's not the last i see of him.
um... i would like to work with... i really admire charlize theron, but i don't know if i'd want to work with her, because i'd be hugely intimidated, but i think she's a fantastic actress.
heheheehee! i think as i've grown up, as arya's growing up, there's definitely similarities between us. and it's been really helpful for her personality to change as i've gotten older. and it's been great for me to make the transition into being an adult actor with the same character. and i still look at chickens and think they're delicious, haha!
the last of us movie is in very early days. i have spoken to powerful people who are getting the last of us on its feet. and i'm hopeful that i can play ellie in the future, but we'll all have to wait and see.
i came in, like 2 weeks ago, and one of my baby tortoises - one of the youngsters, if people follow my account, they'll know i had 3 little ones being born - and one of 'em was upside down in his dish, and i thought he'd drowned, cuz he was so little, and i went over and picked him up, and he was just in his waterfowl! i don't know how he did that, they're pretty study, but he was just floating around upside-down in his dish. and his head was out of the water, so he was fine. i nearly cried, and then i realized he was fine! i was like "goddamnit stevie, don't do that to me!"
ehm... i don't want to offend anyone... is there anything i find odd? you drive on the wrong side of the roads, in my opinion.
pffffffbbbbbbt. ehm. what would i name the first city on mars? mar-zipan! i find marzipan quite disgusting, but that was the first thing that came into my head.
my favourite music... ehm... is probably like drum & bass, and bass lines? and the tv i watch at the moment, i don't have a lot of time to watch tv. so probably as i said earlier, the great british bake-off. i religiously watch that.
i'd love to work in the theater! i was recently talking to emilia clarke, who's another actress on the show, about what it was like being onstage, so yeah, in the future, i hope that crosses my path.
yeah, i would love the hound to live, because i'd love to work with rory again. so in an ideal world, yeah, the hound is still alive, in maisie's opinion. i wanted to be... well, when i was like *really* little, i went through my old books i did at school, and on the first page, one of them says "when i grow up i want to be" and there's a little picture of me being skateboarder. yeah! and then i grew up and wanted to be a dancer. and then i started acting!
i go with lemon & herb, but i get the medium sauce. and occasionally, if i'm feeling daring, i go with the wing roulette, and burn the mouth!
um... pepperoni with some extra pepperoni, and then sprinkle it with some pepperoni. yeah! my absolute favourite.
it would be... halloumi cheese, because i think it's probably the best thing that has to be invented. but it has to be grilled. it's like rubbery, and squeaky, like cheesy bacon. you should try it. it's really salty. amazing.
manuca honey, lemon, and hot water! or just like, *loads* of green tea. but that's just me every day.
1.) i would love to play... cersei, because she's badass. 2.) ehm - i think... bronn (tyrion's left hand man) would do a really good job? cuz he's funny! 3.) ehm...oooh! if i had a super-power... i can't think of anything? oh! probably shape-shift. 4.) dancing. that was kind of my career path before acting, but yeah. things change. and now i'm acting. 5.) green!
muesli. but only the special kind from waitrose. it's like the green stuff. it has to be that one, otherwise i won't eat it. very specific.
first of all, thank you for staying up so long, that's really really nice of you! and after game of thrones, i'd love to continue in television, and i'd love to move on to movies as well. i don't really know what i want to do? but i think that's quite cool, because i'm only 17 and i don't have to decide yet. but definitely staying in performing. she's absolutely fantastic. she's probably one of the funniest girls i know. and i'm so glad that i met her. it's very difficult. i'm madly in love with him. and it's quite - everybody has a crush on him. but i'd never tell him. oh well, now the internet knows. hahahaha! oh! i would love to fight 100 little duck-sized hounds. because i'd never in my life looked down on rory, and that would be an interesting situation.
star wars. i used to watch it a lot with my dad, and my siblings. and star trek, i just never really got into it, i guess. and keep liking arya, because i have a good feeling about her! okay, i will add it to my list of films to watch when i'm bored.
it'd be pretty cool to kill a white walker. but i don't know how much good that would do, because like 6 million of 'em would gang up on her. but that would be on arya's bucket list - to kill a white walker.
i would go... to... i'd probably, like, go to the 1960's? so i could've grown up in the 80's. because that would be fun. so be born in the 1960's.
i can really badly speak french and german. i would love to learn french & german more, but i'm just really bad at learning languages. like, *why do words have genders?* it confuses me. a lot. like it's just -- what?! a table? i don't get it. anyway...
i don't know why he chose me? i guess i was just the right look, and fitted the role, and i'm very thrilled they did choose me. and yeah, now it's kind of blown up and completely changed my life, so thank you george!
greetings from iceland, i'm glad you enjoyed your stay :d
it's cold 10 months of the year and mild the other 2! we're a sound bunch alright, thanks for answering!
oh man, that was so perfect. your response was executed so well, and your laughter was so contagious. i couldn't stop laughing myself.
this is by far the most damning piece of evidence that you're a teenage british girl and that victoria can perfectly voice a person through text.
you'll understand when you're older.. bants.
how many times a day on average does someone recognize you on the street? do you embrace the kinds of attention in every day life, or does it eventually become to wear you down somewhat?
i bet rory eats every fookin chicken in the room for breakfast
tommen would outlaw beets, so you're doing a bit better than him so far.
wow all wolves were played by 1 dog? thats awesome
if that is the weirdest fan encounter you've ever had, i would say you're pretty lucky judging by today's standards. o_o
elon musk has said in interviews "if you have a good idea, go for it college will still be there." i think the same applies to you. you've had (and do have!) incredible opportunities ahead of you and you can always go back to complete college.
she doesn't say "starbucks lovers"? are you shitting me?!
so, maisie williams' metaphorical brass balls are bigger than mine in *and* out of game of thrones.
no love for the walrus? #hot4trott it's so awesome to see arya is a fan!
this gave me an image of arya and the hound sitting at a tavern watching the mountain vs the viper live on tv and being more engaged by the outcome than any fan watching the show
what you don't realize is that ladybird couldn't sing, and was very sad and jealous. but you gave it hope. it didn't just fly away, it traveled the world, watching every broadway show. and years later, when you least expect it, you'll wake up to a ladybird singing the lion king intro song.
judging by the rate at which martin's working, you'll probably get to act out what happens to arya before we get to read it.
aidan's back now. everyone wants to say thank you very much. d'you have anything to say? *for reddit!* i did it for reddit! - aidan
*savoury pies, come on victoria let's not translate her words to american. let the letter u run free!
(*remembers when tobey maguire was spiderman*) (*single tear falls downs cheek*)
she's answered two questions in a way i thought was interesting: someone asked what her favorite type of music was and she said "drum beats and bass lines" which is a different type of answer, and this one as well -- she answered what sport she enjoys doing when i feel like most people would interpret this question as what sport do you enjoy watching. i'm way over thinking this but i thought both of these answers were interesting!
one of my friends summed up bake off perfectly: it gives you all the drama you'll ever want but it the end the worst thing that has happened is someone's cake hasn't risen.
so you can say you have plenty of experience dealing with hounds?
you wish you had your tortoise emojis on reddit right now, don't you..
you should totally check out game of thrones. i'll let you borrow my hbo go password if you'd like.
yes when you are doing a reddit ama that is how you know you've made it.
since i'm assuming victoria is answering....that would be wing roulette - although may lead to ring roulette in six to eight hours....
oh god. i was born in cyprus and apparently as a toodler i didn't each much else. halloumi is love. the squeaky cheese. the cheese that grills. bouncy happiness! my mum still barbecues it sometimes.
that's sounds like something i'd dream up if i were drunk and pillaging the kitchen.
shape shifting, of course! very appropriate. thank you for answering my qestions, enjoy the ama and good luck with everything! :)
quite amused by victoria's struggles to figure out what exactly the alien british things maisie's referring to are. i can completely relate. it's "waitrose".
it's okay, he already knows you have a crush. it is known.
well, a table is male because of... the long... wooden... legs? great, now the rest of the day i will wonder why (in german) a couch is female but a chair is male and a sofa is genderless.
for me, i thought it was that and her just reacting to overwhelming absurdity of her recent past. it was perfect for her character and a real window into the kind of person she'd become - she'd finally fully accepted the nihilism of westeros.
she always puts titles in all caps for some reason, so i imagine celebrities screaming the names of movies.
been on reddit 2+ years and still don't understand people who ask follow up questions to ama:ers even though they only answer top level comments.
beets should be outlawed though! all hail king tommen!
i thought she said 'star crossed lovers' as in romeo and juliet..
the series will probably go through 3 reboots before that happens.
*remembers when willem dafoe was green goblin, alfred molina was doc ock, and james franco was harry osborne* *three tears* *remembers when eric forman was venom* well i feel better now
she looks just like one of the characters, might be off putting.
haha first time i had haloumi was when a cyprian friend made me a ham/turkey/haloumi toasted sandwich (y)
poor vicky. or maybe she's called tori. or ictor. ...probably not ictor.
everyone in the world, male, female, and trans, has a crush on pedro.
what are the chances that this dog gets an oscar before leo?
gaben wins. he just steps forward, spreads his arms and begins to glow slightly. he then begins to stroke his beard and whispers "confirmed". the mountains eyes then melt out of his eye sockets as the crowd falls to their knees chanting "three! , three! , three!"
the human race will go though 3 planets before that happens.
okay you've convinced me. buying it right now. be jealous of my first time experience.
i like how you named every actor by their real name except for topher grace who'll always be the scrawny little neighbor boy.
is it common drinking tea with milk? in portugal we only do drink it with sugar.
did you know peter jackson is the santa that stabs simon pegg?
grrm real good at loading those chekov's and leaving em lying around.
stay the fuck away from spoilers you're in for an amazing ride. don't look up anything online, just enjoy. the last of us is easily the best game i've ever played.
i'd say about 95% of people drink their tea with milk over here. but i just made that statistic up based on personal experience.
and that cate blanchett is the (masked) girlfriend of simon pegg's character?
the whole series is an arsenal. in the basement. which is prone to flooding.
i've never agreed with a comment more. i actually sent an email to naughty dog after i finished thanking them for making such an amazing game.
guess most of the people here are talking about black tea. because nobody would drink a fruit or pepermint tea with milk
rory mccann, who plays the hound, also played as lurch in hot fuzz.
and that simon pegg's character is played by the same guy who plays simon pegg's character in shaun of the dead.
same as in shaun of the dead. the entire plot of the movie is broken down when simon pegg outlines the plan. the idioms he uses are the major plot points of the movie.
yeah, in the uk people just drink tea. there's no fancy names for it, it's just tea. however elsewhere in the world (like the states for example) people would call the "just-tea" that we drink "orange pekoe".
i didn't need any funds. the united nations refugee organization took care of all travel arrangements for displaced persons like myself. at that time the united states admitted 200,000 displaced persons from europe.
the trials were secret and we didn't know the results until 50 years later when gorbachev came to power. the kgb made lists of suspects who were tortured into signing prepared confessions and then were sent to the gulags or to be executed, usually standing on the edge of a ditch and receiving a bullet in the back of the head.
from putin's point of view, it's inadmissible that ukraine should join nato. the united states became involved because it was a signatory together with russia and ukraine to the agreement that ukraine surrenders the nuclear weapons on its territory in exchange for guaranteeing its borders. the majority of people in crimea prefer to be part of russia rather than ukraine. therefore, the question is very complex and if one considers history and the different requirements of the parties, i do not see any reasonable solution.
my biggest accomplishment aside from starting my business would be staying married to the same woman for 61 years. the scariest part about life in the soviet union was that people like my father would disappear with no explanation.
my first meal was pretty horrible food on the ship coming here. the captain was a frenchman who spent most of the food money on dramamine for the refugees. whatever we ate was full of celery and 65 years later i still cannot stand it. in the ussr i was used to eating anything that was available. i was overwhelmed by the availability and choice of food in an american supermarket.
i think that the choice we have is the worst since i came to the united states in 1949.
it was the availability of books on different philosophies and points of view. when i went to the library i didn't know which book to read first and i just stood there.
the syrian refugees are victims of religious fanatics. the refugees from communism were victims of political fanatics. while the motivations are different, they both come from fanatics who do not value human life. when i came i did not experience any backlash; i was more anti-communist than anybody here.
the project was classified as "confidential" not "secret". after i became a citizen i got confidential clearance that permitted me to work on these projects.
he was executed because he was corresponding with his parents in romania and any correspondence with a foreign country made one suspected of being a spy. 50 years after his disappearance, a letter from the kgb informed us of his execution and also that he was being "posthumously rehabilitated", admitting that he was innocent.
the propaganda there aimed to make one a slave while the propaganda here aims to make one a fool.
yes, the propaganda was incessant telling us that this was the best country in the world and there was no information about any other countries. i believed it until i was 10 years old and my father disappeared without a trace in the gulags.
you may find answers to your question in my first book, a red boyhood. in the soviet union the citizens were terrorized by the government and could be made to disappear without any court oversight. in regards to snowden, i can't visualize a country functioning if every citizen could decide what is appropriate and what should be published based on their personal beliefs. the american judicial system is based on punishing acts that have already happened. the challenge now is to be able to prevent these acts from happening in the first place. this means that the government has to know what people are thinking. the difference is that suspects here are still entitled to their day in court.
well socialism is a very comforting idea that someone is going to take care of you. it is not compatible with the american idea of meritocracy and does not encourage initiative and effort.
bernie sanders didn't provide a good answer about how he was going to finance his plans. his ideology itself is fine in theory: he'll take care of everything and everyone. however, it would eliminate incentives for individual achievement.
initially people were shocked because these police leaders were considered to be exemplary communists. the next emotion was schadenfreude that now the executioner will be executed. very few believed that the terrible things happening were necessary for the future. however, people were afraid to say their true opinions. when asked what was the tallest building in town, some said it was the fire tower while others said this wasn't so, the tallest building was the kgb headquarters because from there you could see siberia.
for those who don't know, the holodomor was an artificially created famine in the ukraine. the kgb did not allow bringing grain from other parts of the soviet union where it was available and was even exported abroad. in the ukraine, they took all of the smart peasants and sent them to siberia or killed them because they did not want to join the collective farms. the ones who remained didn't know what to do and were placed into these disorganized and chaotic collective farms. at the same time, an american correspondent named walter duranty from the new york times received a pulitzer prize in 1932 for his reports that there was no famine in the ukraine. this caused people in the united states to be unaware of the famine. there are various estimates as to the total number of people who died and they vary from 5 to 8 million.
religion was prohibited in the ussr so i wasn't raised as any particular religion. as a child i remember playing with crystals from the church chandeliers that were dumped by the authorities who were going to use the church for grain storage.
to those who wish to embrace communism, i would advise that they read the black book of communism published by harvard university press. to those who want to embrace socialism, they should first figure out who is going to pay for it.
i escaped to the american zone of west germany and there was plenty of information. i developed my "american dream" from reading american books which were reprinted in the soviet union only when the books were criticizing the united states. however, they still shed some light as to what was going on. for example, reading the grapes of wrath by steinbeck, i couldn't understand how people who owned a truck could be considered poor.
i never participated in any black market, if only because i had nothing to sell. everyone knew what was going on and the police welcomed it because it was a source of bribe income for them.
stalinism was not unique if you consider mao and pol pot. i do not believe in unrestrained capitalism. just reading the business section of the newspaper, one can daily see the unethical or criminal behavior of some companies and executives.
the idea of the united states is based on individual achievement. while a social safety net is required for those who temporarily or permanently cannot take care of themselves, a permanent "nanny state" would kill the incentives for individual achievement. in reality it is not a continuum, you can have some of both systems. it just depends on the proportions.
being the son of an "enemy of the people" was no fun and i lied whenever possible that my father had died rather than telling them he disappeared in the gulags.
not op, but i am russian. in my opinion - both should stop fucking in other countries problems. both should stop propagandizing that it's better in their country and worse in the other. the cold war itself stopped, but we still have some icicles left to melt. both counties seem hellbent on not doing it.
my great grandfather was a violinist and he studied with shostakovich in st. petersburg. my grandmother told me stories when i was little about how everyone turned away from him when he "fell out of favour" with the government but they still remained friends with my great grandfather, but he had his own troubles because he was jewish and proclaimed a "cosmopolitan" so perhaps he wasn't concerned that being friends with shostakovich would be the most damning thing in his biography. it's interesting how despite all those troubles he remained deeply grateful to the communist regime, it's a fascinating time to study.
there is none, the us is the greatest country in history
yes, every time i hear the phrase "political correctness" i think of the people in the soviet union who were killed because they said something that was not politically correct.
someone must have killed those 20 million people in the soviet union, 65 million in china and others in cambodia and soviet satellite countries. according to the black book of communism, published by harvard university press, the total number of victims of artificial famines, executions, and gulags is close to 100 million people.
no, because the brutal dictatorship has been replaced by a milder dictatorship.
every other question was almost the same thing, worded differently. i would've really liked to see this one answered
i blame communism which called for extermination of capitalists as a class regardless of the guilt or innocence of an individual. karl marx wrote, "the last capitalist we hang will be the one who sold us the rope." the nature of the ideology was based on the extermination of its opponent. consider lenin, stalin, mao, and pol pot.
if you remember, were there people that were horribly off-key, or people just didnt care and were happy to be singing?
i laughed after scrolling back up at his or her name.
do you think the us and/or european countries should take in syrian refugees?
idk if you've seen the tv series "the americans" but there is an episode that deals with a sham trial and a summary execution. i wonder how realistic this was in 1983?
amazing answer. i am really happy to see a person with an actual knowledge of the conflict.
as sergei korolev(the guy that designed r7 rocket and sputnik and was in gulag before that) used to say "'we are all going to be whacked and there will be no obituary" it was referring to people simply disappearing without a trace in the ussr after being targeted as "enemy of the state"
that reminds me of a famous photo of yeltsin browsing the produce section of a grocery store in my hometown of houston circa 1990. apparently he insisted on an unplanned side trip to inspect an american supermarket. he looks a bit flabbergasted in the photo. this is a great ama, keep the answers coming!
do you feel any guilt about developing weapons designed for mass murder of your (former?) soviet countrymen? i mean these are people you grew up with as a child. did you ever stop to think about it?
posthumously rehabilitated. . . . . interesting phrasing sir, sorry for your loss.
the great depression was very real. uk was real fucked up at that time, like the worst we've ever been.
rather disappointing and shocking answer,considering an escape from where a select few got to make rules.
before i get lynch'd, here in venezuela i've seen people waiting just that. socialism was the government's single-party excuse to gift nice things to those who supported them and keep the votes going. nowadays the same people are in the government and money is magically disappearing, drugs being trafficked by familiars of high politicians, and those who worked for the government, grabbing the money and fleeing to the usa to escape all the crises going on.
oof, there's a lot of people on this site who are not going to like that answer.
it's almost as though atlas shrugged was based on some real country.
the black book of communism is given little respect in academia, it's like getting an ardent dogmatic stalinist to write about holodomor or a neo-nazi to write about the holocaust, not exactly a good source for information.
i can see why the soviet union would allow the publication the the grapes of wrath. its an explicitly socialist book.
you talk about the horrific crimes of pol pot, how do you feel about the large amount of support he received from the us government and cia?
on the american side of the fence, it seems that we could get along, but if we did decrease any pressure then putin or a different russian leader would annex another former soviet country which we *really* find unacceptable. any expansionist russian move at all would be unacceptable to the us and all of europe. putin says he's not interested in an expansionist or imperialistic policy "like the us". but then says 95% of the people in the next place to be annexed are interested and does it. and so it gives us the current situation. perpetual war mongering. perpetual missile defense shields. perpetual threats to cut off gas to europe (which almost never happens because russia needs the money). what do you think, i would like a different perspective.
i'd love to see what proportion of your upvotes came from people seeing it as sarcasm and what proportion was from people who are reading literally.
i found that question really odd. putin is still an authoritarian.
they sang for themselves rather than for an audience.
i don't think he'll respond because that's a loaded question. he'll get flamed for either choice
"the americans" is loosely based on a real russian spy couple. i can't comment on the accuracy of details, but i have read that the nature of much of the show's content is, if not accurate, at least plausible.
whenever i try and explain to people that a majority of people in crimea legitimately prefer being part of russia i just get called a putin shill :(
in other words soviet union was founded by biggest and most ruthless mafia in history.
i believe seeing the availability of all the food and the fact that normal people dressed in regular clothes came in and bought stuff without anyone bothering them shattered his world view of the soviet union.
the incredible luxury of food choice is lost on the vast majority of the first world.
i did not feel any guilt because i was trying to prevent the soviet union from bringing their system to the rest of the world. i felt that my work was defensive rather than offensive.
the use of language to obfuscate guilt, intent, or reality versus official interpretation. sort of like 'political correctness' is really just 'tyranny with manners'.
the people that committed those crimes are long dead.
good news comrade, with trump as president, you may yet!
meanwhile, the soviet union experiences massive famines where millions and millions of people starved to death. "awful" is a relative term.
i think he is saying that if you do expose it, be prepared to go to court. this is based on the "i can't visualize......based on their personal beliefs." line.
when you have the perspective he has, i imagine things that enrage us don't enrage him.
haha my dad liked that answer, and then was like, "you didn't already know that answer?" he's also a communist-escaper, different country and much later, but yeah.
rand did, iirc, herself escape from the ussr. her entire philosophy is based on her revulsion for communism - it's more "vehement anti-collectivism" than "absolute individualism."
and steinbeck's later work was slanted the other way - because he lived long enough to see the brutalities of the matured movement. he even offered to inform for the feds against the american communist party.
i think it depends on what you call "communism." many libertarian socialists point to things like the revolution in catalonia or the anarchists in ukraine as an example of "communism" but what they mean by communism is completely different than what the soviet union would call communist. ultimately they are separate ideas, but have a common word and heritage from the 1848 revolutions and the thinking that happened around then.
well, crimea for me is a touchy subject - i just returned from there a couple of weeks ago and been there every summer for the last 6 years. the way i heard it - people seceded from ukraine and then joined ukraine. people seemed pretty comfortable with the situation when i was there. the problem is - both countries have interests that are... questionable. us constantly invades some middle east countries, russia constantly shows the middle finger to the whole world. whenever one does something - another criticizes it, even if they've done it before (syria comes to mind). what bothers me most is the amount of money they waste on military. we are supposed to live in the age of peace and friendship - but we waste so much on all that weaponry, we could destroy half the world even with no nukes. both countries seem to not want it, even though we could.
he may be an authoritarian but it's not even close to the brutality under stalin
i had a hungarian roommate who talked to herself loudly all the time (in hungarian). one time she screamed something with panic and desperation in the kitchen. i thought some accident was happening so i burst out of my room and into the kitchen, asked her what happened, and she replied "i'm all out of potatoes."
this is how music is meant to be. this is how it started. this is what makes music beautiful. thank you.
i'm not sure if it's a canadian thing or just my family but we all sing all the time. my girlfriend also hates it.
i don't think you know what a loaded question is...
the part mentioned that deals with an execution takes place in the soviet union, is separate from the spy couple in the us, and is supposed to be pretty accurate.
that still doesn't mean the way that putin decided to take it back was very diplomatic or constructive.
history is a better story then hollywood could write.
yep, another user linked the article. communism done in by a randall's. pretty amazing stuff.
it's beautiful though in the sense that so many people take this for granted, yet here he was standing in awe of free information and feeling the weight of what that really means.
i think it's depends on your background the most. i once knew a highly decorated american combat veteran. he grew up and fled post war vietnam as a child with his family and witnessed the worst of humanity all the way up to his arrival in america. living in america really opened his eyes and started a life long career in the military because of it. the dude was super appreciated of what a western nation gave him. it made him staunchly anti communist too. on the flip side i went to school with saudis who would shit on america while wearing all american designer clothes and smoking american cigarettes.
that is my opinion too, as a muslim. the stupidest fucking thing i've seen was another pakistani women at the beach, but she was wearing a full black burqa. me and my dad laughed at that.
this guy takes absolutely zero bullshit, i love it
is it me or has the government stopped giving a fuck about the constitution?
i would've imagined they enrage him more since he's seen those tools of government spying misused.
seems to be a common theme amongst escapees from communism. cuban refugees are staunchly conservative (where marco rubio's family comes from)
really? that's fascinating, which books show this change?
the difference is between marxism-leninism and anarcho-communism. marxism-leninism also calls itself "communist" but it's a complete perversion of what communism was originally defined as. anarcho-communism or libertarian socialism or whatever you may like to call it falls more in line with the original idea for communism, anti-state and anti-hierarchy.
stalin is the guy who ate puppies for breakfast. putin is the kid on the playground who bullies smaller kids.
no potato is bad news, die of malnourish. of course, potato bad news too. kgb take potato, send you to gulag. also die.
denmark checking in. you drink nothing but walter.
i whistle all the time. both girlfriend and kids hate it. let a guy be happy damidt!
crimea had been longing for independence from ukraine ever since ukraine popped up as a sovereign state in the early 1990s - and all their 'legislative' efforts had been bluntly sabotaged by the central govt in kiev
the rest of us leftists hate the tankies just as much as the next guy.
if it had been beer then he might not have looked so confused.
americans still have no concept of the plenty they take for granted. i know there are poor in the us - which should utterly shame a nation that has so much
got a very similar story from a old co-worker of mine. that when they came over he did the shopping till he found a job. then the first day on the job he had to leave the office because a super market called him and his wife was crying in an row.
cat food does look pretty good. it's like tuna cans but with variety of flavour.
yep i get it. :) maybe i should have replied that i find it to be a terrible beauty, that the world would be better off overall if nobody could know this particular beauty because literally everybody had it and took it for granted.
most of the saudis i've met abroad and in the us (who i imagine were on the upper-upper echelons of saudi society, and thus not a good representation) were very awful people. extremely materialistic, mysoginist, racist, etc. the elite in many middle eastern countries is just completely depraved.
really? i'm at an extremely liberal college in boston and everyone here is open to discussing cultural views. it's not taboo to criticize things in our home cultures at all - in fact, the vast majority of us acknowledge shortcomings in asian culture. however, i think it's 100% ok to still embrace parts of my heritage while shedding the uglier parts.
how old is he now? i've only seen stuff on youtube but that was from the late 80s.
you could also say that bill cosby is a rapist. did a good bit of raping in his day
i think of it like legal loopholes. regular citizens can get out of a lot of shit through a good lawyer. corporations even more so. with government this escalates to: what's the point of a constitution. for example, my mother asked me about the ability of the president to declare war and i told her that only the congress has the ability to declare war. that granted power is basically meaningless when the president has legal authority to send thousands of troops to iraq. with the nsa some legislative act effectively allows the organization to spy on everyone regardless of constitutionality (for now). there's a lot going on in legislature and it makes it really hard to obey the constitution effectively unless the supreme court gets involved every step of the way.
my dad is pretty conservative too - he was (comparatively) better off in poland in terms of material possessions, but he gladly gave those up to actually be able to advance in his career without signing up to be a party member. ironically, he sees more communism creeping through the cracks here in canada.
well it depends how it's implemented. i live in a social democratic state where the government is actually running a relative tight ship. and i wouldn't dream of anything else. as a warehouse worker i can afford my own apartment, two cars, 5 weeks paid leave every year where i usually travel abroad and i can eat well and live well. all this thanks to the structure set up by a social democratic governance sprinkled with capitalism. norway btw.
i was also born there (poland fyi) and returned many times in the early to mid 90s to see the stunning progress post-communism, and holy hell did it change yearly. my (not blood related) grandfather was in the prl army and was a loyal dreg. he was a good guy to me, but a terrible supporter of the regime, however, turned cheek when he helped my mother escape. he stopped advancing in career rank after that, but got to keep all his current payout (renta) and still be employed. maybe it was just coincidence, not sure, he was also a hardcore drinker. either way, i have a decent view and understanding of it, without directly living *through* it, albeit i was technically born into it (but too young to remember directly). i just didn't put it into a wider scope when i told my dad about it and was surprised at his answer until it sank in.
i think people also forget that most eastern countries that switched to communism were basically just u.s.s.r. backed pseudo-puppet states.
he is more like the kid in the playground that makes kids punch theirself.
american, i sing to myself all the time(typically heavy metal songs such as anything by dear ole ozzy, metallica, iron maiden, old metal essentially!
wtf is a tankie? seen this word like a billion times today
i work with uzbeki woman who said that grocery store had such selection that it was debilitating. she was overwhelmed by the choices and something as simple as buying bread was really confusing. she said her first few trips to the store she left empty handed because she couldn't figure out what all the different products were.
well, to be fair, he did get stupidly drunk. edit, guys, this isnt me being cute, it's a well known story. there's pictures.
dunno, the craft beer market in texas is insane. houston has some good ones with st arnold, karbach and southern star up in conroe.
you know what we need to do? we need some type a system where government provides for everyone and everyone is equal, just like the former soviet union!!
i mean, i've spent 15 minutes staring at toothpaste because they're all identical but different and there's really no way to tell what the difference is. i actually ended up googling reddit dentist amas on my phone in safeway. i get the confusion, and i'm living in this society.
and instead we spend our time looking at pictures of cats.
my university has a bunch of saudi students on exchange, and while they have a lot of money and usually wear pretty nice and expensive clothes, they've all been extremely nice. i had a dinner with around a half a dozen of them, along with some other guys in my arabic class, and we had a great time, and they were willing to go out of their way to help us with arabic and understanding the arab world. it's odd you all have had such a different experience, i feel like mine was practically the opposite.
asian cultures are one of the more acceptable to criticize though, most likely because asians in the u.s. have higher median incomes than european descendants (and higher rates of college completion, lower incarceration rates ect). multiculturalism seems to focus its protective qualities more strongly on cultures deemed "weaker" than the hegemony, and asians just usually aren't seen as that due to how well they do here.
he looked to be in his late 40's, still spits hot fire though.
norway doesn't have socialism. norwegian economy is actually quite deregulated. corporate and capital gains taxes are much lower in norway than the us. trade barriers are lower than us too. norway also has the fifth highest per capita oil wealth in the world. population wise it's barely a city state. governance is much easier as a result. socialist planning is much harder in larger economies. norway's economy is pretty straight forward. sociologially, norwegian population is pretty tight knit. this means collective bargaining amongst unions can be done with little conflict. this also means that norway doesn't need a minimum wage and it doesn't norway and us is apples to oranges comparison.
similar, perhaps, to lighting a single candle in a forest full of dry pine needles, while telling everyone, "my intention is for this candle and this candle alone to burn brightly and illuminate the forest." the candle is communism. the forest fire - and the resultant death and oppression of communist regimes world-wide - is the "matured movement". **edit - thank you for the gold, kind stranger.**
yeah, his mom is gloria vanderbilt. if anyone doesn't know that name, ask your mom.
your razor could be razorier. 1. he's both a member of the lucky sperm club *and* hard-working, meaning he's both (unfairly) present when opportunities arise and (fairly) beats out the other people unfairly benefitted by life's lottery.
while that's true, it's still very rare for a country to actually hold a free and fair election allowing one part of the country to vote on whether to secede. that for me was the biggest wow from the scotland election. irrespective of the vote outcome, i was amazed that the uk government even agreed to conduct the vote.
marxist-leninists. basically anyone who sympathizes with guys like stalin and mao and looks up to the ussr. leftists have a very poor view of them, as does just about everyone else.
my russian father complains about having so many choices at us supermarkets, but at the same time is fascinated by the variety and prices.
wouldn't you too if you saw that plethora of food just out of reach?
but if we don't study them we won't know how to please our overlords when they eventually take over.
well you're partly right but norway still have strong social democratic tendencies because of a powerful labor union, workers rights and state owned corporations to name a few. to be more precise you can define norway as a social democratic state with the nordic economic model. basically the best from socialism merged with the best from capitalism. i'm not saying it is a perfect system because it requires a government that is high functioning and low in corruption. and i'm not comparing it to the us, i'm just putting forward that there isn't something as socialism = bad just as there isn't something as capitalism = bad. that's something many people need to realize, especially those on the far left and right.
this is really a brilliant and elegant description. it shows how obvious consequences, no matter how vehement the denial of intent, are *only ever* the real intent of leadership, or madmen--it goes to the character of the people who advocate for socialism. well done.
this comment made me realise why moon landing conspiracy theorists exist. occam's razor is a double-edged blade.
they did have a vote though (unofficial i believe) and it showed a large majority wanted to be part of russia. what most people don't seem to realize is how unstable ukraine is and who the people leading the country actually are. regardless of where you stand in the conflict you have to acknowledge that some of the ukranians in power are fascists and thus should not be invited to negotiations. then again, this is all about interests and nato would love having a base that close to russia whereas russia is strictly against that. ukraine itself is just a piece in this game.
you think the us is going to annex a bunch of desert and then what? start building walmarts? even if it made any sense politically, economically, legally, diplomatically, ect, they couldn't even occupy iraq, let alone annex it.
it's from the british comedy duo mitchell and webb. they had a sketch comedy show, and in this sketch they're playing ss officers in ww2. and one of the ss officers is having like *doubts* about the whole nazi thing, and he points out how even their own uniforms make them look like villains, because they've got skulls on them. and then he asks "are *we* the baddies?"
although i'm more of a free market guy, i don't have anything against unions. collective bargaining between unions is a great way to set wages. this is the reason why norway doesn't have a minimum wage. unions in the us and india resort to rent seeking. this is as much a problem when corporations rent seek.
according to the ukrainian law, you can't conduct a local referendum in an isolated part of the country deciding its faith. there should be a national referendum where everyone votes on a particular decision. setting aside the fact that it was a well-planned military takeover followed by an attempt to legitimize it with a vote that was "supervised and protected" by the russian military (i'm definitely not an expert on international law, but i think it's not allowed to conduct referendums during military conflicts for self-explanatory reasons), russian stance is extra-hypocritical because similar movements for independence are absolutely illegal in russia and historically have been suppressed by force (tatarstan, chechnya, etc.).
agree there. collective bargaining is in my view perhaps the most important aspect of a well functioning economy. strong unions are necessary promote the interests of the working and middle class and to balance out the profit interests of the companies
steven: the whole five years that we were together. every moment. it was magic. it was really magic. we couldn't do wrong and it was excitement 25 hours, 8 days a week. so, just being a part of those guys was great. it was like i was part of the cool kids in school. deanna: that was his family. when he was in a band, that was his family. and that was okay. steven: assholes. [laughter]
steven: when we played the street scene in 1986, downtown la. there were 100,000 people in the streets, outside, and we started playing. literally not 10s, or 100s, thousands of people were spitting on the stage at us. i was in the back, so i wasn't getting hit. the coolest thing was, nobody in the band got pissed off , they started spitting back at them. it was one of those moments like "holy shit! what am i doing here? how did i get here? and why is this so awesome!" deanna: i'm so glad i wasn't there. steven: that and playing with the rolling stones at the coliseum was pretty fucking cool!
steven: practice, practice, practice. repetition makes the master. stay away from alcohol and drugs and you can't lose. deanna: i agree with steven, especially about staying away from alcohol and drugs. he practices every single day. steven: alcohol and drugs are a waste of time. deanna: 3-4 hours a day he practices, even now. steven: that is because i love to play. always practice and play with everybody and anybody you can.
my michelle imo is the best g n r song they released. if you are scrolling, and have not heard this song, youtube it. nice, heavy guitar and drumming. sick rhythm
obviously steven answered, but personally i miss the... chaos of it? all the rock bands around today, even the metal bands, seem relatively tame. maybe i've just read too many stories (i was just a kid in the 80's). but it seems like there was so much more excess back then. huge shows, crazy times, tons of energy, just everything about it seemed bigger than life.
steven: it was a dream come true. every musician that i can imagine, having a friend that was as talented as slash was and being able to be a part of him and his life and us doing it together was just so fun and so magical. everything in our lives just fell into place. it's not like we had to do anything extraordinary. we just woke up in the morning and did what we did and it just worked. it was magic. deanna: i didn't really know slash when he was young because steven was living with his grandmother and so they hung out together, of course. but i don't really have any stories about him. steven: it's funny, i was the bad influence on slash. i'm the one who got him to start ditching school. and turned him onto rock 'n roll.
steven: all i know is that the gods of rock are pissed! i think i am afraid rock and roll might be dead. there are just no great bands out there. the last great band that i know of was the foo fighters, and that was 25 years ago. deanna: i don't believe it will ever die. when he was playing in the 80s, we would go on sunset blvd and see all these guys with the black leather jackets steven: but that was the 80s, this is 2017. music is completely different now. it sucks! deanna: a few weeks ago we were going down sunset blvd. there are so many young people. i don't think it will ever die. what goes around comes around, it's always gonna be there. i still listen to oldies but goodies. good music comes back.
steven: back off bitch, don't cry, you can be mine, coma, civil war.
why do you ask? because the lyrics "with your bitch-slap rappin' and your cocaine tongue you get nothin done" are on the liner notes of appetite?
steven: losing those years to the hard drugs and alcohol! it was a waste of time.
steven: hi u/fuck_you_in_the_valley this one girl, right after a show, i was walking to the bus and this one girl got so excited to see me that she jumped on me and pulled my back out. i had to miss like 10 shows because she hurt my back.
steven: my favorite person that i have ever met was steven tyler, from aerosmith. nobody that i met has disappointed me. everybody that i looked up to was already as cool as i thought there would be.
steven: the most important was love, support, and not giving up on me. no matter what an asshole i was, she didn't give up on me. deanna: i'm so happy that steven is clean and happy now and that's a miracle. you can never give up on your child. i want people to read the book "sweet child of mine," i think it will inspire people never to give up on their child.
steven: every single one of them. i still play the ones that i recorded the demo tapes i helped write on "use your illusion". at least 12, 13 of those. i'll still practice to those because i love them so much, but obviously, i play em my way, which is the right way. deanna: steven is the greatest drummer in the world. he is my king. he is the best. steven: i'm the biggest asshole you're ever gonna fuckin meet. [laughter] deanna: no son, don't say that.
i asked him about his set up. he plays a brand called soultone cymbals. never heard of them but i'm gonna get some now.
steven: my favorite songs, like i said earlier, were kiss, queen. i loved disco. i loved jazz. i love 70's rock. i love 60's rock. just music that made me feel good, that i still listen to today and i still practice today. it's so cool. you just go on the internet and get 70's hits, ya know, a collection of all these different 70's songs. and i went this one, this one this one, and i picked all these different ones, so i got all these great songs i practice to and they're such great songs 'cause they're stories about something that's meaningful. nowadays, i listen to these bands and for one, you can't understand what they're saying, two it doesn't mean anything. i just like a good story and something that makes my heart feel good. and then 30, 40 years later i listen to it and i still get that euphoria. i love rock.
steven: dude, i'm sure you kickass if you've been playing that long. keep practicing. repetition makes the master, as i say many times, which is true. what's my favorite drum beat i came up with? there's "rocket queen, there's "welcome to the jungle", there's "mr. brownstone". deanna: "paradise city" i like. steven: "paradise city" is a great one. every song i recorded with them i love. it was my favorite. deanna: and because he loves them i love them all too.
steven: hi saffron, thank you very much! i appreciates that. my favorite bands and my influential drummers were roger taylor from queen, peter criss from kiss. pretty much any 60's, 70's drummers because in the 60's is first when they started using jazz drumming and started turning ti into rock drumming and then the 70s just took it to another level. in the 80s it just went completely out of style until i came around and changed that. deanna: because you are the king! steven: it's good to be king.
i was a little kid the first time i played mega man x5, and that's actually how i discovered gnr
steven: piano because freddie mercury is god! if i could do anything, i would do anything close to being freddie mercury. even if i had to be gay. in fact, i wish i was gay but i just don't have it in me!
adler had nothing to do with that. it was just axl needing a guitarist and slash being available. literally the most obvious thing. no huge offers of money or pressure from the label could make it happen in the past 20 years, they just had to be friends again. and duff was back in the band as soon as tommy left for the replacements reunion in 2014 so it went from there. steven was just called for guest spots like izzy used to do, he's not the full time drummer.
well, his pancreas *did kinda* explode from it so yeah...
steven: thank you brother! i appreciate that! i had so much fun in nashville. my setup is a 22 inch bass drum, 10 14 inch floor toms, 16 18 floor toms, a john bonham snare, soultone cymbals - the finest cymbals made, and i use vater drum sticks 7a. i practice every day!
steven: play with everybody. play every day consistently. the whole game of getting good is practice. if you're gonna play with a band, just practice, practice, practice and everything will just flow together. and if you're playing with somebody that's not cutting it or pulling it off, you either gotta be their friend and say they're going to have to practice a little harder or just keep playing. i recommend play with everybody you can, while you're young. cause the more people you play with, the sooner you're gonna find the right people you should be playing with.
he hasn't been a part of the band for like almost 30 years lol. axl's been talking about releasing the ''second part of chinese'', which is already mostly recorded but has slash & duff adding stuff on it, so that's probably what it's going to be. probably coming next year or the year after that. no chance of steven on it because it's already recorded mostly and he's not a permanent member, it's all frank or brain.
steven: no, my grandmother did. my grandma always said, "a please and a thank you and a nice smile will get you far". deanna: i did it. not my mother. steven: grandma did everything. deanna: i did it. no! she never smiled. steven: she hated everybody, but me. deanna: she only smiled at steven. steven: she hated everybody, but me. deanna: my mother had 14 grandchildren and the only one she cared about was this one, steven. that's the only one. it was amazing. people would see him and they would cry because they are so beautiful. it's true! steven: and this is what you grow up into
they are for the toughest of the tough. i was in nam, iraq and somalia, but the toughest time i had was with my high school marching band. it's like crack.
i would recommend checking out tommy stinson's interviews that mention axl (he's one of the longest running members of gnr, been with axl for 18 years). he called him misunderstood and somewhat of a perfectionist but he wasn't negative about him.
i still watch the "live from the ritz" special from '88 or whatever it was at least once a year. you guys had a very special moment there - there was an energy and danger that was so purely rock & roll - i'm not sure that it's been matched by anyone in the 29 years since... guns wasn't ever nearly as electric in any other incarnation - you five are the real band.
can someone give this context? why were people spitting at them? just genuinely curious, thanks for doing this ama btw :d
off topic but my high school teacher says he knows you almost as a friend i would say, and my teacher use to be in a band called "weeds" i believe, he said he's opened up for you guns n' roses before. i hope this is all true
as a 'michele'...when introducing myself to adults as a child - it never, ever failed that someone would starting singing "michele...my belle." until one day....when someone said, "my, my, my, my michele!" and little me was like, say what now? they told me it was gnr and so i convinced my great grandmother to buy me the album (no grandma, no bad words! it's a song about my name! see? -- oh really? that's very nice. ok, i'll get it for you.) thanks grandma! def my preferred michele jam!
there are lot's of good bands out there. you just have to dig for them.
coma is a great song bro. what type of kit did you have before you made it big, and what did it change to once you had some cash coming in?
when you say terminal drug addiction how many years is that exactly ?
if you worst experience was a fan being that excited to see you i'd generally call that a good thing, but missing 10 shows because of it...dam. thanks for taking the time to hang out with us here.
dude!! me too!! i think i remember reading that he used to run a set of 13" sabian hi hats and a 13" snare... it sounded so awesome
you mean sideways in orientation to the rest of the band mates? also style wise in the article above near the end, jose noted how he hated the look of metal kits with toms tilted towards he player, preferring the aesthetics of a flatter orientation that's easier to rim shot.
please release those demos with your playing if you have them! with all respect to matt who did a fine job, these demos would be the holy grail.
the fact that you can't set appetite to a metronome is one of the (many) reasons i love it. great to see you doing well, like many others here you influenced my decision to start playing the drums.
i've been a soultone player for a couple years, they're really nice.
that was an amazing time for music and it was definitely reflected in the music of gnr.
no offense to any of the other songs, but you're it on mr. brownstone. you make me move every single time.
steve, your in luck. just started a band. talked to the guys. your in!!
it's better than matt sorrum who just grunts and frank ferar who pouts his lips
try and imagine keeping a bunch of drug addicted rockstars from killing themselves, i'm sure that would make anyone cranky, especially when you're already as ornery as axl is... i'm not saying he's not a dick, but i can understand how he's seen as an asshole by his band mates.
i have this on vhs somewhere, unfortunately the expletives are censored out with very loud tones.
i dont know you love, naanuu, and i don't know god but i'm praying for you. heroin killed my family. it's too late to pray for them, but i am with you and here for you every day, man. reach out if you need to. you are amazing.
im so sorry for your loss, and especially for those two kids who lost a father
so after 3 years it still has that much pull on you? do you envision a day when its fully behind you? not having been an addict its just hard to imagine something having that kind of power. much respect for your time clean. i dont mean this to demean but to empower that idea. fighting over 1100 individual daily battles and winning them all is impressive!
serious answer: probably out of respect. punk bands back in the day used to get this all the time, and gnr had strong punk influences.
i too was at that show! best concert i've ever been to! remember the giant inflatable women when the stones played honky tonk women? oh and helicopters flying overhead... (i was pretty drunk, but do remember this)
i was at the first night, when it sounded like axl was breaking up the band. awesome show by all 3 bands. :) thanks for making some of the best music of my youth! glad that you're in a good spot in your life!
what is weird is i thought deanna was saying that he practices drugs 3-4 hours a day.
are u kidding? doctors do it all the time. if you're ever in the hospital and a strange dr. pokes their head in the door and says hi, well you'll be getting a bill for his/her services. guaranteed.
thanks for mentioning this. i've been in the same funk as steven. stuck in the past and having a hard time finding good new bands. these guys are pretty good.
agreed. one of my favs, and loved it at their recent tour. local newspaper review called it a 'filler' song which infuriated me. if they consider that filler, well then keep filling up albums with songs that great and i'm happy.
i liked this song but mtv killed it for me. it was on constant rotation and was played at least once an hour minimum for a month (unless something like "120 minutes" came on). -former mtv addict (it used to be good, really).
terminal is something with perpetuity. as in it goes on indefinitely. you don't just all of a sudden cure a drug addiction. there is an underlying chemical love. one slip up, is much like fucking your ex. you're right back in it (without the tolerance).
yeah so drummers normally face the crowd like everyone else. fishman faced the band instead. brandon, mike and jose were huge phish and primus fans in the 90s. the influence was pretty apparent once i started listening to phish. i think jose also took the maple wooden kit idea from fishman too.
i didn't realize how badly i wanted to hear those demos until right now.
so much great music being made now and the foreseeable future. it's not on the radio or in the record/cd/tape store - it's at our fingertips. just gotta know what to look for. however, if folks are content with the music they grew up with and it makes them happy. good for them.
there will be those who will never cut off connection to their drug-using pothead friends and or associates or even family members. when it hits family members it's time to use power-of-attorney and block them from doing a complete take-over. the bigger the family is the stronger this is so it is obvious.
that's amazing!! congrats! yeah 15 months is the most after a few 6 month periods of sobriety. my life has already changed drastically. just applied to grad school for speech therapy programs! been my plan for many years but of course heroin was first and foremost. but more importantly than any of that, my insides are totally different. i can be with myself, i can live in this world and cope. it's not easy but it really isn't anything compared to the pain and darkness i reached as a junkie. one day at a time. we can do this.
thank you... i'm sorry to hear this is happening to you and the person you love. there's so much pain, all around... that time is a while back for me now, but - i didn't go to al anon, but i got a *lot* of support from soberrecovery.com, where there's a section for friends and family of alcoholics, as well as for people struggling with addiction (just as another option). best of luck to you xoxo
i have no idea how she'd react, but i would definitely appreciate an apology. i think it would be very good to make it clear that you don't want anything from her. she may or may not respond, but you can only try. best of luck to you.
watch the movie pleasure unwoven, on you tube. kevin macalay. best "choice" response i've ever heard.
aa seem to have made people believe that it is the only option thereby contributing to people falling further into addiction and making it harder for addicts to deal with a relapse. aa is causing more alcoholism no doubt in my mind.
just stay away from narconon .its a scientology backed program
good point. i ought to have checked the link. years ago, it used to be 'sober our selves', a peer support network. not sure what the new incarnation is...
thanks for the serious answer. (and to everyone else who answered) it's hard to understand how spitting could be a sign of respect but hey, today i learned something new :)
the worst part about 'nam was the dilophosauruses. they'd sneak up on you from behind, and then shoot you in the back with their ak48s, which were one better than ak47s.
got charged $345 from a dr who was not mine, walk into my room, look at my chart, and walk out. didn't say a word. i asked the nurse later wtf that was and she told me he got the rooms confused and was supposed to be in the room next door to mine. later when i get the bill i don't even know who or what it's for, when i can only guess it's this guy. i call the # on the invoice and tell them to write that shit off as a loss bc if they think i'm paying him $345 for a 10 second mistake he's on crack.
neat fact: the original lyric was "even kurt cobain and axl rose" but then cobain committed suicide so rivers changed the lyric.
same thing happening with us hiphop heads today, older hiphip heads absolutly hate theae mumble rappers today and just want some 90s rap
you're not wrong, (in fact you're right), but alot of this mentality comes from the fact that old school rock and roll is "dead" in the sense that it's gone from the mainstream, or at least not as prevalent. you need to activately look for decent rock bands these days, when for much of the past 50 years you could just turn on the radio and have it handed to you. i disagree with the idea that rock sucks these days, but i understand where that mentality is coming from.
don't think it's actually about the music anyway, just nostaligia.
i am struggling to find a support system myself and wondered about /r/alanon to start with...i think i need to check that out, as well as seek a better therapist (i just started and don't know if it's a good fit). i'll check that website out as well as search for others. thank you!
thank you for the input.. i'll give it a shot. be well!
side fun note: primus (who has some of the best chunkybass(tm) ever ((thanks les!)) expects that the crowd will yell "primus sucks!" i know it seems counter-intuitive, but it gives a sense of reverence and love when you can yell at the band "you suck!" before/during a concert. jerry was a race car driver.....
i come to reddit so i can gain accurate knowledge about things i never heard of before.
...to rearrange the letters in oral sex properly. fun fact.
how long is work? add an hour tomorrow. then another soon. i don't know you but i am here for you. you're my hero right now. do everything you can do not to use today. no matter how far you make it, if you tried your hardest, it's enough
that's funny, i enjoy when subcultures have little "meta" things they do like yell you suck as a sign of adoration, kinda fun.
i know aslatie from mygnr, and prettyslowtocatchon quoted the film, the room =)
i've heard that before but then when axl tells the story about how he came up with his stage name, he says he just kinda pulled the name out his arse and blurted it out on the phone. but then again who wants to admit that their creative efforts were a contrived thing that they put a lot of thought into. it's much cooler just to act like you casually just fart out awesome coincidences.
hey paul! try getting a reservation at dorsia now you stupid fucking bastard!
you're an amazing person. thank you for responding that way to him.
shit i'm 32 months clean and from my journey in recovery this is some great advice. if all you did today was not use, then it was the best day of your life. you can control the day, nothing else.
i still have trouble remembering that sometimes. i'm almost four years sober/5ish years clean and sometimes i have to tell myself "the house is a mess. both kids need baths, and one ate 2 chicken fingers for dinner. none of the schoolwork is done. but yknow what? i know those things because i didn't drink today. i wasn't high today. so today was still good. it was still a success."
that is the job of the ranger, that is what they are trained for and they are all local from this region. when we have to engage, we have a variety of weaponry, some of it confiscated. however, we are never the first to engage, and it is the last thing we want. we would prefer to arrest poachers and help the region join us in our conservation efforts. thanks alot :)
the majority of the poachers actually come from outside of the chinko reserve from other countries. in fact, there is little concern about local poaching because the nearest village is 100's of km's away. the conservation is a part of this project. we are trying to educate and help the local population in this regard.
look at the iapf. they're a military centric foundation that trains local rangers in zimbabwe. they're usually on the lookout for former military members as instructors.
i haven't heard from microsoft in an official capacity.. however i was contacted by an employee of theirs that understands and appreciates our plight and what we do. he was nice enough to escalate my post within their pr department, but with no promises obviously. we'll see if anything comes of it.
eco tourism is a pretty wide concept. we are focusing first on stabilizing the region and gaining enough control of the area to hopefully in the future turn this into a park for tourism to begin.
normally, we will fly 4-5 hours a day using the ulm. with this ultralight we can support our rangers with surveillance and supply them thru airdrops. the cessna 206h that we have remaining is more for longer flights. (like to and from the nearby towns and capitol).
i'm asking the staff what their top 3 wishes would be... * drones with unlimited cargo capacity would be great (care of our logistics guy). * free internet would be a huge boon. but there isn't even a tower out here.. satellite is all we've got * as for animal tracking... a fleet of helicopters + fuel for 10 years. :) to be honest, the technology available is always changing. so when we have funds available to supplement our stock we make those determinations through research at the time. it's another way of saying i don't have anything specific to ask for. thanks though
i'm actually not the it guy!! i was supposed to be the pilot, however since the ulm aircraft had it's accident right as i arrived, i've tried to help where i can. as for the it work.. it's been a lot of cleanup. there was a large storm before i arrived that ripped the roof of the control room's building right off.. taking most of the wiring and devices with it! it's taken a while, but i got them limping and then pretty much back in service.
that was actually medication for the sudanese cattle to protect against local diseases. as for the pelts, we burn them.
most of the year, i actually work in antarctica. but having been a bush pilot for many years, i still want to fly during the off-ice season. there are not many places you can go to do a short term contract for flying. this just worked out great.
the main concern is range and time. the chinko reserve is 17,600 sq/km! the weather patterns and terrain would just make that unfeasible.
i would say in this particular area, weather. it is mainly flat with sparse but large airstrips. the flying i did in tanzania was some of the most difficult, dangerous, hectic flying i've ever done. from chasing animals off the runways, to landing on inclines on the side of volcanoes and craters with crazy winds and simply people sabotaging runways. plus birds and downdrafts when flying low for an emergency
actually, the last thing we want is a violent confrontation. we would prefer to arrest poachers, and try to convince invasive sudanese herders to help us keep this park pristine.
peregrine falcon chicks don't require killing the parent falcon to acquire. if you want to flood the market with something you have to have a lot of it and be able to do it for a while. otherwise the market will revert to the way it was once your supply runs short of the demand and the original suppliers no longer have your short-lived competition. the only way to keep the supply up would be to kill more elephants.
my ama dream is now complete.. i can answer this. the staff disagrees, but i'm going to say the horse sized duck. i will then lead the rangers myself atop this steed and scare the ever living shit out of the poachers.
actually, one of the greatest legacies of the ulm was when it came to the rescue of rangers under fire. it continually buzzed the poachers and diverted attention/fire long enough for the rangers to get clear.
the supply chain ends so far away, we don't have interaction. khartoum is the main departure point out of africa. national geographic did an article about the ivory trail (gps in a fake tusk) and tracked it just east of the chinko border!
from the longer term staff: * seeing the positive results and increase of animal density in our "core protection zone" * seeing the animals from the air for me.. i haven't been here long enough to see the changes that they have, but i can really appreciate from their descriptions what a joy it is to see progress being made
i wish i had a decent answer for you. ivory exists out there, and we can't change the past. making it sought after is something i'm concerned about and i'm not sure if recycling the ivory helps or hurts by keeping it desirable.
due to security reasons.. we prefer not to discuss our tactics or give away positions/quantity of active rangers. hope you understand.
this is not a huge operation.. and it's scarcely 2 years old. this is the bush.. the real bush. you work with what you have available and what this staff has done, and created to this point is very impressive. it would be nice to have an it staff that could design, build, and maintain such a system. i don't know where they got the machines.. but i assume donations with windows already installed. the staff has larger concerns to focus on with the anti-poaching efforts and os takes a backseat.
once there is actually time to work on redesigning the system.. we'll take all the advice we've received from both posts
1. i love bush flying. i fulfilled my lifelong dream a few years ago flying medical emergencies and masai clinics in tanzania. i then moved on to antarctica, but wanted to find another bush flying job in between the on-ice seasons. 2. well, it is something most people have to adapt to. i'm ok with a simple lifestyle. i've got a room & a bed, food, good co-workers, and beautiful area. plus i have plenty of battery life on my laptop for watching movies :) 3. i have yet to experience anything that has made me fear for my life. i'm not saying i'm a courageous guy.. i'm not :) but knowing the possibility exists for a "hairy situation" keeps you on your toes. 4. thanks.. actually i'm still trying to get the whole system back up and running after a storm destroyed half of it. but i am trying to focus more on the project and aircraft... and only do it when i have to
afaik the gates foundation works in the medical side of african charities. we could look into it i guess.. remember i'm not even supposed to be the it guy, much less knowledgeable about non-profit fundraising. but thanks for the idea.
actually.. the ulm has a big valuable impact on this. flying it near some groups cause them to run away. there are other groups however have no problem standing up to the rangers.
an apprentice of ours: worst - getting malaria and needing the dashing pilot to emergency evac me to medicine sans frontiers. best - collaring the animals in the bush.
luckily at the moment i'd say we have the upper hand.. but the heavily armed poachers looking for elephants have already killed so many here that they are moving towards drc's garamba to find more. if the populations continue to increase here, we could see more escalation. as for the technology, i can speak to the animal tracking. basically we have camera traps that we collect images of wildlife from, and collars to try and track certain herds.
the majority of the poaching is towards antelope species like eland & duiker + elephants with the occasional buffalo, leopard, hyena.. etc
yeah does corruption have any effect on how you operate?
i know i answered this above.. but basically the range we need to cover is too large and for too long a time. hell, just the charging is an issue. we run soley off generator and solar power.
1) the majority of the poaching occurs in the dry season (mid dec - mid march). during daylight hours. 2) as stated before, we are preferring not to discuss our tactics for security concerns & success of our mission.
first would be getting in supplies. infrastructure in the country is ruined because of a lack of maintenance for many years combined with a rainy tropical climate. distance is obviously a problem.. we are actually very close to the geographically most remote location in all of africa. then there's uncertainty. circumstances are always changing and it's one daily unforseen challenge after another. the political situation in bangui (capital) is somewhat under control.. but once you are outside of it, it's more like the wild west.
we can only hope.. but i personally have heard much about it and love it! i heard of a chemical that can be introduced (i think) into rhino food supply that while not harming the animal, will end up in the rhino horn and affect the human consumer in a very negative way.
we get up around 5:30am for breakfast (bread and jam).. sleeping later is pretty impossible because of roosters. we work until 12:30.. have lunch then take a siesta until 2pm then work another 3 hours. then if we don't keep working, hopefully get a run and shower.. some time reading or listening to music and then dinner and bed. there isn't a whole lot to do out in the bush. the job is the main part of your life
we are safe, if for no other reason than we are very remote.
* from our logistics guy.. i am too busy to get home sick! as far is being away from home (netherlands).. it's hot! you can wear shorts and flip-flops! * from oliver.. it's a huge contrast from amsterdam.. but like he said.. you're too busy to be homesick. * from me.. i've spent the majority of the last 12 year traveling the world and living in remote places. i'm used to it.. but i also make an extreme effort to visit my family when i can (couple times a year). but we all do get vacation and rotations on a schedule. as far as never 10.. i used gwx control panel. thanks.
awareness of the impact is important and obviously choosing not to purchase items that are a result of poaching.
as mentioned above.. most of the local population believes there is no problem and that the wildlife availability is infinite! of course we wish everyone held the same value for the animal's conservation as we do.
the ulm used mogas, and our cessna uses avgas which we keep stored in barrels. i'm not sure about the life personally, but we use it quick enough not to be a concern.
the two american bases (mcmurdo & the south pole) are permanent settlements. there's a nz base nearby as well that hosts an american night every thursday.
that seems like an awful lot of effort for a little honey. usually i just see video of people climbing the tree to get the honey.
that sounds like vetpaws (?), they got a lot of love a year or two ago over on imgur when they posted the lady that ran the program's day to day operations. i was in the army and i thought about doing it.
at least there's that. maybe hearing about critical operations being interfered with, especially ones where lives can be put at risk will make them realize that their upgrade strategy isn't winning any hearts. it's a far shot, but i hope at least you guys get some form of compensation.
that makes sense, i always heard ecotourism suggested as an ultimate goal to help support the local economy and wildlife. i hope that you are able to get the stability you need.
i am a pilot as well, recently got my multi commercial and almost finished with my single commercial add on. so, how does a person go about getting a job flying in africa working for wildlife conservation? it seems to me a far more worthwhile task than flying boxes for some small time part 135 operation and flying in africa is a notion i've entertained in my mind a few times.
now this is what i want to hear. :) thanks for the response. people have odd hobbies, i know a few drone fanatics for example. if predator drones can drop bombs i'm sure they can drop other less immediately explosive items. (beans and bullets).
do you have any experience or training flying planes?
why dont you put them back in the market? i know i dont know anything, but just a first impression is there is always the market for these pelts. so by destroying it just increases prices and thus risk/reward leading to higher violence. not only that but the damage.. is already done, so by selling them back into the market you get a high cash bonus to help try to protect more again, i have literalry no understanding of your job. would be intresting to know more about yours
have you ever seen any norwegians shooting at a dog?
hasn't bill already done a ton of charity in africa? sounds like this story would be pretty close to home for him...
now that you have it, turn off the auto updates!!! there hasn't been one since may 10th i believe, so it might not have been a problem yet. but most of those things will install on their own, and can be up to a gig or more of data.
there are single wing drones that can cover over 100 miles. i know just the person who has a ton of experience delivering emergency supplies in the middle east with drones. pm me if you would like to know more.
it's good to have reminders how spoiled i am with jet ways, paved strips, apus and packs
yeah that does sound like the logical way to do it. but stories of people doing it 20-30 years ago?
i'm glad i wasn't the only one that connected selling ivory cheap to what i learned from the wow auction house
yeah the flight time is pretty much under an hour at max for quadcopters but i've seen people on youtube flying trainers for hours and ranges up to 5km, i'm just starting at this hobby so there's that :d thanks for your reply and all the best for you and the team.
one of reddit's many sketchers should jump on this and draw you and your crew riding a duck-pegasus.
actually, that's a really good point. sorry, i should have thought of that!
as co-owner of a small it company here in the uk, if you ever need anything in terms of help for your it, just let me know and we'll do whatever we can.
oh some .50s and plate of armor would do just fine, cmon :)
even running on generator fueled batteries, a drone is going to be many orders of magnitude cheaper to run than a plane. regarding range, you can find affordable solutions that give you over 30 km autonomy nowadays, i know that's much less than what a plane offers, but its a different tool for a different purpose.
thank you for the reply! i accept you should not be sharing information in regards to security, bad question on my part. thank you again for your work to protect wildlife and environment.
on behalf of many future generations to come, we thank you for this offer. i hope they get to see these amazing animals too.
holy cow those prices are high... but to get internet in the middle of the ocean...
they're in the middle of nowhere, there are no cell towers or any other way of accessing the internet. satellite is literally all they can access
are you clicking an ad? i can read the description and apply
i remember news stories of hospital equipment upgrading the first week they did this. they don't care then, they don't care now.
i actually did a lot of research on eco tourism during my undergrad. tl;dr of what i learned is eco tourism is a great option for a lot of countries to very sustainably support their economy and promote other countries to try do the same. why destroy for the sake of profit when you can preserve for the sake of profit? unfortunately, in all the months i worked on this project i only came across 2 eco tourism locations that employed truly sustainable practices. everything else had the label of eco tourism but was really just another resort destination, only now in a more remote area. still always tons of waste produced, tons of energy used, no interaction with local community, etc.
you know, i became a pilot with the sole intention of becoming a bush pilot. i left the us after i got my commercial and started traveling the world. i just put myself out there.. sought out local flying orgs, hung at airports, made connections in the towns. it wasn't until i found myself in a coffee shop in tanzania that the owner gave me the contact info for a local flying medical service. i made a quick phone call, met them for dinner, joined them for a 3 day clinic with the masai tribes.. and that was it. i joined up. once i had the experience under my belt.. it was only a matter of finding organizations in need. there are several bush pilot facebook groups that are good for this.
start a youtube channel while all they have is slow, expensive satellite internet?
sounds like you should be reading least i could do. last year, they had a story arc about the main character buying an old aircraft carrier and using predator drones to deliver food to starving kids in africa to one-up elon musk.
the thing about the pelts is selling them on the market doesn't do anything to help in the long term,short term it will give you some extra cash but in the end you're just contributing to the market that you're fighting against.demand for the pelts can't lower due to supply as the animals themselves are less in number than those who wish to own whatever it is that they're taking from them.also in the case of ivory(which is the main concern here) releasing it to the market will actually expand the market and demand which as you can imagine is extremely bad.
the gates foundation works primarily on healthcare, with focuses on women's health, family planning and innovations that increase hygienic standards in poorly developed countries. they do a lot of good, but i don't think they would step out into elephant conservation. they have enough on their plate already in the fid of public health
what i do have are a broad set of skills, skills that make me a nightmare for redditors like you...
i'm in comp sci so when i see apu my head goes to arithmetic processing unit... curious what it stands for in this context.
you have to tag them to summon them. this seems most appropriate for /u/awildsketchappeared .
i work in app dev for a f100 here in the states.. would be cool if we could put together an offshore team of developers to help these folks out. i wonder if that would be any more effective?
they're trying to be as little violent as possible .50's will not help
discover any useful information from arresting poachers? i feel like there's probably an interrogation effort going down. any luck in figuring out if large scale poaching troupes have predictable operations?
but then how would they reap the sweet sweet karma?
i love the internet so, so much. it is a progression of humanity in the best way.
yep, that's the price of satellite broadband. even using the older systems like fleetbroadband you are in to $20/mb (with less than dial up speeds). you can bring that down to 4$/mb however at that point you are paying for yearly subscriptions that will cost almost as much as vsat. also, you can probably find cheaper vsat however you will have limited bandwidth. what i mentioned is ideal for large groups of people like boats or camps because you don't have to monitor bandwidth or worry about automatic updates and instead just monitor it on a speed basis and prioritize traffic.
could they build a tower with enough funding? i have no idea how it works, it's magic signals that connect me to the world.
the only other wireless option would be microwave, but that is line-of-sight. it doesn't work for more than about 20 miles.
i think for local tribes consumption it's "limitless" supply of food. they have live off it since ancient time. their breeding/reproducing speed can cover local tribe consumption. poacher made them endangered.
shit, i didn't know the size of the economic incentives til now. that's insane. you don't have to educate the villagers. you have to educate the fucking chinese about voodoo quack medicine.
i'm on a plane already and haven't paid a dime yet
shouldn't hospitals be using the enterprise version?
what were the two locations? having spent some time in kenya i saw how large a positive impact safari tours can have. i'm not clear why this model wouldn't work in all of africa.
"it wasn't until i found myself in a coffee shop in tanzania that the owner gave me the contact info for a local flying medical service." how did my mind turn this into the han solo hiring scene in the cantina? am i.. am i a geek?!
here's an excellent opportunity for a new type of drone or a combination of drones. you could have one type of light-weight, high-endurance drone (even solar powered and possibly a hybrid that uses helium or hydrogen for some of its lift) for linger and observation and then pair that with a resupply drone that is heavy and fast. this could also work in a scenario such as a beach (or park or ski resort, etc...) where one drone could monitor swimmers (and possibly look for sharks in some locations) and if someone is in trouble, a fast rescue-drone with a life preserver, first-aid kit, etc... could be sent.
they could send sd cards by mail and upload it in a other city.
i'm forcing this title on the office managers in my company.
wait....stars and the moon aren't visible on antarctica? ever?
oh dear. can i send you a dvd player with dvds? or if that won't hook up how about more vhs tapes? you all work so hard and do such a great job protecting the wildlife and villagers, you deserve to kick back and have a choice of entertainment!
yeah, they probably dont have the resources to expand operations.
please, for your own sake, take 5 minutes to add the extra tiers now in between answering questions. you don't even need to spend much time adding clever descriptions or figure out the numbers that i mentioned before, just at least add the tiers ($1, $7, $15, $25, $50, $100, and $250) with a couple of words to indicate how important your work is. strike while the iron is hot, this ama will likely be seen by tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of people who are primed with interest in your story, many of whom will be eager to donate to such a worthy cause.
apu- auxiliary power unit. small engine in the plane to power all the systems when the engines aren't running. pack- pneumatic air cycle kit. small motorless air cycle machine (acm) that conditions the bleed air from the engines to provide variable temperature and pressurization to the plane. there is a valve the moves that changes the temperature to the cabin. it's more complicated than this, but this is the best i can do to simplify it. outflow valve- a valve that controls the pressure in the plane by opening and closing. the pack pumps air in and how much pressure in the plane is controlled by the position of the outflow valve. fyi
most of these guys are already filthy rich... i don't think they're willing to die for their cause.
thanks for the answer. it's a shame that the kony 2012 campaign was apparently a money grab and made it a less cared for subject.
i was unsure of the spelling, thankfully there is always a few helpful redditors around!
you don't even need that. just imagine if a company like spacex reduces launch costs to under 20 million dollars and companies can put way more satellites up for cheaper. that directly reduces the cost you need to charge.
sure, but the tower wouldn't do anything. if they can't get access to a cable or phone line, a tower wouldn't either. they could build a radio tower for communication between aircraft and rangers, but they most likely have a decent antenna already.
not true. a harris falcon iii (hclos) system will get you ~100 miles or so on a clear day via line of sight. but that would require some significant funding for them to pull off. the benefit is that it can handle some pretty spectacular throughput.
it's worth noting that this only the case because the species that couldn't breed fast enough to survive hunter-gatherers went extinct. natural replacement rates weren't always high enough. anywhere you go, you'll find 50-90% of megafauna went extinct soon after the first people arrived.
this generally doesn't work. the poachers spend time and effort tracking down the animals. if they find it's de-tusked/-horned, they'll still kill it so that its trail doesn't waste their time in the future.
it's not just medicine, ivory is used extensively in jewelry, furniture, and many other luxury goods where it's traded.
hah, i like the bold "untaxed profit", like only getting 35k instead of 50k would make someone say "fuck this, i'm tired of this".
drugs are a bit different. i doubt many people are suckin dick for ivory figurines.
i just got there and they gave me money when i arrived.
yes, yes they should. tbh i have no sympathy for (big) businesses who aren't using enterprise that complain about windows trying to upgrade to w10.
that last point is basically it. life critical machines shouldn't be running consumer grade software. it's simply not created for that and is treated as such by its developers.
and hopefully soon u/zambuka42 and his team will receive funds from this pre-established pr slushy. this is amazingly cynical, but likely reality. ...yay multi-national software-vampire-squids :-/
one place i went is the santa lucia cloud forest reserve in ecuador. fantastic place, they do their best to be sustainable.
that might push them into more of a seasonal format, unless they can get a good timetable worked out. not that there's anything wrong with seasonal stuff. that actually sounds pretty cool..
how would you recommend getting into being a bush pilot? i want to fly planes but don't want to shoot people, and also don't want to be an airline pilot either for various reasons. bush flying on the other hand pretty much seems like my perfect job.
sorry.. should have qualified that i work in the summer... sunshine 24 hour a day
that satellite internet tho 20$ a mb makes it cheaper just to fly out a dang vhs
got it.. my brain is a bit fried.. but made some generic reasons for each level. i appreciate the info
oh i agree it isn't necessarily easy, but they do end up in places with better internet sometimes. so it is doable. also while the ubuntu installer wants to get updates, it isn't necessary. depending on what they actually run it is entirely possible they have native apps that do what they need. obviously we are all speculating, but once the initial install is done, they would be pulling in only new stuff to install, as opposed to windows 10s constant pulling updates.
the problem with satellites is that they can't be in geostationary orbit, as that murders latency. so you have to throw up a gazillion of them in low earth orbit - which is still cost prohibitive, even at a few million bucks per launch. then you need something on the ground capable of tracking them or at least an entirely new system capable of knowing where they are. it's a very difficult problem. not unsolvable, but very expensive to solve initially. google's last estimate was that it would cost $1-$3 billion and require at least 180 satellites. the entire us only has 600 or so satellites in orbit now. i think there are somewhere in the neighborhood of 2000 total worldwide? that's why the airline industry dropped the old linking to satellites for phones/internet and built and entirely new air-to-ground system.
this may not be a popular opinion, but i've gleaned that the chinese culture is one that greatly values wealth and opulence, sometimes to a vicious degree. i've heard it mentioned a few times that if you're a man in china without a "good" job, women will openly mock you. i suspect that the chinese people that buy ivory have little concern for the animals in africa. they care only for their precious status symbol. please feel free to tell me i'm wrong about this.
it's actually a misconception that they purchase ivory primarily for medicinal usage. the majority of poached ivory in china is used for decorative purposes. generally they have the ivory intricately carved into some work of art, which is then placed on display in their home or office. the rarity and high cost associated with ivory is what makes it so coveted, as owning a nice piece, or gifting such an item grants one a tremendous amount of *face* in their culture.
nobody is sucking dick for marijuana but it is by far the largest part of the war on drugs
i just got my 4th confirmed poacher kill and was awarded with a rhino harem.
sometimes vendors use highly modified versions in their equipment. contracts with vendors will say you can make zero modifications. so as a hospital sometimes you are fucked no matter what.
more to the point, shouldn't live critical machines not be connected to the internet in any way? like is it just me who sees how horrible a hack into the system could be?
i don't mind the "you own a license" part of it so much, it's the "you clicked x, so you accept," "i know you disabled the gwx update, so here's another one," "oh, btw, we found *expensive program* to be incompatible with 10, so we uninstalled it for you :)" kinds of bullshit that has me hating ms, but yeah the license to use vs own thing is arguably a part of it as well.
aww! i stayed there a few years ago! so cool to see this place mentioned. the showers are the most beautiful showers on the planet. man... now i want to go back!
they can post frequently, just schedule videos from last month for next month and so on. nobody will be angry we are getting month old material. i imagine cutting and preparing material would be much more challenging.
this is correct. and as with travelling to australia, you will also need training in how not to fall of the earth once down there.
more to the point, the military isn't being force-fed windows 10. they do plan to upgrade to it, and they probably should, but they will do it when they're ready, not in response to an unsolicited download followed by a malware-like popup window from the os. it's not unreasonable to ask for the same privilege as an individual user.
awesome, you are a dead set legend mate. i can't even begin to imagine the horrible shit you see and the side of humanity that the vast majority of us will never experience other than through the pictures you've posted. i hope every single person who reads this ama takes the time to sling a few bucks your way, you deserve it.
a lot of asia is like that. my first time visiting korea to go see family was surprising. a lot of women will keep bags from high end stores and use them to daily carry things just so they can be seen in public with them. anything name brand is automatically better than something that isn't regardless of actual results/tests. and like you said, people with certain jobs are just looked down upon.
what people don't realize is china is still a third world country, yes they're wealthy now but 30-years ago they were not. they're still largely peasants basking in new money and give zero fucks about everything else. it will be decades before the millennials have the same power as the old heads.
i just killed my 7th and i can now call in an air strike.
my rhino seems to only have 3 legs. i can order a 4th leg for my current rhino, correct?
"this device is not compatible with your version of windows 10" well, there goes the respirators.
i'm sorry this simply isn't correct. some hospitals have a significant amount of computers. nurses stations, laptop systems, billing, testing, administrative, and hell some will put a station in each room. really enterprise level.
it's why they are allowed to take control from you. they own the os, so your input is inconsequential.
training is no longer required. we provide special magnetic boots at border security these days.
people who can't see beyond themselves or beyond today. "i got mine. fuck the rest of you."
surely that would make the genuine stuff more valued and drive prices up again, making ivory more coveted.
pfft! i've called in a dozen air strikes already, and now i'm president of small nation. laggards!
it's the tragedy of the commons,solutions need to be based on economics not ethics. no one gives a shit about ethics when money is involved
gagnam style was a satire of the one of seoul's shopping districts.
well, it's a joke. there are already hundreds of faux ivory products being produced in china. you can buy them on amazon. but as a more realistic solution, flood the market with a high quality, nearly indistinguishable synthetic ivory. i think i've actually heard of people working on that approach.
my boyfriend was on reddit one night about 3 weeks after our website launched and posted on r/shutupandtakemymoney. we didn't think much about it and went to bed. when we woke up, we had 24 new orders. we freaked out. this was more orders than we had gotten since launching. that whole day, orders just kept pouring in. i think we got 200 or so just from reddit. that day (specifically waking up that morning) was definitely the moment.
my favorite box was france, and my boyfriend's was south korea. my favorite snack was the haitai walnut chewy candies from south korea, and my boyfriend's favorite was lychee hi-chew from taiwan/japan (japanese company, made in taiwan).
learn how to do everything yourself, unless you absolutely cannot. we outsourced almost nothing, and in addition to saving us money it allowed us to make better decisions about how to outsource it later.
thank you! the process of figuring out what goes in the box has evolved a ton since we first started. here are all of the ways we do it: * we go to trade shows where manufacturers and importers come to exhibit their products. we make contacts, try products and get samples here. * we visit a lot of grocery stores in ethnic neighborhoods. we live just outside of nyc so we can almost always find a neighborhood with an ethnic grocery. * we make contacts with a lot of manufacturers/exporters/importers. sometimes this comes about through googling, sometimes through people, sometimes by finding their product as a sample in a store. these contacts are often experts and can help us find even more products. as you can imagine this takes a ton of time and effort. it takes the most time of anything in our business.
we've had some customers that have been with us since the very first box, and some that just sign up for one box and then cancel. while i can't provide the exact number, i will say that most people either cancel within the first 1-2 months, or they stick around for at least a year. a lot of our customers try the snacks as an activity with other people (their family, their co-workers, their so, etc.). so once you make it a routine/tradition, you stay subscribed for a while.
for the first few boxes we worked with importers who had already brought the product into the us. we spent a lot of time on google finding them, and then called them up to start doing business. we got their catalogs, then spent a lot of time researching all the products and getting samples. then we decided what items to include. when we ordered the products we had them delivered to the ups store. we picked up all boxes of snacks after work and drove them to my boyfriend's apartment. then we assembled everything from friday after work until sunday night. we stayed home from work the next day for the usps package pickup. in terms of what surprised me... i wasn't sure what to expect when working with international suppliers. many of them have gone out of their way to help us by explaining parts of their country's culture and food. i didn't expect that in a business setting and have been pleasantly surprised!
yes, the 7 digits is revenue. the business has been profitable since we started it. we are now able to take out enough money to live comfortably, and we invest everything back into the company. in terms of investing in the company, this is a mix of infrastructure and advertising. infrastructure being things like making our website better, buying equipment for our warehouse, etc. advertising to grow our customer base.
we both signed an operating agreement when we first started the business. it is owned 50 / 50 by me and my boyfriend. there have been many, many times when we've disagreed on a business decision. the best way we've found to handle it is to explicitly separate what the other person "owns". as an example, my boyfriend handles all of our operations, so he gets to make the ultimate call on anything that's related to our operations. after working together for two years, now i can definitely understand why it's discouraged to mix business and personal. however we also have shared a lot of great moments together and always have each other's back. he understands any sort of stress that i'm experiencing and overall, i would say it's made our relationship much stronger.
when the business first started, we paid a lot for the products, but our advantage was that we could keep our overhead super low. our rent in our first office space was $300 / month and we weren't paying ourselves at first. a storefront will never be able to start off with such a low overhead. as the business has grown, our overhead has grown, but we now often receive volume discounts on the products we purchase or we set up payment terms that allow us to receive a discount (ie. paying for the full order upfront).
yes you did, haha. we're trying to get it back up now but if not then sure, please try again tomorrow.
congratulations! we've had a lot of success marketing our product on youtube by partnering with content creators that have a good number of subscribers. we send them the box, they try the snacks on camera, sometimes we give them compensation beyond the free snacks depending on how big they are. we've experimented with fb ads but haven't had a huge amount of success with it. seo is important for every business, although we haven't spend a ton of time perfecting it (not a lot of people are searching for our product and stumble across it). what kind of product(s) are you selling? i can recommend some advertising channels once i know!
i got the gift page to load, but not the join page. gift page has a yum box (6 or more snacks) starting at $14/month and a yum yum box (12 or more snacks) at $25/month.
i am not sure if we will work on this business all the way into retirement. one of the things i've enjoyed about leaving my corporate job to start this business is that i have control over my own destiny. part of what's awesome about that control is that i can decide that i don't want to do this anymore. of course, i'm not going to do that right now, but it's nice to know that i could. in regards to the longevity / "next steps" of the business, we have a lot of ideas! most notably, we'd like to begin selling the individual snacks that we featured in past boxes. we have a lot of customers who try the snacks and then want more, but can't find them anywhere (many are not sold online). we don't want to deprive them of that!
at a country a month, they have like 10 years before they need to think about that. i don't think anyone will mind getting two south korea boxes in the span of a decade
the first country we did was germany. we try to plan the countries so that we mix up regions of the world (e.g. an asian country, then european, then south american, etc.). we also do more asian and less european countries in the summer, because we can't ship chocolate. everyone gets the current month. we would like to eventually have all the boxes available all the time, but it really takes a lot of customers for this to work. you have to continuously source products from all over the world while keeping track of expiration dates so you don't send expired product. it's something to work toward, though! so far we've sent out boxes from 22 different countries. we've only repeated one country (we did brazil again for the olympics in august). obviously, we will eventually have to repeat some countries. when we do this we'll look for different products so that even though the country is the same, the products are new.
a great question from an actual customer unanswered. ama except how to improve lol
answered this elsewhere and copying it here: the process of figuring out what goes in the box has evolved a ton since we first started. here are all of the ways we do it: * we go to trade shows where manufacturers and importers come to exhibit their products. we make contacts, try products and get samples here. * we visit a lot of grocery stores in ethnic neighborhoods. we live just outside of nyc so we can almost always find a neighborhood with an ethnic grocery. * we make contacts with a lot of manufacturers/exporters/importers. sometimes this comes about through googling, sometimes through people, sometimes by finding their product as a sample in a store. these contacts are often experts and can help us find even more products. as you can imagine this takes a ton of time and effort. it takes the most time of anything in our business.
the initial 2k went into website software and inventory. because of the nature of our business we were able to take pre-orders for a couple months before sending out our first box. the cash from that funded our first major product purchases. we have never taken out loans, although we do have credit cards (for rewards purposes).
haha, so many... we had a hard time transitioning from doing everything ourselves to outsourcing pieces of work. by extension, we also waited way too long to hire our first employee. we ended up feeling like were behind constantly because we didn't take anything off our plates. a lot of mistakes came from us being totally new to the industry (ecommerce and imported food). we didn't know how to communicate with suppliers, how to negotiate terms in contracts, etc. lots of small mistakes there.
we're going to launch an online store to get rid of them!
we didn't take a salary for our first year in business but we have fortunate to be able to take a salary this year. we moved for the business - to be closer to the ports, to be near all the ethnic neighborhoods of ny, etc. we have talked/thought about going on shark tank but ultimately decided not to apply. we do not want to give up equity or take on investors.
i'm not sure, i've never done an ama before so i don't know what to expect. if you'd like, i'll be happy to report back in a few hours!
we taste test everything with our employees. it's really fun, and you can usually tell what fits with the american palate or not pretty easily.
our biggest differentiator is the 12 page booklet that comes inside each box. it has trivia, detailed descriptions of the snacks and their history, cultural tidbits from the featured country, and a riddle describing next month's box. aside from that, we're featuring snacks from a lot of countries that no other company is buying from. so, the products we're including are really unique. in some instances, it is the first time the product has been brought into the us. so, that's pretty cool!
i should've activated a cdn before posting this, but didn't. tbh i had no idea this would be popular. we're hosted on wpengine.
i worked in market research. mostly this helped with understanding how to segment our customers and target our product appropriately. my boyfriend was a mechanical engineer. he had some basic programming skills from college, which made teaching himself how to build the website easier.
yes, we'd like to expand to australia and the rest of europe soon!
i am portuguese, with spanish roots living in the uk with my french gf who i met in finland where i studied for a year.ohh and i love snacks do you need a business partner? :d
definitely. the biggest component is that we don't buy from smaller manufacturers or manufacturers that aren't registered with the fda. all the products we are buying are consumed regularly by hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of people on a daily basis around the world. therefore, if there are any safety issues, they will be made known to us in the form of a product recall.
good questions! the large companies will only pay attention to what you're doing if you are importing a very large volume (i.e. an entire container of one of their products). aside from that, it is not worth the effort for them to regulate. the regulatory issues associated with importing food products are difficult. we primarily rely on importers to handle that part of the process. even if we are custom ordering product from them, they have relationships with foreign manufacturers that we don't, and they also know the customs process very well.
don't try to do that stuff yourself. you will fuck up. every business should have a lawyer and an accountant.
did that happen again after this ama? seriously considering subbing, and i know i'm not the only one after seeing this. i like these kinds of businesses and have a similar subscription to a japanese candy one. i totally love the idea that its a different country each month, that in itself was really neat and makes me want to sub.
that lychee hi-chew was sooo great! i ordered a 6-pack of it on amazon as soon as my box ran out. have you considered making extras available so people could order more if they really like them? sounds like a way you could grow your business and move unused product.
did you guys set times for work in your new business, after quitting your day jobs? or were you basically working it non stop whenever needed
you really need a german box soon! our bread snacks are great and only swiss people can make better chocolate
knowing you're from cincinnati, did jungle jims play a roll in you deciding this?
i'm going to allow my so to start a business while i work my ass off to cover her. :)
this sounds like me -- but at a different point in life. mortgage is paid off, cars are paid off, daughter is in college (but the money is in the bank). i've started a small manufacturing company while keeping my day-job. i'm about 6 months in and moving from setting up shop to finally offering products. it's nights and weekends and sometimes feels like a pit that i just throw all our money into. that said, the hours fly by when i'm working on my business... the day job? not so much. i'm really looking forward to the day i'm not working two jobs again!
i know the feeling of family members starting a business. my mother opened a cafe while i was still at school, my time before and after school was spent at the cafe. 7am-7pm when i wasn't at school i was usually at the cafe the only day i wasn't was wednesday. this went on for 5 years before dad finally convinced mum it was tanking and to get out before it tanked the family. dad was still working a full time job and then working at the cafe in the afternoon and weekends.
past business owner here. i'd suggest taking out a small percentage for personal savings as well as other investments. while you can easily net the most gain from investing everything back in the company, you really want to diversify if it goes down the tubes/takes a hit. also, if your relationship ever goes south you won't get locked into the idea you have to keep working together because literally everything is wrapped up in the company.
from what i have seen in family owned businesses, it will either destroy or strengthen a relationship. glad to see you guys are the latter. and i wish all the best for you guys.
you mentioned having a warehouse. how big is your inventory currently and how efficient are you in clearing said inventory? do the customers have no say in what they get?
considering the subscription section of the site's down, i was unable to find the subscription prices for each box. could you maybe edit that into the post body? nevermind, found it off google. yum box ($13/month), and yum yum box ($20/month).
now i remember why this sounds so familiar. totalbiscuit tried out a few of your boxes with his wife.
reminds me of the pepsi challenge. though internally corporate run it's still similar and was pretty successful.
you put irish crisps (meanies) in the uk package. just saying...
there are like 4 or 5 countries we've done that actually have some of the products on amazon. most of the time the products we're featuring are not sold online. sometimes we're bringing the product into the us for the first time ever.
"this is bullshit! we already got snacks from trinidad 8 years ago!"
your website lists some of the past boxes but it misses the box that included german snacks. what was in the box?
nothing special comes to my mind, we didn't have snacks during communism therefore most things got imported. by the time we managed to produce alternatives by ourselves, the foreign products were already rooted in our lifestyle. however, asking over at /r/albania is not a bad idea.
almost half of those companies in the list are internationally focused. many of them are very similar to your business model.
where can i learn how to communicate with suppliers and how to negotiate terms in contracts or even how to contact them in the first place ? i've always been curious about this.
if u sent kinder eggs (which based on the sweden boxes you did), you already broke the rules. also if it's the first time a product has been brought to the us, i have no idea how those products are fda certified. i think you can fly under the radar for now, but you could be royally fucked if you get inspected or someone sues you. i would be taking more money out of the company just to protect myself from future litigation. they can't take money that you already paid to yourself but everything else is on the table.
i was trying to sign up but i'm getting an error from the join page.
considering the website is giving out 504 errors...
thank you for your business and helping us get our start! what country has been your favorite?
i can totally understand and empathize with your feelings. since our product is subscription-based, it's unlikely that everyone will decide to cancel all at once. that said, finding new customers is hard and you never know which of your marketing efforts will pan out. for us, it's very nerve-wracking working with new suppliers every month to source our product. we don't have a preexisting relationship so there's no trust, and we're constantly afraid someone will screw us and the product won't come.
compiling snacks into boxes in their apartment? yes i imagine the overhead is low...
not even turks like grape sucuk, that crap should've never been in that box. literally feels and tastes like rubber
we didn't have strict times when we worked, but we did fall into a basic schedule. to be honest, at the beginning we worked every single day for at least 10 hours. we did not find that to be sustainable and have since cut back, but hard work is inevitable.
norway would also like a word. i'll take norwegian milk chocolate over any other chocolate any day
bissli is awesome! my top 5: * haitai chewy walnut candy from south korea * lychee hi chew from taiwan/japan * bamba (puffed corn with peanut flavoring) with hazelnut filling from israel * chocolate covered crepes from france * torcida pimenta mexicana (spicy chip-type things) from brazil
both groups of people who notoriously don't have any money.
jungle jim's had a lot to do with my weight gain.
if that's the case, they are just proving that the demand for this product outweighs the supply. there can be more than a few companies. you don't pass a gas station and state "there are like thousands of gas stations out there."
that's a great way to do it! we thought about having one of us continue working full-time while the other took the leap. in the end, we decided it would build resentment as we both really wanted to work on the business.
medical device manufacturer. i won't go into specifics. but i came up with a medical device that i needed and found out others did too. don't recommend it as fda compliance makes business unnecessarily hard and unnecessarily expensive. plus i manufacture, assemble, and ship my product in america, which all adds to the expense. but it's a niche without a lot of competition due to the fda requirements. oh i burned myself out. but it was worth the sacrifice. :)
this is great advice. we'll be looking at taking out a "bonus" at the end of this year to invest personally.
pretty sure she was saying that their personal income (which they issue out as a salary to themselves) is greater than 70k each, but that they end up putting putting a lot of their personal income back into the company instead of investing it some other way.
my first suggestion would be to create your own brand and try to sell as many branded products as you can. this is very important in this day and age. even if you can't afford to get your logo onto everything you're selling, start by using stickers. in terms of advertising - you should teach yourself a lot about google adwords. people search for what you're selling, and if you can find the right terms you can make good money selling to them. also, to get started you'll want to find bloggers/youtubers/instagrammers/etc. in the fitness niche. ask them to review your product in exchange for giving them the product for free. the smaller accounts will do it.
wouldn't those chips be sold in northern ireland as well...?
so i just ordered. i think you can't really think about it as if you could just go buy all these things for cheaper or find someone to give you a list. i like the idea of being surprised and i also don't want to waste my time looking into finding the best treats from each country be it from internet or research etc. excited and can't wait for the first box.
"whoa whoa whoa, south sudan *again*?? i can practically still taste the april 2007 box! that's it, i'm cancelling!"
i would find the link but the website is so bogged down right now. from memory: * kinder hanuta * lorenz pomsticks * hitschler softi sticks * ritter sport jamaica rum * leibniz pickup * haribo gummy bears * wawi schoko-something (the rice chocolate bar) * lorenz paprika chips * kinder happy hippo and like 2-3 other snacks i can't remember.
unfortunately enough for your geographically-challenged self, a trip from cincy to nj would not bless you with the opportunity to travel through the city of champions.
nothing redditors love more than an underdog story as well, "were a young couple that quit our job to pursue our dream selling ____" gets redditor dicks hard. pretty much every start up hotsauce/homemade soap company used reddit pity to gain initial financial support.
i think they might be overloaded from this thread
what are you going to do when you run out of countries with culturally diverse snack foods?
oooh, tough question, there have been some great ones, especially the ones that surprised me. i'd say colombia and philippines are at the top of my list. i've hung on to a lot of the boxes/lists - i think there's 13 in my house right now!? i swear i'm not a hoarder... what usually happens is i'll be saving/ignoring a couple snacks, and then a new box shows up, and ... well, alright, maybe a little bit of a hoarder. anyway, thanks for such an awesome service!
i subscribe to a subscription box and actually the bottom did drop out for this company when they announced they would be charging for postage. well there was a huge backlash and people were not happy. prior to that we were paying $5 a month for a box, but then they had to add an extra $12 per month on top of that. i obviously don't know what went behind the scenes but they closed their facebook page, many apologies emails were sent out, then a survey on options that would satisfy us (ie. one bigger box four times a year instead of once a month), then everything went quiet for a few months, and finally an announcement that they had sold their business and the boxes would resume soon.
sourcing and shipping packets of sweets from other countries, in bulk enough to not run out of stock.
my grand father grew out till he employed over 50 people. but he did start with it in his kitchen as well. same for our family company. selling pools from our living room.
depends how much your time is worth. for someone with a good job, if they aren't making 150k+ profit quickly on a business, then they could be losing money big time. a college student barely needs to turn a profit so the risk is much lower.
there's a theory that israeli kids are less prone to peanut allergies thanks to bamba being introduced early on. i have no idea how true it is but we gave it to our baby daughter and she loved it.
they don't have as much money, but it's all disposable income...
i wasn't thinking of fund raising, i am a high school math teacher and i think my kids would love this for our spanish class. (yes i am going to pass this along to the appropriate people.) bit if you get a k-12 school into this it is a great way to end a month with snacks form the country.
i'd speculate the opposite. most businesses without mature systems and processes don't have realistic methods for tracking this sort of analysis.
no they definitely know the numbers in detail. i looked at the source code and they are using wordpress. also seen a few tracking plug ins and they for sure have a subscription plug in that would allow them to see the exact numbers in detail.
i think the explanation she gave was even better than an exact number (avg #of months before canceling). the interesting part of that data lies in the distribution (clustered high and low).
yeah, there's like dozens of men's clothing, dog toy, makeup, etc. services. don't know why people would be expecting only one of a kind to exist, this being a competitive capitalist society after all
i'm glad you're being competitive, a business doesn't succeed without competition. monopolies get lazy and fail perpetually then get swept under the carpet the second another company does something similar better.
it's not unimpressive, but a company doesn't have to be profitable to be a "7 figure company"... i'm a few months into a business and revenue is where i planned, and growing, but costs are out of control lololol
repeat business is not so hot, but there's always a steady supply of new customers.
true! it does seem like non-americans really love to share their culture, too, though. older generations of immigrants are teh same from what i hear. it's really neat! i wish more people were like that here in america still, instead of being like "no you can't know about my culture, it's mine" i just wanna learn :(
sometimes you've got to do the leap of faith! i really enjoy the flexibility in my current job. i don't think she has the intent to start a business as large as you two, but she wants to do something to help her family as well as mine (parents and siblings).
what we did was a quarterly financial review. while we didn't pull money out every quarter, we tried to pull out something. it was a low as $400 one time and as high as 20k just to keep it consistent. consistency is the key, small or large.
people get pissed if you tell them that though ..im a business owner in canada who takes full advantage of these weirdo tax laws we have and ways to pay ..but when you tell other businesses owners you barely paid any taxes on 500k+ they get kinda pissed and pull out the pitch fork canadian tax laws are odd ..cra is odd ..it's just an odd system
awesome advice. thanks a ton. i hope nothing but good fortune and further success in your future. cheers!
wow. this made me realize that about half of my subscribers on my youtube channel have come from reddit after i talked about how depressed i was before starting my channel. i kinda expected to get ignored but i actually got a lot of really friendly pms asking to see my channel to support me. it was kinda heartwarming.
but even if they had 1% of people that visit sign up for a subscription, that's definitely something.
imaging a hosting company as part of a relationship: "godaddy, we should talk. i think we have grown apart and don't think this is going to work out" *"its that slut isn't it!! rackspace with her "enthusiastic" customer service. "* "it's not you it's just my needs have changed and ..." *"is it cause their sla better then mine?"*
it seems a lot of subscription companies underestimate their total cost and price their box super low to compete but it's not sustainable. was it a food subscription box?
i'm sorry to hear this. what did you all do, if you don't mind my asking?
you can just go to an international market, no reason to import anything. these boxes are never cheaper than just getting the things yourself, you're just paying to not have to go out yourself
i have a vision of everyone working around the dining table, with a pile of fiberglass pools stacked in the corner, behind the tv. in this vision you have a very large but very cramped living room.
luikse (liege) wafels are delightful and particularly difficult to find in the us. they're made with large chunks of sugar that melt while they're cooking to create little sugar crystals inside and a caramelized outside. they have pre-packaged ones in the grocery stores called suzies that are pretty good. of course nothing compares to getting them fresh.
this is definitely catching on here. i live in a big city, and my pediatrician told us about bamba. i found it in the kosher section of a regular chain grocery store. my baby loves it, and he had it around 7/8 months.
i love the mango, i have a box of them in my desk drawer i'd forgotten until now.
not really. many college students have bills to pay and high school kids tend to have very very little money, so little that they would not spend it on a subscription.
disagree - or at least, if they're into any of the growthhack/startup culture and read any of the blogs (which i'm pretty sure they do, considering they started an online start-up) they'll know to track retention, churn, customer lifetime value, etc.
competition makes all products and services better, more efficient, and less expensive. if you think you can do something better than what's out there, then go ahead start something.
that would be an interesting insight on the business.
maybe they were the first one they knew of? i've heard of a whole lot of subscription boxes but never a box with snacks from different countries. you're right that making an objective and verifiable (or refutable) claim like that is a bad habit to get into as a business, but it's possible she just worded it badly.
making the assumption that this encouraging allowance is more financial than affectionate
we tend to randomly put a few k to the side as well. we do swimming pools so it's like "15k for the pool and 1-5k to the side" for every pool.
they can get pissed all they want. are they covering the responsibility for your retirement income? are they paying for your vacation? are they working 100 hour weeks so you don't have to lay everyone off? no? then they can shut the fuck up.
guide to being a self-made internet startup millionaire "hey reddit, my wife and i just quit our jobs to pursue our dream of starting a homemade hot sauce scented soap monthly gift box. it's been the only thing helping with my depression and my newly wed wife's cancer"
i love it because i am a racker! and i saw the 503s and immediately thought they need autoscale setup :-)
i mean while i don't have one of these boxes, the appeal for me is that if i were to just go out and buy things myself i would probably end up with the same things i always get. using these boxes i can try things i never would have tried on my own.
yeah, but scaling can be really expensive. aws can handle reddit frontpage load with no problem, but this traffic is going to die down, and they probably won't see another surge like this for a while. for a super small business, sometimes it is better to ride out the outage rather than pay $$$ for extra servers, which might nullify any profit from the sales that would be lost.
not sure if the edit was made before or after your comment, but beatmasta was implying selling directly to schools or university departments, not the students.
i develop, sell and implement retail business software for a living and i can tell you firsthand that there are many, many retailers out there who have been around for decades, who are quite large and successful, and who still cannot tell you this kind of information because they've never bothered implementing systems to track it.
that's not remotely true. it tends to push in that direction but your statement as is is flat out wrong.
you're correct. i would always ask her about buying something crazy and outrageous and she'll shoot me down. :p
consistency in the act. they did it every time in order to take the habit, even if there wasn't much to pull out.
exactly and the country does mis-manage billions of dollars very easily it's almost like giving your money to a child with 0 financial knowledge what so ever but some how has a actual degree in accounting ..it's weird
...and 40% of all proceeds will go on to help orphaned rescue kittens, ones just like our little max (pictured, with prosthetic wheels in place of his rear legs)
exactly, plus its also nice to have someone do your shopping for you with a little neat surprise in it. in addition, i feel sometimes there are things you will not find in the local stores despite being "international markets etc" because one cannot simply bring everything over and hope to sell it, they'll be selective. i thought bout some of these boxes, but more so as a business idea and how they earn. i wouldnt mind trying one of these some day when i find something i really want to experiment with.
i have no idea idea why your getting downvoted, its so true, i buy stuff at walmart, target, ect and sell it online. people are extremely lazy, and i make great money seeking items people could buy themselves.
a great middle ground for an event like this is to utilize a cdn like a cloudflare or amazon cloudfront.
baby, can i buy this company that sells a monthly subscription to boxes of foreign snack foods?
it seems like they tried to consistently take money out, but it wasn't always a feasible option. doing a quarterly review means you have more chances to analyze your finances and plan around it versus just an annual "pay day".
i'm from wawa loved areas. we always argue which convenience chain is best. hortons is usually within the top 3 contenders. personally i do prefer wawa over all others. my second choice would be speedway. then probably hortons.
the nice thing about it is that it offers a marketing aspect to it in the core software underneath, which is useful for a product like this where you may need to explain it a little bit first to help people understand the specific nature of the site. it's not quite like other software that goes, "here are products. you buy." plus, there are out-of-the-box themes all over the place for it. you can just buy one for the cost of a pizza and a movie, change the logo and brand colours and you're ready to go.
i'm not trying to put them down for doing it; it's smart and clever.
haha i know. i was making a lewd assumption due to the phrasing.
yes. my dog is awesome!!! ;) as far as being bullied on the show having an effect on my real life i would say no. the bullying was only on camera. the minute the director yelled cut i was definitely one of the "in crowd". lol
i remember meeting you at hedwig (great show by the way). because of the popularity of p&r it's changed many things in my life. 99% good...1% not so good. i can honestly say that part of the 99% is the interaction i have with the fans. i know a lot of actors aren't happy to stop and talk with their fans but i'm always happy to take pics and chat a little. there were many many years as a working actor that nobody knew who the hell i was. the fact that i was lucky enough to land a show like parks and get to have an impact on peoples lives is something i will never take for granted. i'm honored (and humbled) that people like my work and want to come up to let me know. for those wondering what the 1% is that isn't so great...people sneaking pictures. i would rather have someone come up and ask for a pic than sneak around trying to get it. for some reason that seems much more invasive to me. :)
missing p&r is something i will do the rest of my life. i spent six years (7 seasons) with the greatest cast and crew that has ever been assembled (in my humble opinion). thankfully the cast are constantly texting each other and staying in touch. i keep in touch with a lot of the crew too. that being said...nothing will ever be like going to work every day to laugh with people you truly loved. as far as people being different from their characters...as actors i think we all bring a certain part of ourselves to every role. it's just natural. nick offerman is a smart man who can build anything. so that's like ron. on the other hand i think politically they might be at odds.
great question. i've been blessed to have been working in this crazy business for over twenty years. because of the popularity of parks i'll always be best known as jerry which is a gift. i love when i get to sink my teeth into a dramatic role. dark comedies are my favorites. it's one of the things that led me to middle man. i'm not the "funny" guy in the film yet i get a lot of laughs. i love getting a new script and figuring out what i'm going to do with it. as far as finding something i did in the past...hmmm...i did an episode of diagnosis murder where i got to play a crazed serial killer. i had a lot of fun with that. i would also check out a remake of harvey i did many years ago with leslie nielsen, swoosie kurtz and harry anderson. it was one of my first films. i look like a baby. it was an amazing experience. :)
great question. from what i understand one of the writers were standing next to me at the urinal and thought it was time to mix real life and tv life. made perfect sense to me. lol ;)
they were all funny. what a lot of people don't know is that after every scene we did a "fun run". that's where we got to play around and do whatever we wanted while telling the same story that was on the page. most of us had an improv background so it made sense to let us play together. we did that every day. i think it's one of the reasons we stayed so close as a cast. that being said...chris pratt is so off the cuff funny that it's crazy. really really funny. i had fun working with each and ever one of them. that's not hollywood bullshit. i loved them all...and still do. :)
thanks so much. my dogs names are chase (the white one) and stella (the black one). they're both rescues. last year i lost both of my other dogs to cancer. i don't have kids so the dogs become like children (some people think that's crazy...that's ok). when they passed away i didn't think i could ever go through it again. after nine months my gut was telling me that it was time again. i went to the linda blair world heart foundation and found chase. i knew within two minutes of meeting him that he needed to be with me for the rest of his life. a few months later i went to the amanda foundation and met stella. she had obviously been abused and needed some loving. they're brought the smile back to my face after losing my other two pups. :)
it's totally different than any other role i've played. my character lenny starts out in the same vein as jerry from parks. a sweet, nice guy. unfortunately for lenny he makes one terrible mistake and on his way to las vegas he picks up a hitch hiker (played by andrew j. west). this turns his life upside down. from that moment on we slowly watch the mental unravelling of an otherwise normal dude. playing the character was terrifying because if i didn't make it work the film doesn't work. from what i hear i did it justice. :)
i love when i get to different types of characters. that's what actors do. like i mentioned earlier it's hard not to be typecast but it's part of the challenge of being an actor. :)
i try to keep something from every shoot i'm on. most of it just sits in a box. i figure someday when i'm old (well...older) i'll want to take a trip down memory lane. i have the jerry gergich conference room rip plaque on my desk. i see it every day. :)
you nailed it. li'l sebastian will be starring as lenny in "of mice and men". can't wait to see it. :)
tell you dad thanks from me. without our kickstarter campaign we would not have been able to make the film that we did. i'm still blown away that strangers gave us their hard earned money to help us make our dream project. it's very humbling. i mentioned earlier that i have too many all time favorite actors to mention. i'm been blessed by being around not only amazingly talented people but also amazing good people. for me that's more important. getting to work with andrew j. west, josh mcdermott and anne dudek on middle man was an unexpected treat. i didn't know any of them and they came with their a games. really amazing people and actors. :)
i wouldn't say overly nice. we were all just good friends doing good work and laughing our asses off every day. :)
my favorite director was a guy who started as our editor on parks. he had also worked on the office. his name is dean holland. he really understood all of our characters and knew how to get the best out of us. my favorite actor that i've worked with is too broad of a question. i've fallen in love with so many people i've worked with over the years. by "love" i mean i loved being around them. :)
lol that's a great analogy. i'm not sure that's what i was thinking at the time but who knows? as far as pulling classic jerry moves....every day. we all do. i won an emmy last month and as i was walking up the steps to get the award i just kept thinking "don't fall...don't fall". if i had fallen it would have been another "jerry" moment that i would hear about forever even though i won the award for a different show. lol :)
i've thought about this question many many times so credit for the question goes to me. ;) the answer is ... 1 li'l sebastian-sized aziz. :)
i thank god every day that the acting thing worked out. otherwise i have no idea what i'd be doing. i guess because i'm a talker and a bit gregarious that i could have gone into sales but honestly i don't know. a lot of my family around me are in the trades...like pipe coverers and fitters. i'm too damn uncoordinated and lazy to do that so again...thank you god for letting this work out!!!!! :)
totally thought up by aubrey during the last commercial break. my favorite part when watching the video is how the other cast members reacted when they realized what was happening. aubrey is a super funny person. she knew it wouldn't be funny to make out with pratt or scott. she knew it had to be with the old fat guy to get the real laugh. i was happy to oblige. :)
the joke was funny but his laugh made it legendary
i typed "please bring me to a site on the interwebs called reddit that will let me answer questions". ;)
i think it's multiple reasons, including that one. in season two, it's mentioned that he had plastic surgery, and he explains that it was in the wake of getting hit by a fire truck. in season six, he tells chris that he gained "a lot of sympathy weight" and that he used to look like chris before he had kids. so what this means is gayle fell in love with a very different-looking person - a skinnier and probably better-looking pre-accident gary, who still had a massive schlong, and probably still had his kind, gentle personality. we see the photo album of the experiences he had with gayle, and he mentions how much he valued going home to his family right at 5 - they built a solid foundation for their relationship, which means after all of what changed, she still loved him because they'd build such a strong marriage, and also because of his massive schlong.
i've never been able to see if i have mumps. when i go to look i'm always distracted by the largest penis i have ever seen. ;)
nothing but nature that night. i didn't know that was going to happen. aubrey leaned over and said "you wanna make out during the li'l sebastian song". within .01 seconds i said yes. as a guy who doesn't get roles as the romantic lead i listened to rob lowe's advice. just follow whatever the girl does. so when we started kissing and i felt aubrey tongue make its move i knew all bets were off. lol i'll be on seth meyers next wednesday, june 14th. check it out. maybe aubrey will surprise me and we'll make out again. mmmm ;)
thank you so much. i love that scene too. any jerry's on the crew? yes! because i love them all so much i will not name names but i can tell you that there was the occasional mishap caused by the same person many times. lol of course we still loved him. :)
i'm obviously not him but i think the show ended perfectly. i don't know if they can top that ending.
my best bud was retta (donna). our trailers were back to back so we spent a lot of time going between them. our characters were not initially brought on as series regulars so i think that bonded us right off the bat. we were both in limbo together while things were working themselves out. i had lunch with retta last week. she's one of my favs in life. :)
huge billy joel fan. i was on a show yesterday talking about his song "my life" as one of my all time favorites. billy tries to avoid me because of the christie brinkley issue. he knows i could have taken her away from him. easy! lol ;)
awesome question. really something i've never thought about. i would say that initially they would get along great. they're both very devoted to family and inherently good people. the journey that lenny ends up on is not something jerry would ever go along with so their friendship wouldn't last. a night out for them would definitely involved a sundae. :)
awesome question. wow! i'm not sure which way to go. on one had pratt has turned himself into a physical machine. on the other hand nick is very smart and might be able to outmaneuver chris. damn...i have to go with a draw. :)
dj roomba haunts my dreams. i still wake up thinking i hear him coming down the hall. even talking about it now has me on edge. ;)
mr. o'heir? who the hell is that? lol great question. there's certainly a part of jerry in jim. at least i hope so. i think that jerry is a very kind and caring person. i would like to think that i have those attributes as well. unfortunately i don't have the temperament that jerry has. i can upset and people know it. jerry just seems to let it all roll off his shoulders. i've always been a kind of people pleaser. i'm not sure how healthy that is but it's who i am. i've gotten better as i've gotten older which makes me happy but ultimately it's in my core to try and make people feel comfortable...sometimes at my own expense. damn. i need therapy now! lol ;)
the kardashian outtake is one of the funniest moments i've ever experience on any set ever. chris pratt is so damn funny and he hits you with it when you least expect it. for those who don't know what i'm talking about just go to you tube and type in parks and rec and kardashian. you'll love it. :)
while i'm doing this reddit i've also been texting with the cast of p&r. i have a parks fam text link on my phone. we're always in contact whether it's to break balls or share what's going on with our lives. the love you see on the screen only works because it was real off screen. :)
people always ask about regrets. i don't think they're very healthy and certainly aren't going to help us today. that being said...one of my regrets is not being involved in my high school theater department. when i was a kid you were labeled depending on what you did or who you hang out with. there were the burn outs, stoners, jocks, brains and a few others i'm probably forgetting. in my day if you were part of the theater crowd you were known as a drama fag. unfortunately i let that term stop me from doing something that i probably would have loved. words are powerful and when you're young you don't realize that it just doesn't matter. if i could go back to those days now knowing what i do i'd be happy to be called a drama fag. :) tell them to work hard and enjoy every minute. they will also make friendships that will last a lifetime. :)
the popular answer is going to be offerman but imo it's aubrey plaza.
i have soooo many favorite episode of parks. the one i like to always mention is the season 2 episode called "the hunting trip". i think it's one of my all time favs because it was the first time we were all out of the office together (other than april and andy) and you got to see who we were in that world. the scene where donna (the awesome retta) realizes her mercedes has been shot is one of my all time favorite scenes of the whole series. i also loved the harvest festival and the episode where ben and jerry had their day out together. ben had set up a special day for he and leslie but she wasn't available. he ended up doing everything with jerry. so damn funny. i can honestly tell you that there is no least favorite episode that we shot. not trying to avoid the question...there just wasn't. i have great memories of all of them. :)
great question. mike schur doesn't get talked about enough. i can tell you that, in my opinion, mike is a comic genius. he knows what works and what doesn't. we were lucky to have mike with us throughout the run. many times a show creator (runner) will leave after a show becomes successful because they'll be given other opportunities to start new projects. mike did start new projects (brooklyn nine-nine) but never left us. his voice is in every episode of p&r. i think that's why the show never lost its strength. mike never handed us off to someone else. between him and amy they were our fearless leaders and they took great care of us. :)
i love them too. thank you. they love to roll and creative tons of dirt in my house. lol when they play fight it gets so intense that sometimes i think they must have hurt each other. they run at full speed and just smack into each other. two seconds later they do it again and their tales are wagging. crazy but so fun to watch. they both love the dog park too. and of course walks. :)
you saw me in roseanne? that's awesome. unfortunately i've never been on that show. lol but seriously, i used to watch roseanne and would have loved to have been on it...but sadly no. you must have me confused with some other shockingly handsome well hung guy. ;) as far as the reboot goes...i'm not sure. some things are better left alone. :)
fart attack is definitely classic. i like the old school original with mark brandanowicz. we were playing a game in the office that jerry never wanted to play. we had to dig dirt up on each other. jerry finally relents and says to mark "i hear you've got two unpaid parking tickets" (big f'ing deal) and mark says "i hear your adoptive mother smokes pot". he looks at me and realizes he's hit a nerve. he says "i'm sorry. you didn't know your mom smoked pot?" jerry says..."i didn't know i was adopted". the first and best burn for me. :)
there were so many outtakes that should never see the light of day. lol we did some filthy silly stuff sometimes. on the other hand we also all had our moments of brilliance when we were doing a fun run so i'm sure there's some stuff that i've forgotten that would have been fun to see in the show. ultimately our co creator mike schur always did what was best for the show. he would never put in a guaranteed laugh if it didn't move the story forward. :)
aubrey and i dated for ten years before we eventually broke up due to a side relationship i was having with joan calamezzo. it wasn't easy on any of us and i take full responsibility for the breakup. that being said it didn't help with aubrey started dating joe from the sewage department. that really hurt. ;) lol
i just heard about that minutes ago. i feel terrible. she was a very very sweet lady. for those who don't know glenne played ben's mother on parks. we had a lot of fun with her son set. what a shame. she was way too young. :(
final seasons (and episodes) are tough. i think the pressure to go out with an amazing story is tough to do. i know i'm biased but i think that the writers at parks nailed it. i love the time jump and the fact that we get to see where these characters end up. some of my favorites shows didn't quite nail it for me but parks did. again...i'm a bit biased. lol :)
your character on pandr ends up living to be 100 years old. i always thought it would be funnier if instead of chris traeger, jerry somehow would be the the first man that that ends up living to be 150. did that idea ever come up from anyone working on the show?
when the writers realized that jerry was going to be the office punching bag they also realized that they had to give him some reason not to blow his head off. lol they decided that ultimately jerry would have the best life of any one of the characters. jerry's wife and kids adored him and thought he did no wrong. don't forget...they also gave him a huge penis. i like when real life and tv life come together. ;)
he just has to have a pill inserted in it every hour for the rest of his life.
i heard from some friends that they met you near kansas city at karaoke and said you were so wonderful and nice to them. i really hope it was a true story because you seem like such a nice person and they really like you in p&r! maybe i'll see you if you're here again!
sooo... when's the sequel coming? ann and chris in michigan? house of cards-esque drama with leslie and ben? full house with you and gail? please. i need this.
i loved your cameo in brooklyn 99 as the homophobic cop in florida.
because we're all going to run out and watch it anyway in support of him. *obviously.*
you responding to my question while i'm at work makes this one of the best days at the office for me, thanks!
i remember there was a bit in nick offerman's first book about how hollywood types were baffled when he started doing any kind of comedy because he was originally a theater guy. i've always really enjoyed it myself when an actor i love steps out of their typical bounds. definitely gonna have to look into middle man.
politics aside, he's still the archetypical "man's man"
that's pretty much it. nick is such a great guy and so is ron. they just took nick to an nth degree. what he did with that character was something i have never seen on another show. i've always been confused on why he never received an emmy for his work. :)
that's so so wonderful of you to adopt and take care of these dogs! i wish you could share a couple pictures of them with us.
i just want to comment that you ending your comments with smiley faces makes me envision your goofy happy smile on parks and rec when jerry is showing off his family to (i think) leslie for the first time and that makes me smile too
jerry, i hate to break it to you but... li'l sebastian is dead
damn. should have read this before my previous comment. i guess nick and lil' sebastian are going to have to fight this one out. :)
'literally'. by rob lowe. "it's literally, the best fragrance."
i'm sure they "loved" being around the two of you. ;)
holy crap, can't believe you actually answered me! thank you! in all seriousness though, my wife and i loved parks and rec immensely. we went through some really tough times due to medical complications, but you guys were always there to cheer us up. for a lot of people tv shows are an escape, but parks and rec will always be something more for us. thanks to you and the rest of the cast for helping us when we needed it most.
haha thanks for responding! i will check out your new movie and try not to let your above average acting skills distract me from the plot.
let scrubs serve as a testament to this truth, spoken here on this day.
i love this because donna also showed jerry so much warmth on the show (in her own way). it makes me so happy that you're pals outside the show.
sorry to offend you by calling you mister, sir. force of habit from the fire service. i'm just glad that i got an answer from one of my favorite actors
this is going to mean so much to them. the last play they did was called the box and it was all about being labeled and bullying in middle school. these words are going to be the message they need to give them that push. thank you for helping. you are a great person.
i figured the popular answer probably would've been chris pratt but i was kinda hoping it was aziz ansari
jerry and ben taking the dance class together was the best part of that episode.
as great as the ama is, this is probably my favorite exchange. mistaken for another actor, still responds in the nicest possible way. you're alright, tim.
"that man has the largest penis i have ever seen. i actually don't even know if he has mumps; forgot to look. i was distracted by the largest penis i have ever seen."
i completely agree. the episode where jerry retires and leslie comes over to talk with him because she felt like they didn't give him a good farewell was one of my favorites. leslie sees how jerry is adored by h is family. she also sees that he's awesome around his house. he's funny, smart, quick reflexes. leslie acts likes she's been thrown to some other dimension. the writers on parks always knew how to handle each situation. i thought it was a brilliant idea. :)
i get the feeling they did this to make it up to the actor for all of the abuse he took. that and his hot wife. i always wondered how actors with characters like this can compartmentalize the experience of being verbally/psychologically abused. i mean, i know it isn't real but the writers are making fun of their physical representation of the character which is their actual physical appearance irl. i am guessing it is easier for adult actors but what about younger ones who are still developing psychologically? for example, anne from arrested development. there were some really cutting comments about her on that show and i have to assume it stung a bit.
i remember that tweet. sniff sniff lol all good!!!!! :)
i want to see the saga of gary gergich, mayor of pawnee.
i didn't know i wanted this. now i know i'll never have it. why do you do this? who hurt you?
i'm just now watching it and the surprise cameos are one of the best parts of the show. between mr. oheir and like every side character from its always sunny, its been amazing.
i was distracted by the **largest penis** i have ever seen
nick offerman doesn't act, he's just himself and people film him.
are you suggesting that anyone besides maybe ben wyatt, human disaster, would ever lift a hand against lil' sebastian? the very thought is rocking me to my core right now.
punctuation can fix that. doctor, who is overrated?
god damnit why doesn't she ever ask me to hardcore make out?
did you just pee yourself? just a dab... you nasty jerry.
dunno, we see a very different side of him on master of none, which i think is probably closer to him irl.
+1000 points for actually responding to comments. kudos to you jim, and to /u/cipherstone
the absolute confusion on leslie's face. good times.
my favorite scene was when jerry told chris that before having kids, he looked pretty mu ch like chris. in one short part of a scene we see chris' psyche shatter again and see a glimpse of jerry's backstory
the relationship between ben and jerry (heh) was so awesome. i loved how ben was so much more conscious of how terrible jerry was treated by everyone, and then jerry noticed that ben noticed, and would stop ben from intervening and in a subtle way would let him know it's ok and he's used to it. such awesome chemistry between characters in that show.
that's an interesting insight. yes. when they're making fun of a characters physical attributes they are also making fun of the actors in a way. personally i've never been bothered by it. i've been a big guy all my life so weight jokes come with the territory. that being said maybe i should get myself some therapy and figure some shit out. lol :)
omg bless your soul, jim. i'm not even religious and i can't think of another thing to say. you're the best.
who other than artemis? i've only recently started watching it's always sunny so i have probably missed the connections !
i literally read it in aziz ansari's voice before i even knew what it said so yeah i agree.
i know it's supposed to be a crazy reveal, but in the hunting episode he says he has brothers... something like "i usually watch the football game with my brothers on thanksgiving, maybe you can come over and shoot me in the head!" so it wasn't the surprise that the joke was supposed to be, and how he was like "ugh, yes i have a brother. one brother"... made no sense
i agree. master of none (which is brilliant) is more like aziz in my opinion. i love watching him do his thing on that show. he also writes it with alan yang who was one of our parks writers. two really smart guys for sure. :)
really? that's surprising to me considering the way he acts and how enthusiastic he is in his comedy shows. i guess things aren't always as they seem.
the showrunners also did not have favorable things to say about him. it says quite a bit that brendanaquitz is never mentioned again after he leaves, as if the writers are just erasing him from memory.
boom! two ankle bracelets. the judge said it's the first time he's ever had to do that. uh, ja boiz a question on the baaaaar exaaaaam~!
"that man has the largest penis i have ever seen. i don't even know if he has mumps. i was distracted. by the largest penis... i have ever seen."
that plus ben's near obsession with how he was married to his wife were just perfect.
you should start at season 2 though, not at season 5. if you have the time you can watch the few episodes in s1 but you don't really have to.
by the later seasons ben was essentially a permenant break in the fourth wall. he was an extension of the viewer, reacting how a normal person would to all the ludicrous behavior. and i loved that.
there was only ever one possibility. and yet, it's always worth the rewatch.
consider this a lesson learned about the importance of headphones.
yes. a time share in muncie can certainly sway a girls head. but jerry's other "head" is what probably turned her head. lol
i'm understanding now why everyone on the cast of parks and recreation has always had such wonderful things to say about you. you have a wicked sense of humour and such a positive outlook.
well toby was one of the writers and later the showrunner, so you'd have to think he was ok with doing it to himself.
the waitress, gail the snail, bill ponderosa, uncle jack off the top of my head
i have three nannies suing me right now. one of them for no reason
yah it was a talk with most of the cast and the head writer and someone asked what the funniest joke was in their opinion. and the writer was like goddamn chris just came up with it
sometimes i can't tell if i love or hate that show. i love the concept and the social issues that are explored in the show, but something about aziz's acting throws me off. he has that aziz joking tone all the time and i can sort of still hear it or feel it during some of his more serious lines. maybe i'll check it out again because this was a long time ago.
he quit. then chris and ben were written in and the show reached new levels of awesome.
i think alao because there was probably no chance of a return that they figured best to remove him
maybe my favorite jean ralphio quote of them all. i mean its pretty hard to choose. but this may be his best moment.
wait, wait. i worry what you just heard was "give me a lot of bacon and eggs." what i said was, "give me all the bacon and eggs you have." do you understand?
oh yeah. i love that. he just brings it up from time to time.
no normal person would have the genius to create the cones of dunshire.
nah, they coulda been jealous of that burrito he fell into the river for.
damn, jerry. never knew you had all these dirty jokes in you.
you should hear some of his podcast appearances. he's a natural. he seriously needs to make his own podcast!
i find many writers who insert themselves into shows really try and make fun of themselves. the creator of workaholics always makes subtle jokes about whatever ~~kyle~~karl is doing at the time. i think he's the writer...
tell me more about your memories of raggedy anne and andy.
ben (stands on chair): i like larry! he is a good friend, and a fine man, with an inexplicably gorgeous wife, i mean, to the point where it makes no sense at all, sorry, getting off track, he is a nice person! and we should all stand up, and say **i...like...** tom: ben! no! what are you doing!?
come on, he was the one who laughed the hardest at chris pratt's comeback joke!
i thought it was that they really liked the second actress, mae whitman, and decided to keep her on. and most of the comments about mayonegg were more about how unmemorable she is rather than any specific features, so i don't think it would have been quite as difficult as if they'd been picking on her for a gap in her teeth or the way she walked.
like when he sensually touches pam's leg, realizes his mistake, and in a moment of pure awkward panic decides to announce his move to costa rica. to escape the awkwardness, he proceeds to hop a 10ft fence and jog home (possibly miles? lol), leaving his car in the trapped parking lot. yeah mindy wrote that episode.
everyone who worked in the annex early on, not in the last season, was a writer. it let them not need to be on screen at all times but still in the show!
i knew they were all writers, but i never put together why it made sense they were all together. no idea how i didn't put that together. thanks!
christy brinkley was fantastic in that role too. her constant joy and grace was perfect.
kinda makes all the jokes where the main staff (actors) make fun of the weirdos in the annex (writers) a little better too! :)
since our videos are advertiser friendly, it hasn't hit us too hard directly.. but it was part of what prompted us to build floatplane club so that we and other creators would have ways to make money in the event that our adsense revenue got ripped away.. so it's definitely costing us money, but only because we're re-investing what we're making.
well i'm getting some now, so that should give you some idea :p
firetruck unboxing video. i wouldn't even hate it so much if it didn't have more views than all of the good stuff i've ever done. if it didn't make so much money in adsense from 5 year olds just watching "the next suggested video about firetrucks" i'd pull it down. it's an embarrassment.
i personally really like kickfarted but not every kickstarter product we order is spectacularly bad enough to feature in the series, but we will probably revisit it.
7 gamers 1 cpu was one of the most exciting projects i've done. i'll always remember the moment it worked as one of the highlights of my career. that's really where i get off - spending a ton of time on something, not being sure that it's going to work, and then seeing the end result be awesome. scrapyard wars season 1 will also hold a special place in my heart forever. that was where we began experimenting with the idea of being a "tech top gear" rather than just a review channel and that path we took continues to shape our content (even our reviews which contain more personalities and funny stuff and more little sketches than ever) to this day.
this. i found it really jarring in the final episode of the last season where you had the team talking about finishing their benchmarks and then instantly it changes frames completley and jay is starting to review them. then after about 5mins the winner was decided and it was over. seems a real shame to have this 3hour or so build up, only to have the big reveal over in about 10mins.
yeah dennis and i were both really pleased with it.
probably at some point and so much has changed so there is a lot to show :)
he wants to make this stupid nonsensical movie that is just actually dumb. this was an idea he had 5 years ago and he still wants to do it. super cheese fest with stupid techy nerdy junk.
i think berkel holds the record for most expensive stuff broken... he got out of his chair, which caused the air shock to spring up, knocking over a 34" lg ultrawide back when they were brand new (about $1500us iirc). i was also (somewhat) responsible for taking our sony fs700 out for a shoot in the rain (brandon let me do it, so it's partly on him). it didn't work for a few days and we had to disassemble it to the greatest degree we could to dry it out.. scary times. that was in the early days when we couldn't have afforded to replace it :p
yes. i highly recommended linus brand cable ties. they are available in any colour and style you want as long as you want orange with my face on it.
so when luke, linus, and i would drive from ncix late at night on fridays (we would carpool) the conversations always went: 1) are we friends? 2) linus media group is a stupid company name. this went on for a few months, without fail.
tv. or i guess our own platform, float plane club.
reading positive, supportive comments like this one. i also love spending time reading stories to my kids and playing with them and playing badminton.
being up in western canada makes collaboration a little tougher.. and i'm pretty asocial by nature so i haven't generally gone out of my way to "collab" - especially because many collabs are just blatant subscriber swaps "hey sub to me and sub to him/her and get a chance to win" but i've also known a lot of the people in the tech tuber scene for years and really enjoy spending time with them. so it's nice to have an excuse to hang out and make a video. i'm not like sending them dick pics on snapchat or whatever though.
eventually, and completely. it will be it's own building.
depends how the first one goes. if we lose buckets of money, then no. if we lose a little bit of money, then probably. if we break even or make money, then game on!
i want the wireless logitech mice. do you hear me, logitech? give them to me.
we will be making a video about that very soon :p
my favorite camera currently is my fuji xt-2, imho its the best stills camera i have had the pleasure of using day to day
i prefer 'guided' where you have an arc planned out and you have the meat of what you want to say written but it's not word for word
i suck at it :p but seriously, i have no social life, so it's just work/family, which makes it a bit easier. i get one night a week to go out and play badminton and other than that i go home and spend time wiht the kids. i've also significantly cut back on the time i spend working on the weekends. so it's not too bad at this point.
i want to make a movie trailer. not a movie. just a trailer. but with badass high production values so it would be a ton of fun to shoot. it'd be basically a bunch of sketches back to back without having to deal with the boring parts of making a movie like real dialogue and a story arc and character development. i just can't figure out how to fund it other than stealing $100,000+ from the lmg coffers and putting it in a firepit...
it's not that i'm not spending time making content, it's just that i'm involved in overseeing the process rather than actually doing it.
for most of us at the start, it took a lot of hours, low pay (so linus could afford to keep us going), and corner cutting. actually, it sounds like not much has changed. nevermind. for my hire so far, and the people i hire in the future, i don't really hold chasing fame against them. motivation is motivation.
i am, i've been very busy with other projects and there are a lot of windows only apps that i need so i will likely be splitting my system in half with unraid.
one of them is literally fused in there.. i"d have to cut it off. so... no...
lots of things... if i ever stop making tech videos, you'll see them.
ehhhh kinda but it's easy to regret things with a project like scrapyard wars. its an insane wrap up of rapid fire decision making and prioritisation. by design not everything will go perfectly.
i'm trying to make sure that they don't. =) that's my job.
they are maxine's nails she is the newest shooter on the team
'we're a media company that makes videos for the internet'
that's actually the sentiment every year when looking back.
i want the nvidia shield portable to get updated. it's frickin awesome. as for tech that needs to stop.. fitness trackers need to stop or start being accurate. as it is now they're just jewelry imo.
they were broken down and put in the pile. a lot of the stuff is engineering samples so we can't sell it or give it away, but it's still functional so maybe we'll find a use for it.
everyframeapainting, wisecrack, nerdwriter1, philip defranco i have a huge respect for all those guys.
no. i am seriously considering going to school part time for project management however.
it's growing much faster than expected, i'll still be around tho!
no plans. trying to recreate the magic of an earlier video by making it again is rarely a successful formula.
t'would be lit af, but no plans for that at the moment. i don't want to mess with the purity of nicky v's vision
i get to smell him on a daily basis. sometimes he doesn't notice and sometimes he just pretends not to notice. so far, the same amount. xd things don't get easier, we just try to do more/different things
they can call it "linux with linus (but not that linus)"
there are positives and negatives to both but ultimately where we are now imo is better than its ever been in many ways.
put all my parts under mineral oil then it failed to post. i fixed it.. but damn..
its dope, they do a lot really cool stuff with blocking and composition and i liked that they try to keep the show somewhat grounded in reality.
he doesn't really wanna answer our stupid questions
new shows and ideas are a constant thing that we think about so always looking to do new challenging ideas. keeps life interesting
knowing linus they will be able to go down whatever path they want and he will support them ferociously.. as long as it's productive, has any possibility to succeed.. and isn't being a stripper.
tech for the sake of tech is lame. i kid. gaming is awesome.
the end game is to make videos with people i love working with. and no i want nothing to do with physical inventory. i played that game. it's no fun.
hello friend. it doesn't offer nearly the range of capabilities that we plan to offer. this is the short and simple answer. fpc isn't just early access video. more will be clear on launch. :d
tech is great that way. there's always something new - sometimes great and sometimes terrible - to get excited about or crap on. we're really lucky to have so much inspiration.
actually quite a lot. if someone here feels strongly enough about an idea it will be questioned and examined but generally if they persist they will be allowed to do it.. thing is i'd the audience doesn't get on board fairly strongly you'll just never be able to do it again. which is fair. its actually quite a lot of freedom, ive taken advantage of it a lot and don't take it for granted.
i have a video review on the red 8k helium cameras that we got, should be on its way mid july
infrastructure is doing very well. design and front end dev is not. we are quite a few months from launch because of this.
how's floatplaneclub going? better or worse than you expected at this point?
one of the reasons the community respects and trusts ltt: you are not afraid to call out companies regardless of your relationship with them.
estimated earnings for the firetruck video is 12 grand. i can see why xd
any plans on doing any videos on crowd funded items that were actually good?
evidently making a pile of cash and getting loads of exposure is against their brand values...
"tech top gear" i'm imagining linus and luke being dropped into the bolivian jungle and having to build pc's out of sticks and snake carcasses.
yeah i felt the same way. build up was great, climax was too fast
so no big reaction to how they just won against a watercooled 980ti?
i kinda missed an overview over what ended up being in the machines. felt like i had to write it down myself while watching.
not sure if you frequent reddit, but there has been huge support and want for a "tech talks with linus" sorta thing where it is just down to earth discussion
just 'cause people have asked, i'm not going to schedule it.
you've told me enough. i want to see it. start a gofundme
linus, i've literally just put my tissues away from crying about the loss of berkel. why must you re-ignite such fresh pain. *sobs*
it's too bad there's no way to filter the supportive ones from the "we hate your thumbnails. unsubscribed!" ones.
"i'm not like sending them dick pics on snapchat or whatever though." umm... that's... oddly specific...
this makes me feel as if you two are breaking up :(
as someone from the east coast.. i really hope there's at least a second year.
i'll assume it's to future-proof, and with 8k footage you can digitally zoom in a lot (assuming good sensor quality and low iso, to keep grain and whatnot down) and still maintain 1080p or 4k quality. but to be honest i really don't know. i'm just taking a shot in the dark. but knowing ltt it's likely for a very good reason.
linus free styling on wan show is probably my favorite thing on the channel, when he starts pulling chipset development history out of his ass it's amazing. luke does the same when talking games, and did for vr too, till oculus hurt his soul.
i don't know man. they may be good buy your videos still have a unique charm to them.
is work still pretty social for you? or has the corporate growth caused you to distance from some of your staff from a friendship perspective?
you're producing children? for linus? i am so confused.
that's fair enough i suppose. it not only appears to be an amazing work environment, but you get to be "famous" too! on that note, what are the basic qualifications you look for when you do hiring? who was the least qualified to be on your team before joining?
maybe virtualizating windows through iommu would help you? i'm going for a new setup with ryzen and definitely going that way
it's a valid concern and i'm happy you take that into account.
a common misconception. that series was a ton of fun to make and generated far more views and notoriety than we could have possible hoped for. huge success.
as someone with an m.b.a. and a assortment of certifications for business management, i would recommend getting an pmp rather then a full college experience.
we all know that [current year + 1] will be the year of linux desktop!
that's one of the main reasons for me at least. if not the biggest reason. never sell out.
it's actually around 64 grand. linus gets around 8 bucks per 1000 views.

rocket league in real life was really exciting at the time. it hadn't really been done and we thought with some more production values channel super fun had the opportunity to go viral. but it didn't really work out that way.
it's possible paul just got a better overclock still. his card was air cooled, but goddamn that was a massive cooler.
duly noted.. it's something we're considering, but we also don't want to force ourselves to create content because it's "popular". there's a fine line between engaging with the community and pandering. just trying to stay on the former side of it.

basic qualifications would be some sort of knowledge of how to shoot or edit (depending on the job, obviously), the ability to speak english (mostly), and being able to adapt to situations that may be out of the norm or unexpected. i think the last one is very important because the turn around times we have. if something goes wrong then we have to move things around so that we can still have something go up and when you do daily content, that means lots of different things have to change directions at the same time. looking for structure in something so dynamic is a bit of a pipe dream. so that's something i'm definitely keeping an eye out in the people i'll end up hiring.
virtualization with iommu is amazing, i've set it up recently and it's great how when i want to play a windows-only game i don't have to reboot (thus losing any sort of work flow i might've initiated) and still keep around 95% of my hardware's power
i think that was what made me subscribe, had seen other videos but, something about the lunacy of standing in a bathtub or something plugged in computer hardware just, i dunno, it was compelling lol.

it was kind of boring, long, and unstructured. very unstructured. it was all over the place. but also boring and long. also, i ran out of time.
yeah but it's true. right now i could setup a linux box for my friends or parents and they'd have no problem using it for a few days, but once they want to start installing software it will all fall apart. for most of the linux software out there you can't just download and run the installer. i'd have to tech them how to use the distro software repository and even then it may not have what they're looking for. the trouble with most linux developers is that they either don't know how or don't like making things dead simple, and that's what you need for mainstream success.

yeah i know silicone lottery plays a much more important role and noise levels were completely useless for scrapyard wars anyway. its still impressive though that they even managed to get that gpu
how about "tech walks with linus"? you can talk honestly about tech issues while walking places, climbing over cars, wading through bushes etc.

i heard he plans on doing daily vlogs. his first video is going to be "why i left linus media group". should be really interesting.
i love that video. shit was raw emotion. i couldnt stop grinning like an idiot.

sure, but that kinda feels like the death of channelsuperfun though.
we still got ~~jian yang~~ dennis to keep the show rolling. all jokes aside, i do agree. berkel was fantastic on camera and added that extra flair that made a lot of the videos enjoyable.
very sobering. "oh wow my life has changed". i had to sit down and think about what my life would be like going forward. i am responsible, to a large extent, for the success of the nerf dart gun line. yes
high performance dart guns were originally based on my patents. i hold them in high regard. i'm a nuclear engineer, and engineers aren't known for their humor.
i went and gave a talk at a school, years ago, after the super soaker first came out. i told them that i had invented it, and they didn't believe me. i left the school with them never really accepting the idea that i had invented the water gun.
backpack tanks or hose attachments might be the peak
jammin' jet. it was commercialized. it was a water propelled airplane that was pumped just like a super soaker with water shooting out the back, propelling it into flight. the manufacturer changed the design of the plane to fly in a circle, but didn't adjust the wings so as it turned it would roll and dive into the ground. usually causing the plane to break after the first launch. exciting toy, exciting commercial, disappointing in the end.
i got the idea in '82, had a number of false starts, and it wasn't until '89 that i made the presentation to larami. it was on the market a year later in 1990 as the "power drencher". we changed the name in '91 to super soaker and because of the consistent sales success in both years by word of mouth, larami decided to run tv commercials. in 1992 it became the number 1 selling toy in the world.
your friend sounds like a douche lol. always gotta 1-up, huh? supersoaker was pay2win lol
i wouldn't phrase it that way. i would phrase it as hard-ball, hardcore business. one would like to see businesses operate more on principle as opposed to what they can get away with legally.
i have worked with and been funded by the department of defense in the past for my inventions. it's probably better that i not comment on the specifics of those contracts however.
i went to the toy store one day and saw a number of guns being sold under the n-strike name, and my royalty check did not reflect the number of guns i saw in the store. i took out my contract and did a close review. inventing energy converting technology and batteries that will be 2x better than lithium ion.
having high pressure and a relatively large nozzle. however, as you go to higher pressure and the water comes out faster, the stream breaks up in the air and limits how much further the water travels. there's an optimum combination of pressure and nozzle size.
i once used a super soaker to unclog a plugged up water drain at my home.
i wanted to be an engineer long before i knew that "engineer" was the term that described what i wanted to do. i was tinkering as a little kid. always curious about the way things worked. since that time, what i've done has been to be persistent. so perseverance and continuing to hone your skills is the key to being successful in anything you do.
the monster was the largest gun that larami produced. it was very badass in its look. but the seals around the nozzle had manufacturing defects that were not corrected, and it did not deliver on the promise that the appearance presented. it was a dual nozzle version of the cps 2500, and would've been great if it worked as well as the 2500.
i have in the past. we used to routinely get them when we were focused on improving them and redesigning them. but at this point in time i'm not really active in that sector.
i really appreciate the compliments people give about the water gun. it makes me want to do more to improve quality of life. i'm hopeful that my new technologies will help improve more lives. in fact, the heat pump that i was working on when i got the idea for the super soaker was being made to address an environmental problem.
yes and no. i do have a display of super soakers and i have a display of prototypes we built over the years. my collection is not complete, there are some that got away. periodically i'll go on ebay to find ones out of production, and some are stored away to protect them. the room in the background of my proof picture is the prototype "museum" we have at my laboratory.
when i made the super soaker i was trying to make a high performance water gun. the desire to make a high performance water gun occurred when i was shooting a stream of water from a nozzle i hooked to a bathroom sink while working on an air conditioner that would use water as a coolant instead of freon.
i have an invention on the galileo spacecraft which went to jupiter, and my fellow engineers at jpl were skeptical that it would successfully solve the problem we ran into. it went to jupiter in support of a very successful mission. i also invented an engine that converts heat into electricity more efficiently than perhaps any other engine and it has no moving mechanical parts. super soaker remains what i am most known for. i am confident that history will be kind to me.
that never occurred to me that people would do that with a water gun, but my philosophy is that everyone is an inventor. everyone has creative ideas, and hopefully most of them are productive.
i could be wrong. it'll stick around, but i suspect it'll go the way of the hula hoop.
yes. eventually jtec technology will mature and become widely used. the nuclear community is very conservative with respect to implementing new technology and want to rely on the tried and true. but eventually the performance of the jtec will warrant its use in nuclear applications.
one of the keys to success is realizing that there are many things that can go wrong with a given idea, but my strategy has been to develop multiple inventions to put the odds in my favor. also to persevere. it's important to know when to quit, i'm just not very good at it.
i knew it would be successful because i knew it was a fun toy, but i didn't anticipate it to be a number 1 toy in the world. that's not something one can predict.
i had one that would be a great super soaker in a water war. it was a rapid refill model that when you ran out of water you put the nozzle up directly to a water source and it refilled your gun automatically.
i was designing space craft before i was designing super soakers. that being said, when you present a really innovative idea the general reaction is usually skepticism if it is something they are not familiar with or have seen before. people don't usually accept radically new ideas readily.
the super soaker and nerf allowed me to pursue the other projects that i'm working on.
first off, you can't make money unless someone knows about it. secondly, i was willing to put my idea out there and to lose as long as i learned from the experience. i felt that subsequent ideas i had i would be able to use that experience to become successful.
i know this comment is really late to the party, but we'd love to see you over on /r/nerf. you're kind of like a god to us.
i worked in the nuclear field on submarines for a couple of years. *somebody* has to have a sense of humor to decide to put handwheels in the least comfortable or usable spots
honestly, there's something to these jokes about alpha radiation, they really make me go hehehe
i believed you, lonnie! (i went to school with aneka.)
that's interesting. i had a toy as a kid that was a similar concept but it was just a plastic rocket. you pumped it up for a while and then it shot off propelled by the water pressure. did you have any hand in that?
the name power drencher is funny. it sounds like the cheap dollar store knock off super soaker.
for real, i know it's been a while since the ama, but you really made summers a blast. your story is really inspiring, too. i've always thought they should make a movie about you.
working with dod on top secret super soaker project. not a question he can answer in an open setting. story checks out
are they 2x energy dense as li-ion? capable of high discharge? there are huge implications if that's the case. as much as i love the super soaker, which i do, battery technology is where it's at and will be your legacy that actually matters in the history books!
are compact flow laminisers just too expensive to mass-produce to prevent stream breakup? or is it not turbulent flow that causes the issue?
thanks, now i have an excuse to buy one as an adult and the wife can't complain as thats what the inventor uses them for:-)
i guess that way she doesn't have to hit the shower before she heads back out. super doucher 50.
i just got the wind knocked out of me when i saw you replied. thank you so much for taking the time to answer these questions with real responses.
i would love to see a video series of your guidance and experiences on filling out a patent on your own. any suggested books?
thank you for the response and taking the time to do an ama. super soakers were a fantastic part of my childhood; a favorite, actually.
the super soaker sector is still wet with money, i hear
you already made the world a better place. it's awesome you're still going. you freaking rock dude i think you're my new hero.
wow, is anyone else amazed that the creator of super soaker goes on ebay to find models he didnt get???
a swamp cooler? i always thought the biggest issue was you were pushing cold air in, but never pulling cold air out and the temperature of the cold air going in was never cold enough to make a difference. never any circulation. i grew up without true ac and swamp coolers is all we had.
you're my hero. genius. impervious to outside criticism and jealousy and simply make awesome shit. thanks for doing what you do, it's greatly appreciated:)
napalm can be pretty productive.... rather the threat of napalm can make others productive for you! ;)
what is this solid state battery? and when will it be ready for release? may i buy some stock in the company releasing said battery?
somebody above mentioned there should be a movie about you - and now it's obvious - there needs to be a remake of the hudsucker proxy but instead of tim robbins and hula hoops, it's you and super soakers.
wait, i'm confused; if you received the patent, what did you miss? couldn't you have sued whoever marketed it, since you had ip protection in place?
hopefully quite well, nerf and supersoaker were most of my summers as a kid.
i saw you said you did your first patent on your own. do you have any videos or documents highlighting your experience? thank you for your reply.
it's so you can fuck up your knuckles on angle irons and bulkheads, duh
same here, you would pump it up and then pull back on the little handle and it would shoot up. i know this toy. red translucent top and white bottom/fins.
but they made the punisher game which was one of my favorite nes games.
born in 88 and just had my mind blown. thought these were around for years.
dude's rich and a nuclear engineer. . . they're totally using him for super soaker action. . . /s
good luck; if you want one powerful enough to do that you'll have to find it used. all the new "current-gen" super soakers are pretty small.
stop trying to mail half eaten sandwiches to your future self.
can't help but think of a dedicated scientist working for years to create some piece of advanced equipment only to have some buffoon come along and use it as a cheese grader
a guy named thundercool, receiving advice from a guy who embodies thundercool. that's thundercool, man.
i think everyone can identify with looking at unattainable models online.
swamp coolers are used in arid environments where the humidity is low. the evaporation of the water within the swamp cooler takes its heat of evaporation from air resulting in the air becoming cooler as the water evaporates into the air. in a swamp cooler you need a constant supply of water. in the heat pump i was working on, the water would circulate in a closed system similar to the way freon circulates in a typical ac or refrigerator. in that system the water evaporates because i create a low pressure point within the system and the heat of evaporation is extracted from the surroundings through a heat exchanger.
being on the other side of that for most of my childhood, i actually shuddered when i saw the picture....
i can answer that one. the 2500 is a direct upgrade of the 2000. the 2500 has three different spray nozzles of different diameters. the smallest is similar to the 2000; the largest is genuinely like using a hose. it only lasts for a second before you've dumped the entire pressure chamber, but it will utterly and completely drench your target. small nozzle for protracted running fights, large nozzle for ambushes.
nasa is presently reviewing our proposal for use of the jtec to replace tecs (thermoelectric converters) for powering outer planetary space craft. the tecs that nasa presently use are in the 6-8% conversion efficiency range. the jtec will provide conversion efficiency in the range of 30-40% and thereby significantly reduce the nuclear heat source sized requirements to provide the same amount of power.
the solid state battery uses a solid electrolyte instead of liquid. so it's an all ceramic and metal battery with twice the storage capacity. we are in the process of transitioning the battery out of the laboratory. we have working cells at this point. there are improvements i'd still like to make. we have not yet set up an investment vehicle structure. stay tuned.
the snoop amas are a tough competitor, but i agree that this is a great ama.
let's be honest, hula hoops made a comeback when cute girls were added.
i think he used it as a measuring device, but cds had a different application with substantially similar tech. i think he's saying that he didn't see how it could be used like that when he filed.
i thought you said "i had a kid thanks to your invention" and figured you were using it for some ghetto artificial insemination
maybe if you posted under a different username ;()
i also love this thomas edison quote: "i attribute my success to 1% inspiration, 99% perspiration." also when they asked him how he felt having failed to invent the light bulb after trying thousands of materials: "i have not failed. i have successfully identified thousands of ways to make a light bulb that doesn't work."
**c**onstant **p**ressure **s**ystem probably an unintentional coincidence that works in the end... i hit my friends hated when i brought out the big gun (was the only one i owned) i bruised them more than i would like to admit :d
i just want to say thank you for letting me rapid strike my wife with foam darts from across the room. she'd probably curse your name, but for me it's just fantastic.
but we're not talking about water propulsion anymore
if i hadn't looked up the name, i'd have assumed it stood for **l**onnie **j**ohnso**n**
bingo, me too! my cousin and i launched it in the air a few times and then realized launching it horizontally at each other was way more fun.
i played major league baseball a lot as a kid. they also made royal rumble.
tall person here. i've found that sitting down to pee minimizes urinal backsplash. went to my friends cabin in high school and his mom had put a sign up in the bathroom saying "boys if you can't pee without splashing everywhere then pee sitting down". changed my life.
i wish i still had my cps 2000. loved that thing, but getting shot in the eye point blank with it was not a pleasant experience.
well you want the surface of your cheese to be nice and even.
when you add 'thunder' to anything it makes it cool
i helped a guy working on his phd who was doing work to show that evaporative cooling is efficient depending upon the humidity and the temperature. basically he calculated that in tropical climates, it was efficient and was at the stage of building the measuring gear to prove it.
the kid who had that ruled the yard. none of us could hang with it and yes it stung
isn't the 2000 regarded as more powerful, despite the shorter duration of super soaking?
i am very excited about your battery project! batteries will help save the world, i'm sure of it. do you have any predictions on cost per kwh?
exactly. he's not saying the cd industry did anything wrong, just that he wishes he had thought of that use.
that's not how patents work. if he legitimately had that specific of a patent, he would have been able to force the industry to pay dearly for it
what do you think he needs the super soaker for? gotta clean that dirty d
dude, that's nothing special. we all rapid strike your wife.
i'm not a patent attorney or law student but i took the lsat and agree 100% with this comment because i'm really good at googling and took 2 seconds to verify this information. if you think you have a real winner of an idea, call your state's bar association or pm me for how to google. my rates are fair like my skin. edited because i wanted to.
i have a patent that my employer sponsored. i wasn't allowed to even look at other patents because such corruption could render my patent indefensible. so that's the first thing i think that makes it hard for diy. second, i know very clearly what i invented. i demo'd it nearly 100 times. however, the patent itself is unintelligible to me. i was invited to review it for accuracy and was literally unable to do so. so the idea that someone could, themselves, write a defensible patent with no help seems highly unlikely. in op's case it makes sense because it is clear he is good with details and guidelines. and when i say "good with" i am really underselling the level of genius and capability he has.
isn't this just undergrad thermodynamics? or was he accounting for various higher-order effects?
it's even more entertaining when you fill it with hot (not scalding of course) or cold water. the surprised wtf looks your friends get when they first get hit is priceless. then when they are no longer surprised, fill it with pee and you'll never have friends again! it's the perfect toy for introverts who were forced to go outside and "it's a beautiful summer's day".
after looking it up, it seems i was mistaken about the 2000 - its only nozzle size is the 'hose' size, which means it's terrible for long fights. yes, the 2000 is slightly more powerful and has a slightly larger pressure chamber than the 2500, but in my opinion the versatility of the 2500 more than makes up for that.
theoretically. whenever an independent party tries to sue a company for a patent, all the lawyers shout 'patent troll!' and are immediately in favor of the company, and it's an uphill battle. the worst part is that this is justified. patent trolls are people who own patents, and have no intent on selling or licensing them to producers, and simply constantly sue companies that use those technologies, since it's more profitable to sue than to license. these cases make up most patent cases with an independent party and a company. i think. i'm no expert on this so i probably messed something up.
yeah, new ked limit toy legislations will also get in the way as it is a heavier and denser dart.
from across the room? that's some impressive range and accuracy. *forfeits wife*
you know what everyone who has ever had cancer drank right? water.
i was helping build the testing gear he specified. i knew the broad outline of what he was now trying to experimentally verify, but not all the calculations and reasoning behind it.
maybe it has to do with humidity? sorry, i don't know the maths or full details behind it, only that i thought it was interesting when he explained it to me. to cut and weld pipe, sling a hacksaw and a drill, i left most of my uni level maths well behind me now.
you just reminded me of a memory that i haven't thought of in years. at camp when i was a kid we had a huge water balloon fight. water guns, balloons, water slingshots, you name it. anyways, this kid, jacob, he filled a bucket with water and then he peed in it. and he just went up to some girls and dumped it on them. and then he told them it had pee in it, and then he got kicked out of camp. each move makes less sense.
yeah it has everything to do with humidity. maybe it's just me but i'm used to associating tropical climates with high humidity but maybe that's just because i'm from florida.
lord almighty, this is such a fantastic story. thank you for sharing.
all i remember is that my dad got the bigger one to even out the match against me and my sister. but we always knew the real reason he got the nice one...
no. i asked for $50s and $100s only. everything i'd understood about bait money was that they only came in $20s, so nothing to worry about there if you specifically demand the other non-$20 denominations. and i wasn't worried anyone would see me getting into my vehicle because i parked out of view (i.e., on the other side of another building).
i didn't tell my wife or my best friend or anyone. i didn't want to burden either of them with that. but that's not the real reason i didn't tell them. i just know that your chances of getting caught skyrocket when you start blathering on about it to others. i didn't feel like it was a dirty secret either. it was just one of those things that i did every now and then. i'm a private person, so it didn't bother me keeping it to myself.
not a lot. the most i got from a single robbery was maybe $7k.
i put a lot of thought and planning into the first one. i probably spent five months obsessing over all of the details, possibilities, etc. once i got the nerve to finally give it a go and everything worked as planned, it was pretty much copy-and-paste from then on. i didn't scout banks, per se, but i did have an idea of what i was looking for. i didn't want to hit a stand alone bank. i wanted to be able to park my vehicle within walking distance yet out of sight from the bank (i.e., on the other side of an adjacent building). as for the best times, i usually opted for some time around 3pm since i figured that's when shift-change would likely be for the local police.
so my first ama pretty much went viral and a gazillion people reached out to me for this very thing. i ended up meeting a really great producer who is doing a documentary type film, and i can't wait to see what he does with it. i don't know that i'm at liberty to say much about it, but he is awesome and i'm glad i met him. hopefully will have some news on that soon.
my 10 y/o self was trying to cope with his parents divorcing and not understanding how to fit in at school. he wouldn't have listened to a damn thing i said anyway and probably would have done the exact opposite anyway. more than anything, i think i'd just tell him to hang in there and things won't be bad forever. i'd tell him that his parents still loved him even if they didn't always know how to show it, and i'd challenge him to actually try to appreciate school instead of trying to make it hell on every teacher in his path. 10 y/o kids don't have a fucking clue in life and are in that really awkward phase of *too young to care for themselves* and *too old to have everything done for them*. i'd probably tell him to become a hacker.
first of all, i am standing up while typing this and there's nothing you can do to stop me. nah, i can't imagine ever wanting to do that shit again. i like my life, and i'm happy. that's something i never had for the first few decades of my life. there's just no appeal to do certain things as you get older and for me, this falls into that category.
this is a fun conversation to have, and i actually will have a really cool opportunity to go to an event later this year and talk with banking professionals about it. i'm excited. cameras are a shit ton better today than they were in 2006. plus, we have social media in a way that only existed in our worst nightmares back then. it's a lot different these days. with that said, it's still just not really that big of a priority for banks to catch robbers. they're not really losing *that* much money to robberies. if you do it how i was doing it, you're not going to really raise any eyebrows. on the other hand, if you're going in guns blazing and wrecking shop, they're going to put a lot more of their resources into catching you... ...because if you hurt a customer during a robbery, that's going to cost way more money than a few thousand dollars from teller b. and i agree with your last sentence.
depending on which type of table you're talking about, it could be as simple as opening up the table and getting it out with your hand. most coin-operated tables that you find in bars/pubs/whatever have a split-cabinet design so the owner can open it up and remove the coin box. if you're talking about a home model that doesn't have a split-cabinet design, it's going to probably be a pain in the ass.
i never really felt like i was looking over my shoulder. that feeling usually only lasted an hour or two after the robbery, but it was pretty...i dunno...whatever a drug does to you is what it did to me. but as with drugs, it wears of more quickly each time as you build tolerance to it. i didn't really feel like i was living on the edge. it was exciting, but it never lasted.
damn right, it is. and not just because of the crime, but just because of being a felon in general. although it's technically illegal to discriminate based on that, companies aren't so quick to hire an ex-con. thankfully, it's still america and there's always opportunity if you try hard enough. no complaints from me.
i stuffed a rag into the drain of their sinks and turned on the faucet so the house would flood. other than that, no.
if i saw an officer of any kind, third party or not, there's no way i was sticking around to rob the place. so your presence alone can prevent a certain amount of crimes, i'm sure. the downside is the people who don't care you're there also do not care if they have to hurt you. at a glance, i think your comment kind of sounds like you're probably in the wrong business. that sounds so stressful.
i think about some of the tellers often. i don't really know what i feel about them, but i do hope they don't have any kind of ptsd or other resulting issues. and if they ever wanted to get me in a room with mediators or whatever and give me a piece of their mind or whatever other things they needed to do, i wouldn't be against that. i guess the answer to your question is no, i don't feel guilty. but i don't feel the opposite of guilty either. i just don't feel a lot on certain topics. i don't know what i would even do with those feelings. i'm open to suggestions.
probably. i don't know. i don't think i'd want anything to do with that crowd.
i've never seen that movie, but generally speaking, hollywood tends to really get bank robbery wrong. granted, if they painted a more accurate picture of bank robbery, it would be terribly boring and nothing people would want to pay to see. hollywood portrays bank robbery about like the porn industry portrays sex.
my sentence was 36 months. i served 39 months because i didn't get credit for all of my county time. i think you misread the proof. the crime carries *up to* 20 years, but that wasn't my sentence.
she was terrible. she's one of the few people i mentioned by name in my book. she was just a terrible, terrible person.
i graduated high school and never went to college. that was about eight years before the crime stuff. i think there are lots of things that could have changed my path somewhere along the way, but it's hard to say exactly what they might have been. as a parent (especially knowing my own history), this is something i think about constantly, and i wish i had a better answer for you.
i do think about the tellers. there's not really much i can do about the impact my choices had in their lives, but i'm open to anything that would be productive in the matter. i hate to admit it, but i really just don't feel a lot of remorse. in a lot of ways, i've grown a bit detached from who i was back then, so perhaps there's some denial at play (or some other kind of psychological explanation), but i do think about those folks and if there's anything i could ever do to resolve any issues that arose from what i did.
i was expecting more like a decade or so. i wasn't really sure, but i definitely expected way more than three years.
only problem would be if it got on news it never did. he would watch his back for couple hours, after that he would relax until next robbery.
no, it never happened. and i don't really know what i would have done. i probably would've just been like *ah bummer...ok, ttyl.*
i don't fully know how to answer it. to me, it's like asking someone why they prefer mustard over ketchup. i just don't like mustard, i guess, but i can't explain why. i just don't like how it feels in my mouth. to me, there's a certain *icky* feeling about selling drugs, stealing cars, robbing convenience stores, or any other crime. also, i knew how banks worked. i knew their procedures during a robbery, so i was just more comfortable with the thought of doing that instead.
i don't think anyone was in shock. i don't think anyone predicted or anything like that, but i don't think there's many things i could do that would raise the eyebrows of those who know me best. i guess i could be tried for other robberies. but then again, so could you. that's pretty much the level of risk i'm at by now. it's been 10 years. it's all good. thanks for the well wishes. :)
i was too lost in my own spiral to really worry about jail. but yeah, most of the fears people have about jail/prison are pretty comical once you've done time.
he said the banks never pursued him because they didnt lose much money and because no one was threatened
inmates are damaged long before they're incarcerated. it's not normal for mentally healthy, functional people to do things that land them in prison. so just understand that the people you'll see have pasts long before the crimes they're doing time for. people in our culture forget that criminals aren't just born. nobody pops out of their mom and is immediately bad. things happen somewhere along the way that help shape them, for better or worse, into the person they become. for balance, i'll say that it's also important to not simply have sympathy for inmates and only focus on the terrible upbringings they may have had. you have to be able to simultaneously see them for who they are, what they've done, but also where they come from. prison is a dark place. there are some things you just can't prepare for. just don't forget that everybody has a story. and with some of those people, you hear their story and can't help but think *my god, no wonder you ended up here.*
dave is the coolest dude ever. seriously. i'll box someone for talking shit about dave because the dude is just really exactly the same guy off air as he is on air. he ain't just putting on a show. he's the real deal, just another redneck who cares and happens to have a lot of money too.
u/ninjaassassinguy is correct. i don't really know what they could have done to spoil my plans aside from things that were out of line with what they were trained to do.
how dare you try to trick me into finishing my 4th grade homework. and sorry, but i have no idea. definitely less than minimum wage though.
nope. i don't think i've ever been above the third story of any building in austin.
hell if i know. i think my only realistic choice at that point would be to leave.
no, i don't think it's a gateway crime. it's probably near the end of the list of things criminals want to do but are too scared to try, for whatever reason.
because its easier to give money to him than take a risk and have guy runing around bank with weapon.
i don't think i'd have been alive much longer. i was really in an bad place mentally and emotionally, and i didn't have that give-a-damn thing that makes you avoid really bad choices. i don't think i'd have taken myself out intentionally, but i wasn't really making decisions based on my well-being.
the grand heist is sneaking an extra house or two onto a lot.
bait money is really only useful if the robber gets caught with a stack of money, btw. money isn't routinely scanned for their serial numbers, so even if you were to use it, it wouldn't really be traced to the robbery if it was used a few days later. it just adds proof for the prosecution if they're caught almost immediately.
ha, that's awesome.... my small talk "i have succulents"
man i love me some office space or liar liar. its the clawwwwwwww
this sounds familiar - was it you on the criminal podcast? i loved that episode.
sheesh...7k? that seems so low. do the teller machines limit what they can pull w/o pre-authorization?
thank you for the answers! did you have a system set up to clean your money afterwards? and what did you do with it if you don't mind me asking? just rent and stuff or more for pleasure? also, i love the duke's of hazzard tv show!
i played low-level foosball tournaments back in the day. what's your opinion of players who stop the ball, then proceed to play mind-games, circling their man around the ball before slapping it in a table shaking strike. i used to play against italian fellows who never let that ball stop for more than a split-second---it was a pleasure to be beaten by them.
are you my ex? i dated a guy in high school who ended up getting busted after robbing several banks just the way you did, years back. he just did it for the shits and giggles. visited him when he was locked up and he just made jokes about it the whole damn time. i wanted to strangle him!
he was caught. i saw the news article about it on 4chan. currently in prison, i want to say he's due out later this year.
please update when that comes out. i would love to watch it. thanks for doing this awesome ama!
nice! a skill set where great crimes lead to light prison sentences and job offers.
this is how the movie always starts. one last score after you've retired
why do you reckon bank robbery isn't more common if indeed it is this easy even today?
step 1: get friends step 2: get money step 3: become 21
appreciate the ama. although quick note, it's actually not illegal to discriminate based on felony, or even misdemeanor status. it's common and legal to not hire someone with a background of shoplifting for a retail position, drug dealing to work in a pharmacy, or child abuse to work at a school or daycare. some states and municipalities don't run a background check until after they've interviewed you and only then consider if your background is related to the type of work you will be doing. but in at-will employment states at least, they can run a background check on a prospective employee, and just say "they're a felon, so i assume they are a bad person, and i don't want to hire them" and that is completely legal.
i was just a poor college student trying to pay student loans, and what better way to stand for 50+ hours a week making $12/hour plus overtime. probably should've just robbed a bank instead. i no longer work there though. they started putting me at high risk locations that were robbed multiple times with guns and other weapons. thanks for the ama! i plan on reading your book while i'm going to bed at night.
but imagine how much more they'd clamor to hook up with you again if you robbed them after a one night stand
that makes sense, it's a great movie btw, worth a watch of you've ever got a couple hours to kill :-)
ah i see. what is county time? i'm from the uk, is that like what we call community service or similar? yes i believe i did, my bad, does that mean you didn't get a fine at all or just didn't get the full fine of $250,000?
if you're still here, i'd love for you to elaborate on this. i just got out of hs and i think it's crazy how some teachers can be so helpful and some teachers can be so shitty and the massive effort that can have on a student. i'll pick up your book for sure though.
thank you for your honesty and your response. your ama has given me a lot to think on.
turning yourself in contributed to that factor a lot i assume
so smaller places like credit unions were more likely to have security?
if you haven't already, you should try fried halloumi. i'm far from a cheese expert, but that one is my favorite by far. also, happy cake day :)
he did have priors, but the feds didn't want him. the state gave it to him.
that's exactly what a former bank robber would say. /s
he never had a gun and he never wrote something like that on a note.
so you're saying if i rob a bank i should throw all the real money away and keep all the fake money.
really though, it's when you're talking a first or second date and the girl doesn't seem all that interested in you, but keeps suggesting the most expensive restaurants possible.
oh shit we got the succ boys out here!! let's party!
unfortunately yes, that was me. glad you enjoyed it, but that podcast is the reason i'll never do another interview that isn't live. i'd give anything to get my hands on the unedited audio from our interview/conversation and re-release it somehow.
the money is insured and the risk of danger is greater than the loss of dollars. most retail places and banks will just give you the money and know that the vast majority of robbers fuck it up within 24 hours.
i was a teller for a few years and we got into deep shit if we had more than a couple grand at a time. we actually got warnings every transaction where our drawer balance was over a certain amount, and we were supposed to move the excess to the vault. it was specifically for this reason, if we had six grand in our drawer and got robbed, you bet your ass we'd get fired. getting robbed isn't a teller's fault, but there are procedures in place to mitigate the bank's loss should a robbery happen. if a robbery happened while we were insanely busy and didn't have time to move money, it probably would have been let go, but if you were over your limit and had a free moment, you'd better get rid of that shit.
thanks dude, you took my gold virginity! i'll remember to pay it forward! now i just have to figure out what to do with it.
if you stop the ball and do that crap for more than three times in total (not just in a single match) against me, you are instantly added to my personal blacklist, which has a paragraph about deporting you if i ever become a supreme leader of some sort. don't do that!
link? i've been reading the news about it the last 30 minutes, not seen anything about him being caught. last i heard, 2 days after the robbery, he was still a free man. and a lot of that blog on 4chan seems to happen before that. which means he probably did get out of the city. would be interesting if they caught him after that, would love to see more.
nobody is getting a job after getting caught these days. the prison sentences also aren't light anymore. you'll get fucked harder than if you literally just rob a bank.
no, no no. not yet. those things aren't mutually exclusive for two people. just one person, however, would not be able to do both at the same time.
i think it's a lot more common than people realize. but there are stories/studies talking about the gradual decline over recent years, and my best guess is that it's just easier to do other forms of the same thing via identity theft and other digital crimes.
step 1 and 3 can be solved by completing step 2 and i've heard it isn't that hard to rob banks
true, and to expand on that, companies can be held legally liable for hiring someone if they have background issues and the person commits a crime at or related to their workplace. like if you hire a sex offender and they sexually assault a client it's a huge legal liability.
i was a teller for 3 years at a bank in college. we were told to always do as the robber said, and to never "try to be a hero". the only thing to focus on was giving the minimum they asked for (some people apparently say something like give me $5000), getting them out quickly without a scene, take in as many details about the person as possible, and then finally hitting the alert button (after they leave). also, i'm not expert, but from what i'm told even giving an indication that you are armed is considered armed robbery. so if the note said they had a gun, and they didn't then they could still be charged. either way, the teller will comply... the amount of cash in a tellers drawer is usually fairly limited anyway.
well....there's always money in the banana stand.
this. seriously. time has passed, they have no trail of you... i'd have gone on with life.
in the states, we have local, state, and federal levels. when you are arrested and charged by the police for something, you are usually taken to the county jail (local level). the county jail is where you sit while you go through the legal proceedings of a criminal case. after the court process is complete (which can take months and sometimes years), you are either released (i.e., if found not guilty) or found guilty and sent to prison. prison is where you actually serve your sentence, but you typically get credit for the time you spend in the county jail. in my case, i didn't get credit for all of the time i spent in county jail. so instead of serving three years, i served three years, three months, and 10 days. hope that makes sense. i know our terms are a bit different, but that's my best attempt at a brief eli5.
i don't know, but i'm guessing that is probably correct. i didn't necessarily know what the smaller places did. i just knew what the big places did.
clay paid the money back in full and he wasn't caught, he turned himself in. those two things with no priors can make a huge difference in unarmed robbery. essentially, technically, all he did was ask for the money. sorry about your dad, priors can be a bitch.
the one i where i worked, each teller had two bait 50s in their drawer. i think the vault bait was a bundle of 100s.
no, he's saying that when the teller fucks with you, you should cut off one of their thumbs
you also look pretty fucking suspicious robbing a bank, too...
the new way one sucks. there is one instance that you should watch it. are you planning on going back to jail?
huh, that's so interesting. thanks for clarifying - i forget to listen with a critical ear sometimes. well - here's your chance, set the record straight. what was misrepresented/what do you wish had been done differently?
and at this person's window, you might even get a drink!
the registers at my store work like that. after a few grand it'll say "drop needed soon" every transaction to drop soon, then over a certain amount it'll say "drop needed now" and refuse to do anything until you to drop.
/u/rabidroosters: put your hands in the air and hand over your gold! and don't try any funny business!
i'm sorry i don't have the link, but i'm positive. i read a new article about him being caught, and saw his mug shot and sentencing date and other information from the county courthouse website
sometimes even when you do something good with your skills. i remember reading that at one point the steubenville hacker, who helped expose the whole thing, was being given a longer prison sentence than the rapists.
having spent a decade in banking i think it's also that banks have spent a lot of time and money making it less attractive to rob a bank. for example, they have much stricter controls on how much cash is on the floor, with some banks having virtually none unsecured. that said, there are still plenty of bank robberies in major metropolitan areas.
unless it's your own money that you're waiting for the check to clear - then they'll gladly sit on it for 21-30 days before making any of it available to you.
i read in his other ama that he partially turned himself in because he didn't want to risk the law catching up with him later in his son's more meaningful, memorable years (which he insinuates here). still, he said somewhere in here that he theoretically could've gone to jail for 20+ years so...if the law had ruled for that, he probably would've never really ended up a father figure for his son, as much of the need for a father would've been gone by the time he got out. hmmm.
op mentioned elsewhere that these sorts of minor robberies happen quite frequently, so they're hard to sensationalize. he literally just waited in line and handed a note to the teller saying "money plz" and just left.
i think the mental glitch is probably the same, regardless of the crime, so i understand where you're coming from with the serial killer analogy. the simple answer is no, i never felt a relief. it was more similar to the kind of feeling you get when you win a competition of some sort. it's just a good feeling. and you celebrate for a while, sure, but then you eventually go back to competing because that's just what you enjoy (if you're a competitor).
the key difference is not looking suspicious before you've started robbing the bank.
stolen cars plus stolen plates from a different car is the usual trick. no bank teller is going to play the hero.
this is one of the strangest threads i've ever seen on reddit.
great. one is playing nba 2k17 at the moment. he's pretty good, but he can't quite hang with me yet. he always picks the warriors and just tries to rain 3's on my head, so i pick someone like the clippers and just big-man the shit out of him. if/when he learns how to move the ball around for 20 seconds or so instead of insta-shooting, i'll be screwed because i don't know a lot about video games anymore. but for the time being, i'm god. my other kid is trampolining right now, and i don't even compete with him. i can't hang. that shit is nowhere near as fun as it used to be. dad life is pretty cool.
regardless of weapons, you do exactly as asked. keep in mind, we don't keep a lot out front for a reason. you can ask me to go to the back and get more, but now you are risking the cops showing up while you are still there. we are trained to comply so the robber will leave as quickly as possible.
that's probably a good thing. we could have been tens of thousands of dollars over and all we'd have to do is click "ok" on the warning that we were over in order to continue. probably not good if you're in a fucking bank.
this is true. work in pizza delivery. we're only allowed 20 dollars on our person at a time to ensure we weren't seen as targets. i mean. we still are. but we're like celery to a fat kid level targets.
the car wash bit was a joke i stole from the first ama. :) i'd love to sit in on a debate like that in class, however. i don't believe altruism is real, and i believe most people are generally selfish. i think robinhood's intent were so much different than mine, so i usually cringe at the comparison. let me frame it this way... i wasn't doing bad in the name of good. i was just doing bad and then had money left over because of it. the money was a byproduct of bad, and there were no good intentions up to the point that i had the money. but then, i had money and wanted to serve my ego yet again, so i gave it away and enjoyed the *wow, you're so generous and helpful* in a selfish way. unfortunately, that is a more accurate depiction.
funny, i just mentioned in another comment that i don't believe there is such a thing. you'd have to be a robot to ever have pure altruism as a motive to anything. and i'm totally up for anyone posing a scenario where that point can't be shown.
yeah, i remember that conversation we all had, fun day.
he probably knew he would get a better deal by turning himself in.
so i take it you were competing against the police? it's either that or the banks. that's an incredibly high risk game to play, and knowing the end results is why most people don't play that game. this is why your mind is interesting, you saw the high stakes and chose to play anyways, most likely knowing full well that almost no one has played that game and actually won (in other words, were never caught). there's a certain appeal there to everyone else in the world, since we can vicariously play that game through yours and others experiences with it.
just like payday. walk in with all your body armour and assault rifles but don't put your mask on until it's time to look suspicious.
tell your son to try the 5-out offense with the warriors. you'd pretty much have no chance
i had to watch a video about teller robberies when i got a temp job as a teller a few years back. they said most people get away with it the first time, but because they got away with it, and because it was so easy, they often continue to do it...and their luck runs out fairly fast.
yes hello, this is the fucking bank? i would like to withdraw some fucks, please.
was the car wash joke from the first ama a reference to breaking bad? im just curious
probably more along the lines of competing against other criminals or just "chance" in general. i never actually felt like i was actively engaged with the police. but yeah, the high stakes risk stuff was appealing.
i let my 6yr old son play payday 2. we would play together hit banks and jewelry stores. bond and stuff. today he put a ski mask on. said "let's get some money." he is 9 now. i questioned my decision, for a brief moment. then i asked him, "when are they coming out with 3. he looked at me and said" we need to be fast."
when it comes down to it, unless it's some kind of enormous heist a bank robber never actually gets that much (op said his biggest robbery was $7k) and the bank is insured for it. so if the cops *don't* catch the robber, it really doesn't matter all that much because nobody is hurting for the money. now, if they commit other crimes that's a different story.
haha, i just googled interior bank vault and there aren't really any pictures of cash vaults as i've seen them- that was the best i could find. usually they are just like the safe deposit vault pictured but with bigger compartments. if you'd really want to score you'd need to case the branch to figure out when the employees service the atm's and hit them while the atms are cracked. i worked at a couple of slower branches and each of the atms held more cash then we had in the entire vault when they were full.
yep. and i hadn't seen it yet, so it totally *whooshed* over my head.
at the same time, he's literally an hour's drive away from the scene of the crime. what the hell was he doing for those 12 days? the guy obviously didn't read the part about where our reddit ama bank robber spent half a year on his first robbery. definitely a thrill seaker, got 3 years for it. it'll be more than a year before we can ask him for an ama.
i didn't make any money in prison. when i got out, i had restitution of $150/mo until the balance was paid in full. i paid it off early.
it almost sounds like a large scale gambling addiction with huge consequences when played! did you ever think to try and fulfill that desire for high stakes competition in any other way? at the point that you were at, playing high stakes poker would have been a healthier alternative by comparison.
might just be me, but perhaps this wasn't the right game for his age. stick to mario and minecraft.
oh crap, i need to practice my three sea shells... 2032 isn't that far off.
well that's what i'm saying. he probably lived in the county where he was caught. he said the taxi was 200 bucks which sounds about right for a 1 hour drive. so after the heist, he made it home, sat around and jerked it to mlp, then 12 days later there's a knock on the door. and that aug 2018 is his scheduled date, idk when he'll actually get out. how many people actually serve their full sentences?
ok thanks. are you not allowed to say the total amount fined?
i played halo with my older brother when i was 9 and 10, and i turned out fine. *flies through air with replica energy sword*
i asked for flying fucks and holy fucks only. everything i'd understood about bait fucks was that they only came in fuckloads
the last thing a bank wants is the cops showing up during a robbery. the cornered animal is the most dangerous, insurance companies would gladly pay out a few thousand for a robbery compared to a hundred thousand or more for an injury or death of a customer.
you can't seriously be telling me that robbing a bank is as easy as that...
depends on the crime and the jurisdiction. in my state most times people get out in half time so two years for their four year sentence. but they'll be on parole for a specified time following release. crimes like home invasion carry an 80% rate instead of 50% and murder is 100% so they have to serve everyday of their sentence before being released.
there might be an agreement made with the banks for as for what he had to pay back for restitution, but the actual legal results are public record. you could look up all his court information if you took the time.
while the media goes off on the idiot trump-russia witch hunt, the real damage is quietly happening on this front. the enduring, horrible legacy of trump will be the dissolution of public land and monuments. forget the russia tangent; if you push too hard, the right will bring up the bribes by the russians to the clinton foundation
**this**, so much this. toured up the west coast with open roads through all the federal lands and beachfront with nary a sign of barbwire or private properties for hundreds of miles!! what, you mean just pull off the road and camp on a beach like it's your own back yard? exactly like that, and it's like nothing else i've experienced. freedom exemplified. east coast touring, not so much. in fact, not even close. hundreds of miles of barbed wire, pastures, no trespassing signs, paid lodgings, lakes, grounds, everything privately owned/pay to stay and keep on moving to the next hotel. truly two very different sides of a single coin.
sounds to me like it might just be good old fashioned nepotism? as a kid i worked 2 or 3 weekends a month on a small colorado ranch. we neighbored a dude ranch that owned a small acreage surrounded by nfs land. accessible only by nfs roads. the nfs land was considered some of the best hunting in the area. because the dude ranch was in good with the local ranger they got him to close off all the roads and give them a key. officially it was to "prevent erroision" but everyone knew it was a favor to give the side ranch private access and hunting. i will say this was the exception. most of the management done was honest. one bad ranger in charge of this area...
i would like an answer on this as i have mixed feelings about it. on paper i think it's awesome. but atleast in my part of the country it seems like everywhere is cultural, spiritual, or historical to native tribes. its not just like an acre where they buried their dead. its chunks of huge square miles.
sure! just outbid the companies looking for the raw resources. but seriously, the selloffs happen in huge parcels that are open to anyone. most people just don't hear about it because they don't go looking.
good question. groups that back land transfer, like the american lands council and the mountain states legal foundation, have received funding from industry groups. mslf has received money from texaco, phillips petroleum, u.s. steel, the coors foundation and exxonmobil. the american lands council, which has employed utah state rep ken ivory, has received funding from fossil fuel interest/koch-backed alec and americans for prosperity.
the federal government isn't requisitioning these lands, these are lands that for the most part were never claimed during the homestead act and never left the possession of the federal government
hey! i'd love to hear more about the eminent domain issues where you live. if it's about federal mismanagement of land, we might cover it in this series. if it's a national story but not right for this series, i'll pass it along to another editor. thanks for your time! [first name].[last name]@theguardian.com
cleats, for sure. who doesn't want to be the flash?
seems sort of futile to me, aren't republicans against federally owned anything?
you need to include ranchers in that. they're a big, big part of it.
learning a little about drilling operations would be a good first step in understand what actually goes on in the aftermath. even the terrifying looking oil sands in northern alberta, canada look roughly the same post production. from the wells i've been part of, the impact is negligible. the process of selling mineral rights to private oil companies and the like has been going on in texas for years. it's really not as terrible as this man would suggest. if you'd like the basics "a primer of oilwell drilling: a basic text of oil and gas drilling" is a reasonable place to start. i know i'll get downvoted for saying this.
you would need millions to buy a national park plus the money for upkeep.
the biggest reason against the states controlling public lands at home is the cost, and the reason that 70% of previously transferred public lands have been privatized is all about money. states aren't supposed to run a budget deficit like the federal government does, and when the cost of fighting fires and maintaining public land gets too high, the state sells thousands of acres to private interests to ease that financial burden. /u/caty_enders may be able to speak to that a little better, though.
hey, thanks for this! on my way out, but this is a question that i answered more fully in a few other responses. in brief: backcountry hunters and anglers and the teddy roosevelt conservation partnership have made a huge impact this spring
budget. states have budgets to keep to (so do the federal government, obviously), so a "good" way to do that is to sell off the land to private ownership, which is what has happened to the vast majority of the federal land that has been transferred to the states.
side note, i misunderstood until i read your twitter feed. unless i didn't. so to add another question to the mix, who is this land going to? where is it coming from? aka is it public parks people use and enjoy, or just unused, undeveloped, unknown?
article 4, section 3, clause 2 it's in the constitution, also kleppe vs. new mexico for the supreme court's opinion on it
hey, thanks for reaching out. if you'd like to chat, you can reach me at [first name].[last name]@theguardian.com
jus to note, it wouldn't giving that land back to the states. federal land in the west with few exceptions never belonged to states in the first place
federal land = purchased by the federal government, and usually managed through blm or the national parks service. state land = purchased by state governments or gifted to them by the federal. as enshrined in the constitution, the power of the federal government supersedes that of state governments. states should certainly have the power to decide what to do with the lands that they own, but the federal government has the power to decide what to do with the land that they in turn own. i'm addition, if a state is mismanaging its lands in a way that is to the detriment of multiple states (for example, pollution that runs through rivers to other states), it's the federal government's responsibility to step in and protect these lands, in order to make the will of people in outside states that are being affected known.
is it even remotely possible for any intelligent human being to not have a personal agenda on saving the planet ? including our protected lands? i mean.......?
the problem with local governments owning these vast tracts of land is mainly that they cannot afford it, so after a few years they sell it off.
because it takes away a lot of public space that's enjoyable in its own way. there's a lot of unique land rivaling the national parks out west that could be forever lost to private interests and blocked off with"no trespassing" signs.
those lands are the property of the federal government, which it acts as an environmental steward over, why would it give up property to the states
this is so true. even beaches require you to prepay and wear a tag (that is a thick old pin that will ruin your swimsuit, bag, etc). i am a photographer who moved from a county that had an unusually high amount of lands donated to the public, beautiful gardens, wooded areas, mansions, farms- all for public use. i moved to another area and there are only a few public parks that are just playgrounds really. i haven't even been working. i'm uninspired, i'm bored, there is nowhere to go without spending a small fortune. i used to know what plants bloomed at which sites at what time of year, what the sunlight looks like at different times, i could walk people around and introduce them to these placed i truly loved. my life has really changed without that.
wait a minute. after having worked indirectly with cleveland cliffs and freeport mcmoran. i know for a fact we worked with and cooperated numerous times with state and federal geologist and surveyors. maybe my experiences are out of the norm. did you ever have any individual property owner or corporate owner refuse any request?
fellow utahn here as well- my husband and i just came back from another amazing camping trip. i'm not originally from the us and i was just talking with my husband about how amazing the national park/lands system is. now i see this! i can't believe i didn't know about it. we must protect this amazing part of america.
it's usually leased. that's what the bundy standoff was about. the bundys leased a bunch of land for grazing, but didn't want to pay their fees.
never said there was a conspiracy there, fella. just said that it wasn't widely publicized. agreed that dc doesn't really understand the whole concept, however you would definitely find that the day-to-day workings on public lands are handled by locals, whether they're firefighters, biologists, archaeologists, hydrologists, etc. none of the public land agencies are faceless, they're heavily involved in their communities, and a good amount of the workers are seasonal and spend the offseason working right alongside local ranchers, miners, etc.
those roads were built by the forest service, not the logging companies. they are labeled as so both on a map and with fenceposts.
...hmm, it's almost like they used to own all that land before the settlers arrived
i didn't refer to him as a senator. i referred to him as a democrat. and so what about the age of that article? it's clearly relevant to the topic at hand.
that's quite a bit misleading. donating to a cause, regardless of what it is, does not equal profit. (unless you consider the tax break for donating to a non-profit)
fair does, but doesn't continued federal ownership, without the possibility of sale i the event of their being interested parties who want to buy land, pretty much amount to the same?
well, the issue is they took land to set up a new overpass, and they're planning on turning the area, which is currently very much just farmland, into a semi and train storage area. so it may not just be the state, it could also be corporate buyout of the area.
public lands are a weird animal... they pretty much cross partisan lines for the people that actually live with and among them. the real problem for the most part is the people who've never seen or experienced even the concept of public lands, that end up with a hand in stewarding them.
i'm going to sound like a dick here but i feel like some of the other outdoor activities don't chip in their fare share.
i'm just looking for a few acres. not looking to buy yellowstone.
thanks for the response. i joined bha this year. i'll have to check out the other.
oh if these lands belong to us all, you can just go ahead and walk on them... or... graze your cattle there, right? that surely wouldn't result in a 10 year legal saga culminating in a sit-in at your local blm and eventually result in your death in the snow at the hands of state troopers, right?
because the federal government was supposed to sell off the land to pay off the costs of establishing those states in the first place. that's how it worked until congress ended the sale of federal land in the 1970s.
the land that bears ears is on was already federally owned land, so they aren't "robbing our sovereignty" by creating a national monument. and as a utahn, i want bears ears protected by the federal government because i do not trust my state government to adequately protect it themselves. we've seen them side with oil, gas, and mining in the past.
that's only supposed to cover territories, not land in states.
same with any of the state's not originally in the 13 colonies. until the west though most states were given control over the majority of the the land the made up when they became states.
just a correction here: "as enshrined in the constitution, the power of the federal government supersedes that of state governments." that's not true. the constitution specifically enumerates the power of the federal government and reserves all other rights to the states. in this case, there is nothing in the constitution about federally owned and managed lands. now, this has been a great issue for over two centuries and continues today, those who would thwart and are in favor of a more powerful federal gov't vs those who seek to conserve (conservatives) the original intent of the constitution.
obviously, if you disagree with federal ownership of land, you're a disgusting human being who thinks the corporations should pollute the water like they did in flint michigan!!!!!1 vote blue!
i don't really see the problem with them selling it.
because the states are what form the united states. they give, collectively, the federal government, some jurisdiction over certain inter-state (commerce, roads, mails, other state to state stuff) and international functions (treaties, borders, tariffs, other intl stuff). but the federal government isn't the united states. the states are. the land of each state belongs to each state. or it ought to i think. with the exception of some federal parks, perhaps.
elliot forest was also bid on by local tribes, whose land it was originally. i can't imagine the frustration when they were denied buying back their own land.
we have lost access to mapping areas before. mostly it's to individuals. although i've heard corporations are hit and miss, as some do not wish to garner the risk of liability. at least, that's how it was explained to me.
as a utahn that has also been involved with bears ears, i hope every attempt to transfer federal land to our state and others is unsuccessful. utah's track record of not selling off public land is better than nevada or oregon, but in general keeping federal land under ownership of federal government has served us well and is the reason we have so many recreation opportunities in utah and other western states.
it would be a good idea to take a gps and get waypoints for each of your photo sites. then there would be solid evidence that you were where you thought you were, and that the land posted is definitely national forest.
hey, thanks for pointing that out. edited for clarity. i hit on tall/dark/handsome republicans and dems equally (kidding).
it's not a dumb question. it's actually the most important question in the whole field of public land management, in my opinion. is it *worth it* to sell off the land? what is value of undisturbed nature? it is truly fascinating!! i am a huge proponent of keeping the land for public use in a majority of the cases because it seems much more likely to me that i can benefit from visiting nature/parks monuments- whereas it is too abstract to see how i can "benefit" from the one time bump in revenue the government gets from selling to the highest bidder. is the price of natural gas going to slightly go down if we frack all of the protected federal lands? will the government efficiently use the money it gets to benefit me in a real, tangible way? the question "where does the money go?" is so vitally important to the debate surrounding this topic!
but these groups would not donate if they were not going to see an eventual financial return on their donations. all lobbying by corporations is, in the end, motivated by a profit-making mentality. to pretend otherwise is not only disingenuous, it's foolish.
the federal government has a self-imposed stewardship responsibility, and absolute supremacy due to the 1971 free roaming and wild horses and burro act so these lands are rendering the service of allowing the federal government to fulfill these self-imposed rules (created by nixon and congress)
you're not a dick. you are 100% correct in that assumption.
dude, y'all queada and the bundys are stealing from all of us with their little grazing scheme. don't try to take the high ground. there's a difference between wanting to preserve lands and wanting to exploit them for personal profit.
so how come utah and nevada couldn't manage to sell 85% and 65% of their land by 1970 then? hint: the answer lies in the provisions of the taylor grazing act and the machinations of senator mccarran.
they absolutely have sovereignty. every state does. that's why there are different laws in washington than alabama. that's why colorado has legalized marijuana despite it being federally illegal.
and other properties owned by the united states, which was the entirety of the west before the homestead act. the federal lands today are the lands unclaimed from the homestead act territories is only half of it
you are misunderstanding that section. that's for when the federal government wants to create a new fort or any of those structures on state land. the supreme court has recognized the property clause as justification for federal ownership of land and reiterated that claim in the landmark kleppe v new mexico
would you have issue with it if it was sold off for pennies on the dollar to the people / companies who backed the politician in office when they were sold off? how about to mining / logging companies who plan on just stripping the lands and polluting anything nearby? i don't have any personal issue with the government letting states sell that land. those are just my two worries.
these lands in question have never once been in the ownership of the states. the federal government bought or took these lands from mexico, then distributed them to people during the homestead act. homesteaders formed states but all the land that was never claimed in the west during the act has remained federal land.
the purpose of this land was very specific to it being profitable for the state of oregon, not recreation, not conservation, but very specifically tree farming. as it sits, it costs more money to maintain than it can generate in tourism or revenue, therefore in order to keep the land owned by the state, management resources must be pulled from somewhere else, only there is nowhere to pull that money from. the state is basically going to have to pay maintenance on an unused tree farm, which it cannot afford, hence it being an economic drain. even if it were a desert, it would cost the state money to manage it.
thanks for the reply. i have also had a fair amount of dealings with ranchers in the western us and have never run into any that were not accommodative in allowing access. corporate owners carry insurance and in some instances require disclaimers of liability to be signed. individuals, that may be a problem.
sure they are a little homogenous, and the democrats that are there are a little too radical on certain issues, but public lands and natural resources is a specialty. this is where the usl really knows their stuff and does a great job of balancing preservation and economics.
most smartphones geotag photos, but you may have to check to verify that the setting are correct, gps on, as well as making sure that geotagging is not disabled by privacy settings. usually, you can just look at the photo info for a photo and see if it includes a geotag.
that's good. i always feel like i'm only getting half the story when a show/documentary mostly just goes after one side of the isle.
the state is much easier to hold accountable. if you don't like your local legislation, you actually have the power to change it.
writing as a montanan here. federal management of public land is not a problem in any way. the state of montana does not have the ability or the resources to manage such a resource over the long term. most of the federally owned land is managed by the forest service or the bureau of land management both of which have appropriate long term management objectives.
thank you for the history lesson. i was unaware of that.
and? states are still subject to federal law. they have "sovereignty" insofar as they can make additional laws if the federal gov't hasn't addressed whatever issue the state law does. for instance, you can still be arrested for marijuana possession/use/sale in colorado by federal officers, despite it being legal on a state level.
it's cute that you can't read but still make dumb claims. the antiquities act only allows monuments to be made out of federal lands bears ear was always public lands, why are you lying lol. you have to be braindead to think you can lie about something in the public record the parts of grande staircase that weren't federal land were traded by the state to the federal government for more valuable land elsewhere if you don't know what you're talking about sit down and listen. the united states has supremacy on federal lands due to kleppe v. new mexico which hinged on a republican bill
and this is somehow better if it happens at a federal level where the only way for a company to make productive use of a piece of land is to lobby the government to reimburse them for the fees for using it? you haven't placed the land out of the reach of corruption, you've placed the people who are corrupt out of the reach of the people who have to live with the consequences.
understood. so why is this a reason for the fed to keep holding them? just because they've always owned them is not a reason for them to keep them. why shouldn't they now give them to the states?
had fires nonstop last week, this week it's snowing in northern nevada. that said, late summer this year is looking to be a crazy fire season.
i don't know much about the industry, but has there been a value associated with other benefits that forest might bring? (e.g ecosystem services, water basin recharge, erosion control, etc).
it's the pnw. it's cloudy all the fucking time. a wind farm, on the other hand...
*aisle although it usually does feel like regular us citizens are getting voted off the island by those who know how to play the game.
ownership in most common law nations is based on the concept of *fee simple*, in which the state maintains ownership of all lands under its domain, and grants stewardship rights to private citizens. so, it may have seemed snarky, but it's true, you don't actually own any real-property, the state does, and merely grants you exclusive stewardship.
the problem with this is once the land is sold, it cannot be gotten back. so you can vote someone out of office, but that piece of land will never return to the public domain.
so very much this. i can work with my local offices, who are branches of the federal government. frankly i'd rather deal with them than my counties' building department any day of the week. i've worked with them to keep roads/trails open to the public when they didn't have the funding to keep them open. at every step they were reasonable, caring and receptive to our desires. we wanted to keep off highway vehicle access to a historic mining district (obviously non-wilderness). the only groups who can't get what they want out of federal land management agencies so easily are big business. ...which is why those groups (oil and gas, mining, large timber) want so badly to "open up" the public lands to their industry. ...i see that as closing it to me and other citizens who like to traipse through the forests and deserts on occasion simply to see landscapes without big, modern industry. i don't think that's too much to ask.
being a sovereign state /= sovereignty. im not claiming states are sovereign states (as in nations), but rather that they have an amount of sovereignty (the right, and the power to do certain things without the interference of federal powers) in specific areas. i dont think it would be a crazy argument that states should have a certain degree of control over their lands, and that having 60% or more controlled by the fed is too much. i personally would love for even more public land in utah, and understand that federal ownership is going to be the best way to do that. however i also recognize that as a coloradan, there is a limit to how much i should be interfering with the management of other states through the powers of the federal govt.
that is a fair case about ownership itself. but what about the makeup of the potential ownership? we certainly not talking about an idealized rugged individual property owner that would end up owning this land. the most likely future owners of privatized land would be foreign controlled corporations. that is not a better outcome for citizens of western states.
but as it stands, the lands can't be sold. so yes it is better at a federal level, as the selling of these lands at a federal level cannot happen.
because the fed has a self imposed stewardship responsibility that the states would not fulfill also these lands can make for semi-useful bargaining chips lastly why give something up when there isn't a compelling cause to do so
maybe an old-growth forest, but these forests are specifically planted for harvest. the trees are planted closely together, and require maintenance for them to properly mature (an unkempt forest is also a greater fire hazard). foresters also seek the benefits of sustainability, as they want to be able to replant forests and make more money in the future. think farming, but on a much, much longer cycle. i grew up in sw washington, and many people buy 40 acres of land, or whatever, as a long term family investment they expect to keep in the family for generation, it's not like the stripping of resources it can be made our to be.
i wonder if he's using the modern conservative form of the term "cost", which is essentially the same as "not generating revenue." even if something costs $0 to maintain, but could generate at least $0.01 in revenue by selling it off, then it's now a "cost." the cold, hard figures in $$ are the only thing going into such an equation. preserve nature by leaving it untouched? naw, that's too "costly".
you've pretty much nailed the problem. people want public lands, they just won't vote to pay for them.
that makes you the livestock/crops. kind of dark, if accurate.
fire mitigation is one. a forest that was used for logging will have trees planted real close together that will die and become serious fire tinder if they aren't tended to. it would also just become overrun with non-native invasive plants if just left to nature, so if you intend it as a sort of ecological sanctuary the ecosystem needs to be managed. animal populations like deer and bears have to be managed or they spill into surrounding areas. plus if you want the public to enjoy it, you need to maintain roads, trails, facilities, and an emergency rescue team. also need to patrol for squatters and poachers. they're a lot of costs to managing land.
because you cannot take people out of the equation. even wilderness areas require protection from illegal/damaging activities, that costs money.
not even exclusive stewardship, as far as i am aware americans and foreigners can visit us national parks equally for the same entrance fee and conditions.
first off, nowhere is going to slash and burn forests. that's just overdramatic. secondly, not all of what the fed owns is wilderness or even close to wilderness.
take another updoot. as a transplant to nevada, this is fascinating! pardon the over simplification, but it sounds like ranchers should have known better than to think the milk would flow free forever?
i don't see why it's so great that the land can't be sold. it's completely worthless until someone does something with it. this insistence that it's owned by everyone doesn't change that.
there shouldn't be a quid pro quo between states and the fed. this is probably old fashioned thinking. i believe in a small federal government. one that should surrender to states all possible and sensible authority and power.
the issue here is unsustainable farming, which means it needs s constant input (human energy to mantain proper maturity, questionable soil erossion over time). a forest, in balance, can be harvested and require minimal input, you just cant milk it $$ and instead look at it as a long term resource. we have to plant and mantain healthy forests, not some warped monoculture ecology.
that is easy to say that for the upvotes, but its extremely ignorant. we're talking about an asset that is being maintained for economic production. that is its sole purpose. therefor, its profit is the primary metric that we are concerned about. when we talk about a national park, its primary goal isn't economic and therefor its profitability isn't a useful metric to track. when we talk about a factory, its primary goal isn't beauty so we don't track that metric either. when we're talking about a sales person, do you think the company really tracks how many calories he eats during the day ?
up above, fire fighting costs were cited as a major component -- esp because the trees here were planted densely, with the expectation of harvesting. not sure you saw those responses.
they don't require protection... giving protection is a choice, and you can choose not to do it.
oh, i'm not talking about public lands, i'm talking about general real estate; public, residential, commercial, the state has "real" ownership of it all.
last year the outdoor industry generated $646 billion dollars. so while you can't tie a dollar directly to each acre of land, to say the land is worthless is just incorrect. as an aside and a personal belief of mine, just because a piece of land isn't generating money doesn't make it worthless. the vast pieces of land that i have hunted, fished, camped, and used for my personal pleasure may have never been used for a strip mine or a walmart, but i wouldn't consider them worthless. and the cool thing is, you can use them just as much as i can because they currently reside in the public domain. i think that is very worthwhile, and it is reassuring to me to know that we have this land that is open to anyone to use.
yeah i suppose that's true, a good amount of precipitation can be great but can build up fuels if it dries out again. i suppose better grass burning than forest, at least in the sense that it regenerates quickly and people don't usually build many homes out in the middle of grasslands
not all of it, but slow down. google elliot forest... now look at the pictures labeled elliot forest where all the trees look the same. they have the same bark, the same size. it's not a tree farm like a christmas tree farm, but it's a working forest. that's not necessarily a healthy forest, and cutting in down might suck now, but it needs to be managed, or it could face a variety of risks.
but that argument accepts as given that it's perfectly acceptable to view a forest solely in profit/loss terms. i disagree with that entirely.
if it isn't worth protecting, it isn't worth saving.
the idea that if you sell a piece of land it will immediately be strip mined or turned into a walmart is just nonsense though. it doesn't make any sense to charge ranchers for grazing cows on federal land for example, the land isn't used for anything else and the cows aren't damaging it in any way, it's just continuously extracting money from people who aren't given the opportunity to purchase the land. the money is then taken out of the state and spent at a federal level. why is this a good thing? the state loses revenue, loses employment, loses money, and then what? it can be spent on one more million dollar firecracker to drop on the middle east? fuck that.
right, he's begging the question with his insistence that this piece of god's green earth can only be viewed as an economic production unit. this is a common fallacy. i have no idea whether the forest should be maintained or sold off or strip mine or timber harvested. but his/her argument is a fallacious one.
you don't *need* to stop poachers... the vast majority hunt with a license. plus the state already has fish and game cops typically that drive around looking for violaters so the area is more than likely already covered as they cover everywhere including private property.
we saw a bunch of fish that i had no idea what they were! we also saw some whales. the first time we saw a whale we rowed in circles for half a day trying to follow it and get a picture.
it is absolutely the most amazing thing you can ever see. the stars were so bright and numerous that i would just stare until my neck started to hurt. we also rowed through bio-luminescent plankton which was mindbogglingly beautiful.
it was not fun..i did try to swim after each shift so i could at least get some of the sweat off! i also washed my clothes a couple times a week with freshwater so they wouldn't get crunchy. the first shower on land was pretty amazing!
when we found out the storm was coming we tried to row as far south as possible to miss the worst of it. once the wind was strong enough in the wrong direction that we were not making any progress we deployed our sea anchor. a sea anchor, or para anchor, is basically a parachute with a hole in the top. you put it out in the water and it hovers ~50-75 ft away from you below the surface. it keeps you perpendicular with the waves so you are less likely to roll and it also slows down your drift. once we did that we hunkered down in the cabins until the storm passed!
the hardest part was when we got caught in weird currents and would row as hard as we could and get pushed backwards. it happened when we were only about 400 miles from the finish line! we were so close to being done but we just couldn't move! we had one tropical storm hit us that turned into a hurricane! it was scary not having weather radar because we really didn't know what to expect. we had a satellite phone so people gave us weather updates but we really just had to wait and see what happened. it ended up not being that bad but it was a little scary.
our boat had 2 emergency epirbs and our lift raft had 1. the race made sure that we had all of the safety equipment and training we needed!
honestly i don't think it really sunk in until we lost sight of land. that was when it finally felt real. then we just kept rowing until we saw land again! there were some times that rowing got really tough and i just wanted to be done. we hit a weird current that was pushing us back east and we would row for 24 hours and stay in the same spot or lose a couple of miles. it was really frustrating!
since it was a race there is a sailboat that tries to sail around the entire fleet in case someone needs help. luckily we never needed any help. if you get assistance of any kind you are disqualified from the race. i didn't think i was weird after the row but my family and friends said i was really spacey. they said it was hard to carry on a conversation with me because i would just start daydreaming.
we rowed 3 hours on 3 hours off. so one was rowing while the other was sleeping. basically you would just wake up, get dressed, eat something, start rowing, finish rowing, change your clothes, eat something, sleep, and repeat. i did have to run the water maker every day around noon to make our fresh water for drinking. we mostly ate freeze dried meals and a lot of costco bulk snacks!
whales, fish, dolphins, no sharks (thankfully) i think i would have been too scared to swim if we had seen sharks.
do it! it will seriously change your life. if you want some inspiration watch losing sight of shore...it's on netflix! i was never scared for my life but i did get a little nervous a couple times.
thank you! i really appreciate it. the race organizers had a "first meal" set up when we got back and it was a burger and fries!
we had a very complex garmin system called nmea 2000. this included our gps, ais (which pings our location show we show up on other ships radar), wind/weather info, and navigation. we used the gps a lot in the beginning because there were several small islands close to the one we started on and we wanted to make sure we didn't get to close. after that..we pretty much rowed west/southwest and went with the wind. if our electronics had failed we did have a handheld gps that we could have used for navigation but it would have been very dangerous to be out there without an ais. since our boat was so small the big cargo ships could hardly see us. if we didn't show up on their radar there is a good chance we could have been hit.
i don't feel like i was spacey but i do remember feeling overwhelmed by all of the noise.
oh, definitely! at one point my spotify playlists stopped working and i was left with two albums and some audio books. lets just say i have those songs memorized. sometimes i would count strokes..1000 would be about an hour. definitely did a ton of daydreaming!
wow that is really embarrassing! i don't think i can change it either. whoops. i guess i was nervous and typing fast. it was weird being in a tiny boat but i think we got so used to it. then when i watched some footage of our boat in the water it looked like a tiny toy!
thank you! i love my chacos. we definitely did not think about the foot setup enough before leaving. when i do another one i would mount those foot straps like wind surfers have and also get something comfortable for the heel. my feet were too small to fit comfortably that is why i had to wear the sandals!
i trained for about 2 years leading up the race. i was rowing in college at the time so it was easy to stay in shape. for the southern atlantic (east to west) the best time to start is in december. it is the time with the fewest hurricanes. east to west atlantic is also probably one of the easiest routes. it has one of the most consistent currents and trade winds in the world. no disney release. just a few youtube videos for now! my arms are still pretty strong and it has been a year and a half!
so this is kind of embarrassing but we both had really weird songs that we loved. i was a big fan of celine dion's "that's the way it is", "jack sparrow" by lonely island, and "we didn't start the fire" by billy joel.
i'm not sure! i know i definitely sang super loud but i don't know if george got it on camera. we both just belted songs out. it was one of the only ways to stay motivated. i also have "we didn't start the fire" memorized now! :)
i rowed for 3 years in college on a club team so i had some experience. we did the row as part of a race and a lot of the people on other teams had never rowed a boat before in their lives! there was definitely a wide range of people from hard core athletes to every day people and everyone ended up making it across!
we kind of had our personal time during our rest hours when the other person was rowing. we never really got sick of each other because we didn't actually see each other that much!
1. the race takes place in december-february because this is the time with the least hurricanes. 2. our goal was to finish in under 60 days. we made it in 58. 3. we had emergency beacons, a satellite phone, and a lift raft if shit really hit the fan. maritime law would be our friend..any boat that is able to respond to a distress call has to. 4. i lost 20 lbs. i had put on a lot of weight because people scared me and told me i would look like i was starved. i probably didn't need to put on as much as i did. 5. definitely! my back was so strong. 6. we had a bucket for our toilet. we used biodegradable wipes for tp.
we took 75 days worth of food. we had 3 freeze dried meals per day and lots of snacks! our snacks included: trail mix, cheese its, goldfish, granola bars, candy (m&ms, snickers, hershey's), poptarts, mini muffins, and various other munchies. the snacks were mostly just calorie fillers and not meant to be very nutritious.
sorry i missed this comment earlier! it was definitely a little freaky swimming for the first time..but the water felt so good that i quickly got used to it!
we both put on way to much weight before the race! people made us nervous that we would lose like 50+ pounds. girls on average lose only about 10lbs..the guys lose quite a bit more! no naughty time was had. we have always been just friends!
thank you! i've always loved the ocean and i saw a youtube video of 4 guys from the uk that did it. their video was so inspiring that i really got motivated to do my own row.
yes! we arrived in nelson's dockyard/english harbor. it is the finish line for the race now so every year there will be a whole fleet going in!
we tried to do 2 hrs on 2 hrs off but realized it was not enough sleeping time. we both felt pretty comfortable rowing for another hour and thought it was worth it to get that extra hour of sleep. i do think we lost a little bit of productivity in that third hour but since we weren't concerned about racing it worked out.
thanks! yeah i had never heard of it either. people have been doing this since the late 1800's! some people did it in an actually wooden rowboat..like with no cabin or cover. i don't understand that! modern ocean rowing boats started in the 1990's. the race started in 1999 and has been going every year since.
that's awesome! gap is the best. not much here. getting pretty sleepy.
there are basically two boat builders out there for these special boats. one is in the uk and their prices vary from ~20k-50k. we got our boat from a new company that just started a few years ago. they are in port townsend, wa and are called spindrift rowing. they are super cool and did an amazing job with our boat! ours was actually the first american made boat to cross an ocean so that was really special!
we had a pretty uneventful row in terms of equipment failure, weather, or injuries; which is definitely a good thing! i think one of the worst things that happened was we had downloaded a bunch of playlists of spotify so they would be available offline without wifi..and about 30 days in all of the sudden they were unavailable! luckily i about 20 songs and my audio books left..but rowing 12 hours a day..20 songs is not a lot! the next row i want to outfit the boat with better cameras! i feel like we missed filming a lot of cool stuff because we didn't take time to set the cameras up. i also would bring fruity candy! i surprisingly got sick of chocolate and probably would have killed for some starbursts or skittles.
hmm.. i'm a big fan of remember the titans, the guardian, lord of the rings, actually..pretty much anything! i'm definitely not a movie snob.
i flew home with my family from antigua to minnesota (it was freezing). it was a very strange feeling. the finish was amazing! but we had spent almost the last 3 years of our lives planning this journey. every spare moment was dedicated to it and then all of the sudden it was just over. the first few months back home were pretty tough for me. i really felt kind of empty and not sure what i wanted to do with my life!
bored: yes, lots of daydreaming was involved. listened to music, rowed, listened to audio books, slept. we did a lot of wiping off with freshwater and baby wipes to get the salt off.
1. sponge baths with fresh water! lots of baby wipes! 2. dryness like our skin? or the boat was always wet? i don't think we can fix the boat thing..it's just too humid! 3. definitely! there were very un-athletic people in our race. 4. i do not think you would want to row for 8 hours. your butt would be dead and you probably would be barely moving by the end.
this is honestly my first time! one of my friends who is on here a lot told me that i should do an ama because he thought people would be really interested.
um... rowing. i mountain bike a little, i like fly fishing and hiking also.
i think we got a good base tan being in the canary islands for two weeks before we left. we also had spf 100 that we applied every time before rowing.
i would say a week or two? the first few days were pretty rough but it slowly got better.
i would love to! i am not a great writer but i think it would be awesome to get all of the memories down while i still have them.
we actually did it right after we graduated college. i graduated in may and worked a summer job..george graduated in august and then we left in december.
we went by 5500 calories per day. we also had some hydration tablets that we put in our water. i think if i do more of these i would definitely meet with a nutritionist. i did notice that my pee was very neon green and my nails got very weak. i lost about 15-20 pounds on the trip!
we watch a youtube video actually! damn interwebs..
i cried twice. once when my music broke and the other time i can't remember why.
we did! we had about 5500 calories per day. three freeze dried backpacking meals per day and lots of snacks! i would have killed someone for a pizza about half way through.
no we weren't, we were about in the middle of the pack. we decided we were not as concerned about racing and just wanted to enjoy the experience! the first place team finished in 35 days and last place was 96! everyone made it and we were actually the first fleet to have all boats finish!
thank you! yes, we took turns sleeping. 3 hrs on 3 hrs off. sometimes on my daytime off shifts i would stay up for a bit and chat. i also would run the water maker and get the meals ready for the day. at night it was pretty much switch over, eat something, and pass out. it was pretty amazing how fast my body adjusted to the schedule!
no sharks but we did see a few whales, lots of flying fish, a lot of normal swimming fish, dolphins, and some barnacles on our boat.
not very often. my boss told me i need to get a shirt that says "ask me about my ocean row"
a couple fans would have been nice! fruity candy, more seat pads..
sounds like an amazing experience. after reading about the hurricane i'm glad to hear y'all made it out alright!
how far off the shore would you say the sky is without light pollution? i've always wanted to do this although i'll never own my own boat. i imagine it was even more breathtaking during the new moon.
exactly! it's so hard to explain. i've also been to some really remote wilderness areas but this was a whole different level.
didn't you get that itchy salty feeling putting clothes back on?
how did customs/passports work going to a different country by sea like that? did you have to register with customs across the ocean when you got there?
this is unbelievable. how confident were you in the boat? was it tested enough for situations like that? good lord.
"only about 400 miles from the finish line" the word only here really puts some perspective on the size of this race.
are there any side effects of doing that afterwards?
epirb = emergency position indicating radio beacon. question; why not a sepirb? also, thank you for showing people just how strong we actually are. you and your friend are a beacon of inspiration and motivation. i wish i could hug the both of you.
there's your sponsor. document the garbage you see and supply footage for funding for environmental companies?
let me just tell you that i'm a 47 year old dude who doesn't know how to swim, so i look at your achievement as something akin to the moonshot. i'm incredibly impressed that somebody ever thought "know what? i can do that." and then actually did.
1. our hands were surprisingly ok! i think we rowed enough on the ergs that we had good calluses. they did have a lot of dead skin and were very sore but no blisters at least! there is a picture of my hands in the video diary video! 2. that's awesome! i love how it is such a small world. i will definitely keep that in mind as i work toward more sponsors. thank you!
wow! that's a big pile of supplies. just out of curiosity, how many calories and how many cups of fresh water did you guys consume per day? and what kind of stuff did you eat?
ahh, how was it adjusting to that level of sleep?i'm also assuming the ocean isn't the nicest place to lay down
you swam?..that's crazy. i couldn't imagine more surreal moments then swimming in the open ocean.
this seems kinda inadequate?? or was it perfection??
thank you for using the ais. i'm a ship captain and it's hard to pick up small boats on just radar, especially in rough weather and/or with fiberglass hulls.
i would think that's the effect of having a 3 hours row, 3 hours sleep schedule?
i could imagine, spending that much time away from people and then suddenly being back in civilization. makes me wonder what it would be like to be away from people like that
all good, i'm only teasing. i honestly didn't realise it was even possible to row across the atlantic until 5 minutes ago - what an adventure!
honestly i'm more surprised that you chose a celine dion song other than "my heart will go on". nice playlist though
did the nights ever get super cold or really hot?
people who never rowed a day in their life made it across to the atlantic??
to add to the question, did you bring a vibrator or anything?! i can't imagine going that long....don't answer if ya don't want!
i wonder, what would happen if you encountered a distress call? would there be enough supplies and room for another passenger or two in an emergency?
10994 meters, closer to 7 miles actually, it was measured in the marianna trench.
thanks for answering! reading your story stokes my desire to do a long distance hike. i am good at walking. i am good at not falling. and... i already have 'strategic' calorie reserves so it would take me longer to starve to death.
lol.. yup we were there for the finish this year. we live on a boat in caribbean and spend a bunch of time in antigua. it was very cool to look at the boats though. i thought we were crazy crossing oceans on our little catamaran.. nope, you guys are way more crazy.
just thought i'd mention that's probably because of the stage of the sleep cycle you'd wake up in. cycles tend to be an hour and a half so three hours is two complete cycles leaving you refreshed while the two hours interrupts the cycle.
thank you for doing an ama. i'm checking out your video diary now. it's been very interesting. i've always been intrigued by long journey/adventure stories. i live in sw mn and i've never heard of anyone doing something like this from here.
why do you have to pay so much to be in the race? can you just leave at the same time for free?
how did it feel to fly over the ocean you'd just crossed? two months of rowing speeding under you in just a few hours.
a nutritionist sounds like a great idea. i've paddled some long distance outrigger canoe races (a measly 40 miles or so) and i ate poi as much as possible. sounds like a blast, you've inspired me! thanks!
cool, i find the sleeping arrangements really interesting! i had a few questions i'd like to hear more on: 1) did the sleeping cabin ever get wet? was it fairly easy to keep it dry? 2) did you have a sleeping bag or some sort of foam pad to sleep on? also, you mentioned that you get used to the 3 hour sleeping cycle. so that's like 4 sleeps cycles a day. 3) did you have a dreams each time you slept? 3) did you sleep every 3 hours or did you stay up for 9 hours straight sometimes? love reading all the comments! there are so many!!!!
oh my. what happened to the 96 day crew? was anyone disqualified?
thank you! it really was. i wish i could have had a camera on my head the entire time so i could remember everything.
hmm.. i'm not sure about that one.. we rowed for about 2 days before we finally lost site of land.
kind of a funny story.. both george and i had seen this "glowing stuff" in the water for a couple nights but both of us thought we were just losing our minds. finally one of us said something. it was so cool though! when we would take a stroke and the water ran off our oars it looked like little gems falling down. then the oars would make the water swirl and a huge cloud of the blue/green would come up. i tried so hard to get it on camera but it didn't work.
i was in the atlantic on a submarine. very few lights. the way i describe it is there were so many stars they actually looked close. like a ceiling that's only 20 feet up. almost as if you could jump up and punch your hand through it. i'll never forget it and hope to repeat. i have plans to move onto a catamaran. do you have youtube videos up? i'd love to watch them!
yes! we tried to rinse our clothes with fresh water frequently because they got really crusty. i also would try to do kind of a sponge bath with fresh water after each shift.
it was a weird feeling! i was pretty nervous the first time.
we had to go through customs in antigua. i think the race organizers kind of worked out a deal with them. we didn't have to go immediately.
i loved our boat! i never once felt unsafe. the company that built her did an amazing job. we didn't have a single equipment problem on the entire journey which is basically unheard of. before the race the boat had to be flipped over in the water to make sure it was water tight and also to make sure that it self righted.
i think i mostly slept through the storm! it was about the second week of rowing and we were so exhausted. it ended up being a nice break!
yeah..it seems crazy! once we got to 999 even..just losing that 1 digit helped so much.
tends to be a heavier flow once you go back to normalcy
thank you so much! i really am blown away by all of the amazing questions. this has been so much fun!
not that easy, millions of pics of them can be found, there is actually islands that are full of garbage because of this shit.
there was a 67 year old dude that did the row! i'm sure there have people that have done it that are afraid of water as well. it definitely was a bucket list thing to start with but i fell in love with it and want to do more!
it's amazing to me that you can still say it's a small world after rowing that far!
we tried to get 5500 cal per day. we had 3 freeze dried meals each per day along with a bag of snacks that had a variety of things in it..granola bars, trail mix, chocolate.. etc. i think i drank 3 of my camel baks every 12 hours.. so 6 liters. we drank a lot! i don't think i ever stopped sweating.
the first two weeks were pretty rough. i felt like i had been hit by a truck. after that my body slowly started to adjust and things got easier. waking up to row at night was definitely the worst! the cabin was surprisingly comfortable! laying down was ok it was hard to sit up though without smacking into the walls.
i believe it was a katadyn? it involved flipping a switch to turn it on and holding the tube into our containers. it ran off of solar power.
yep! sometimes during the day we would stay up and chat for a bit but definitely passed out right away at night.
they were pretty good! you just add water to them so it's pretty easy to make. sometimes we had to eat them cold because it was too rocky to boil water. the cabin is small and hot!
i have to admit i was pretty scared the first time i jumped in. i got used to it but it is a really weird feeling.
my stomach did feel a little weird..but i never got sick.
i never shut it off! i was so terrified. i knew there was no way they could see us. congrats on being a captain! i am hoping to get there one day.
not really, but you do use your legs in rowing! so at least they were getting a workout.
i had never heard of it either! it's still fairly new..i think more people have been to space actually. surprisingly though, it is one of the safest endurance sports. compared to something like everest it is really safe! i think 10 people have already died trying to climb it this year and since modern ocean rowing started i don't think even 10 people have died.
i just tried to download the most random songs! even people i had never heard of in the hopes that i would not get sick of the music.
the nights did get a little chilly! it was also that nasty wet/cold too. i had a light blanket that i brought with and usually would row in a long sleeve shirt at night.
we could have probably fit a couple people for a short amount of time. if needed we could have maybe also deployed our life raft. i imagine something like that would have ended our row though.
the us has some great long distance trails for something like that!
that's awesome! i hope you cheered really loud. i was absolutely blown away with the welcome we received at the finish line. also, everyone on the island was so incredibly friendly. i got so many free meals!
that's awesome! thank you for your questions and i am happy to hear you enjoyed it!
it was a 60 something year old man from the uk who was doing it solo. he was really struggling and so one of the guys from the support boat (leven brown, ocean rowing god) agreed to get on and help him! i believe he was disqualified from having an official race record.
isn't the horizon approximately 5 miles on sea? jesus.
there's a kayak tour in the san juan islands (pnw) that is at night so you can row through that bioluminescent glow!
you might have already answered this, but how did you have enough fresh water for the entire trip?
upvote for my country lol. all jokes aside, i think i remember seeing something about this in the antiguan news. when i get access to my computer, i will see if i can find the article.
that is truly amazing. amazing accomplishment. congrats.
that's nuts. i can't imagine being tossed around by waves and sleeping!
what was the total length? did you have anything for entertainment besides rowing?
i've always wondered how women deal with that. thanks for the info.
my dad sailed the atlantic in the clipper race, he said what struck him was the number of floating party balloons, like those foil ones with a number on them.
thank you! follow up question... how do i find joy in anything?
i have read that the (then-) 67 year old dude is now training to row the pacific.
well it is a huge world but i love all the connections that pop up! i like to think it means that i am on the right track...that sounds strange.
how many liters of water did you bring? did you desalinate?
depending on how that 'meeting' actually played out, i can imagine it being quite enjoyable. meeting some french people and explaining that you're rowing across an ocean. i wouldn't think that you planned on meeting anyone in the middle of nowhere. do you speak french? or did they speak english? it might have been quite funny as well if there was a language barrier.
i think they're saying redbull would sponsor it...they probably would.
what does rowing across the southern ocean even mean? would you circle around the entirety of antarctica? also, for the arctic would you go from iceland to alaska or some similar route? would any issues arise from being in russian waters?
i also find it crazy how you guys had 3 hour shifts it take me an hour aline just to fall asleep. well for you guys after doing all that rowing i'm sure you guys met the sandman within 5 minutes? were there any nights where you were restless when it was time to sleep?
went from rowing in the middle of a continent to rowing in the middle of the ocean. awesome
i could probably manage the at if i went southbound. however, my job has me working long construction hours during may-october. i've looked into either at or something below 40n latitude. unfortunately my wife tore her acl a month ago, so it probably won't happen this year.
land features will appear/disappear later than that. typically, we see land 20 nautical miles before we get there. the canary islands are fairly erect, so i think they might linger a bit longer/show up a bit earlier.
so we had to bring an emergency supply which also acted as ballast weight. this was bottled water that was stored in the lowest part of the boat. then for every day use we had a desalination machine that made fresh water.
they had to bring an emergency supply which also acted as ballast weight.
it is a huge event on the island! the locals are amazing. they were so friendly!
thank you! if you are interested there is an amazing documentary on netflix called losing sight of shore. it's not me..but it is about 4 amazing girls that row the pacific ocean.
just over 3,000 miles. we had music and some audio books!
my advice: get a dog..or a cat. coming home to my dog being so excited to see me is the only thing that gets me through the work week!
i could see this becoming a movie. "dou you naeed heulp?" "no, thank you! we're just rowing across the atlantic." "pardon?" "i said, we're rowing across the atlantic!" (quietly) "n'importe quoi..."
i tried talking with them before the first one and they said they would give me a few cases of redbull to take with. i haven't tried again since i got back but i probably should!
route planning has not taken place yet! but those are great questions that i will need to figure out..
the night shifts i pretty much fell asleep right away. there were times during the day where i had trouble sleeping because it was so freaking hot! i would just be laying there with sweat running down my face. it was awful.
there is one lake that we had to drive about 40 minutes to row!
small adventures are always good too! i hope your wife heals quickly!
i heard the guys at /r/dogecoin are very supportive and managed to get a jamaican bobsled to the olympics with funding.
also a row boat is really low to the water so you would lose site of it much earlier than being on a ferry boat.
can you tell us more about (or link to) the desalination machine?
holy cow the pacific is massive and anything but pacific. also how did you get food out there?
after you do something extrodinary or tough it's nice being home for a while, but then it just feels kind of empty, at least from my experience. any other plans in the works? flight around the world isn't as impressive but man would that be a trip. i think that would be fun. getting a license and a small cessna and just leaving.
i don't know you, but i love you. dogs are the best!
tomorrow i'm gonna get out of bed before noon, does that count? thanks for your story btw :)
like the scene from the holy grail where they're at the walls of the french castle.
yeah i think having actually done it would give you enough credibility for a larger investment lol
haha well if it does mean circling antarctica, that would be your longest trip by far. i wish you luck in all your future endeavours!
fuck that's so scary tbh, just imagining the waves buckling the boat beneath me is ughhh! though reading your post, it kinda makes me want to try it juuuuuuuuuust a little bit more. and that's from zero.
awesome! i worked in seattle on a yacht for a few months. it is a great city!
we had to bring all of our food with us! 70 days worth.
i completely get this. it wears off over time, maybe that's just complacency, but it's an odd thing coming home (a safe, comfortable familiar place) and feeling like what you said. i often think of the hobbits in lotr after they did all the amazing things and come back to the shire to have that emptiness.
i am still trying to adjust! most days i sit and stare out my office window thinking about the ocean...
i thought that too! a lot of companies that i have been in touch with since the row still just think i'm crazy. maybe i'm doing it wrong.
i've been kicking myself because a sailing company was looking for a receptionist position here, which i do, and they would teach sailing skills. i didn't apply, i wish i did though. bummer :(
"vaporators? sir, my first job was programing binary load lifters very similar to your vaporators in most respects."
holy cow that's a lot of food! also serious props to you, that is no small feat and you raised money for charity. you are some pretty cool folks
they kind of touch on that, especially in the books and why frodo has to leave.
well i hope you finish adjusting soon, and figure out how to make it easier after your next 4 voyages. :)
crap, sorry. i don't know why my phone does this sometimes. they say honesty is the best, but i guarantee you that if i text her and say i had a few beers last night and got on youtube, and now i'm somewhere in the atlantic ocean, she'd be grumpy as hell.
maybe you're actually crazy. like in the good way, but still.
you should try to work on yachts! it's super cool and you get to travel.
i thought the whole point of dogspotting was that it had to be a random dog encounter, ie not your dog or your families dog and not where it would be expected that you'd run into a dog (like at a dog park)
the open ocean gives me panic attacks. i would have shat myself the moment i couldn't see land anymore.
thank you so much! i enjoy letsrun. rojo and wejo have done a great service and made a wonderful resource for runners. oh, yeah! i would love to see people like jordan hasay and allie ostrander get more attention, i'd love to meet them and watch their meets. i think it should be more of a spectator sport. i love watching running, i don't know why people don't like watching track and field...people just don't get it, i guess.
mysticadelasierra hi. i'm glad i inspired you. because it is you that just inspired me. i thank you. stay true to yourself and everything will fall into place. don't let other people make your decision on what and when to be happy. please don't let the unkindness of others stop you from being a good person at the gym. i know, i know..please continue towards your march of health. the fitness is 80 percent in your kitchen. i found that out. i have had a
by the way...thank you so much! i'm so glad you're a runner...the running community can be so wonderful and supportive. :)
i am mi'kmaq, my tribe is in maine and nova scotia! my kids are mi'kaq and chickasaw. i just recently was in santa fe speaking at the w.i.n.g.'s of america coaches conference, at the american institute for indian arts. i love to go to reservations and talk to an encourage kids. i've been traveling since my daughters was 8 weeks old, she went to her first reservation in bemidji, minnesota, we went to red lake. i'm so glad you have a group!! 100 milers...wow! that's so awesome. it's so necessary for our communities to be active. i carry diabetes and heart disease in my family, it's such an issue...we need to be proactive.
hmmm...good question...i am a toe-striker when i run, so i had a lot of foot and lower leg problems. achilles and plantar fasciitis were common with a lot of the people i ran with. i struggled with that, too. shin splints...my hubby had a stress fracture in his navicular bone that he had for ten years. those are pretty common as well.
a lot...i married my husband danny 25 years ago, we raised two kids. before that i had my own store...owned a restaurant. i skiied. i was a massage therapist and a nutritionist...i worked as a nanny for a wonderful family. lots of stories, lol! but the past few years were being a stay at home mom and proudly homeschooling two kids.
i loved running so much, and how it made me feel, that by not going out after work for a drink with my coworkers, i didn't miss my run. i used to go out every night and drink schlitz...i didn't let other people dictate my happiness. my run and the feeling i got during and after my run was the most important thing. i wouldn't let anything or anybody jeopardize that.
good question! i was just reading about craig engels this morning...love his hair. hmm. i liked both runners, they both ran with heart, i have so much respect for both of them. when danny and i first got married, he had a ponytail, lol! i'd have to say long hair...i still wear it down when i run.
thank you. my daughter raven has a lot to do with the introduction. she's my girl! yes, my running career. i have a long term goal. but right now the short term is taking precedent. strengthening feet, ankles and lower legs. i haven't thought about keeping track. hmm. good idea.
thank you. ciao!!!! :) for a young athlete..play. play, play, play. keep it simple. have fun. learn the basics and when you do you can apply them to any and all sports. soccer is super for body strengthening. exhaustion. know it well. i'd say sleep, but being overtired one can not sleep. when i was training i had to teach myself to shut down and i had to learn to sleep. crazy. now i meditate . yeah, i had to focus and i try to meditate everyday. five minutes a day. it's nice. my daughter wants me to do tai chi. so i think i'll take her up on that as it's better for me to have movement while letting go and be within...(sounds good huh). also i have found that certain foods help calm the body and sleep won't be too far off. chick peas, bananas, walnuts, almonds. i personally will have raw local honey with chamomile tea with cheese and crackers. i found the above helped me a great deal. i suffered ...insomnia...
i didn't, really. i ran with a group of guys. i've run with a group of guys. i just trained like a marathon runner, a long distance runner, not like a woman. but...there are differences. women are still behind in heart care. a paramedic would probably think i'm a corpse, i have a resting heart rate of 43. but ultimately it's individualized, its hard to speak for all women on this subject.
yeah, i've read articles about that too. i don't know. personally i had kids late, and i'm thankful i had a healthy body and could have my kids in my 40s. these days (i'm 64), i want to get back to top-class, back to my top form, and i don't know where it's going to take me, but i'm reading everything i can and pulling out everything i know.
i identify with you. it's hard to start and restart, it's just really hard. stick to it, that's my advice. be consistent. set a goal for yourself, even if that goal is just running for fifteen minutes without stopping. it takes time, and you may get frustrated, but if you stick with it, you'll see progress.
these days, more or less. i listen to spotify. the whole neighborhood does because i hate headphones, lol.
hi. thank you! i was inspired to race the boston marathon by the group of guys i saw at the quincy y. i started running march 28. the boston marathon was in april. listning to their "war" stories i wanted to do it too. one of the guys said i had to qualify for the marathon. hm, i thought i had to run a marathon to prove i could do a marathon..hmm. ok...but the guy planted a seed by saying i didn't have to worry about qualifying time because the women had more time allowance. a few months laater i entered the ocean state marathon in newport, ri. i ran my first marathon after a few months of running and losing 52 lbs. i qualified for boston by running a 2:53:40. under the men's standard. (hehe) not planned at all. i thought for sure i'd die of a heart attack during the race.
try changing your shoes. it sounds like you need to change them. shin splints are usually caused by tight calves and toestriking...i'm a toestriker. i would stretch before you run, especially your calves. try dropping your heel on a step, 30 seconds, 10 reps each leg. flexible shoes are key.
i loooovvvee toffifay. it's a hazelnut and caramel candy and it's delicious!
that's so great! i used to go in front of the y, all the way down wallaston beach, to the squatum guard shack. sometimes i'd go out and do the bridge, out and back. the police had their fire range out there, i think. they didn't have my event in '80, so i didn't even have the olympics on my radar...i knew my distance, and i knew i was a marathoner. and yes, i did try for the '84 team, i got 16th at the trials--to me, i just wanted to be on the line, i was tickled that i got to the trials themselves. i don't have any regrets. i wasn't raised with the olympic attitude...everything i did in my career, i did to try and recapture that feeling i had in the locker room shower of the y.
i know huh? well, if i thinking about something, it'll pop in my head...and answer will soon follow or a justification will suffice. usually back in the day, i'd play out scenarios. the "what if" game. but it usually comes down to just relax and take note of what is going on. now, lets see. i did a two hour run a couple weeks ago. i picked a beautiful country tree lined road. rolling hills...very early in the morning. i think i saw only 3 cars. i ran in the middle of the road..sweet. so yeah, i fantasize about achieving my goals...and what if they actually happened!!! what would i dooooo!
good for you..a month. way to go. keep it going. it takes time to build up to be fast and to be fast while going long. time time time. be nice to yourself and take the time to build. you will reap rewards.
thank you deusos! well, hmm fave fruit. i eat lemons because it my favorite that my body needs. my favorite to eat just to eat is...drumroll kiwi!!
the first time that i actually acknowledged that i wanted to do something in regards to distance and time was between my first marathon and my second marathon...they were a year apart. i did a 2:53 in my first marathon and i thought for sure i'd do 2:40 in my next marathon. (i did a 2:47 and i was bummed.) i had a whole year to train...i took the winter off though, because i didn't like running in the cold. that was the first time i became aware of time and speed. otherwise it was just run until i couldn't run anymore, and then get up and do it again. good luck on your powerbuilding!! :)
i ran in the late seventies and early eighties. i had heard of blood doping. at the time i didn't know what it was. and didn't know anybody who did or was doing it. it was after when the stuff was made public that i understood it. and no, didn't know anybody who was doing it. our "drug" of choice then was 120-150 mile weeks. as it probably is now.
oh wow, you have a goal...terrific! more than half the battle. ya'know it sounds like to me, that you need a transition period between getting home from work and going out for a run. as to tips for speed. i was strong. strength carries speed. i wasn't fast iin the shorter distances until i got stronger to hold a certain pace for a shorter period of time. over the course of a marathon strength is what helped me through. push ups, sit ups core work...can't beat it. when you are so tired, look towards what you ate during the day. too much caffeine, not enough water, too many carbs, brain tired, haven't kept the runs fun. change it up. change a course. change the time you run. remember to keep drudgery to a minimum. you have a wonderful goal. keep it wonderful. have fun enjoy the process. it's real. i look forward to you celebrating the end of june...with another running goal....yeah, i know, i know...that's how it works good luck
lol! i never did. other people did that for me. i always just accomplished things for me. i was very goal-oriented, and what other people said or thought about me didn't matter. my times were my times, and i stand by them, it didn't matter what gender i was or what ethnicity. they were good no matter what.
no, personally. my recovery was an easy run. i didn't run on treadmills or in pools...if i couldn't run outside, i didn't run. low impact exercise can be good for maintaining fitness through an injury, though.
goals. goals. goals. little goals, stepping stone goals are important, i find. at times the long term goals make for being overwhelmed. and fear can set in . believe your goal. doesn't matter what anybody else thinks about it. it's yours to make. it's yours to own. it's yours to work towards. when the time comes, you may not reach the long term goal..but it won't matter because you did everything you could do to reach it. it's the process...not the end result. ok, i know that may sound like a "get out of jail free" card...but it's the striving and making do with what you have. you neva know what you have until you try. and that's where the work begins. when you try there is no failure!
i'd start by not running fast in the beginning of your run. think of how far you would like to go. the pace you start with are you able to hold the pace for the length of time you would like to run. one of the best ways to build endurance is to run consistently. take it little by little. time will be your friend.
i suppose i do. though i have not had it in eons..not any ice cream for that matter. i lead a sad life.
really...no...really? huh? why? sad..."another one bites the dust.."
well, when i was under contract i went through quite a few (free). seriously though shoes at the time were good for perhaps a month. training and racing shoes. now i think it could be about the same. for me, i go through a pair in about three months or so. right now...it's ok. yeah running will do it for you. but if you can't run, don't give up...take the time you have for running and use it to walk...many times a person gives up physical fitness because they gave up the time to something else...me included. i have reclaimed the time. if i can't run i don't... i walk. puppy boy needs to get out to run in the fields with his buds. we have two other dogs.
hi!!!! wow! ah, my mom was from antigonish. beautiful. nice plaid, too. i did have a skirt at one time but now i have a scarf.
hi!!!!! i attended quincy college when it was a community college...for hmm, i think three semesters. notice i mentioned attended..lol you're an aries. i do not know whether to congratulate you or send you a sympathy card ;) lol!! you are head strong. you poor dear. though it makes you determine. people called me obstinate, stubborn ..i called it "stickittofness". and you will spit blood before you let go of a goal. so make the goal...and go for it. you'll have fun..because it's fun.
the mi'kmaq tribe is a federally recognized american tribe. who knew right? well, they are and i found out when i went through the registering process. it wasn't easy. yes, she was from nova scotia. the mi'kmaqs have tribal land in maine and i have many relatives in maine. i am a registered voting band member as are my children.
pretty awesome to answer the questions. it's a broad spectrum of questions. makes me think and helps put things in perspective. my running was so long ago, but today it feels like it's happening right now. the best questions...i don't know...i don't have a best. i like it..
i share with wilson. we have a good trade. he eats the skin/fuzz, i eat the fruit. :)
she's half mikmiq (canada first nation indian. her mom ran away from nova scotia) yeah, so she's not "100%" indian. when i read the headline, i assumed she was native american. she could of mentioned that in her bio.
how bigger do u mean by that? am i not just running?
not the op but i love this ama. thanks for these thoughtful and insightful responses!
we don't all do 100 milers but i think a couple people in our group have. we all participate in a variety of runs. especially trail running. we would love to have you come to fond du lac reservation in minnesota!
thanks for doing this! did you ever suffer from plantar fasciitis? if so, how long did you usually take to recover? i'm having issues right now. going to pt for a couple weeks but hasn't seemed to get too much better. it's really discouraging having such bad pain in my feet after 10 minutes that i need to stop even though i feel like i'm just getting started.
whoa! seems like you've had quite the life :) any plans to write an autobiography?
i let my jogging habit lapse when i moved away from the park i ran in, but today i got out of bed and jogged half a mile because i saw a pokemon i wanted. pokemon go is one of the best things that ever happened for my motivation!
thanks for the reply! my 11 year old daughter saw wonder woman on the weekend with her friends and they all really liked it, she's a pretty fast runner too and has quite good stamina - so just maybe....
most definitely individualized. i also train mostly with men and as an athlete not necessarily as 'woman', but i've come up against resistance from doctors when i discuss my issues with training and cycles for example and told to just change my training which is frustrating. thank you for your thoughts!
thanks for the reply, i have tried a few different shoes already. i know i am a toe striker so i'll have to work on that and stretching them out.
thanks so much for your reply! i used to love running at dusk along wollaston beach! these days i live in the city and run along the charles a lot, which is also nice. that is so great that you tried out in '84! awesome that you have no regrets. you have had an awesome career (so far) and i love that you ran for the feeling more than anything else. we should all be so lucky! good luck with everything!
i love this answer. keep on being you, and doing your best!
thank you. i was using a spring marathon as a stepping stone goal and despite hitting a wall at mile 15, i still got a pr. i know i could have done better, but i'm going to take your advice to heart and celebrate the small steps. thanks again for the great advice.
no idea why but quite a few friends ran track and are pretty sad about it
thanks for the reply! having small kids, it's easy to just shrug the time off and ignore exercise. unfortunately, diet doesn't just do it for everyone. i'm thinking about simply leaving for work an hour early, and going to my office gym and either swim or run before work.
haha a scarf is certainly good enough, antigonish is a nice place. just a hint for you but because it's canada's 150 year of being a country they're giving away national park passes for free; so if your thinking about traveling, now's the time!
i was hurt quite a bit. but at the time i didn't know the difference between being really hurt or it was normal training hurt. because everything hurt. i met ice. ice became by best bud. and salt water. i would wad in the water whenever i got the chance.
you're not either. your moms tribe is first nation canada... not north american indian and your dads 2nd gen irish.
yeah, perhaps...i don't know. father was a redhaired fairskinned freckled guy. it's in the dna.
i carry a big-ass knife when i run sometimes. the days i'm feeling scared. i worry i won't be able to whip it out and unfold it in time though. or that an attacker would take it and use it on me. but it helps me feel more brave.
i understand your question, and your friend is right, but i never cared. winning was only important to me in the sense that i was beating someone...if i didn't win, i usually set a pr. people forget that i never won the boston marathon, i placed 2nd three times...they were all so broken-hearted they just changed history to fit their memory. other people have their goals too, and my motto was "if you can't beat them, make 'em spit blood." i always put up a fight, whether i placed 1st or 30th.
really? i would love to come! i can put you in touch with my daughter, she handles my schedule. (lol!)
follow dr's orders. my rule of thumb is always "if you can run, run. if you can't, don't." i ruptured my plantar fascia and i had surgery to have to reattached, which is more painful to recover from...i ruptured it in december at the tuft's track, and had surgery at the end of febuary. i didn't take a step towards running till september...and promptly got a stress fracture. (my first one). i'm so sorry...it's so hard. stretch, ice, and heat. wear a lift in your shoe if you can. it shortens the muscle in your calf and relieve some of the pain. recover will take a while...tendons are very fibrous with very low blood flow. it takes me 45 minutes to stretch out my calves...it's a process. i use a homemade ointment that's peppermint, lavender, and lemongrass, mixed with coconut oil. i drink hawthorne tea for inflammation, too. it'll just take time. you can do it! :) (and don't swim. or bike. stay off your feet as much as possible.)
no, not really. i had a book planned for awhile, but writing isn't my gift...i like to tell stories. that's why i do speaking engagements. storytelling is important to my tribe, and also to me. :)
yes!! i love pokemon go! i'm getting candies for my snorlax to power him up (he's so cute). i'm a level 30, my husband is a level 33, and my daughter is a level 25. we're all team valor! what team are you? :)
really? that's so amazing!! my tensor fascia latae has been tight lately, but i have a guy who's working on it for me...art jaffe. thank you!
hi, thank you for sharing about hyaluronic acid. no, i do not take the supplement. i do however eat meat and poultry and sweet potatoes and lots of greens. it may be something i should think about. and i have just started making bone soup...yeah, huh? oh, about a month ago i think. a long time to make. so i'm thinking about getting the powder form and adding it to my drink. thank you!
oh thank you. i love the charles. oh. oh...have a run for me. i used to race the 8 man boat crew teams...yeah...what a blast!!! early am and dusk pm runs...i covered a lot of ground. boston is my favorite place to train. so much is going on. but i must say, i live iin the country now and wll, going to boston once in awhile...lol...well, i don't know how we all did it then...with all the traffic.. thank you...you too. see you on the roads.
congratulations! yes, life happens! it'll come back. wait until it all gets ahead of you and you'll come running back towards what was good for you. i know, i know. well mindfulness is huge iin everything. and yes, i still shove things iin my mouth...and thing go in one ear and out the other. though i am catching it earlier than i once. much like my stressors during a race. catch my down falls before they destroy the whole race. so what else do i do...theres not too much i can do other than increase time on meditation. five minutes is a lot for me at this time. though i do look forward to what giancarlo esposito (aka gus fring from breaking bad). he can sit for forty five minutes and listen to his breath. how cool is that? lol, i think that would be soooo cool. but five minutes is my mindfulness as i know it. another thing i do now quite a bit, is pray the our father.
that's actually a great correction! my mistake, i should have said biologically male to female, not biologically female. trans people often self identify as mtf or ftm but obviously you're right, can't replace the chromosomes you're born with (though who knows about ovaries/wombs, and testicles/prostates in the future?). thanks for the correction, you're not a dick at all.
really? ok, thank you. hubby and i are looking for a trip ... doing the grand canyon rim to rim is on the list. but gosh, i do have a passport that needs to be stamped. ;)
haha i think she sees it the same as you. she always does her best and while she loves to win, sometimes someone bests you. she just doesn't like the way other people respond when she doesn't win. i think i'll stay a middle of the pack runner so i never have to deal with that! ;)
thank you so much for your thoughtful response. i am going to heed your advice and stay positive.
team valor all the way! i've got a dratini as my companion until i get enough candy to evolve him into a dragonite. the downside of where i live is a level 24 (where i'm at) is waaay to weak to make a dent in any of the gyms nearby, so i'm waiting to hit that 1000 km achievement (367/1k so far) so i can at least show that off. :)
it's out as of yesterday. maybe you need to update the app?
what a great answer. yes, praying is the best thing i can do.
i'm not a big rice eater. i like quinoa. i mix it with whatever i have on hand. peppers, onions, cilantro and broccoli. i like the red quinoa. keep it happy.
so funny story- there's this machine we kept in the back, right, called the hate engine. we have these siphons right underneath the desk that suck up all the complaints to add to the hate engine, and the engine converts that hate into more money, which is why they keep adding service fees. more fees = more money = more hate = more more money. seriously though, nobody paid me to be a fan of ticketmaster's practices. this whole ticket monopoly situation is kind of fucked right now. best lesson i learned at the job was to always buy from the venue directly when i can.
it doesn't really work that way anymore, unfortunately, at least according to my experience. a lot of it's the usual "get in early and get lucky". with casino tickets specifically, though, there is the vip angle to consider. good casinos reward their players really well, and for us in particular we had presales a day before public sales just for our players. also, depending on circumstances we'd sometimes get tickets back from our vip folks for sale if they just weren't doing the numbers they expected, which would lead to some last minute openings- usually in the primo seats too, just because the vips get the good stuff to keep them coming back.
yeah, we used the old-school dos-ass tmwin99. when i was training people i always said it's like using a program written in swahili or something- you can learn a phrase or two and learn your way around to do some basic stuff, but beyond that it's really tough to figure out unless you've been doing it forever. it's a lot of rote memorization and repetition, which takes new guys a while to figure out.
we still sold in house, we just used an in-house ticketing system that worked in tandem with the room reservation system before (i think it was called showgate) and switched to all ticketmaster in tandem with a major remodel about two years back. the difference in show quality was noticeable- we were getting good shows before, but we jumped from d-listers on average to b-listers. no taylor swift or metallica or whatever, but still a lot bigger draws that pulled in a lot more sales. i'm willing to bet a lot of them got on board because their agents or record labels or whatever work exclusively through ticketmaster. like it or not, they opened doors.
here in tampa at amalie arena it is definitely worth it to go to the box office. you save on all the convenience and print at home and whatever else bs fees.
our venue did music and comedians mostly. before we renovated a few years back we'd have amateur mma live, which was interesting, but also tricky to handle since the theater wasn't designed for that sort of setup (since all the seats are on one side and whatnot). the stage was actually enormous, which gives a lot of room for some of the real showmen that have come through (alice cooper, empire of the sun, and kiss come to mind) to work with cool set designs.
in person it was free, $3 extra per over the phone. recently they added a $2.50 fee on top of that to everything, no clue why. still dirt cheap in person.
i haven't, golf was never really my thing. went to the arcade as a kid and tried a bunch of the restaurants during my time there, though.
it varied a lot- show days were almost universally busy, whereas any day that wasn't within a few days of a show was slow as hell. i had days where i didn't speak to another person all day long, and then i had show nights where i sold nonstop for hours straight and on-sales where we didn't stop selling until we closed.
could be. what if amazon, google, or apple decided to enter in the ticketing industry? all could afford to just throw staggering amounts of money at the problem to make up for their lack of initial services. they could bankrupt tm in short order. non-massive companies? nah, not really. consumers tend to see ticketmaster from the perspective of a heartless entity trying to bleed them dry. ticketmaster clients (venues, promoters, etc) _love_ ticketmaster because the available services available as a tm client are literally not available anywhere else. tm has no real competitors for the upper end. you need to get down to the "club" size where your eventbrites and the like are very competitive, because the clients just need something super easy and quick.
turnover at the box office isn't as bad as something like the front desk, which was nonstop *and* dealt with complaints *and* was high-visibility. as far as management, i liked my direct superiors a lot, but more than a couple steps up the chain i didn't really hear from anyone. that could be a whole lot worse, but it wasn't great either.
allllll the time, dude. this is a throwaway so i don't wanna be specific, but a lot of gaming subs.
it's still there, dude. saw it a few days ago when we ate backstage for my little going away party.
i can't speak for anyone but myself of course but man, i think she can go fuck herself. heard from one of my bosses at the time that she was being an asshole to the people working at wardrobe and all that too. i'm sure she's probably nice to some people but that was a pretty dickish thing to say.
it varies wildly depending on the show, location, venue, all sorts of stuff like that. i'm sure you don't need me to tell you that super popular acts sell out instantly. from the angle of this specific venue, the casino and presales are what take the lion's share. casino gets a couple hundred tickets at various price levels to offer their players based on their play rate (and i've seen players with an average daily wager rate from the single digits to the thousands), sometimes five or six hundred if it's a big show. beyond that, our presales were pretty open so a lot of times the a good chunk of the front half would go before the on sale. at a guess, that means about thirty percent of a theater seating about 2500-2700.
1) interestingly enough it's likely that ticketmaster splits a portion "their" fees with the venue, promoter, etc (however rarely the artist) as incentive to keep using ticketmaster. that way everyone involved gets more money, tm gets the client/venue, and tm gladly takes the brand hit for having fees that are too high and not the other parties. they're so used to taking that brand hit, coupled with their market dominance that it's baked into their business model. how do i know? not telling.
i have heard that, yeah, but it wasn't really true for our venue (max fee total outside of online was $5.50) so i don't really know how accurate it is, sorry.
swing/night shift for three years, then morning for the last year. given that my new job is normal business hours, i'm glad i had time to adapt. i was part time, but for awhile we were really understaffed, so i did more hours including a lot of overtime pretty frequently.
seventeen bucks and a free coupon for the local mcdonalds. honestly i have no clue. we used ticketmaster for our sales, we weren't actually ticketmaster.
not at all, honestly. i'm not a very outdoorsy person. tons of people come through the casinos for that stuff, though.
actually, i just told another couple stories on another comment higher up.
a looser refund policy. ours was "no refunds unless the show cancels" so there were many times where something happened and people couldn't go and we couldn't do anything about it, which sucks for everyone involved.
it's been updated all over the place, man. if you're in the area it's good stuff.
no clue man, ask tm customer support i guess. might be a mailing list you can opt out of.
honestly i have no idea. you'd want to talk to an entertainment director or promoter, someone who works directly with third parties to negotiate the sales.
depends on the venue. if it's high demand, you've got more people going after stuff quickly, and you're more likely to get a shit ton of scalpers. that's kind of indicative of the sorry state of ticket sales at the moment, and there really isn't much we can do about it on our end either.
nope. policy says "charge this fee in this circumstance". can't really do anything about it- i didn't make the rules, i just followed them.
my best guess is it's u2, they're hugely popular, so tons of scalpers got to it.
i actually went to school for design, and left this job because i got one in my field. i enjoyed the ticketing side and interacting with customers (most of the time) but i never wanted this to be a career, just a way to help pay through college.
they're not too bad on our end, actually. i know the bell guys hate them because they smell like shit, all their bags are covered in dust, and they stiff them on tips all the time, but for shows they're usually super chill. we had thievery corporation come in for the burners one year in one of the pavilions, right? our setup down there was two computers, two ticket printers, and two card readers, and it was just me and my boss at the time running it. we got down there and no printers worked, no card readers worked, and only one computer worked. my boss literally kept running back to the normal box office to print chunks of like 500 tickets to bring back while i was punching cards in manually and giving out tickets from a stack. despite this, none of the burners cared about having to wait in line, they were super chill and let us do our jobs, which turned a nightmare into a manageable show.
no, but i got a cool little keychain dongle. it says i slept with satan and all i got was this cool little keychain dongle.
it depends on the size of the venue. we attracted some good talent, but none of the absolutely enormous acts that fill entire stadiums, so we never really had that problem. kind of fortunate in that regard, really, since casino already gets a chunk of the good stuff, so with no scalpers buying stuff up fast there was still plenty for everyone else.
don't think so, i was using tmwin99 the whole time. i know the management system ticketmaster one or something was online, but i was never a manager so i only saw it once or twice.
if the venue charged what the scalpers charged and they still bought it up, what's stopping them from selling it at even more of a markup?
$10 an hour, but it's okay because i got sexual gratification from being an unwilling cog in a machine far greater than any individual change i could make in order to pay my way through college. venue was a nice place to work, customers were good, liked all the people i worked with. doesn't mean i like ticketmaster. it's better than the available alternatives, but that's because they're all worse.
also, check the websites of your local free alt-newsweeklies and magazines (the free ones that have local stories and culture, like the village voice) they almost all have deals with all of the local venues (it's how they survive) and you can get fee-free tickets!
so instead of spending $1000 on a $100 jacked up by some scalper, i should spend $1000 at a casino and get the ticket comped?
when i was first training i wrote a python code that printed and responded to tm commands so i could practice. building it also was super fun and probably helped me learn it faster. wish i still had the code.
i never really found tmwin all that complicated. it's just a lot of rote memorization. people are so terrified of computers, but i think the youngest generation of the workforce (including myself) is more comfortable with the system. that's anecdotal though, can't say for sure.
i think it's because ticketmaster inc. owns livenation which in turn owns and/or manages well over 2/3rd of the outdoor amphitheatres which means the band managers knows their peeps.
however you fucked me on parking at a lightning game last year. charged me $20 plus fees for a parking pass and they were taking $15 cash at the lot i had to goto. thanks
if someone is rude to you, would you intentionally give them seats with a bad view? that's something i would do.
that's pretty cool...sounds like a neat venue for specialty events. amateur mma? that must have taken some logistics to get right as you alluded to...wonder how the turnout was.
i guess the people who don't live within 30 minutes of the box office are kinda stuck with the fee.
there are multiple methods to make scalping a pain in the ass, such as photo id on tickets or credit card checking at venues - is it as simple as "this costs more money so we don't bother doing it"?
are you at all pumped for metro exodus that was announced today? this is my shot in the dark question
haha have any other acts used the plane in your tenure there?
i'm sure she's nice to the people that pay her to appear oh and all the dicks she has to suck too.
ticketmaster has a resale outlet of their own on their site though don't they? the thinking is probably that people can sell their tickets back through ticketmaster (with more service fees of course because ticketmaster) and get their money back without the venue/artist/promoter losing their sale
but how did it happen literally two minutes after tickets were on sale? instantly sold out.
are the presales the only access they have, or is there other avenues that they have to secure the best tickets?
do you think there is an unlimited demand at any price? the scalper sells it at the highest price the market would bear. why doesn't the venue?
he was checking out the village voice, seeing who was playing where pulled his head up out the paper, pushing out a single tear five words like a beacon of light in the mist ministry live at the ritz
i've been not buying tickets to shows i've really wanted to see for 20 years now. can confirm. doesn't work.
if you're only going for the tickets then nah, it's a shitty deal, i get that. i'm just saying that casinos sometimes have benefits that vary from the normal venues. with our casino all you needed was a player's card attached to an email to get in on the offer. your mileage may vary and all that.
yeah no problem! we had a bunch of those holds too, definitely. it wasn't at all uncommon to get a handful of holds back here or there, but just as often we would use up all the holds and sell out.
a lot of times we didn't really care- once the ticket's been sold we have no way to police what you do with it (and honestly probably shouldn't, there's very little fundamental difference between giving a ticket to a friend and selling it on the internet beyond the exchange of money). back when we were able to do outside sales for other venues we'd get a guy coming in every once in awhile around 10am pst, right when shows went on sale. dude's name was dave, he scalped and knew tm back to front (he showed me where to find the macro commands and whatnot). nice guy, we knew what he was doing but as far as our "jurisdiction" went he was a guest buying tickets. we didn't really have the ability to deny him tickets or anything like that. there's significantly less power to combat scalping at the cashier's end than people seem to think there is. we're not paid to guess what you're going to do with your tickets, we're here to sell you tickets.
yeah, coding's never been my strong suit. glad you figured out a way to pick it up quickly though, that shit gets complex.
it's no more secure than anything else. security through obscurity is not a valid thing.
i would absolutely have considered it were it not for the two bosses standing beside me and the cameras covering every square inch of floor space.
i'm sure it was that guy personally pocketing your after tax dollars and laughing maniacally.
to be fair, if you live in plant city, you were screwed long ago.
if anything, i'd find them the best seats i could. a lot of times the rude ones are really picky. there wasn't really a bad view in our venue, it wasn't big enough, so my goal became "make them go away as fast as possible".
you're usually better off on the website. it's generally the fastest, even if you pay more.
the turnout was alright for awhile, although they stopped working with us after the renovation. dunno if they found a better place or what, but i don't mind. those shows went on for hours and someone had to stick around till the last fight started so i was usually getting out after midnight.
i thiiiiiiink it's the world's largest stage? maybe the largest in the country? i tried to look it up once and didn't find anything so i don't know if there's any foundation to the claim. it is a huge stage, though. you should have seen empire of the sun back in april, man. it was great, though i felt i was way too sober to get the most out of it.
i keep seeing replies like this... is this real life? obviously if you have zero access to the venue before the event you want to attend, you can't take advantage of the "buy at the venue tip" that has been shared here. people keep pointing this out, as if you're being slighted because it's inconvenient for you to buy in person, when in reality that's the whole purpose of the online system and "convenience" fees. sure everyone knows they're inflated, but it's saving you a trip to get tickets--that's the convenience! and the overall message here (if paying fees just deeply offends you) you can drive to some/most venues and buy tickets with fewer fees.)
those methods are effective at making scalping a pain, but they also make it a pain for regular customers too. people who don't have a credit card and normally use their parents, or people who want to buy tickets as a gift. or even just people who buy tickets and find out they can't make it and sell tickets at face value or give them to friends, etc.
metro's not really my thing, but i'm a big mass effect fan so i'm hoping that anthem is good.
i think david copperfield vanished it once, but that was before my time. these days it just sits backstage with some other old sets and stuff.
yeah, they do. it's a solution, but it's not a perfect one, especially when you have to cancel right before the show.
scalpers have bots that snap them up in milliseconds
depends on the venue. for sports, some of them will have multiple sets of season tickets. i know that msg got in trouble not too long ago for its relationships with brokers.
just from my experience i see tons of people that won't buy tickets past a certain price. shows have gone without selling out despite high demand when the prices were set too high, so i could definitely see it hurting business depending on the specific show. shows that weren't much of a draw in the first place might not get sales at all. it's kind of a tenuous balance, but i never had a hand in pricing the shows so i wouldn't know more than that.
my mom goes to a ticketmaster kiosk at walmart. never checked it out for myself. there still fees through the kiosk?
thats what ticketmaster is, a temple. we all live in its shadow and most don't even know it.
they also own most of the big festivals in america and most of the radio stations here. it's pretty scary when you think about how much influence they have in the music industry.
christ had risen to chris. boy oh boy, that blood sandwich got me all ready eyed when i first heard it, so chill and respectable and just love for his brothers just in case he never has a chance to say those things before any are dead... i fucking love it... also, i only reference the village voice because that's like the industry titan of the alt weekly's in america, i worked for salt lake city weekly tho...
yeah ticketmaster actually wanted to investigate the guy for finding me on reddit so that they could ban him from buying tickets again after he called them and said he found me on reddit. shit got really intense for a little while during it, but yeah, i'm glad they were able to get the man a ticket again.
$500 means a lot more to a customer than it does to ticketmaster. they said it was guaranteed so they should have stood behind that instead of trying to fix someone else's mistake by creating a poor customer experience for op.
why don't you care about people abusing the system
used to work with ticketmaster too, but at a venue. i actually sort of enjoyed tmwin99. autypes ftw.
thank you. people thinking that way is why hacking is so fucking easy in 2017.
so what did your boss end up doing to show him what it's like to have money? did he take him out back and kneecap him like the good old days of the casinos? did he take him to the high rollers room and let him see thousands of dollars being poured into a single tug on the helllooooo machines? did he show him the vault then kick him out? i'm burning with questions as to how this ended.
you also don't need to be so touchy about language. a blind person will say "it's nice to see you" even though she can't see you.
that was basically my job description for the casino, yeah. also the toilet clogging in your room was my fault, i spent the service fee money on six gallons of chili the night before.
record stores still exist?? forgive me for being ignorant here.
oh, even if it's true, you really shouldn't say things like that on the internet. that just encourages even more people to be assholes acting entitled to something.
they probably couldn't sell any tickets at $80. i went to an amateur mma event to watch my buddy fight, it was like $15 to watch at least 10 fights
i put the"convenience fee" in quotes because often times it's more than the cost of 2 or 3 gallons of fuel. even some box offices actually charge the fee.
for sporting events in many big cities they get between $3 and $20 bucks.
this last bit especially. lots of people buy tickets as gifts for others or hand them off to someone else. not only that, it would slow entry down dramatically, which causes problems for my specific venue.
i vaguely recall that when i was way younger too. funny to think they've hung on to it 35 years
maybe you could design advertsing posters for boxers, musical bands, mma, wrestling, comedians..
what you are describing is dynamic pricing and it's a model that many ticket resellers use.
i'd imagine so, yeah. when we sold for other venues we had to charge the full tm fee set.
me specifically? it's not my job. the venue? we didn't really have a way to easily police it without seriously diminishing the guest experience with some form of check at entry, which would slow down an already glacial process at times. add to that that it's not a huge venue that gets sold out immediately and there's no real reason to focus on that over other improvements elsewhere.
that's why you use the shopping cart in sell and hold onto that shit until you're sure they've made up their damn minds.
only ever learned wcprtdos, honestly. i still keep in touch with everyone i worked with so if you know any good ones i'll send them their way to mess with.
until you have something people want a lot, then it's definitely not.
nah, see, that's the old school. these days that kneecapping stuff is, yknow, a crime. instead we just chucked pennies at him and called him names. really though we just kinda kept refusing until he got pissed and asked for the casino manager. gladly gave him the number so that guy could tell him no too.
because "nice to be in your presence" hasn't successfully entered the vernacular yet.
it would be nice if they were forced to advertise an all in price like airlines are now. i'm lucky the venue i go to the most uses another ticketing platform that charges about $4 per ticket for fees.
yeah! they sell a lot of cds and some comic books now, and actual records are hip again. i only know of daddy kool as far as ticket sales. there's definitely one in downtown orlando i forget the name of that sells tickets, so i would look into that if you ever head that way for a show.
but why did you feel the need to talk about san francisco here?
i said it in the other response to this, it doesn't really change what i offer (i'm always out to find people the best seats possible), just the level of customer service i provide. for assholes, it's pretty much just "polite and to the point" to get it over with faster.
part of it's how it's named, too. i noticed it right away- the $3 is officially a service fee and the $2.50 is a facilities fee, no idea what either are actually for. when selling on the phone i'd say "and there's a $3 service fee and $2.50 facilities fee per ticket" and people would get bent out of shape all the time about paying a bunch of fees. when i said "and there's a $5.50 service fee per ticket" i didn't hear a damn thing.
beats me. my best guess is it incentivizes coming in person to the casino, where you're more likely to stick around and buy stuff somewhere else while you're there.
your asking people to do what the system wants, not how they feel. people's feelings have too much recognition, so they will use them whenever they can.
when i played there a few years ago the production manager told us that it's too much effort to take it apart and since the stage is so huge they can just keep it on the back half and no one will ever know it's there.
sounds about right. i've got a design degree, not an economics degree. i'm just kinda talking out of my ass on this specific stuff.
well yea. why do you think its called a convenience fee?
michigan here, too. "soda" is becoming more and more popular, i just don't think i'm ready for such a drastic change in vernacular.
i had to get out of ticketing because the onslaught of calls got to me eventually. fun thread to read, though, as a former box office manager. i've used four different ticketing systems, and learned more from that field about programming and hardware than i ever imagined i would. future programmers could have a lot of fun in that field, but i have no desire to pursue that stuff anymore.
i would just play dumb... "what's this money for? you already paid for your seats." and then if he says it's for me, i keep it. if he says i can have it to upgrade seats, i could still just say something like "oh sorry, you can only buy the tickets that are for sale"
i'd love to see someone propose the legislation just to watch them gasp and choke.
san fransisco isn't the only place with a bay and an area surrounding said bay.
exactly. pay $5 online for the convenience of not having to pay $10 at the kiosk. makes perfect sense.
my girlfriend is from port huron, mi and i'm from mississippi. we have this argument constantly. we southerners call everything "coke" down here. it drives her nuts. lol what part of michigan are y'all from?
but if you don't live near one of those other areas, "bay area" is san francisco.
thanks for clarifying. i wasn't sure what was going on. yes, the mcdonalds box office is great.
honestly i didn't mind this job at all. i had zero interest in it being a long-term career, but i'm glad i worked there instead of at a fast food place or mall store or something.
except it's usually $30-40 a ticket online for *convenience*
that's a shame, as i'm a pretty big nin fan. i'm actually wearing a nin fan club shirt right now...
i don't think i've ever seen anyone use the " mark when spelling out nine inch nails before
for sure man. i didn't say that would be a bad thing, i just thought the joke was the irony of still doing work related to the venue. and i hear you about interesting jobs. i worked at a patio furniture factory before my "career", it was pretty enjoyable and definitely memorable.
22.86cm nails doesn't quite have the same feel. take that, metric system!
native yoopers typically call it pop. anything besides that means the speaker is from away. source: married a keweenaw yooper 15 years ago and became a transplanted troll.
actually disney totally left us alone, we did what we wanted. we got one note from michael eisner that said "love the show, could use more history" (eg)
we actually haven't yet seen it. i (eg) just saw the documentary bill nye: science guy and loved it. i laughed, i cried.
never imagined the success of the original show. we talked about the show being relevant for 3-5 years, max. almost 25 years later, to have so many millennials say they got into science from the series is so amazing to me. and just a shout out to mike green, composer of the theme song.-(jm)
thanks - we were never approached though always happy to help out (eg)
good question. bill leaned more to education, we leaned more to entertainment, a constant battle so to speak. we always felt if they are not having fun they will tune out. bill kept us on point with the message. we always tried to present different ways to learn, i (eg) got the most out of the sketch/humor parts, so i always leaned towards that. bill always had great real world analogies. there were times we felt a show might be a little flat and then it went thru audio post at bad animals and we were always cracking up in the final review.
on camera, bill played the science guy. off camera, bill was bill nye, human- one that loves, laughs and is passionate about what he does. to be on camera, you have to push that personality.
bill was very much influenced by mr. wizard. when it came to the production of the show we were very influenced by mtv sports and the pbs show square one television.
we were as surprised to hear about this as anyone. we actually found out about it through reddit comments. we have no idea who did the edit. (jm)
as far as i know, nothing flip-flopped, if anything he seems to have become more political. we totally support his stance on climate change. (eg)
oh man, that's so long ago, i don't remember. we had a great writing team, mike green and tom mcgurk did the music. i loved so many of the music videos in fact we had a whole episode with them. it was the top 11 countdown - because 11 is a prime number (that's a bill thing) eg
we all worked together at king-tv in seattle. there was no picking. it just was. (eg)
probably not. i also wished i was related to the gottlieb pinball machine empire. (eg)
absolutely. i majored in film and broadcast production and minored in environmental science - and when i grew up i wanted to do environmental documentaries....so years later i'm on the set of bnsg and a friend taps me on the shoulder and says - you know you are doing what you always wanted to do. i didn't even realize it at the time. (eg)
that it continues! and my favorite educational show on right now...you mean other than biz kid$ of course, i'd say arthur, still an all time favorite. make sure to go visit the bizkid$ website and take a look at what we are up to nowadays! www.bizkids.com (eg)
hey there! to answer your question, he was born into it. (eg)
you went on to be a scientist because of the show? thank you! that was the plan. we were working on the idea of a financial literacy show for years called financial genius. we met our canadian partner, jeannine glista, with her idea for a show on kid entrepreneurs called biz kid$. now, we do about five stories on kids and their money per episode, all wrapped around one general theme. so many kids think they can't do this, but when you see where some of these kids come from and the ways they are building their financial futures, it can be mind blowing. some have become multi-millionaires. and i think if these kids can do it, anybody can. (jm)
like a proud momma! that is one of my favorite quotes as well as is "keeping shaking science guy the sapphires fall to the bottom" (eg)
i would absolutely love to see some statistics on the effects of the show. we hear from someone almost daily about how the show impacted their lives and they made a decision to go into a field of science because of it. that is very gratifying. (jm)
it took weeks for a show to come together. we shot the show in segments and would usually shoot segments for three to five episodes over the course of a single day. if we were in the field, for example, we might be doing something on reptiles in the morning and rivers in the afternoon. we generally shot on the main stage on weekends because it was when our science kids were free from school. we could usually do the lab scenes for two shows over a weekend. offline usually took three weeks, online was a week, audio post went another week. (jm)
the original disney presents bill nye the science guy series had very little negative comments from the scientific community. at the time, we tried to do the best research our budget allowed. we had a team of qualified young science researchers and a broad based science advisory board. we did our best with the information available at the time. now, of course, there is this thing called the internet... (jm)
the pilot episode of our series was funded by a republican administration. the series was funded by a democratic administration. this is one of those important discussions we should have over a beer. (jm) this is not a one beer discussion. (eg)
you realize these guys have nothing to do with "bill bye saves the world" right?
they already said bill, because mr wizard is already dead. a bit harsh, though scientifically accurate.
that's not a bad idea. get your foot in the door. learn everything you can on the job. you can start working on your own show for cheap - shooting stuff on your phone. (eg)
1. at king-tv, we worked together. 2. the food. jim went to one of the baths with one of our hosts and enjoyed it so much he went back the next morning and didn't realize (couldn't read the sign in japanese) that they switched the male and female areas and next thing i hear are ladies' screams.... 3. yes, it was an effort to not have the education overwhelmed by the humor/entertainment. we did have one rule of the road that the science was always the science and no faking/drama. 4. probably my parents, even if i didn't want to admit it. (eg)
pat cashman is the "what?" guy. the character was created by jim wilson, audio designer, at bad animals studio. they were always filling the show up with sound. a lot of that sound was an attempt to make us laugh and we encouraged it. one episode, at the final mix, a scene goes by where bill says something a little complex. there was a brief pause, we hear a deep-voiced "what?" and fall over laughing. almost immediately we start getting scripts featuring just the voice! we quickly decided that only jim wilson could place pat's voice. (jm)
i was an associate producer for the first three years of almost live! i gravitated to john keister's stuff and tried to help him every chance i could. one sketch i remember was called hydro hijinks, about the hydroplane races we have every august here in seattle. in our version, it was actually local norwegian fishermen trying to catch salmon faster with boats that exceeded 120mph. another sketch was keister's lifestyles of the almost rich and famous, with robin leach. in john's version, his fortune was made selling amway. we did a reunion show of sorts with a series we called the [206]. i just missed doing a show in front of a live audience. it was a blast. (jm)
bigly. when we started the series we had one of the first avid edit stations (non-linear editing) and one of the editors said he felt he was editing with mittens on. we don't shoot on tape anymore. for a while there we had to remember to brings drives to off load the media. you can probably shoot way more than you need cuz you aren't going to run out of tape. today, getting your show on can be as simple as posting on youtube, i guess. (eg)
we were very influenced by mtv sports. we also thought if we were getting bored of a segment - we'd switch the channel for you, so we threw in static and abruptly cut to the segment. we also had an awesome edit team. (eg)
i wouldn't call it censoring as much as updating it to fit the way scientists think of gender nowadays. also, it's been made clear in othet comment chains that netflix didn't edit the show: when they got it it was already changed.
oh now you're having me go way back into my past (eg)
we touch a little on economics, but i think you may be right. possible new series idea? (jm)
bill, most definitely. and we built the show around him. (eg)
scientists aren't 'accredited'. part of the whole thing is anyone, anywhere, can be a scientist by simply following the scientific method. there is no accreditation board where you earn a title and it's not regulated the way claiming to be an md or jd is. would you consider the mythbusters scientists, that's also primarily engineering.
sex and gender are different things, scientifically speaking. the quote is about gender.
we are currently putting our efforts into biz kid$ and appreciate your comment. (though we never say never) eg
i didn't intend to portray that. and bill, to my knowledge, has not claimed to have a phd. (jm)
i know it's a little later, but if you see this, i'll be ever grateful. thanks for doing this, guys. could you elaborate on the 'history'? what changes did you make? does a certain instance come to mind?
do yourself a favor and just don't watch it, knowing that it ruined the original bill nye: tsg for many of us...
you poor, poor man... also: "bill! bill! bill! bill!" sorry, habits and all.
thanks. i loved the sound effects as a kid, and that's probably a huge reason why i watched the show. they made him come across as like the friendliest mad scientist.
i'm glad you did. hearing the same lessons from different people/perspectives really helped me remember a lot as a kid.
did having 100 rather than 85 episodes help with syndication?
were you influenced by *3-2-1 contact*, which my local pbs station ran back-to-back with *square one*?
do you think it was the right or wrong thing to do?
uh why would they answer a troll question. chromosomes determine the biological sex of a person. gender is a social construct. the only reason you people are asking this is to stir shit up.
he's now pro-gmo after so much research has come out refuting early scientific concerns.
thanks for taking the time to respond. hope you guys accomplished what you wanted and i'll always remember the time watching with my friends when we were youngins.
do you have a favorite pinball (or general arcade) machine?
snl changed my life and i wanted to do a comedy show for national distribution from seattle. at that time, doing any show from seattle was virtually impossible. it was many years of struggle and low budgets, but we always focused on doing humor while casting bill in commercials and industrial videos while trying to pay the rent. we kept seeing a need for science education and thought people always remember things that are funny. so, we got to do a science based comedy show from seattle. i really did get to do my dream. (jm)
were the early seasons of arthur an influence on bntsg? at the time its approach of having a story arc that followed the characters through an entire episode was often contrasted to the fast-paced, segment-driven approach of bntsg and sesame street. (meanwhile, square one had lots of short segments but it was the ongoing monday-to-friday mystery storyline of its mathnet serials that kept me watching through each week!)
that show idea honestly sounds fantastic. i hope it is as successful as bill nye the science guy.
wow - totally missed that, reddit proves once again i cannot have an original thought.
what resolution was the show digitally edited in? is it enough for the episodes to be shown in current hd and upcoming ultra hd resolutions?
if they were to update it they would've added a scene in that episode that talks about how gender is infinite and you can identify as whatever you want to be. instead they ripped out that part of how you can or could've been one of two genders like some orwellian dystopian novel, changing history to fit a political narrative. this wasn't an update. this was censorship plain and simple.
thank you for not preemptively self-censoring! i guess it's not as surprising there wasn't as much pushback given that fox made fun of its own programming with *the simpsons* episodes "the springfield files" and "lisa the skeptic". i am a bit surprised that pbs thought you were "too zingy" given that the approach of making educational shows fast-paced and crammed with short segments to catch the interest of short-attention-span kids was pioneered by *sesame street*!
perhaps my phrasing was off. i meant having a recognised qualification in a scientific field. physics/biology/chemistry. if anyone who has ever done an experiment is now a scientist as you suggest i fear the bar has been set rather low.
but goonies is based in astoria. this makes you much cooler than the kids in sea.
i'm used to it by now. it's worse when it's a group and i have multiple people standing around chanting my name. also: "bill nye the science guy!"
in case they don't answer, 100 is usually the minimum needed to be considered for syndication, though clearly there's no law so exceptions can be made.
netflix says that buena vista gave them the series in that state, so unless something compelling emerges to suggest netflix is lying, it's seems likely that the distributor is to blame.
yes, hormones and chromosomes are clearly socially constructed. are you retarded?
marx's "nature of man"? yeah, a lot of what he wrote has been updated as new information comes out. many historical texts are preserved with a forward about outdated information though.
i linked the wikipedia above, yours is basically a boiled down version of the scientific consensus. interestingly, while my comment is at -11, the wikipedia bot backing me up is at +5.
that's one thing that i find really separates a true scientist and some one who cherry-picks scientific evidence. a true scientist isn't afraid of changing their stance when presented with evidence.
my family is from montana and i have a touch of salish tribal blood in me from my mother. dad's side were irish settlers. i almost impulse bought erren a gottlieb cowboys and indians machine. kicked myself that i didn't. (jm)
that's like saying gravity is just a theory. it's not "just a poll" it's the only thing that matters, because otherwise nothing is true.
you didn't re-phrase it at all. "scientist" has one definition: a person who follows the scientific method. a degree has no bearing on that. but he does have an engineering degree, which is applied science. his contributions to science have been recognized by many groups you seem to care about though. he has been given honorary doctorates from several colleges and universities, usually in simply "science". if you want someone with a pedagogy, earning an honorary doctorate from johns hopkins should do it.
and free willie, and kindergarten cop, and short circuit... damn, seattle blows compared to astoria.
i bet it was. and he is probably a "dick" because someone's aunt said he was rude to her at a gas station at 1am.
wasn't it syndicated during its run, before the 100th episode concluded it?
billy quan beat up john keister with his flying leg-attack, but only because keister did not mind his manners.
while that sucks for netflix, it just means that the anger should be directed towards buena vista. just because it wasn't netflix doesn't mean it's not a bad thing.
/r/td has been brigading this submission from the start. original commenter's question was one of the very first intentionally planted.
absolutely. even if they ran an entire episode that hinged upon something that turned out to be dead wrong, we could learn about the time period and the scientific process from the result. it is never the right decision to censor the past.
plenty of people are born missing a finger too. that doesn't mean the number of fingers on a human hand is a "spectrum". those are called evolutionary defects. i'm not saying we need to get rid of them or treat them nasty or oppress them or really do anything but treat them as equals. i'm even perfectly fine altering pronouns for my trans friends. but this whole "gender is fluid and there are endless numbers of them" nonsense? yeah thats bullshit.
hippocrates nature of man, you are the one who brought up humors. also, marx never wrote anything titled nature of man, and i strongly doubt that anyone has updated the ideas in any of marx's writings, as changing marx's political philosophies from what he had written would be a massive disservice to history. a man's ideas don't get updated once he's died. other people like lennin built on his ideas, and added their own, but they never went back and changed what was written in marx's writings.
gosh, maybe people are just offended about the balance of humors thing. is that making a comeback in some alternative medicine or something? ancient greek medicine, it's so old, it must be right!
and yet many will still criticize it for being flip flopping and imply that it damages the credibility of scientific claims.
also primes wouldn't be produced by inanimate processes that go in cycles, like pulsars (whose radio output was in fact originally thought to be too regular to be natural).
no i'm not saying that at all. gravity was/is a real thing and not a social construct. i'm sorry that xx/xy mean something scientifically and not based on your views of things. saying there's more than 2 genders is based on ones views and opinions nothing more. saying gravity doesn't exist is the same as saying we have a flat earth. that's just stupid. facts are facts. it's black and white. if a person cannot and/or will not see that makes them ignorant.
i second this. it's not your fault bill sacrificed science for social justice street cred.
apparently he's an absolute nightmare to interview because he doesn't answer your questions. he waits for you to stop talking so he can make some kind of convoluted point about the atmosphere that we've all heard from far better sources. back when reddit wanted nothing more than to suck is wrinkled dick, the entire site shit on a newscaster who was trying to interview him about his new upcoming show and basically gave up because literally all he wanted to talk about was climate change. he was being a huge condescending asshole and reddit ate it up. he treats interviews like an episode of hardball or something. i'm glad things have kind of changed.
bill actually does have multiple "doctor of science", though they're all honorary.
why would it make you angry? it was edited to be scientifically valid. science has made advancements in the last 25 years, and scientists have come to the conclusion that gender and sex are different and that chromosomes determine sex. gender is a social construct. i know it makes a lot of redditors butt hurt to read but it's a fact.
what the actual fact. so you people think a science show should spread misleading information to children just to satisfy your hunger for "not changing history"? what?
sex and gender are two different things. sex is biological science, gender is social science. and they both back up my argument
why is it that every time someone disagrees with you it's an organized conspiracy?
there are 62 sources there, feel free to choose a few you deem hard science. wikipedia is meant to be a brief, accessible introduction with sources. do you want to read a paper analyzing brain scans demonstrating the non-binary nature of gender?
well gender is a linguistic device. sex refers to anatomy. that's literally how it has always been... i'm not even on the left and i know that that's the accepted way things are. gender is a social construct, sex is not. you are physically either male or female, but psychologically there is a lot more variance. come on, that's just obvious.
no one said anything about fluidity. just that gender isn't determined by chromosomes.
"**on the** nature of man** is by polybus. and doesn't change my reply except subbing a name.
the world is flat, and all of our humors are falling off the edge!
primes **do** occur in nature though. numbers of petals. dormancy cycles of cicadas. it's not entirely unreasonable that they may be created by a natural radio source. that assumption is exactly what lead to confusion about pulsars like you mentioned.
well i'm in america and was assuming we were measuring in pints of piss-beer
i may be incorrect, but it feels as though you're using that term as a pejorative. if so i would say that what saves the world was attempting was not social justice. social justice is a means to provide equal opportunities to succeed for all those within a society. what bill's show did was provide veeerrrry basic science followed up by condescending remarks aimed at the supposed opponents of science, and blanket poorly explained and generally sarcastic dismissals of opposing views. while many people will try to prop up any contemporary culture clash as social justice warriors vs _____, the term is not applicable. in this case a poorly executed attempt to pander to his own audience rather than convince the people that deny scientific work is being presented. it's pretty much the opposite of what social justice attempts to do.
my how the times have changed indeed! i remember the furious circle jerk over that larry wilmore interview just like it was yesterday...
well apparently the edit has been improperly pinned on netflix and it actually comes from buena vista.
he may not be bill cosby, but watch out for his sex junk
because you don't edit the past. add an annotation or something, but without understanding the past ideas you can't progress to the future. also, hell no science hasn't proven that. people just say it is that way,evidenced by the fact that no one agrees whether it's sex or gender that is chromosome based.
or reality doesn't agree with you. clearly we can see this literally happening. someone down votes you, label them a troll, suggest it's organised. it can't just be reality saying you're wrong. if you down vote me, it's clearly a brigade doing it and you're a troll.
sure. would you care to name those genders for me and what establishes them as unique?
you don't have any idea how wikipedia works, do you?
absolutely. not only is that quantifiable, but its also demonstratable. theres proof. even on the small scale. except gender isn't sexuality. and your idea of "gender" isn't quantifiable. nor is it discernable, and you guys don't even seem to have a name for any of them on this magic spectrum.
nah it's alright, ive lived up here just shy of a decade myself and it's not the city i'm enamored with; it's the pnw in general. seattle just makes this beautiful place convenient to live in ;)
what bill's show did was provide veeerrrry basic science followed up by condescending remarks aimed at the supposed opponents of science, and blanket poorly explained and generally sarcastic dismissals of opposing views. episode 9 "sexual spectrum" with its ice cream orgy and sex box beg to differ. the episode starts with misleading information about x and y chromosomes and keeps going off the rails from there so sad.
you can think larry wilmore is an unfunny hack who should never be broadcast anywhere, and not like bill nye
and it's an update to remain scientifically valid.
uh whatever you say. the thing is we spend some time outside of reddit, too. and reddit does anything, but reflect reality. more like helps people with a strong opinion to let each other be heard. reddit is as far as you can get from reality when it comes to any social issue.
i actually know a lot about wikipedia their strict editing policies and their nazi editors that revert any change that don't have any proof especially in controversial articles like the one linked here. you on the other hand judging by your other replies in this thread are simply an antisocial neckbeard who has some deeply seated agenda or something. educate yourself dude, pick up a book or visit a lecture on actual social science. ignorance/disapproval of modern science, because you don't like it and your grandmama told you something different when you were growing up doesn't make you cool. just deserving of pity, if these were the middle age and you had no other way to educate yourself. but you have, you live in the age of information with all the world's science at your fingertips and you still behave like an ignorant child. how sad.
no, what people mean when they use it to denigrate people they disagree with and what it means are two different things.
except there really isn't. the distinction was made out of boastful discredulity between disciplines years ago and is propped up by contemporary people who don't want to consider or integrate changing viewpoints. you could make the more credible argument that "soft sciences" are less reliable due to greater difficulties extracting signal-heavy data and due to the relative newness of the disciplines. and you could certainly make the argument that there are many underinformed people claiming expertise on these subjects. but science, as a methodology, isn't excluded from topics just because they're difficult to study, new to rigorous scrutiny, or, most importantly, don't conform to one's existing view of what science will reveal. you can question results and methods, but denigrating entire fields of study is profoundly anti-science in itself.
yeah the fact that you have all these downvotes and no replies speaks volumes. but reddit's a platform for open discussion, right fellas?
even in science, gender can be considered from a phenotypical or genotypical way. gender could be based on xy chromosomes (which naturally occur as xx xxy yy y x xyyy xxy etc but generally only the xy and xx can reproduce) or physical traits (a penis, a vagina, both, partially unformed, completely unformed as in testosterone immunity among xy individuals). in both cases, gender is ambiguous and there is debate on how to define gender. if its the ability to reproduce, then why and what do you with those who cannot as? if its on physical appearance, then what do you do with ambiguous appearance and behavior?
by questioning me, you are oppressing all other-kin. i don't ask you to prove your gender, don't ask me to prove mine. *licks paw for science*
social justice is the philosophy of equality. social justice warriors aren't interested in equality, but preferential treatment. the two are not the same. i support social justice, i have serious disagreements with social justice warriors.
physics and engineering are based on mathematics. sociology is based on philosophy. the two aren't even playing the same game, let alone in the same ballpark.
one is based on logic and mathematics. the other is based on subjective thought. they are world's apart.
it's a field of psychology. i'd say that "it's in peoples head on a massive scale" is probably one of the best descriptions of psychology i've come across.
male, female, outliers who do not participate in reproduction... not difficult to grasp. also, gender and sex are not the same thing. oversimplifying a bit, sex is what you are, and in humans that's a binary state (abnormalities don't count, you don't call a person with one arm a different kind of human, that's a regular human with a missing part), we are sexually dimorphic. gender is what you identify as. what you are in your mind. it is very much a social construct and covers the entire spectrum of behavioral variance, which does not fit neatly into the male and female binary that morphology imposes.
see, you're wrong, because you refuse to accept the definition of gender. you're describing sex. would you say that the golden state warriors are a great baseball team? no, because you're using the word baseball when you mean basketball. just like when you say there are only two genders, you're using the incorrect word.
ok so all you have are strawman arguments. got it. don't know if you know this but to get gender reassignment surgery or to get your birth certificate changed you do, in fact, have to "prove" your gender via a really intense and comprehensive course of therapy and counseling.
all of it? oh dear. can you please tell my where my sociological argument of gender is flawed, and perhaps give a counter argument? actually, a lot of the names i gave do all come under the non-binary umbrella, so they are very similar in that sense - the distinctions between many are blurred and do depend on the persons own feelings as there are so few studies to definitively label gender identities. however, i feel that if someone has fully read up on a term, e.g. gender queer, has given it lots of thought as to how that term relates to them and their feelings, i don't think that they are confused at all; they have made an educated call. it is true that they might be confused, but that is generally because how they feel (typically social/physical dysphoria) does not align with what society is telling them is true. it's their truth as they experience it vs how society are telling them they *must* be experiencing it.
thanks for the question. i would say we were very strongly investing in mmos in the late 90's/early 2000s and we stopped that side of the business because it wasn't performing well enough and we should have continued on with that.
hi! splinter cell is a brand we talk about a lot. it's also personally one of my favorite series. we don't have anything specific to share at the moment but teams are working on different things, so stay tuned for more.
hi there, that's a good question. i think yes and no, we have encountered some problems recently and we have some work to do on improving our services. it's a tough learning experience but i think we are progressing well. at the same time i'm very proud of the games we've released over the last few years and the success of live games like rainbow six siege, the division, for honor, the crew and steep i also am incredibly proud of what we showed yesterday at our e3 conference.
to expand on this question, what games from other companies have helped inspire you and drive you to create better games for the consumers?
hi there, it would probably be decisions about which projects to persue and which ones to cancel. telling a team who've been focused on a project for several years that they won't be able to continue it is very tough. however what i have seen is when we do cancel projects it is almost always for the best, it gives us an opportunity to learn to refine our ideas and come up with better games.
i would love to hear an answer for this. siege is such a special game, it deserves more love from the finance department. as a follow up question, have you been surprised at the growth and dedication of the rainbow six siege community?
i love it! it's the first time that we have seen that level of engagement and passion around a game we've created.
it's tough to choose by i would say assassin's creed because it gives me an opportunity to explore history. but i love all our games so it's very tough to pick.
to become a ceo i would say pick a fast growing industry you are interested in, surround yourself with the best and work hard!
i would say far cry 3 on the xbox one x would be amazing :)
we have to go where we can find the best talent! we're always looking for very talented engineers, so i would be happy to open a studio anywhere we can find great people :)
hi there, first things first i read them! i very often dispatch and share them with our teams with my comments and i think they help us prioritise what we need to fix and get a good insight into the biggest concerns of our communities.
guy that was heading the story (i don't remember his name) left the company some time ago. starting either with brotherhood or revelations it was basically axed and is not coming back.
if you see me on the booth please come say hello!
thanks for the question! at ubisoft what we try to do, when we can, is take ideas that people have and then try to make that 100% of their job. for instance star link which we announced yesterday came out of a game jam we had in toronto and we were able to make that into a full project, for honor was also a passion project that we were able to turn into a reality. and it has happened for many games we've published over the years!
i think streaming will be the next big thing, but it will take time before it is ready. streaming will totally change the way we create and play games, and will again positively disrupt how we think about gaming.
as video game creators we have the fantastic power to anticipate and build games that allow us to experience what the world could look like in ten years-time. playing these games is a way to test and learn and this i believe will have a positive impact on the world.
for us the world, systems and the gameplay mechanics are key to building a great game!
i would love to hear an answer for this. i loved the division despite its bugs/exploits. the dark zone pvp was possible the best i have ever played when everyone was legit. wish the player base on pc didn't dwindle to almost 0 =(
1. swiss dark chocolate! i always have a stock on my desk for long meetings.
just wait, they said they weren't interested in egypt a few years back, but here we are.
i thought it would be big, but not this big. what is amazing with this industry is that technology is always giving us fantastic new opportunities to disrupt different genres and segments of games and to create new ones. i believe interactive entertainment is the future of entertainment, and we still have huge opportunities in front of us.
thanks very much, it's great to see such a positive response to our conference. my dog's name is buddy!
amas work of you ask one question. if you want to ask another question, post another question. flip the coin and now you're the one answering the questions. do you want to answer ten different questions from ten different people, or ten questions all from one person?
recent ubisoft games (watch dogs 2, ghost recon wildlands, steep and probably some others i forgot) were not downgraded at all compared to the gameplay footage shown before release. so i think you can expect far cry 5 to look like in the gameplay trailer.
they'll probably roll out updates for both ps4 pro and xbox one x. it doesn't make sense for them to only do so for one platform. same way as how the pc versions have been getting better graphics than both console versions, which will continue.
iirc it's called a "hostile" takeover as it's without the owners' approval, only the shareholders giving it a ok.
because they give us free dlc like rainbow six. they are the first one to push this model and they gotta make money somehow
nobody really knows for sure. he was found washed up on a beach and didn't remember anything before that. he might be the only creature in the world he inhabits not to have originally been dreamed into creation by polokus.
shadowbane was way ahead of it's time. glad you guys published it! cheers
thank you for the reply. splinter cell really hits home for me. since the first splinter cell title i played as kid gave me the tools and discipline that i have continued to use throughout my life. it also was the main reason why i joined the military. i have a really deep connection with the splinter cell family. my dream one day is to really be apart of the series in some way. i act and do vo so maybe one day that dream can become a reality. i'll keep my eyes open. thank you for all that you and your company continues to do.
removing the uplay requirement on games you sell on steam would go a long way in improving your services, as well as public opinion. players shouldn't have to go through two stores to play one game.
what are his favourite non-ubisoft games released in the last 2-3 years?
when one of your teams has been working on a game for years, what would make you change your mind and come to the decision that the project has to be stopped? i'm only asking out of curiosity!
i usually just use my right hand, but sticks are cool too i guess.
thanks for answering my question. yep assassin's creed 1 is my favorite in the series, looking forward to orgins as well!
i do agree that r6s is one of the best fps games in history and i am hoping the game gets to another level after op health
thank you for your reply! i hope you guys continue to work with nintendo.
you're one of the best, ill work hard. how do i surround myself with you?
you know, if you really wanted it, you could make it happen :d
it's a great idea, really. there was a great assassins creed game that had a brand new really cool ship element. ("oh boy, this is so much fun, i hope they make an assassins creed pirate game!") and then you made exactly what i was thinking - i preordered black flag. now the team makes the best decision possible, an ancient egypt assassins creed and totally separate proper pirate game and all my dreams came true.
the playerbase on pc didn't dwindle to almost 0. i still play everyday and have no trouble matchmaking for anything (other than last stand.) steamdb says it still averages around 5000 players a day
we might have different ideas about gaming, but you know what chocolate is about. thanks for the reply!
you guys deserve the positive feedback. the ubi conference won e3 this year without a doubt, ac origins far cry 5 and the crew 2 all look great- alot of the new ips look very promising. hopefully ubisoft's reputation will turn around in the next few years, your games have received a boost in quality recently, and by the looks of things taking a year off for ac looks like it's paying off. honestly, thank you.
exactly, people have to forget the past. it seems like ubisoft learned their lesson in terms of downgrading.
shareholders of a company are the owners. management of a company are appointed by the owners to oversee their investment. a hostile takeover is done without the approval of management, but needs the approval of shareholders to agree to sell their shares.
holy shit i almost forgot about shadowbane, i sure have some fond memories of that game.
same. bought a 360 for blacklist. don't own anything newer.
this is a tough sell, as you are telling ubisoft to give up 30% of their sales price to steam (they charge money, you know)
i'm pretty sure ceos measure success in numbers of unit solds, or profits.
i don't work for ubisoft, but i can read between the lines and the only way nintendo was going to license mario was if he was the star and the star alone. rayman isn't as important to ubisoft as mario is to nintendo, so that's likely why rayman isn't present.
changes in the industry either competition or technology are definitely a factor. similarly the breakthrough that we thought we had may no longer be relevant and sometimes we do realize that we are unable to execute what we had hoped to achieve.
one of the things i am proud of is that we have something in our line-up for many types of players and this is something we will continue to develop. we will still make games that are only solo or only multiplayer as long as they provide super rich and engaging experiences.
formal education isn't required for almost any purely design role. it's a plus, but that's all... for now. however, as game design gradually becomes a field adopted more across the world (i myself study it at university), it's likely to become a mandatory requirement. either way, large, high quality mods are great. it's all about your portfolio, and if you can showcase design skills through modding, then you're fine. developing your own games will always be better, but plenty of modders get into the industry all the time.
uplay let's ubisoft make more money. steam takes 30% of sales revenue from games sold on its platform. so for every $1mil sold of games, ubisoft would be missing out on an additional $300k if they sold on steam and didn't create uplay all together. now the fact that you can still buy say watch dogs on steam and then still have to open uplay to play makes no sense to me other than maybe they hope to try and persuade you to buy from their store by flashing you a sale ad or something as your game loads. beats me
they're already being charged money, as they currently sell their games on steam. adding the uplay requirement doesn't change that.
not a joke at all. just because you do something for a long time doesn't mean it's perfect or completely polished, or that you can't complain about the myriad issues with it. there are less than ~5k people at any one time playing this game that isn't even that old. most of the time the numbers hover just over 2k. seeing as it opened to almost 120k players and had as many as 20k players 6 months ago, yeah i'd say my gripes are valid. when a game as old as tf2 still has over 50k players on a regular basis, you know you fucked up. hell, euro truck simulator 2 has more players w/ ~20k, a fucking **truck sim**!
but they let sega make mario & sonic games. sonic is easily sega's icon.
since hindsight is always 20/20, did you ever regret stopping a project?
it comes from ubiquitous so just like you pronounce the 'ubi' in that.
i'm not on the money side of things, but i also believe it's more that we are all gamers and we want you to be able to game from whatever platform you choose, so we put a lot of effort and code into trying to make that experience for you good. same with origin, we do a bunch of stuff with them that most users don't see. but uplay is our main platform, simple as that so most things go through us. as i described in the other comment, we designed the new client to be minimal with steam if you have your accounts linked, then we only show a small splash screen when we're loading and then the game open. no more platform that pops in your face before your game launches, at least for the last 2 years or so now. cheers! :d
removing uplay would mean creating and curating two seperate server infrastructures for multiplayer for the platform where their cut is smaller anyways so that doesn't make any sense, also steamworks multiplayer has cracked workarounds while uplay servers don't, which is also a piracy deterrent.
i understand your concerns but you must see that from ubi's perspective, you bought their game (full price i guess with your time spent) and played 1000 hours on it. they mustn't see much room for improvement after that. the decrease in players is normal since this is a game with an end and no purpose to continue after that. on my side i bought it, played it with a friend and did the missions a couple more times to get better gear then i stopped when i realized that getting better gear wasn't useful. i thought it was okay. not memorable but okay.
yeah, and they are both very marketable and were 'peers' for a long time. if you had a picture of rayman, mario, and sonic. i bet most people would know who mario is, a majority would know sonic, and only a small handful would know who rayman is. which is why nintendo would have laughed at the idea of putting them on the same level in a ubisoft produced game.
he basically answered this - he regrets phasing out their mmo projects.
i liked blacklist :( but i do miss the shadow meter telling you how hidden you are along with the adjustable walking speed and more emphasis on sound
that's how it should be though. they should give you incentives to use uplay, but not force people who've bought it through steam to use uplay too.
there are many things that the division community has commented on as far things that have room for improvement, so that isn't a good excuse for ubisoft. not when there are glitches/bugs and broken game mechanics that have been in the game since the very first beta test. also there are plenty of "games with an end" that have well over 20k current players, so that's also not a valid reason for the player base dropping as fast as it has. it seems everyone either wants to shit all over ubisoft or give them a pass given their shacky track record.
i have absolutely no idea why they got rid of all of those mechanics when conviction came out, they fit really well in chaos theory.
thanks! rest of the answer below on your second question. duplicate.
i was goingto do a gym in manila once but i was always going to do one in thailand for sure. its the mecca and phuket is the heart.
hey bud thanks! i got into fighting after watching the karate kid. my gym in thailand is called aka thailand. you can see more about it at akathailand.com. we are building it to become the largest gym in the world so its still a work in progress but moving fast. luke rockhold and javier mendez have been out here training but not dc yet. he trains full time at aka hq in san jose.
hey reion, it was when i realized that i couldn't put 100% of myself into the fight camp and fight. i started setting myself up for a post fight career early and that just grew and grew so for the longevity of my life and future, business is just the best thing for me right now. there is no issue with the language barrier at aka thailand or in phuket. 90% of the people you interact with will have some understanding of english or speak it natively. its a very diverse location due to tourism.
thanks hussain! i have so many favorites now. my teammates at aka of course.... cain, luke, dc, thomson, khabib, etc... as well as so many others! i like the fighters who go out and put it all on the line and go for it. thanks for the kind words!
thank bud! i kneed a guy's tooth out after he was beating up a girl and threw a punch at me and then my friend threw him through a plate glass door. my friend was christian wellisch, who also had several ufc fights. he always got me into the shit, since i was the smallest bouncer. oddly enough, i never get into street altercations, but my bouncing days were crazy.
hey bud, it can be many reasons. i can attest to the fact that you really do miss the fighting itself. the walking out, the fans, the mixing it up, and of course the winning. i think its just hard for fighters to realize when they are too old to do their best. for me, i am happy and content in business now and operating aka thailand. i live vicariously through my fighters and enjoy their highs without any damage to my already damaged brain. ;)
thanks bud. yes they measure us themselves. we go through very rigorous medical testing as well. ufc fighters are some of the healthiest athletes around.
i can't speak for the other gyms but i custom built this gym from the ground up for 2 years making sure it was perfect in every way. we hold the exact same curriculum as our headquarters in san jose and have had an amazing run of success in just 3 years. i don't think you will find a more clean, friendly and modern gym in this entire part of the world. don't take my word for it, check out akathailand.com and scroll to the bottom to see what some of the biggest names in the sport have said about it. ;) email info@akathailand.com, ask for marc and mention reddit, and we will give you a 10% discount.
my fight with damarques johnson at ufc on fox 4 was my most memorable. i had 910 days out of competition and was still not well and it was a huge stage being on the main card on fox. it was a war 1st round but i got the ko in round 2. ;) i think most memorable was coaching mark hunt to his ufc victory over bigfoot silva.
i see the "bare knuckle" muay thai events here in thailand occasionally, but they actually do use rope over their hands. i don't follow actual bare knuckle boxing. best thing about living in thailand for me is just having the gym in such a beautiful location and interacting with such awesome people that come in from all over the world. worst thing is that thailand does not have a cheesecake factory, olive garden, in 'n out, or some other of my favorite american eateries.
yes we do all types of training packages. check out akathailand.com for more info.
we actually get a lot of requests for this! i was actually in talks to do a gym in manila before i finally built aka thailand. never know...
yea he is a stormtrooper and much respect to him for breaking out and taking himself to a level none of us ever dreamed possible.
i agree totally with putting kids in martial arts but not to defend themselves. i think its good for discipline and respect.
absolutely not. most of the guests we get are not fighters at all and are just either looking for a good workout or to have a fun experience. email info@akathailand.com, ask for marc and mention reddit, and we will give you a 10% discount. ;)
lmao no one who went to clear brook is better at anything from it
check out akathailand.com and then email info@akathailand.com for all info on our packages and sponsorship info.
yes i own a big print shop in northern california but i don't work there. i have a great team that runs operations for me. we are about to launch a new updated website soon (spartanscreenprinting.com) as well as another sister company, fighterprints.com. yes i stay in touch with jon fitch. he has been a longtime friend of mine. we used to be roommates actually. he was up here with me at aka thailand a while back as well.
i haven't heard much new from kaensak but we now have lamsongkram chuwattana teaching full time with us at aka thailand. not to keep bringing up my site, but there is a huge archive of video blogs and series we have shot from aka thailand on mikeswick.com. all new and very interesting. thanks for following!
honestly, i like dan hardy and feel no need to beat him up at this point. he is doing his thing and i respect that. i am still contractually obligated to the ufc if i come out of retirement but it would take a lot to make that happen. i would have to get a fight with mcgregor. ;)
i fish occasionally around phuket but my biggest catch was a marlin in cabo years ago.
to work hard, never quit and accept your failures. there will be many, but you must pick yourself back up and push harder. i failed at building a gym in thailand 3 times and lost well into the 6 figures of my life savings before i finally built aka thailand. it was so bad that my teammates at aka hq were really starting to feel bad for me failing at building a gym in thailand and everyone was begging me to stop already and come home. i couldn't quit and took the ufc on fox 4 fight to make the money needed to start aka thailand. lastly, surround yourself with good people. jim rohn famously said "you're the average of the five people you spend the most time with". i think that is true and i had to learn the hard way. be around the people that push you forward and are successful themselves.
of course you want to but if you really think about it, everything happens for a reason and the entire cumulation is what makes you what you are today. as for lpt, surround yourself with success and never give up.

no not really. they talked a lot and many said they would beat me but most of the big talkers lost. i have a good relationship with all of my past opponents now and don't harbor any real hate towards any mma fighters.
don't sweat the small stuff. i overthought too much and added pressure that i shouldn't have.
different guy. mike from mike's gym is a thai guy. this mike is an american guy living in thailand.
to be honest, i haven't been able to keep up. i don't even watch tv that much anymore. its just work and travel and watching the ufc or studying fight tapes.
thanks man i really appreciate you saying that! the gym is at akathailand.com and yes i have tried to fight matt hughes ever since he said he was coming out of retirement and he never responded. that is literally the only fight i would come out of retirement to take.
thanks! the shop prints t-shirts as well as does embroidery and vinyl banners and decals. obviously fight shorts and banners too. spartanscreenprinting.com
thanks brian! it was long hours but good money. i was doing it when the first pt cruisers came out and they were money makers.
there are a lot of thai fighters learning bjj and wrestling now in thailand so there will be eventually.
hello, i would like to know who your friend is. i may know him. as far as transitioning in, i think you just have to come and start networking. its an easy place to come and fit in. good luck!
i still need to get a ticket and learn how to space travel first. hope they have space for me. its gonna be out of this world though! ;)
you have to visualize things that you want in life. actually see them. print them. feel them. want them so much that you will climb out of the slump and chase them.

thanks mcgraner! it was not bad when i won the fights. the second fight in england didn't go so well.
train hard and embrace the mistakes and failures. they lead to success.
be a student and relax. there are many like you. then train hard and embrace the mistakes and failures. they lead to success.
i have a main accountant in america that figures it all out for me and then adds about 250% rate on top and bills me.
its a t-shirt and vinyl print shop. spartanscreenprinting.com (soon will be updated)
i agree with the discipline and respect aspect. i do not think its a good idea for kids to fight at a young age even though it is very common here in thailand. this is a special circumstance though as it is sometimes the only means for them to escape poverty and create a future for their self and their families.
first, thanks for the support! in general many fighters in all gyms sustain injuries. its just part of the game. aka trains hard and therefore, the penalty is a high injury rate. the upside is a high champion rate. luke, dc, cain, thomson, fitch and more... aka has built more champions and stars from the ground up than any other gym on this planet imo. as far as aka thailand, shockingly we never miss a fight over injury and i think we train even harder than at aka hq.
its hard for me to say without all the facts. in general, i think if any fighters have to be drug free, then all fighters should be drug free. its not like we are playing baseball or basketball. we are are fighting, and the use of performance enhancing drugs can cause serious consequences to the health of the clean and honest fighters. its also a very bad message for the kids when they see these successful fighters on drugs. i never used anything and did ok for myself. i wasn't a champion, but i did what i could and did it clean. i think kids need to understand that they also can be successful and even champions in this sport without taking drugs.
it totally depends on why you are going, what your wife thinks about it, how old your kids are etc... its safe but a different lifestyle for sure. many foreigners do live here with their families though.
the wait backstage and the walk to the octagon is quite intense for sure. its a mix of nerves and excitement, and then i transition to a bit of emotional anger right before. i make myself realize that the man standing in the octagon with me is there to take away my dreams and my future and my success. this is unacceptable, and then i fight with everything i have to not let him succeed in his effort.
bangkok and phuket is very safe from malaria so i never had anything more than just the hepatitis vaccinations.
i was never diagnosed with add but was diagnosed with esophageal spasm, which caused me to lose a lot of weight, drop to welterweight, and eventually start focusing more on a post fighting career.
there is no real problem actually. our guests can party and train as much as they want and our fighters are very disciplined and do not cross the line. in order to be a fighter on the team at aka thailand, you have to pass a rigorous probation period where everything is evaluated.
find a good mma gym, be a humble student, and train hard!
i think a warning and then a point deduction next if its clear that the fighter was not trying to avoid doing it. in other words, if a fighter is throwing his open hand out and pokes and eye and gets a warning, then continues to not close his fist and does it again, that should be a point taken away.
hello, i am not a fan of this and am glad usada is coming in now. so long as everyone cannot take steroids, i think that no one should be able to. this is not baseball or basketball. this is a sport where an unfair advantage can have horrible effects on an opponents health.
hey bud, yes you can get the visa's required. my gym has a full administration team that helps all of our students and guests get visa's, whether its for a month or a year. can check out akathailand.com or email info@akathailand.com for more info. my advice would vary depending on what reason you are moving here for, but its a great place that will be an adventure for sure.
thanks and i appreciate it! more weight classes are just going to be a part of the progression of the sport. there are so many fighters now and so many fights. with the current issues of extreme weight cutting, new weight classes will just fix this. before, there were far less opponents and less weight classes is how the promotions could make the great fights people wanted to see. now with so many more athletes, they can make great fights in many weight classes. long story short, yes i agree with more weight classes. i think fighters should be able to focus more of the fight and training and less about weight.
in the very beginning it was a spectacle. shock value entertainment. then it became a legitimate sanctioned sports promotion with the zuffa acquisition. now its as mainstream as any sport and growing faster than any other. the up side is how big it is getting and how much some of the fighters are now making. the downside is that there are so many fights that its hard to keep up. its also hard to make a name for yourself as a fighter now. with over 500 fighters on contract, you really have to be special.
i tell them that i am sorry, i thought i walked into a starbucks for a latte. seriously though, i don't sleep. i try and take on as much as possible because as most people know, you fail a lot more than you succeed. its a numbers game and i enjoy the challenge of chasing success.
do you think the "new breed" of fighter is really that good, or just that marketable? i only ask because a good friend who had a few smokers and than went 4 and 0 in kotc. never even got a shot. just wondering if you had any insight?
it started with me. i invented both swift and quick and then did a combination invention of swick.
what are your thoughts on connor mcgregor? also, what's it like living in thailand?
awesome thanks for answering dude! 1 more if you have time. is your gym open all the time? is 2 weeks enough time to learn anything? looks amazing and i'm on vacation soon!!
hey nocluedad, i set this up myself to answer questions to fans and followers who are interested in my life. i cannot predict what they will ask and i am answering everything. that being said, if you are ever in thailand and need a place to train, please check out akathailand.com. also, if you need some shirts printed for your event or clothing line, check out spartanscreenprinting.com, and lastly for all the latest mma and fight news, check out mikeswick.com. ;)
thanks for answering my questions, and i'm really glad you've set yourself up for success. it always worries me thinking about fighter burnout and injury rates (especially tbis), and really how many fighters have a plan after they're no longer able to step in the ring/cage.
thanks for the reply! you were definitely one of those guys who put it all out on the line. i'll always be a fan. good luck in the future man
thanks for the reply it makes sense, i am glad you are enjoying your life after your fighting career so much, keep up the good work!
who would win, jon jones or stefan struve at catchweight?
now is the time since duterte and putin are kinda buddies now. we gotta use that khabib connection lol.
thank you mike will do! i want to try and make it out there nov/dec
thanks for the reply mike, it's been a pleasure to watch your career
can you text him right now and ask his favourite pizza for "reddit archived knowledge "?
his name is jeff and he is from kentucky. thanks for the advice, i'll look you up whenever i make the jump over.
yeah man i did not mean to criticize thailand at all i love the country. i want to know if you host classes for kids/preteens as i might want to bring my son.
it depends. some are amazing athletes with years of world class experience. some are more the showmen. others have both. my fighter, amir aliakbari came, to me with no mma fights, but world champion level wrestling, and he has had his last 5 fights in rizin and carries a 6-1 pro record.
yes we are open 6 days a week and we have many people who come for just 2 weeks and have a great time. email info@akathailand.com, ask for marc and mention reddit, and we will give you a 10% discount. ;)
you have to invest yourself(be committed), make a solid business plan, then find a solid investor/partner.
thank you. yes you have to have a plan before its too late. i try and help as many of my guys as possible setup post fighting opportunities.
thanks for taking the time to come on here and interact with me!
yes we will be doing kids classes very soon at aka thailand.
thank you so much for answering. mad inspiration for me to get back in shape after a bad back injury. i hope to one day meet you and maybe even hit the bags. thanks again mr quick swick.
awesome thanks! i guess it's time to look at flights. thanks again for answering never expected to see you here haha!
what was the process like negotiating with owners of aka to use their brand for your gym in thailand? did u start this path knowing you wanted to have it be a subsidiary of aka? does the deal effect your bottom line in a significant way?
hahaha i see them as the honey badgers of the fighting world
haha, yup, im quite aware. i got your point tho, was just giving you a hard time. :)
no problem bud, hope to see you at aka thailand one day!
i was an original team member of aka and javier mendez was my head coach. he is the founder of aka and he is also my business partner at aka thailand. we are all the same family. this gym in thailand was just my dream gym so i naturally carried the name and training curriculum.
if you go to mikeswick.com, you can see a recent article we did on a transgender muay thai fighter that is kicking every male's ass here now. sh'he is scary!
we need to stop selling weapons to the saudis. and start buying lasers from lord buckethead.
i would really love for him to explain how he isn't a communist. or better yet why he isn't. because i can see how his views do not constitute communism, but his views are so close in underlying principle that i don't understand why doesn't just fully apply his convictions. does he see a value to capitalism? is that morally ok for him?
his spending is covered and then some, also investing into institutions now will gain profit in the long run
yes, because a politician has never done an ama...
good. otherwise another generation will be disillusioned later after they have made a mistake, rather than before realising what they are voting for.
if you're the the dominant party with a majority there is absolutely no reason to call a snap election unless you're extremely confident of being able to increase it in order to not only consolidate your power but postpone the next election which might take place at a time when things are far less favourable for you. with that in mind, it's pretty incredible that labour even held on to the seats they had, never mind gaining 30 in what was an attempt by the conservative party to decimate the opposition while they were in the midst of in-fighting and performing atrociously in polls.
nobody wants to use trident you twit! we don't live in the cold war anymore, a nuclear attack isnt likely. heck, even then it sill wasnt likely...
the labour party has record levels of support. levels not even seen when tony blair was elected in 1997. i don't think he's done a terrible job. perhaps if labour had backed him and hadn't been infighting they'd be in downing street right now. i personally don't want tory light. i put the blame on blairites rather than corbyn.
whether you refuse scientific research and established medical conditions or not... the "two genders", male and female constitute as multiple genders, do they not?
needed for when machines and ai take over large parts of industry.
i wanted labour to get in so i voted for... lib dems! why did i do this? because in the uk you don't vote for who you want to be prime minister, you vote for who you want to represent you in the house of commons. in my constituency the conservatives have held a seat for quite a long time and the only practical way to remove them was to vote lib dem. the only other party with any chance in my constituency. labour have literally never won a seat for my area in history. unfortunately, tories won 60% of the vote as predicted but i did my best. and labour came in third place with about 8% or something. as predicted. anyway, it's not as simple as people voting for any party but labour. sometimes it's necessary.
you have to be joking. he shares many more parallels with socialism than communism
the difference being that labour already held the majority at the time and lost it. corbyn clawed back 20-odd seats when the polls at the time of the snap election suggested that may should have gained. all depends on what frame of reference you use as to whether it can be considered a success or a failure, really
i think it's being downvoted because it's parroting the press smears. of course he doesn't sympathise with terrorists, the only people who do are other terrorists. i've looked at a lot of these old stories and come to the conclusion that anyone who has ever tried to help any sort of peace process runs the risk of it being twisted by the press as them being a 'terrorist sympathiser'. if we're going to use the same metric, that is. i'm not irish, i'm english, but having read about the history of what england did to ireland over the years... i think it's disgraceful what was done. i'm not personally responsible for it, but my country is, and i feel ashamed that it's part of my country's history. does that make me a terrorist sympathiser?
which is what i don't get about the whole trident thing. why bother with a nuclear deterrent if there's no chance it's going to be used. "i've got a stick i'm not going to use to whack you over the head with and you've got a stick that you're not going to whack me back with. but we both need these sticks so neither of us use them."
support for labour party is higher than when they won... think about what you're saying. you've probably read that in a headline and take it as fact. the support isn't there and comparing it to a landslide victory for them in 1997 is even more absurd.
fine, more than two genders... kek all the salty dislikes.
you need to tell him that /u/iklews says that all he needs to do is learn how to use ms office.
i feel like a lot of the anti-corbyn sentiment is somewhat of a facade for people who don't want to say they support tories - he got the highest labour vote share for decades, there doesn't seem to be the hate for him that everyone's talking about.
communism...socialism...what's the difference? /s (as a matter of fact, as a european living in the united states i have spent a significant amount of time explaining this difference to my american friends.)
do you know how to read you pretentious twat? i specifically said i can see how his goals do not constitute communism. but that the underlying principle behind them are essentially rooted in communism. which is true.
how am i mccarthy here. i'm not the one scared to be labeled a communist.
yea the cold war was a struggle between america and russia. not a struggle between communism and capitalism. i was unaware that we somehow resolved the latter conflict when the soviet union fell and stopped being communist. but yes. communism is at odds with capitalism, that will never change.
yeah, but the 20 point lead was his fault in the first place
a little bit yea. if you sympathize with the ira, you are indeed sympathizing with a terrorist group.
answers about what? he's actually articulate and has views and opinions. he did fuck up that questions about how much was it childcare? would cost but they had it in the manifesto he just didn't remember it i really don't get what you mean. like even if i don't like a party i wouldn't say there's something wrong with them (well unless it's like the kkk or something)
you say that companies are teaching skills - great an all. but i don't think you realise that just on the horizon automation is in bound and will make humans redundant in a shit ton of sectors. automation makes less errors, needs no breaks and takes no salary. there would only be specialised jobs left for people and only so many jobs available for it even if everyone re-educated (which isn't practical for people in their mid age to pay +30,000 for university again). thats why basic income has been trailed in a few countries in europe to prepare for the inevitable. and people are slowly advocating it in usa aswell. its a matter of when. only people living in the past will not agree that it will happen. but it simply is and will.
absolutely. there's a few reasons why he left and took a job on the other side of the us. when spacex made launches autonomous, it took a large amount of pay out of their checks. launches pay time and a half. you also get paid for a full launch regardless of if it scrubs. when spacex took them off their launches, they lost a significant "bonus". nasa has slowed down on their launches as well. second reason is he found a much better offer in alaska. his old employee works out there on radars (my dad was a radar tech in the us navy). he applied, got a substantial offer and took it. he works out there for 8 weeks, flys home for 5 weeks, rinse and repeat.
i just don't like him, if its any consolation i can't stand any of the other party leaders and i mean all of them.
socialism is specifically designed to be transition between capitalism and communism. my question is why socialists don't view themselves as communists. what is the central difference in principle between the two? a socialist is just a communist who realizes communism won't work but still wants a system as close to it as possible. so why not just call yourself a communist. it's what you believe in, you just aren't so dogmatic to sink the ship over philosophical adherence.
and it wasn't because the media launched a 2 year slander campaign contained consistently of misquotes? a campaign that failed during the election when word of mouth and social media challenged it.
you can sympathise with the plight of a country, and understand what lead to the issues, whilst simultaneously not sympathise with the fuckheads who think blowing innocent people up is a-ok. what's so difficult about that? amazes me that it needs spelling out.
well bankrupting the country a lot is something wrong with labour...
i do not think that you will receive it directly, but you can have mine, buddy.
not that it would have mattered much in newbury constituency - richard benyon's kung-fu grip on west berkshire remains unshakeable :/
fair enough. that's true - i wouldn't say i like corbyn, just that he seems most genuine out of the bunch, besides maybe caroline lucas. none of them are likeable though, it's almost part of the job of a politician at this point to be a cunt.
well you are partly correct. however, socialism has changed a lot since it was "established" if you can call it that. so there are differences, like democracy for example. the socialist party here in sweden is a strong advocate for democracy while the communist party is not. also the view on market capitalism vs planned economy. socialism tends to favor free market with some regulations on stuff like alcohol, tobacco, drugs and so on.
a lot of it was misquotes, but some was true. like corbyn opposing the anglo irish agreement, a compromise that sought to bring stability and save lives. how can you justify opposing that? apparently it's because it recognised northern ireland as its own political entity. its definitely worth people dying for that. or what about when he was paid by the saudi state media (who are complicit in the torture of journalists, and are banned by ofcom ) to appear in their television show. he has done incredibly well pulling off the victory he did, but let's not forget that he was the one who put the labour party into the state it was before.
you really think tony blair has any sort of relation to jc except for they're both labour? even though blair was new labour and jc is old 70s labour? policy wise they share nothing in common, you really can't blame the backbencher who voted against almost everything labour's done in the last 10 years for that stuff going though. blame the rest of the party fine but can't really blame him
so true, i just ended up voting for the party that i thought would be the best to represent my area. they didn't win.
don't talk about ni politics if you don't understand them. there were many reasons on all sides to oppose the agreement.
that's probably a good idea, though the fucked voting system isn't helpful. i can't vote yet but if i could it'd make absolutely no difference - conservatives get ~60% of votes each election
mate, i'm northern irish, check my post history ffs. the anglo irish agreement was a compromise from both sides intending to save lives, and the precursor to the good friday agreement. anyone who opposes that is a moron.
the anglo irish agreement was quite strongly repulsed within unionist circles. over 100 000 people gathered in belfast to protest against it under a unionist banner. it gave the republic constituional powers over norther ireland and blatantly ignored many unionist leaders. i agree it was a good first step in the peace process, but calling all oposition moronic? you eejit.
sorry, i meant all nationalist opposition, which was the angle that corbyn was opposing out from. he opposed it because it entrenched the northern irish border, and made irish unification even less likely. i agree that there were genuine unionist concerns, but i believe that those have been outweighed by the lives saved
we are doing some lane expansion on i-25 loveland to ftc we helped secure federal funding for it. but yes, we need to do a lot more. it also ties into the housing affordability question because people are being forced to live further from where they work- we can't let this hurt our quality of life it definitely has my attention and i will work with local governments and cdot to preserve what makes co special.
at least colorado is building, unlike other areas. oppose nimbyism at all costs.
i will be a fair referee for all parties, not cozying up or showing partiality to a particular interest over others.
i will be in colorado springs tomorrow as part of my announcement tour. i think that my message of an economy that works for everyone will resonate in every corner of this state. and republicans have kids and many want them to go to pre-k and kindergarten too!
i have voted and sponsored legislation on the side of privacy, reigning in the nsa and preventing warrantless wiretaps. i've always supported a full audit of the fed. never met mr. snowden. focused on running for governor to roll up my sleaves to make a difference, too much time in dc is spent debating rather than doing.
yes the state will need to go to the ballot box to see if voter's want to fund our 21st century infrastructure needs. we are growing and we need to catch up or or quality of life will suffer. let me know your ideas!
the veil of public office is easier to pierce than you might think. depending on where you live, you might have the opportunity to run for city council, school board, state legislature, or other office. so know your own interests and what you want to do. for me i care a lot about education and ran for and served on the state board of education. that is a part-time volunteer job, so i did it for a few days each month was still able to work full time. congress on the other hand is full time. our state leg is somewhere in between, they work full time in denver for 5 months, then part-time the rest and many have other careers to earn income. so know yourself and what you want to do, get involved with your community (hoa, non-profit boards, other groups), and find a realistic option (not taking on a popular incumbent unless you have a good reason) and go for it!
i am actually touting namaste solar's co-op ownership model statewide, along with other employee ownership models like esops and stock options. how is the co-op ownership working for you as an employee? in answer to your question, yes of course i support finding a solution to tabor. specifically as governor, i will build a winning coalition (business, educators, republicans, democrats) to bring to the ballot a plan to establish full day preschool and kindergarten and invest in our schools.
i support single-payer health care nationally and if colorado moves forward it should make sure it is very well written and will work. the last thing we want is a failed system that leaves people in the lurch. i will be putting out more higher education plans over the course of the election about my specific plans to make college more affordable. i also tout dual-enrollment which allows students to get college credit and even an associates degree for free (or close to free) while they are in high school!
i think we truly are reaching critical mass in tech. we have a vibrant startup community for sure. we have excellent startup infrastructure across our state. we need to be able to keep more success stories here and independently owned, but i think we will get there. we also need to more fully incorporate our universities like csu and cu into our tech ecosystem. there are some excellent programs like the innosphere in fort collins, a partnership between csu and fort collins, but we need more collaboration. any other ideas?
well as a "voice of reason" in the house i am but one of 435 and my voice is all too frequently overwhelmed. but as governor i can set in place our goal of 100% renewable energy by 2040, universal preschool and kindergarten, and put in place state policies to create an economy that works for everyone by encouraging employee stock ownership
they are all good and i wouldn't have any problem supporting any in the general. i know ed perlmutter and cary kennedy best. i've known and worked with cary for close to 20 years (more so in the early 2000s than recently). i work closely with ed in congress. i don't know michael johnson or noel ginsburg as well personally, i've met them but never worked with them professionally or spent much time with them. i look forward to getting to know them all better over the course of the campaign! they all seem to be good people and i look forward to hearing more about their ideas!
health care in clear creek? consider yourselves lucky compared to summit and eagle. we need a colorado that works for everyone. for our cities, for our suburbs, for our rural areas. i support 21st century infrastructure including broadband, an education system including apprenticeships and skills, and encouraging employee participation in profits and ownership. we succeed together as a state and all three parts of my plan are statewide.
it's an interesting concept and i look forward to learning more about the results of the several pilot projects that are currently in place to try it out
dude plains and mountain all the way, you get all the defense positions along with unlimited attack capabilities, not to mention a fuck load of trample
marijuana food freedom (raw milk, hemp, non-usda beef) and many other areas relating to expanding personal freedoms
i have one archived on a flash drive, i'm sad they took it down. i thought it was still up. boy, jason and i turned out differently didn't we. but for both of us, this is our last session of congress.
protecting what makes co special is a top priority for me. in congress, i served last session on the natural resources committee where i fought to protect our public lands. now we face an even greater threat of our public lands being sold off. i am also working on additional wilderness designations for summit and eagle counties to protect in perpetuity 60,000 additional acres.
well our main arteries i-25 and i-70 are causing the biggest problems for the highest number of commuters. i would base my priorities on an objective scientific analysis of traffic flow and where the biggest needs are! i learned a lot as a tech-entrepreneur that helps, mostly to be creative and disruptive and don't accept things the way they are just because they've always been that way
how else are they going to fund the gluten-free roads?
if they want to be, sure! and i think they want to be!
never banned :) of course i support the entire lgbt+ community. we've come a long way but we still have a long way to go to achieve equality.
random note from an old job of mine - rep polis has been a significant supporter of boulder county careconnect for years; one of their main programs provides transportation for seniors and individuals with disabilities.
that's why doing these reddit things is great, we don't have time to get to all the questions at physical town halls (especially lately with the increased attendance). i'm not sure i completely understand your question, but i for one try to make my decisions based on research and evidence and if i was governor i would appoint people to the various state agencies that did the same. i think picking people and setting the tone are two important things a governor can do. are there any other specific recs you have?
well one way or the other you will wind up with a different governor in january of 2019 (hick is term limited). with your help, maybe it'll even be me!
go for it! don't let being a member of the lgbt community hold you back!
'member south park? i 'member south park. i represent north park county but sadly not south park. but as governor, i'll be the governor of south park! i love the show, watched all the recent seasons. 1) rural broadband 2) better transportation 3) better access to job skills/training
my plan is for colorado to have 100% renewable energy by 2040. congratulations to germany on your climate leadership! yes many local governments and states in our country will continue to move forwards.
as governor, i plan to help colorado maintain a leadership role in the cannabis industry. we have many opportunities to continue to leverage our "first-mover" advantage into a ecosystem that allows us to continue our industry leadership. that being said, yes it's possible that sales will decline as ca and other states come fully online. currently after paying for regulation of marijuana most of the taxes go to school buildings in lower income areas- we need it. i will do my best to continue co's leadership role nationally even in the face of additional competition.
i think fracking should be greater distances from people's homes and more local control
it's very important for rural communities to have broadband and high-speed fiber. i've been working on this federally and the state can and must step up too. i would like to see high-speed fiber as part of any infrastructure package. infrastructure ain't just roads and bridges. sign up at polisforcolorado.com so we know who you are and you can get involved :) say hi when you see me around
great question! i am most comfortable on facebook and twitter. and of course i love reddit. my main challenge with instagram and snapchat is i have trouble making my job visually appealing. here i am meeting with so-and-so. here i am meeting with so-and-so. any ideas about how a candidate can visually engage in those mediums would be greatly appreciated!
nope gov can't do that. i don't make pledges i can't keep ;)
happy to help. first of all i know very little about the market you are in (security for consumers). in fact when i first read it i thought you meant that you were selling securities (like stocks) to consumers! like crowdfunding or something. that being said, it sounds like you should reach out to the head of security at major universities locally (or nationally if your product is national). get a sense of their needs and let them know what you can do to help them. within their budget, they usually have quite a bit of autonomy, you don't need a network so much, even if someone with a big network was doing it they would still need to cold call the heads of security at universities. good luck!
great question! i have really enjoyed bring by best efforts to modernize congress. i've hosted hackathons, worked to open congressional information, and i also still have a year and a half left there so i'm not done yet! but my reason for being in public service is to make a difference, and i feel i can make a bigger difference by rolling up my sleeves at the state level and helping co lead the way in renewable energy, an economy that works for everyone, and education. and i can work on modernizing state government with new tech and ideas, and even though it's a smaller pond i'll be able to do more than as 1 of 435 members of congress!
what kind of food to you like? price range? food style?
omg i am so excited! and as governor i will be able to go to more games than as a member of congress!
i'd love some info and citations on the private military presence in co if you can post some. and yes, the threat of biological and nuclear threats from non-state actors is going up as technology develops. i won't have to worry about that as much as governor as a member of congress, but i will still try to see if there is anything the state can do to keep us safe.
wow! that's the first fish i've ever had named after me (that i know if). i hope little jared lives a long and healthy life. your life will be better if co reaches 100% renewable energy by 2040, our air will be cleaner and we will be healthier and it will create green jobs that can never be outsources and encouraging more firms to share stock and profits with employees will hopefully affect you to and if you have kids you will love free preschool and kindergarten, and i say that as a dad of a 5 year old and an almost 3 year old.
in this area, governor hickenlooper has done a good job. we need to make sure that our immigrants feel welcomed and know their rights under the law. we are a welcoming state, and the governor needs to set the tone. i wish there was more the governor could do to fix our broken immigration system but sadly that is up to congress and i'm not holding my breath for the current congress to fix it and unite families.
i plan on serving out my term to fight "this administrations insane policies" and will work to ensure that our democratic nominee wins and holds this seat
because many school districts divert funds to early childhood, these funds would be available for other functions if we fund pre-k and k universally! so that's good! and of course i support more funding for our schools and to make college more affordable but only the voters of the state can provide that, not the governor :
dual and concurrent enrollment allow high school students to get college credit, even an associates degree, for free or close to free while still in high school! and more state funding for higher ed tied to reductions in tuition would also help.
couldn't you blame lobbyists for a large part of that?
i don't think that there is anyone who thinks that i do the bidding of the oil and gas industry
i'll give you a curly answer: if i had absolute power over the legal system i would get rid of the provisions that gave me absolute power. no one should have absolute power, not even a well-intentioned fellow like :)
i've spent some time with him and like him a lot. you also wouldn't want to mess with him he used to (maybe still?) do one of those pit-fighting things or something like that (more than just boxing, more street fighting or something). course whatever we're doing now under buddy black is working well!
neither one! i support expanding our refugee program and improving the vetting process
the question needs to be more specific. i have voted against continuing funding for troops in afghanistan as an example.
i'm a parent of a 5 and a almost 3 year old and that is honestly not on my list of concerns. if a parent thinks that the legal treatment of marijuana is causing the disconnect, i suggest they dig a little deeper there is probably an underlying reason for the disconnect not related to the legal treatment of marijuana
do you support expanding mass transit in combination? we don't need more roads per se, we need more efficient transportation alternatives.
i would ammend this by saying we shouldn't be building outwards. sprawl is a huge problem for colorado. we need to build more density rather than sprawling neighborhoods. when things go outward, it requires people to have cars, which require more roads, which hurt walkability and public transit, which means cars are required, which leads to traffic and air pollution.
do you believe communities should be able to ban fracking like longmont tried to do?
if you're down here, you'd better have a plan to pay for widening i-25 from monument to castle rock.
i like that, i hope you do well in your election.
i hope this is balanced with more funding and policy revisions that support better community planning and expanding mass transit. look at oregon's urban growth boundaries as a way to cut down on urban sprawl and encourage density where mass transit can be effective while protecting farms an natural areas.
sounds like she had a rather nice and comfortable career.
note that she's essentially bound by law to give the answers she did. not that this diminishes mr. polis's awesomeness here. poking at the ridiculousness on the system in such a direct way is amazing.
i appreciate the response. glad to hear you are interested in our business model. while i am not yet a co-owner (hope to become one next year), i wouldn't want to work anywhere else. the ability to have an equal voice/vote in the workplace is huge for a multitude of reasons. i feel more valued here than i have anywhere else, by far.
what is your idea of "common sense gun safety measures"? because that's usually democrat speak for "punish law abiding gun owners by outlawing cosmetic features such as pistol grips".
i am an adjunct at acc in littleton. i'll be looking forward to reading your higher ed plans, and i hope you'll address ways to support access to low cost higher ed that also holds respect for and fairness to the contingent laborers that teach coloradans. dual enrollment is a great start! cheers!
thanks for the reply! definitely swing by bingo burger and grey coors when you get the chance. just edited my original post when i thought of this - what is your opinion on concealed carry in co? right now concealed carry laws are fairly lax, would you change that or keep it as-is?
i honestly didn't expect you to run with ed in the field, so this morning's news came with a shock. i worked in co-06 in '14, and always appreciated the support you, ed, and cary gave our campaign. it's tough picking between you three, but either way we'll have a great nominee in '18. best of luck!
completely understand, but it should be something to consider. obviously the current buildout would be difficult to adjust considering the amount of growth around the tracks as is, but the issues stands. back to my question though, public transit should be a big part of a large city... not just to ease congestion, but as a means of transportation that assists in the reduction of green house gasses. how do you plan to move that forward in the future?
thanks for the response! another question on a less serious note: i've heard you're a huge star wars fan and, obviously, you're a redditor. do you prefer r/prequelmemes or r/sequelmemes?
well, i'm glad we are on the same page. at least most of the country is haha. i'm a teacher, and i'm very concerned about betsy devos and the path that education is going. i'm a special education teacher, and i worry about cuts to medicaid and special education in general. what will you do to make it so that public education is not in jeopardy?
trample is a green mechanic and control is a very hard to pull off in r/b only colors you have the treats and the burn but it's usually paired with white or blue in standard or a third option of green in modern. but i do loves me some w/r aggro!
you certainly did turn out differently. thanks for your hard work and for being a good example. i'll tell my family in co about you.
so would you prioritize highway projects over public transit? and prioritize projects for commuters in general over other types of infrastructure (energy infrastructure, broadband, etc)?
rock on. good luck. reading recs are good for anyone reading this btw!
you've got my support unless a better choice comes along (something makes me doubt it will). thanks for your time. i like most everything you stand for but i found your non-answer about the fracking a little troubling albeit politically apropos.
thanks for the answer - best of luck on the road to governor!
awesome! also just wanted to say thanks for being an amazing role model for young lgbt people like myself!
fair enough, i suppose i'll still vote for you, for the third time.
we will miss you. as someone who works on those issues at the federal level, there are few members of congress who match your energy and expertise and you will be tough to replace. i hope we can get a few more touchdowns before you (hopefully) become governor. this ongoing drain from congress of smart qualified members is a huge problem. not your fault, but boy do i wish we had a solution for it.
i'm not picky. i just always like to make sure when i'm on vacation i stop somewhere unlike what i can find in seattle.
unfortunately i cannot/do not feel comfortable posting names/locations or other information, i wish i could be more specific with you but i don't believe it would be responsible on this platform, sorry! i'm with you about the threats of both threat types. however, it should be noted that bw/cw has **much** lower barriers to entry in terms of both technology and raw materials required to implement attacks in comparison to thermonuclear tech. as you noted, these threats simply will increase and i, having studied a bit, do not believe the current counter-measures or surveillance programs are effective or reliable. as a governor, a panicked (cw/bw has a distinct appeal to terrorists for this reason) populous would look to you for direction during an emergency and i would urge you to explore this terrain if (nah, when) you are elected. good luck!
that's true, i hadn't thought of that with the pre-k/k funding. yeah, i suppose we still have to keep coming back to that tabor wall. but i'm glad to see elsewhere in the thread you're willing to look at reform in that area, too. good luck!
thank you! while i love the idea of concurrent enrollment, i'd encourage you to talk to a few academic advisors (i am one) to hear about some of the potential pitfalls; it's not a good idea for everyone. and yes, please, state funding! i'll keep watching your platform as you campaign :)
i have no problem rooting for you guys this season, as a mets fan we don't overlap with you too often. good luck (in baseball, and more importantly in your race) :)
since you're playing it that way... so you agree with donald trump that we need to improve our vetting process? what specifically do you find wanting in our current process? would you vote for a version of the safe act that was expanded to the list of countries in trump's travel ban eo?
it's great that you voted against afghanistan, but we're also fighting in or bombing iraq, syria, libya, yemen, somalia, and pakistan. and that's ignoring the countless military operations the us is currently doing in other countries. are there any of these wars you support?
yes transit options like bus and rail are a critical part of making our metro areas work!
hello other lovelander! loveland co is beautiful! we have one of the largest collections of outdoor public art in the country!
psst, wanna buy a lane? the need for these "public-private partnerships" (aka toll-high density vehicle lanes) is because we don't have the money on the public side unless the voters vote to give it to the state
imagine being a teacher with a masters degree, 5+ years experience not being able to live in the same neighborhood where you teach... throw in the being single dynamic, student loans, and ever increasing medical premiums, all while pension programs diminish!
i have a very specific plan to do it on my website www.polisforcolorado.com click issues then economy then check out the pdf and let me know your thoughts it's a pdf you can download. i wouldn't just put out some vague goal without a way to make it happen!
want to make it easier and remove red tape and regulatory barriers for companies to do it. i've heard from several entrepreneurs who would implement employee ownership plans but compliance is too costly
denver is getting far more dense. open lots turning to 10+ apartments, single lots into duplexes or garden units, 20+ story condominium buildings. lots of tear down and build in my opinion
oh i experienced that today. with an accident on it.
although i'm all for gun control/background checks, it's one thing -at least for now -i hope democrats in colorado put on the back burner, as it automatically alienates so many solely because of that one issue. jobs, renewable energy, healthcare and education should be first and foremost issues imo, as so many can get behind these. if you add gun control to this list, you instantly lose almost half the population.
yes he absolutely could have gone to congress including member of congress or taken it to the intelligence committee charged with oversight.
nationally in congress, i sponsor legislation to remove the special tax breaks that the oil and gas industry receives to the tune of $40 billion each year. eliminating these subsidies will help put renewable energy on a more level playing field.
i have met with advocates of this idea and if we can find an economically viable way to make it happen that would be great for our state!
and i would also add that our road system is also critical for our tourism industry and outdoor recreation industry and the jobs that rely on it
she's bound by law not to admit that medically, studies show that ($conclusion) - whether that is "heroine is more addictive" or "the studies do not reflect heroine is more addictive" or "there have not been conclusive studies to reflect either view?" certainly, she could have presented the medical research and then added the dea's stance that these drugs, whatever their level of addiction, have a drastic and impactful effect on users lives, blah blah blah blah blah. there's a million ways she could have answered the question being asked while also representing the viewpoint of the agency. that's the difference between a good interviewee and a bad one - the good ones can answer both the stated questions and the unstated ones at the same time.
yeah i think it can make a real positive difference in the culture and also of course allow employees to share in success. good luck in becoming a co-owner next year!
shout out to ny! my parents both born there (mom in peekskill dad in the bronx)
no not law abiding gun owners, we are talking about people who are not legally able to purchase a gun but go around the law and try to by them and avoid a background check.
i am a huge fan of dual enrollment and as governor look forward to helping expand quality programs
the degree represents a certification that a certain level of skill has been reached in whatever field it is in, and employers take that very seriously
i am very concerned about that as well. i'm currently the ranking democrat on the early childhood and k-12 education subcommittee of the education and workforce committee, meaning i'm on the front lines of defending our public schools. i do have some good news for you: i do not expect any cuts in special ed funding! sadly i am worried about medicare (reducing eligibility reqs and throwing ppl off) and also other areas. so i'm doing my best to defend the federal investment in equity and education, but i can do even more at the state level for colorado.
he was kinda sorted into slytherin more than me, wouldn't you say? (no offense intended) ;)
i would let the data lead the way. if we can get user-ship and the routes work, public transit is the way to go. there's a lot of data and science to ensuring that our limited dollars are deployed in the best way to save people time and reduce traffic. yes our commuter corridors should have priority
i can understand that point. however, i find it odd that the lgbt community chooses to embrace a party that didn't care for them until it was useful for them politically.
i will miss you too and all the friends i have made in our efforts to reform and modernize congress. the work must continue!
under the sun, south boulder. if you like beer. smokin' daves in lyons, if you like bbq & beer. tequila's or santiago's if you like mexican flagstaff house if you've got jared kushners expense account.
trump does not have a plan that i am aware of to improve vetting, he wants to shut down our refugee program from a number of countries. i would support improving our vetting process-making it more efficient, quicker, and more thorough (yes we can do them all!) for refugees from all countries
i doubt you'll see this, but what do you plan to do about the reneging of rtd on the northwest corridor rail expansion to boulder and longmont? we paid tax dollars to have rail lines, and now we have vague promises to finish our train service *25 years* from now. i understand bnsf decided to profiteer the expansion, but our money was spent on rail lines to places we don't live in, like golden and lakewood. every time i remember i voted for this, and sold my car, i am reminded we got rebranded bus lines and a toll lane on the same highway they travel on. voters were promised 25 minutes to denver and we got f*** all. thoughts?
wow! that sounds really cool! i love weird sculptures and what not.
this guy internets. love your votes on net neutrality. seriously isn't this a short term answer that's going to cause us long term issues?
you missed my point and misunderstand the situation... these people are *taking advantage* of students, trying to *use* them to make more money by kicking families out of their homes. that is neither supporting students nor supporting boulder. i find it unethical and anti-social.
what? no, where did you get that? a shift in the *type* of housing offered, turning homes and affordable complexes into high-rent student-targeted housing. which is in effect *decreasing* housing available for working couples and families, forcing them to move outside.
i can imagine that. i was going to school to become a teacher, ended up deciding not to finish because of the extremely low pay for teachers even with their masters. i am making 3k less now than i would have if i would have became a teacher. its amazing the high standard we put on education and how important it is in our society, yet we do not get compensated appropriately for how important we say education is.
i had roommates for 8 years. once you've gotten a taste of having your own personal space its hard to go back. i wasn't saying price control per say, i was thinking more along the lines of government assisted living for single income households that make to much to qualify for government housing but not enough to be able to save forretirement.
i know esops are all structured differently, but as someone who used to work at an employee owned business in co, this strikes me as a bit of an odd answer. typically aren't these business structures treated more as retirement savings/possible future payouts? they don't necessarily affect one's bi-weekly take home.
so you understand. i have a kid who will hopefully get her driver's licence this week. i'd like her to safely be able to get up to denver when she's asked to referee a game or wants to go tour a college. it would, of course, be nice for the rest of us too.
do you think that bringing more renewable energy to co will hurt the economic impact that the oil and gas industry has brought to us?
right, so what are the specific common sense gun safety measures?
yes, they do now. if everyone has one (say, like a high school diploma), don't you think that would change the way they view the degree?
your last point i agree with. however, if everyone has one, it won't mean as much. sure, you'll be slightly more educated than someone with a hs diploma. that said, it shouldn't be paid for by taxpayers.
well, thank you for your service to public education and fighting for our public schools. i'm happy that special education will not have any cuts. however, i am still concerned about our public education system. i'm still in shock that devos even got voted in. ridiculous.
illegal pete's is basically fast food. don't go there. chipotle is better anyway (not that chipotle is good.)
i will repeat the question since you ignored it. what specifically do you find wanting in our current process? and would you support a safe act now that added the other country's from trump's travel ban beyond just iraq and syria, the countries that you voted in 2015 to make fbi personnel personally sign off on? and how do you square what you said about making the process quicker and more efficient with a vote that then fbi director comey said would do the exact opposite?
it is because of tabor and voters that refuse to vote for increased taxes on anything. ppps are a solution to get something done.
i would hope that the voters would approve more free, public roads. public-private partnerships are a kind of last resort if the voters don't want to pay but we still need the roads
can you tell me where these families have been kicked out and which homes you're talking about. i genuinely don't know what you are talking about. i live at baseline and 35th and didn't see this anywhere close by.
for esops specifically yes, but my company uses a formal profit sharing that equates to a yearly bonus. essentially the same, but you are given the money up front(on a yearly basis) instead of the company investing for your retirement.
i hear rampart range road is a nice alternative these days, and might even be faster than i25!
when we're talking about 100% renewable energy by 2040, we are talking about powering he grid. light bulbs, computers, etc. so we are basically talking about the transition from coal to wind and solar. moving to wind and solar power does not directly impact the oil and gas industry in co because that oil and gas is processed and sold on the global market.
i sponsored (and will sponsor again) the bill for universal background checks and to close the "gun show loophole" nationally (colorado voters voted overwhelmingly to already lose it)
yes, they would be considered similar to a high school diploma. maybe not right away but over time. how about free education to only those people who need it? or free degree in a trade to encourage skilled workers? there is a middle ground but the state paying for kids who don't appreciate the schooling seems unnecessary. they'll just go because their parents made them and won't add value to the class or their education.
i think that one of the most important things in building an all inclusive, equal, and progressive society is education. it's the bedrock that everything else stands and is built on, and it should be 100% funded by taxpayers, knocking down barriers for those who can't afford it. imagine all the would-be einsteins or hawkings or musks that never have a chance for college because they're barely getting by working 2 job and can't afford school. kill the monetary barrier and more cream will rise to the top. education contributes so much more to society in myriad ways than what is financially put into it. take a good 10-25% of the military budget and apply it to education k-12 and beyond and see how fast we become the premiere country in the world again, leading in science and research, not just a country who leads only in gun deaths.
cus this is america and its my birthright? but actually, if you believe in the second amendment as a check for the government, you are going to need an effective magazine. its for convenience (when you dont want to pull out your magazine, and then manually load it up every 10 shots), fun (firing off 30 as fast as you can is a blast), and competition shooting as well.
i think it's great that you are so interested in refugee vetting! specifically, i would like to see better inter-agency communication (which the safe act accomplished) and also better social media intelligence of prospective refugees (for those who have social media, which includes many of the syrians for instance). we also need to make it faster. currently potential refugees languish for a year and half, sometimes more, in refugee camps. we can get more done quicker and i hope that's the direction that congress takes. how do you think we should improve the process to make america safer and be faster and more user-friendly for applicants?
agreed. tabor has been one of the most disastrous things for colorado. time to get rid of it, and thankfully, at least there are rumblings and conversations about doing away with it, and at the very least, trying to circumvent it.
i am looking forward to casting a vote for jared polis for governor of colorado! if only we had more politicians such as yourself, i think the world would be a nicer place. i hope you feel appreciated, 'cause you are, very much. here's to hoping gov of co is a stepping stone to u.s. president :)
well, that's funny because i used to live in your neighborhood (at the intersection of 39th and 38th, near where the bike path starts at the end of the frontage road), and in the 5 years i was there about 10 homes on my street were bought out by property management companies or wealthy individuals with cash flow that could out-bid young working families. obviously the owners had the option to stay, but when offered the choice of 30-50k above market value for a house that was built in the 1960's or staying in a neighborhood that's slowly turning into another college block, it's a no-brainer. it's difficult for young working families to buy houses in boulder for this reason, so they end up in gunbarrel, longmont, or lafayette.
to be honest, that is not aggressive at all. 2040 is 23 years away. it should not take an entire generation to make a change. it should be more like a 10 year plan. not 25.
you do know there is no gun show loophole, right? gun show dealers require people to pass nics checks. i find it depressing that elected officials continue to believe this stuff. you're trying to legislate things you have very little understanding of and which are easily refuted with a quick google search.
"free" isn't free. it needs to be paid for by someone. who deems "only those people who need it"? your last point is exactly right. let the people who want to benefit from work/school to do so and reap the rewards.
thank you for the kind words! doing my best! tell your friends and neighbors around election time :)
buses use the toll lane, and can use the shoulder if there is congestion. the idea is that they will always run on time.
what's funny about people with more money bidding higher on homes? that is how it has and always will work everywhere and not just boulder. welcome to real life.
doesn't sound like something a governor could touch. that sounds like a free market.
lol have you been to boulder? it always has been about as white as can be... there are no minorities to push out. get out of here with your bullshit.
for now, let's focus on getting it implemented. then figure out how long it's going to take.
at some state levels, there is no gun show loophole. there is at the federal level, allowing some states to have it. yes, gun *dealers have to run background checks, but at many gun shows in "loophole" states, people get a booth who aren't a licensed dealer, just "selling guns person-to-person" thus don't need to run a background check. yet many of these people will sell many guns per show, and attend many shows. i bought my first two guns this way before my state closed the loophole, requiring all guns sold at guns hows to have background checks run. in both cases the person i bought the guns from had at least a dozen guns at their tables, and acknowledged that they have a table at that gun show every month. realistically, they are "gun dealers," they were just exploiting loopholes.
it is housing discrimination, and part of the affordability crisis in boulder.
gentrification is not limited to racial minorities; it pushes poor people out regardless of race. though in many cases (st. louis being a prime example) race and poverty intersect/overlap.
how long has it taken us to develop other technology and infrastructure? i mean it was 50 yrs between the first flight and being on the moon. it did not take 23 years to build railroad tracks linking the coasts, it did not take that long for internet, the cotton gin, smart phones.
same here, i've purchased a handgun and a rifle in colorado at a gun show by a person with a huge table with a hundred options, accessories, bullets, training class flyers, the whole shebang. no paperwork required because it's a private seller.
no it is selling your product to the person who pays you the most. you think they should have rented to you at a lower cost because why?? because it benefited you and you feel entitled to it.
don't think you are knowledgeable about boulder which is where i am from so maybe mind your own business and stop trying to make social justice arguments where they don't exist. thanks bye.
you do realize that the wiki article has 98 citations, right? wiki is not a source, it is an amalgamation of other sources and has been proven through independent studies to be on average as accurate as encyclopedia britannica. learn to learn.
thanks so much. one tumor was in the middle of the brain but shifted to the right. it wasn't operated on but it's gone! tumor #2 is on the right side of the brain, about 1-2 inches above the temple but deeper in the brain. tumor #3 is on the left side and like tumor #2 but on the left.
i knew i had two tumors in my brain two years before i had surgery, but the doctors hadn't been worried until 2012 when they started to grow. most of my symptoms were migraines, loss of feeling in my left side of my body, seizures, and mental fogginess.
the best thing to do is just keep her happy however you can. i see happiness as a medicine. it works for me and i believe it can work for her as well. be empathetic, but don't treat her any differently. make her smile and smile with her.
this battle has been a pure blessing in my life. it's shaped me into the man i am and i'm very grateful for this battle. funny thing, in 2012 i was sentenced 2 days before surgery to live then after surgery i was sentenced 2 years. i'm still alive today! what a blessing. i still don't really have a bucket list mentality. nothing wrong with it, i just sometimes go with the flow.
thank you very very much. i'm a musician, so writing music and recording it is my favorite.
i feel that the body houses the spirit temporarily. i still feel close with my body because i'm living. even though that i have a lot of faith in god, so i am closer with spirit.
i did receive remission once but another tumor showed. so we have yet to see where to go. one of my montras is,"never give up" the fight may be hard, but who said the crown goes to the winner?
remission was declared in january of this year, but another tumor was found later on. my doctors have found a new treatment for me to start, but i am postponing the start date by one month to see if the mri results improve.
in a way yes but i'm more grateful towards the little things now.
i did have to stop school but i know that everything is for a reason. because i know that, i'm never really worried. all this time i've been undertaking this battle has been great and i'm grateful.
it's writing music and it never changed before and after the journey began.
thank you! this is how i've always been. if you get bad news you just have to keep it all moving. i just like to add a smile because it's fun being happy to me!
due to the tumor locations and movement, i lost a lot of mobility in my left side. this makes it hard to; walk, eat, brush teeth, get ready for the day, live life, play instruments, etc. etc. so, i'll usually have one to assist me through life.
the most memorable thing is from the surgery team, when i asked the doctor to take a picture of my tumor. instead, they filmed the surgery!
god honestly helps me stay positive. through this entire journey it was him that kept me going. in 2012 the moment i learned i was diagnosed with brain cancer, the first thing i did was thank god because i knew this would be for a reason.
that's awesome! so, don't hate me because i'm a not a full time vegan but i am full time vegetarian. my favorite meal is actually yellow rice with pineapple, white onions, cilantro, hawaiian seasoning sauce, topped with avocados that have chili powder sprinkled on top :)
just the nausea chemo causes. a lot of them (i think all) were in total shock. they were also in shock how positive i reacted to the news.
i do take supplements , while i also follow a routine of simple physical activity that i can handle. i don't have much alternates...
wow, what a powerful story about you and your father. i'm glad y'all sound good though. through my journey, i was inspired to establish a foundation in 2014. here's the website. please check it out! www.farwf.org thank you so much and i'm happy to send positive vibes your way as well :)
well, a lot of people have different characteristics like; tolerance to treatments, age, immune system strength, and most of all positivity! the tumors did cause me to be physically disabled in the left side but i'm not mentally disabled.
how did you find out that you had those tumors in the first place though? was it routine or did something happen to make you go have it checked out?
how can you be empathetic and not treat her differently? i have my own ideas, but what's your side of things?
i love music too. i've played the saxophone and took lessons for the electric guitar, and enjoy singing. do you like soul? who's your favorite musical artist?
would it be weird for me to ask you to post the video? (i do apologize if this makes you uncomfortable)
this very comment above me gives me so many more reasons why i should thank god daily....what amazing faith you have..
i noticed my comment got a load of down votes, i didn't mean anything bad by it or to offend you, sorry.
i kept failing a peripherals test (i don't have left peripheral vision) so, i was to get an mri. then, 2 tumors were found.
i don't believe it's true empathy if you do. i just wanted to point it out. side of things towards what exactly?
i love all genres of music! my favorite group is actually mumford & sons.
i had brain surgery in 2012, so my head was sore then. nowadays it's minor headaches.
don't worry it doesn't make me feel uncomfortable. i just don't know where the video is at the moment. i'm sorry.
thank you so much and yes! god deserves thanks to everything!!!
no don't worry bud. i'm not offended or anything. no need to apologize but thank you for taking the time to do so.
were you awake when you were being operated on? and could you feel it happening? i'm asking because in movies when people get brain surgery they're awake and talking normally and i've always thought that was crazy. just wanna find out if it's like that in real life or not!
i can assure you that patients are not conscious during any kind of brain surgery. that would be horribly painful for the patient because many brain surgeries involve cutting into the scalp and removing part of the skull.
depending on the surgery, they do actually have the patient awake for parts in some cases. they'll anesthetize them to get through the scalp and skull, and wake them up to have them answer questions so they can map out regions of the brain.
i usually am pretty careful who i tell that i am gay. for me to be doing this ama is quite a big step but i'm hoping to make more contacts/friends. the one incident i had was i was walking with a sighted friend and holding his arm so he could guide me. i had my guide dog with me but i was holding his leash and not his harness. all of a sudden, some kids started yelling "fag, fag, fag" and began throwing bottles at us. my friend said "hey, my friend is blind!" as soon as they heard that, they stopped and apologized and one of them said, "i'm sorry - i thought you were a fag." that was the worst incident that ever happened to me. that was about 10-12 years ago.
no, i must be honest and tell you i've never had a partner or been in a long-term relationship. my friend who is doing the ama is involved in this project and i think it is something that's really needed. in my present situation, i have helpers who would come and help me for a few hours a day, so i have not availed myself of it at this time. if you have more questions about it though, contact my friend u/runbrownmanrun
i want them to remember me as a person who does his best to help others to understand what it is like to be blind and gay. also, i hope they will consider me a kind person. i also hope that the fact that i have never seen will make people understand that being gay is not dependent on sight and is not a choice. i know this because i didn't even know the difference between boys and girls when i was growing up. i know that sounds strange, but it is the absolute truth.
(answering in order) i do not have any racial factors - race is not important to me. i judge people by somewhat intrinsic qualities - kindness, gentleness, people who are not afraid to hug, who are not afraid to touch in a kind way. those are the things that are important to me. i have no strong opinion on that except that i have no respect for someone who immediately dislikes someone because of their race i guess many people have preferences - some like heavy people, some like thin people. for me, i tend to like people who are on the heavy side but that is not always necessary. i tend to like people who are a little hairy, but again that's in no way written in stone.
(answering in order) i realized i was gay when i found that when i hugged a guy or an older male, i had a strong attraction to that person. whereas when i hugged a woman, i did not feel anything at all. i love women as friends, but hugging them is kind of like hugging an inanimate object for me. his voice, his smell (a nice cologne) and when i give him a hug. for me, i have to have some kind of a physical contact like a hug before i know if i am attracted to the person. some people attract me more than others and because i can't see, it must be something to do with pheromones that i can't describe. i have met guys who are wonderful but i don't have an attraction to them and i don't know why. i love italian food like lasagna, which is probably why i am such a big guy.
i am interested in meeting gay people in general, not just gay people who are blind. i am not really the kind of person who is good at starting groups. there have been some groups for disabled gay people but i don't think there are any right now that would be good for me.
wow, i've heard the finns are very lovely people but i've never met one till now! i think one of the things that keeps me going is i hope that, if i put myself out there, like i'm doing with the help of u/runbrownmanrun, people will respond and i will make some interesting and meaningful contacts.
i have a computer with speech and, as i type on the keyboard, it speaks what i have written. i was friendly with the person who edited bent voices (the website where the essay was posted) and he posted it for me. i can't but i am. how can you prove your sexuality?
damn that was hard to read. "hes gay get him!" "oh wait he's blind? that checks in with my morality, let him through boys."
oh man even blind gay guys know that bears are the shit.
i was joking on both counts, sorry if it didn't come across that way.
i think you misunderstood. (or maybe i did) the kids thought they were gay because they were holding hands. once he said he was blind, the kids thought that he was not gay, and the holding hands was explained. so it wasn't that he was blind, it was that he had an "excuse" to hold a guy's hand.
he said that he was holding onto his sighted friend's arm so that he could be guided. how did you interpret that as they were holding each other's hands and used the blindness as an excuse?
arg. hard to word it. they were not using the blindness as an excuse. he was genuinely holding his hand to guide him. you are a random person, and see two dudes holding hands. most people would assume that they are a gay couple (as did this homophobic kid). but once you are told the one man is blind, you no longer have any reason to believe the man is gay, and just assume he is being led around (as did the kid).
for me, the most beautiful thing in the world is when the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. meaning that when different things - people, materials, ideas, etc. - come together, they produce something of value, to them or to others, that is greater than they could have done alone. that's why i'm creating that service for seniors. there are people who need a good solution and people who want to work on meaningful things. why not bring them together and create something that enriches both of their lives? i'd want my legacy to be as someone who made such things possible. what would you want yours to be?
which was exactly the point of the person you claimed misunderstood.
my legacy will be that of a firefighter. i want to be remembered for being a great husband and eventually father of course but even more so, i want to be remembered for my bravery. for heading into situations that other people run away from...
to my understanding the persons was making a statement that the kid doesn't mind beating up a gay guy, but a blind gay guy is too far. however the kid doesn't think the guy is gay anymore. he's just blind.
this is a request only, not actually lord buckethead himself
15 isn't exactly horrible either haha, if everyone has a bike then no one is stealing them lol
they would still steal them. people would buy better bikes because they could and so they wouldn't be seen riding the government ones
it's the kind of thing he'd probably do once he'd had enough sleep.
when i was in tanana they were stuck with me! but after i left tanana they sent a male doctor there. but he ended up getting sick so i had to go back up there and he was not happy having me treat him! some of the children were so used to having me that they didn't want to go to him. they believed he wasn't a doctor because he didn't wear a skirt! i thought that was funny. when i was in medical school there was a lot of chauvanistic tendencies. in fact, when you applied to medical school the board would look at all the photos of the applicants. if they thought the woman was too pretty they would say "she'll just get married" and toss out the application. but i got in!
i did have preterm babies. i would deliver them and then keep them in a box in my office because we had no incubators in the villages. they would be 3 or 4 pounds. some of them died when they were born but that was uncommon. the nurses were really good, they would come into the office and check them all the time. since i didn't know how to use the preemie needles, i would give them transfusions and fluids through the bone, and would sit with them to make sure it didn't clog up the entire time it was in. in my hospital in tanana, half the 30 bed hospital was tuberculosis, 1/4 was women's ward for birthing, and 1/4 was for everything else. we would sometimes have so many kids in the hospital that we would have to put them in cardboard boxes or in the same crib, if they had the same diagnosis! medicine has come a long way!
the farthest i've been was barrow to visit. that's the northernest you can get! we slept under the plane we flew up in. the northernest place i worked was anaktuvuk pass, which was my favorite village. one native lady came in and had 3 babies in her parkie hood! anaktuvuk had so many pregnant women... it kept me busy! the weirdest food was probably walrus. it was so gummy and thick. not very appetizing!
as her granddaughter, we actually grew up with a lot of native alaskan books and stories! it was great... we spent a lot of time up in alaska running wild.
so i was actually born in philadelphia, but moved to cuba when i was a few months old. my father was a missionary there and so we stayed in very small villages, underwent a few hurricanes and the start of the revolution. when we came back it was fairly simple for me to integrate back into the american lifestyle. we just couldn't go shoeless everywhere in america!
i did learn early that we had to keep the babies until they were really healthy because if we sent them back to the villages they always came back immediately with something else. we always played with them after dinner... and some of the parents didn't like that the babies were so pale after being in a hospital, so we would put them out in the sun when they could tolerate it sometimes.
that's awesome, i want to visit barrow. kotzebue is the farthest north i've visited. what time of year were you there? have you tried muktuk (whale blubber & meat)? if so, is it similar?
i was in barrow on 4th of july weekend... we couldn't sleep very well with the sun out all day and night! i have had muktuk... it did taste similar to walrus but was better tasting. i still didn't really like it all that much.
they also used to just cut off pieces of whale and eat it raw as a snack. i never joined that tradition!
did you ever use native herbs/plants for curing ailments?
not very much... sometimes the natives would bring in what they called homebrew and give it to the kids because they liked it a lot, but i usually just allowed that and would continue to treat them with my medicine. i did get to learn from the navaho medicine men how they used sand paintings to treat patients, but never used that in practice.
jb: any and all of the flower scouts. i love the flower scouts. al: mine's preston. he's the best. bm: mine's quartermaster (jc: you have a thing for old men.)
gh: depends. these days the tendency is to bounce ideas around the animation creative staff. the more people we have chipping in ideas the stronger it gets. mt: collaboration! high five! jc: one of the biggest advantages camp camp had was its longer (for us) development cycle. we were able to really flesh out the setting and how the camp worked, and what a typical episode would be. gh: plus matt and burnie are always pushing us to make the best content we can.
al: it comes down to the director and animator, and usually we get to do our own key poses after getting direction from jordan. we add our own little touches to it as long as it fits the character/scene. he's very open to collaboration. jb: we can often hear laughter coming from the writer's room so we trust that it's gonna be good.
jc: in the episode that just came out today, we have a 360-degree rotating shot of a two-dimensional character that i knew was probably going to kill yssa, our lead animator. before we even did storyboards for it i asked her to make sure she could do it, and rose to the occasion and absolutely crushed it.
jc: storyboarding the shots for the scene in the finale between max and david was a lot of fun to direct. coming up with more dramatic angles to adjust the tone for the scene was cool. going from david on edge and max in control, then switching, then having them be on equal footing without ever really moving from their spots was an interesting challenge. bm: mine was spooky island!! i had to animate the scene just before the reveal at the end. i loved playing with all the emotions happening in that scene from terrified neil and jasper to angry max.
jb: it's not really a project, but a part of camp camp... that god damn flag in the intro crashed so many times when i was animating it. al: the cloud campbell from episode 12 was traditionally animated and had to be done during the last day of production. maggie is the worst. just kidding. (not really) (justkidding..dakjfoia)
jc: my favorite to write for is nurf; we always say lines in his voice in order to make sure it feels like something he'd say. also his voice is just really fun to imitate. bm: old man in rocking chair #1 from episode 8. there's just something about him. mt: larry the hamster! i miss him so.
mt: ~*~boring answer time~*~ this is always one of the most difficult questions to answer. we don't typically work on episodes linearly, so if we're just looking at actual days it would probably be about 6 weeks. but if you broke out every step of the pipeline and completed them one at a time, we'd be looking at about 14 weeks per episode. *pants* (i can provide spreadsheets later.) jc: spreadsheets are lame.
mt: we were really surprised at how many fans applied to join the team. (andrew is the biggest rt fan i've ever met. [bm: actually tanya is.]) if we see someone who is talented when going through resume submissions we hire them? also i'm really proud of saying "post-abortion rape" on on the spot jc: i can't top that.
jc: i actually never went to a camp, but a lot of the inspiration i use for writing episodes is just from summer vacations when i was a kid. i take a lot of inspiration from ed, edd, n eddy especially. miles was an eagle scout so i guess he knows all the camp shit. al: i went to a summer camp but there weren't like any nazis or anything! mt: i went to engineering camp! *pushes up glasses*
gh: with max you're always trying to strike a balance between savvy-kid and some kind of childlike ignorance. jc: keeping campbell's weird type of humor in check so that not every joke is about a cayman islands bank account or some geopolitical statement can be challenging as well.
jc: it used to be a mix of flash and after effects for season 1 of x-ray and vav. then we discovered the glory of toon boom and never looked back. even rtaa is made in toon boom now.
jc: homestar runner is the only reason i became an animator. jb: the pencil test for the avatar: the last airbender finale fight. i changed my major after seeing that. bm: there wasn't really any one time i got inspired, but i was always genuinely interested in animated films when i was younger. and i always would watch the behind the scenes stuff. then i discovered glen keane's interviews and his animation process and i knew then that's what i wanted to do. al: i saw tom & jerry as a kid and didn't understand how it was made. then i realized you could have a job making things like that, and it sounded a lot cooler than an office job!
mt: that's the only way this show gets made. the 2d team is surprisingly small but mighty so many people wear multiple hats. bm: the character designers will sometimes talk to us about how we rig and animate the characters so they can implement that into their designs. (animators have also been rigging and modeling the characters thus far. we wear many hats!)
jb: i like the reprise of the camp camp theme at the end of season 1 mt and al: quartermaster's wobbly dildo hand. gh: every time we make miles scream as david. bm: i like the part where max fixes the order of the sparrow staff. it's cute. :3 jc: when david and max stare each other down in the finale, and the lightning strikes in the background.
jc: we've done a couple of things animation-wise nobody has picked up on. in the spooky island episode, we didn't give jasper a shadow. and in sex swing episode 1, the dialogue on the tv in the last scene is actually dialogue from a scene in the finale episode. also our storyboard artist, al, puts a crap-ton of stuff in the backgrounds of a lot of shots.
jb: more than you'd think, but less than they deserve. gh: one mmmmilllionnn dollars.
al: danny devito mt: david cross gh: donald glover jb: justin roiland jc: matt chapman or alex hirsch
mt: we've been working with a lot of people on projects throughout the company this year, including animating the trailer for the new game we're publishing battlesloths (check it out if you haven't already!) but don't be surprised if you see more 2d animation popping around here and there. gh: facilities and accounting seem cool - let's do something with them.
jb: last season's finale was pretty crazy, with the rain. turns our animating rain is hard. bm: i had to animate neil rotating on the operating table in episode 7, and slowly turn his head. it required a lot of traditional animation with lots of hand drawn stuff. gh: non-typical movements tend to be the most challenging things to animate. al: that fucking cloudy campbell in episode 12
jc: the reason nurf wasn't around early on in season 1 was because we had no idea what his character would be. we finally had a breakthrough with the "bully with a conscience" angle and he's been stealing scenes ever since.
mt: we are who we are, we don't change for no one! jb: i don't think we were very reserved at all last season al: what jb said - if anything we can get away with more now gh: i don't know what you all are talking about - get ready for the most wholesome camp camp you can imagine - breathe a sigh of relief, no more cursing bm: we're all so much better at using the tools that i think we're all more confident in our abilities
jb: band camp kid jc: anime kid mt: rasta kid gh: pasta kid al: i'm already a camper so the best one already exists. (if you didn't notice already, there is a camper from when davey went to camp campbell that looks just like andrew - because it is andrew. where the fuck is my camper?! - mt)
jb: how the two counselors from when davey went to camp look like gwen's parents. jc: canonically they are not gwen's parents. but y'know if you want to have that as your head cannon, i'm not going to stop you. mt: terrace house - we are addicted (mizuki is best girl) gh: maggie's addiction to reality shows al: maggie's addiction to steve buscemi gh: our addiction to maggie's addictions
mt: reptar! al: the dirty bubble jc: max jb: rogue bears, i dunno. bm: manbearpig gh: kerry
jc: we try to limit ourselves to one musical number per season (they're really difficult to make x_x) mt: one thing to look forward to musically is new songs from richie branson in the end credits for every episode! so stick around chumps!
mt: i feel like it's made the department grow a lot closer. but it does make maintaining the inter-departmental relationships more difficult. plus i hate having to go to the other building all the time for meetings. al: we still have our own mini-fridge, so that's a plus.
all: we appreciate your point of view and definitely try to take these thoughts into consideration whenever we approach any piece of content. we'd rather acknowledge the darker parts of the world than ignore them and let them fester. we don't think that any jokes are presented in a way that condones any type of hate. we're not trying to normalize the outrageous but sometimes we'll use the outrageous to demonstrate how ridiculous a character's thinking or motivations are. thank you for giving us an opportunity to address concerns such as these.
i'm sure. it was awesome. i'll live with just listening to those two on repeat for a while. :)
but, i think the point the person is trying to make is that: making gas chamber jokes and making a hitler character isn't "pointing it out" the issue at hand. nor making these jokes isn't doing it to "not let it fester". make these jokes rather rather comes off as "we're using this as shameless shock value to capitalize on anti-semitism whether we know it or not". do you not think it more apt rather, to make fun of the people actually perpetuating and performing these horrible and genocidal ideals? there, you can still point out the issue at hand - by talking about how messed up the holocaust was and how wrong nazism is - rather than using a terrible tragedy and a whole people affected and still feeling the consequences of the actual violence?
great minds think alike! we just answered the first part of this question from another user (pittgrad09). this project is the same in the sense that we must complete all of the who requirements needed to declare elimination of transmission in nigeria just as we completed them in these other places. it's different because nigeria is so much larger (most affected country in the world). we think that five of the 37 states have done this already in nigeria and many others are close. the population spared of river blindness in those five states alone dwarfs everything that i mentioned above in the americas, uganda, and sudan. (f. richards)
$100 million will be used to super-size the program and enhance the flexibility to respond to the local epidemiology of the disease. for example, those areas we think are ready to stop mass treatment with ivermectin will need a full who type evaluation that requires molecular laboratory support. that will be costly. in those areas where transmission is ongoing, we will need to add additional interventions like twice per year treatment with ivermectin. that will be expensive too. lastly, there are many areas in nigeria that we have to reassess to determine if they are ready to stop or if they need twice per year treatment. that will be costly. the point is that we urgently need to do all of these things as soon as possible. it can't be business as usual!!! (the carter center, frank richards)
1) nigeria is the country most affected by river blindness in the world. 40% of the global population at risk is in nigeria. 2) no, not for this proposal opportunity. 3) 12.5% because there are eight semi-finalists. (frank richards)
it would be impossibly expensive and well over $100 million to pay distributors to treat over 50 million people. just think, this is two dollars per person to treat over a period of up to five years. that's less than 50 cents per person per year. so, we have to rely on volunteerism and it has worked up until now. remember, nigeria already has the largest ivermectin distribution program in the world based on volunteer delivery. in a way, we should also look at this as community empowerment and how people themselves can change their own lives. (frank richards)
good question. the big issue is in areas where transmission is ongoing. we absolutely have to treat twice per year there, with good treatment coverage as soon as possible if we are to stop mass treatment throughout nigeria by the year 2022. (frank richards).
it is important to recognize that the carter center is making this application on behalf of the nigerian partnership dedicated to eliminating river blindness from the country. that includes the ministry of health, a number of other ngos, and the communities afflicted by river blindness. we will implement the program through providing sub-grants to our partners who have been working in different states in the country to fight river blindness for many years. we all believe we can do this!!!! (frank richards)
great question! probably, and if not, $100 million is still very close to what we need. a big issue is what the value of the nigerian currency (naira) is against the u.s. dollar. in other words, $100 million can be worth a lot more or a lot less depending on global exchange rates. and recently the naira has been falling against the u.s. dollar. if it is not enough, the carter center has always had strong partnerships and generous donors. the infusion of these funds will surely draw other donors to the cause! (frank richards).
we admire all of the semifinalists and believe all proposals are worthy to be funded. if only there were enough money to do massive good! that said, our proposal will eliminate a disease once and for all that will benefit generation after generation of nigerians and serve as a beacon for other countries to follow suit. we believe in a world free of river blindness. (f. richards)
the carter center has worked in the americas as a partner to eliminate river blindness from four countries using ivermectin: colombia, ecuador, mexico, and last and most recently, guatemala. we've also had great success in africa in sudan and uganda. although those countries have not completed elimination within their borders like those countries mentioned above. (frank richards)
insecurity like boko haram, and/or kidnapping and other insecurity is a big risk for everyone involved in this - nigerians and foreigners. this keeps me up at night. but the people working on this are heroes! they are willing to take the risks and be on the front lines to treat the most neglected people in the hopes in solving at least one of their many problems. (f. richards).
thank you so much! we are a big fan of our fans! i've been in love with parasitic diseases since i was a medical student at cornell. you can read my profile on cartercenter.org. the atlanta journal constitution did a whole story on me to answer all of your questions and this is on our website also. (f. richards)
the nigeria onchocerciasis elimination committee (noec) has developed standard operating procedures for assessing these areas. in a nutshell, we go to villages located close to rivers where there are rapids and test children for antibodies that show they have been exposed or infected to river blindness. the test is a blood test (finger stick) for ov16 antibodies. if greater than one percent of kids are infected, the area is considered to be at risk. (f. richards)
thanks magnumpeeeye! great name. a control program is one that goes on forever, whereas a true elimination program is one that comes to a safe ending. elimination programs are much more difficult than control programs because they have to reach everyone, they have strict guidelines (high burden of proof), and an accelerated window to success. that means they are more costly, but in the long run they are infinitely more cost-effective. one more thing - not every disease can be eliminated. there is no dishonor in a good control program, but at the carter center we believe that when a disease can be eliminated, we should go for it! because the rich and the poor all benefit equally form an elimination program, we believe there is an ethical imperative. this fits completely with president carter's belief system of equity. (f. richards).
actually quite many of them, i'll write which i can remember for now: 1. clean code by r.c. martin (still reading) 2. refactoring by kent beck and martin fowler 3. introduction to algorithms 4. design patterns: elements of reusable object-oriented software by erich gamma, richard helm, ralph johnson and john vlissides 5. the good parts of javascript 6. how to build api's that you won't hate 7. python algorithmic thinking 8. the elements of statistical learning (still reading) 9. sql queries for mere mortals 10. php objects, patterns and practice 11. modern php 12. head first design patterns 13. javascript ninja 14. domain driven development (planning to read) 15. laravel documentation (dunno, but it's just so elegant!) 16. probabilistic overview (can't understand, still trying!)
i am sorry but good with hardware in the sense, it can run in any machine (pc, linux based system), speaker (inbuilt, bluetooth, headset), same with mic and so on. the initially goal was exactly that but due to lack of certain packages i resisted doing that, but yes in the future i could really see that happening, the thing is python code doesn't work with mobiles yes you can use some kind of compiler but all of these modules weren't available, so i need to write all of the standard development kits and then integrate with python compiler to java for android. so one other choice could be to build the entire stephanie on java itself which i might do it if i clear up some time in my busy schedule, but you're more than welcome to read and copy any kind of logic from stephanie to create your application!
no ofcourse not, *cough* stephanie is an open-source assasgoodin platform built specifically for voice-controlled applications as well as to automate daily tasks and hence imitating much of an virtual/personal assistant's job. it is written in python and i call it more as a framework than an application.
thank you! you need to have a solid understanding of fundamentals and few design patterns after that you can easily look up the documentation of various packages and integrate them as needed. but yes more often that not you need to create your own package because of it's unavailability, and the architecture of the application is really important if you wanna create something stable and efficient! that's why design patterns are amazing to get hold off, after that you need some imagination and some creativity? sounder algorithm for instance, i had to research about nlp in order to come up with an idea, some solid principles of mathematics doesn't hurt either!
probably finish reading all of the books which aren't completed, next step would probably be two mini personal projects and another stock market manipulation. i am honestly looking for a job, i live in a small town in india, so i'll be trying to move out to big city and learn some new experience from it, but as of now, i am constantly reading books and completing courses, i dunno i just love learning as compared to working. you didn't? check the developer api! i have demonstrated some demos to write as well! as i said before, i believe systematic education hampers my speed, i am one of those individuals who can keep learning/working for 16hours straight and then go a week without doing anything real good. and alongside i believe in 21st century, with all of the resources present in front of you, there is no real need of a college unless you lack in social skills.
just three things: 1. a working machine: windows, linux or whatever. 2. speaker: inbuilt, headphones, bluetooth, headset? 3. mic: inbuilt, bluetooth, headset, headphone, freaking phone connected to machine? 4. internet connection. and you're done, download the files, install it and it's ready to work, check more in the installation guide where there's step by step procedure written!
i dunno honestly, i always loved the open source community, and wanted to contribute to it! plus i am kind of fun dude, like i invent stuffs for fun, because i wanna use them, its only after that i realize, hmm, maybe others can use it too? but other than that i just wanted a free virtual assistant without any kind of ad blot. i am 18 years old currently, 5 months to get 19!
honestly, i don't have a programming job yet, i have answered it above in more detail. i'd say, learn more about design patterns and actually create/collaborate with other programmers to make some personal projects which then you can share it with the community to get some feedback and take it from there!
i am a high school graduate, i graduated last year, honestly google. i'd say start with some basic course, that isn't too long, once you complete that you start to get an inner belief it can kickstart things, atleast thats what happened to me.
sure why not? it'll be really good! i believe for scripting python is among the best programming language to work with! i started with java honestly, not exactly but i knew data structures, oop principles and what not, but it was python which helped me immensely to become better with it's design patters, and coding regulations. you know what if you really like the 'feel' of an interface, give codecademy.org a shot, it's a really good platform to learn programming interactively!
got any book recommendations? i have no idea where to start haha.
mmm not so much i'd say. i started programming quite recently (last year). i first learned a bit of bash scripting (i'm a linux user since quite a while, so i wanted to do some scripting to get things done on my daily driver system), then i learned some php in order to create a telegram bot. i then studied java/android sdk and in november i started developing apps on a freelancer website. if you're willing to work a lot and get payed just a little it won't be difficult to start working on something (this means you need to have someone else like your parents providing you money to live/eat etc. or a second job). after getting some good feedbacks i managed to work on a bigger python project (which actually involved some linux knowledge as well). the employers liked me and then employed me a few months ago. i still don't get payed enough to live only on this, but i'm learning quite a lot and i hope i'm building something for my future :) good luck with everything you're up to
honestly yes, at first duck-typing bugged me too, and i still know java as well, but the best thing about python i found was it's simple syntax, amazing community, a really nice way to import packages, and best for scripting, also the fact that currently i am learning neural networks, python just seems really good. but yeah c#, java and even ruby are pretty good programming languages, give typescript a try in case you don't like js, i really liked it.
you can type a="hello" b=a/2 won't throw an error until it runs, and until your program reaches that part of the code. in large projects can be harder to track down. maybe it rarely even hits that branch, or only carries a string under rare circumstances.
yes, that is pretty much unavoidable! people always ask the wrong questions.
that steven spielberg accidentally stole the title of "close encounters of the third kind" from dr. hynek
that dr. hynek was a badass astronomer who pioneered the field of celestial imaging. the hubble space telescope is hynek's progeny!
i believe we were switched in the hospital. thank you for noticing!
the tremonton, utah movie film from the late 1950s is pretty convincing evidence that something real was seen. catcher's mask, hands down
that many ufos seem to be both physical and non-physical at the same time
definitely along the lines of another dimension or another vibration, if you prefer... something that our science may never be able to xplain!
i have become less enamoured of the "extraterrestrial hypothesis" because there is so little evidence to back it up
start with "the edge of reality" by hynek and jacques vallee, then follow up with carl jung's ufo book.
the question assumes that any of the tracy's would be helpful, which is open to debate. but if they were useful, john tracy would be the most useful, as he manned thunderbird 5, the space station in earth orbit.
this will sound weird, but the japanese film "goke, bodysnatcher from hell" is the best alien movie ever!
the only ufos i've seen i'm pretty sure were lame chinese lanterns :( i know plenty of people who have really strange, scary ufo experiences, and i kind of envy them
great question! he did battle with a number of interesting foes, and i had to focus on only one: carl sagan. i wish i could have included more of those villains and how hynek dealt with them.
really, my experiences only expand my opinions of what is possible, and so i think of death as an interesting adventure
well, that's a trick question you see... i'm not sure if "scientific" work applies to ufo research anymore!
didn't we already send matt damon? seriously check out the work of robert zubrin. he's got it all figured out!
stop going to ufo conferences and events that feature the same tired old ufo "experts" talking about the same tired old topics. avoid anyone who claims to have a "smoking gun."
that is an excellent question! a number of respectable ufologists have put considerable time into studying this very thing, and while there are unquestionably geographical trends that appear from time to time, they never seem to amount to anything. there's a great story about the government apparently having such data and using it to predict a sensational ufo event in the 1950s, but i have found no way to prove or disprove the story.
i love men in black stories! not the will & tommy lee kind of mib, but the creepy, terrifying, strangely inhuman kind that harass and threaten ufo witnesses. the best account of those i've seen is john keel's awesome book the mothman prophecies. i can't speak for dr. hynek, but the most hair-raising thing i've come across as a ufo investigator was a local family with a history of paranormal experiences and a very real, inexplicable link to one of the famous "saucer crash" myths that was very likely an army psyops scam. that one still gives me goosebumps!
my brother matt & best sister-in-law casey got for that for me for my birthday a while back. it is a "zanti misfit" from the outer limits, and it's scary as hell!
yes, i worked as an investigator for the mutual ufo network (mufon) from 2011 to just recently. i've investigated about 150 sightings, and of those about 25 were just too weird and perplexing to be explained. at least by me.
that's an interesting thought. i could almost see it, but that would mean that our future selves are jerks for messing with us like this, wouldn't it?
my favorite genre is science fiction, but my favorite film is not sci-fi at all: it's a 1982 british comedy called "local hero."
some of them likely are, but beware of making blanket analyses... that's what gets most ufologists into trouble.
i have no idea who "sheriff mason mckinley" is. can you elaborate?
lol, myself included! thank you for your work and open mind.
i have read some claims that steven spielberg's inspiration for close encounters of the thrid kind was based on actual events of a scheduled visit of aliens to pick up a selected group of humans to live on their world for a few years. what are your thoughts on this and do you think it's real?
what about leslie kean's books? i think she rounds up the best possible evidence.
can you expand on that a little? when you say non-physical, you mean like those beams of light that car dealerships shine at the night sky?
in other words, there is definitely stuff flying around up there. there is proof enough of that. we just dont know what these things are or what they are made of. it could be aliens. it could be interdimensional matter. it could even be ghosts. or not. it could really be anything you could imagine at this point.
not sure what you mean by that. i can take it two different ways: 1) there's no one credible doing ufo research at the moment, only crackpots 2) we know what we can know for now, so ufo research is now more like philosophy. are either of those what you were thinking?
do you suspect any one on earth is an extraterrestrial?
meaning the government (supposedly) actually predicted a ufo event? did they warn the public?
ha! i knew it! i was actually a little upset at matt for buying it. he was so excited, though.
i can take a better picture with a $50 camera than i have ever seen of an alien ship in 80 years of ufo reports. is there one pic out there that has any credibility, sharpness and focus?
yeah, he is a man of mystery i suppose. it is better that you don't explain.
really, that deserves a more thoughtful reply! it's not that the question is so wrong, it's that it sometimes elicits the wrong kind of answer! does that make more sense?
this is an enduring and intriguing part of the ufo narrative. i know of no evidence that it's true, or that it's untrue. if it were true, i think mr. spielberg would have been on the first ship.
leslie's ufo book is a must-read! her newest book, surviving death, is also mind-blowing...
it's like how light behaves both as a wave and a particle simultaneously... it can't be but it is. i can't describe it much better than that.
that's what i think. we humans are very good at projecting our hopes and fears on things seen in the sky (see carl jung's ufo book for more on that)
more #2. there are a lot of people doing work, but not much of it is "scientific" and what is scientific is usually barking up the wrong tree. my point is that the ufo phenomenon often seems to intentionally defy efforts to study and understand it, so science is pretty much helpless.
if extraterrestrials are as worried about us as they probably should be, it would make sense for them to have some moles infiltrating our society. i certainly don't think they'd be here by choice.
no, they kept it under wraps and never used it again, as far as anyone knows. it's a very weird story.
check out the kelly-hopkinsville case if you want to read about ufo trolls.
photos of ufos generally suck, which i think is deliberate. someone posted a youtube link below to the tremonton utah ufo movie, and that is worth watching
he's not the first human to have intimate relations with an alien.
knowing the insane powers of liberal hollywood, it doesn't surprise me
what do you think is the best evidence in that book? it seems to me the ex-military people have the most credibility.
when you say deliberate: deliberate by who? assuming you don't mean the photographers, what motivations would you ascribe to extraterrestrial creatures making themselves visible, but only in a crappy way?
if hollywood has insane powers, i wish they would put them to better use.
i generally feel that pilots have the ideal skill set for sighting and observing unusual aerial objects.
i don't know much about video games, but the author sure looks interesting. i'll have to check out his work.
i know it's a reach, but sometimes the phenomenon itself seems to exhibit purpose and intention... as if it was always trying to remain just out of reach or just beyond our powers of perception. so, yeah, i'm talking about the entire phenomenon.
it's a paradox. millions of us carry cameras with us pretty much 24/7. you'd think we could blanket the sky and we still can't decent photos of ufos.
not to be rude, but did he/she explain why they couldnt be birds or balloons? honest question.
not really a paradox - it's a problem with the whole alien narrative.
not rude at all. gimme a minute and get you the page # in my book.
the info is on p. 81. the photo analysts discounted birds because of the illumination of the objects. they were light sources!
he does have 5 boys and two are twins and 3 are triplets.
it's telling that we live in a time when practically everybody has a high quality camera with them at all times, but we're still not getting good clear images of these flying saucers. it seems there were a lot more sightings when picture quality was very low. strange. of course mr. o'connell explained that... apparently the aliens, or spirits, or time travellers - let your imagination run wild - are playing cat and mouse with us, and continuously staying just on the edge of our ability to detect them. uh huh.
that's improbable, but it doesn't prove that he's an alien.
i had a good agent and i got lucky! in the early 1990s, the producers of star trek: the next generation were pretty liberal about looking at scrips from outside writers, so i wrote a script, my agent got it in the door, and in time they called me in to pitch story ideas. it took about 2 years of trying, but they kept inviting me to try again so i kept at it until i pitched the right story concept to the right producer on the right day and made the sale!
the biggest myth perpetuated by those who advocate against marijuana legalization is that there is not enough research to use it on patients. the biggest myth perpetuated by those who are for marijuana legalization is that it has therapeutic benefits far greater than research would suggest.
it's a mix between cancer, autism, seizures, ptsd. this is only for pediatric patients, however. there is no way to approve adults for marijuana yet but access should be available by spring of next year, which is fast, imo.
i believe that people do get slightly stupider when they are high. i don't think it's very significant though and most of it centers around the short-term memory loss. in the long run, i think it may be beneficial for intelligence. it certainly won't increase it, but i think there is a protective effect on brain cells and the mind and i certainly don't believe any decrease in intelligence occurs from long-term use. cigarettes and alcohol on the other hand...
cannabis in general will be useful because of its anti-inflammatory properties and improved tolerance to chronic pain.
talk to your own doctor first, if you feel comfortable with that. then, if they are not applying to be a registered cannabis physician in pa, call our office (855-420docs, or 844-4pa-weed) sometime in the fall when we're closer to the medication being available and we will touch base with you then about the most recent regulations and policies concerning attaining a medical marijuana card.
it'll be a long time until it's legalized on a federal level. the current administration is not accepting of it's medicinal status as is.
the hardest challenge has been fighting the criticism and false allegations encountered by individuals, groups and entire organizations. here's the catch: those people who have hurt me the most and caused me the most distress have been pro-marijuana activists. no person or group that is against marijuana has caused me even close to the amount of damages as those with personal interests in the marijuana industry.
i'm not op, but am a neurologist/pain specialist, with a subspecialty in epilepsy, am also an mmj prescriber in ny. can see some of my posts in regards to proof, and all that good stuff. to answer your question, yes medical marijuana could help you combat this panic if you were utilizing cbd-oils in appropriate dosages.
thc in itself can cause that sleepiness or couch-lock effect you're describing. move towards a much higher cbd, or pure cbd oil and you'll likely find yourself not groggy.
some of the most interesting ones to me include the crohn's disease study from journal of gastroenterology i believe from a few years ago. the more recent larger epidemiological study(s) from earlier this year that verify what i see in my own patients at the clinic. the harvard studies with tumor suppression on breast cancer tumors in vitro. the cbd study in nejm from this past month by devinsky, et al. showing cbd benefits on seizures in kids with the dravet syndrome. the large california-based epidemiological studies from 5-10 years ago that demonstrated safety and limited long-term side-effects. these are some of the good ones out of the limited research we have. what's far more interesting to me though is seeing the results on my own with my own eyes. it is eye-opening, to say the least.
i'm not so sure it would be very beneficial to you without the feeling of being high. from my experience treating patients with similar symptoms, it's the psychoactive constituent tetrahydrocannabinol (thc) that has the most therapeutic effect. therefore, i think you should reconsider the possibility that getting high may actually be beneficial to your psyche. take this all with a grain of salt cause without a proper doctors visit with me such recommendations are generalized and may not be true to you or another reader since it is so individualized, this treatment.
de is a microcosm of what shouldn't happen. essentially, it has become a medically legalized state with one company holding a monopoly, completely unable to keep up with the demand, resulting in a large blackmarket for patients holding medical marijuana cards. the goverment-run medical marijuana program is really great though. pa is a completely different ballpark. it has banned flower and the smoking of cannabis. i believe this regulation will be a blessing in disguise if it does persist after the state fully adopts the medical marijuana industry. one thing is for sure: the state is rolling out its program smoothly and quickly relative to other states.
there isn't much data to suggest smoking cannabis is unhealthy. certainly not like cigarettes. still, there are a lot of carcinogens and tar inhaled in the smoke. so even though there isn't much data to suggest it's bad for you, we can extrapolate that by removing those harmful byproducts of combustion, we are getting the same benefits without the additional contaminants, thus creating a greater net positive for one's health than smoking marijuana.
i don't think that this is going to be helpful. i've never read anything on this and can't even think of a mechanism by which that could happen. that's my initial impression.
recreational is one thing. it's not the worst thing you can do in terms of recreational drug use but altering mood and cognition may not be the best either. if your brain is under 24 years of age i would lean in the "not good idea" direction more, knowing what we do about brain development. replacing or forsaking actual treatments is another. please don't do that. /not op, but a psychiatrist.
i definitely believe that marijuana should remain medical. i also believe it should not require a doctor to get and should be available to anyone in need of it. i call that "over the counter medical marijuana." there have been no significant problems with recreational legalization in many individual states now so i think we can say that the same would hold true if the remaining states legalized. the pros and cons are really the same regardless of who i am "being." personally, i usually remain in the same (mind)frame regardless of circumstances so that question doesn't apply to me much.
i guess medical marijuana prohibition tends to be associated with more conservative viewpoints.
it's basically a pseudo-recreational situation. if they would just eliminate the need for a doctor but keep it medical patients could continue to receive the same benefits without needing a shill physician's assessment. "over the counter medical marijuana." it's the best of both worlds.
i find that psychologists and mental therapists are much more open to the use of medical cannabis to treat mental illness than psychiatrists are! i've had a very positive response from psychologists and behavioral counselors throughout pa and de who have asked me to come speak to them and teach them about cannabis therapy. psychiatrists on the other hand... well, i had to import my own into de from pa because not a single psychiatrist in delaware would help a patient get a medical marijuana card. in a sense, there still doesn't exist a psychiatrist from delaware that approves patients for medical marijuana. the reasons for that are very complicated and probably too subjective for me to discuss like this on the record. :)
i have not had any patients tell me that their visual 'floaters' improved after starting medical cannabis. can't say any have had that be a primary problem either. tinnitis, on the other hand, has on multiple occasions walked through my door. patients with cranial trauma-induced ringing in the ears have contacted me specifically because cannabis use eliminated their tinnitis (each case was a unilateral problem, fyi) immediately and completely. while this is only a few patients personal accounts, the similarity of their experiences suggests to me there may be a real therapeutic benefit that they are experiencing. time will tell!
i think that there are too many politics involved in the politics of federal marijuana legislature, if you know what i'm saying. i don't think i have enough influence to create change on that level. i have, however, changed state laws abour marijuana. last year i helped approve terminal illness as a condition in delaware by contributing to the petition that was submitted and writing a letter of support. i have been in talks with the pa mmj program too and expect to be in close communication with them in the future, the same way i am in delaware with the de mmj program, though right now they are completely too consumed by the task of instituting the state's new marijuana policies and birthing a whole industry from scratch.
getting high is separate and not necessary for the herbs therapeutic benefits.
no, it isn't a permanent solution. medical marijuana is similar to that of many medications, you would need to maintain proper dosing in order to adequately address any symptom.
yes, thc has been shown to cause anxiety and paranoia in users.
it's part of the process, as a prescriber myself i've had patients come seeking mmj but having no documented diagnosis and/or ailments. it's not awkward, it's just being honest.
that would require an assessment of your records and an evaluation by our psychiatrist.
i think it may help for this but to be honest i am still figuring it out. i haven't come to a strong conclusion yet.
yes it does. it's been proven to help reduce anxiety in several studies, and many people self medicate using pure cbd for it.
can you give a few examples of the common types of claims that are being exaggerated for the purposes of advocating for marijuana legalization?
fellow physician here. (pediatric psychiatrist) i'm trying really hard to understand your position - in another place you commented that the benefits are oversold, and yet i see you speaking about treatments for autism (miniscule evidence in kids), seizures (mild evidence), ptsd (mild evidence in adults, almost none in kids) in kids! are you an evidence based physician?
longitudinal studies pretty convincingly show that regular use decreases iq by about 6-7 points (not huge), and that stopping regular use returns iq to previous state.
thank you for your reply. i have already spoken to my doctor about my previous address in montana and how much medical marijuana helped me while i was there even before my diagnosis, but since then had to move back to pa to live with family when it became clear i was no longer able to hold a job due to my illness and chronic pain. my doctor has tried everything he can to help me and i am not sure of his intentions regarding the new laws, but i will revisit the subject during my next visit. thank you for doing this ama and thank you for being a doctor that is willing to advocate for the use of medical marijuana in pa.
i was using oil that is 18%cbd and 0.7%thc. still sleepy. guess it won't work for me.
thank you so much for taking your time on my question! i will definitely reconsider my "no getting high" rule! i was just concerned about how i would go about my normal day, driving/ going to work/ school. what is your most common strain that you prescribe for anxiety and/or depression?
i remember reading a study about pirates who used it to sail through the night easier. oh well it was worth a shot, thanks again doc!
thanks for your insight it was actually very helpful, i've actually never met anyone who has heard of rp (besides doctors) so this is quite exciting! i actually go to see a doctor (dr. tsang, not sure if you know him or not i've been told he's pretty well know), twice a year and he's been working a lot on gene therapy and i'm hopeful! the short term goal (5-15 years) is to stop the degradation and long term is to revert the degradation. i do take daily vitamin a and also omega fish oil (? i think) which are supposed to slow down the progression as well. it's just tough being in your early 20s, everyone wants to go to a bar which is highly uncomfortable and any substance that could make it even a tad easier would help immensely, so i'm always on the lookout. i think i've heard of the bionic eye but it's more geared towards later stages patients which (thankfully) i'm far from. good luck with your studies and thanks for the help, all us bats are very grateful for your hard work!
thanks! what i meant by "person vs. physician" was how do you weigh the pros vs cons in determining whether recreational marijuana should be legalized. like, did you prioritize certain benefits/negatives after becoming a doctor than you did before (i.e., did med school and/or becoming a doctor change your views on marijuana legalization?)? that's what i was trying to get at :)
that's not a misconception. that's the truth. the inebriation aspect is not necessary to treat ailments, pure cbd which has 0 inebriating effects has been shown time and time again to significantly reduce pain, as well as address things like anxiety.
medically irresponsible response, denying significant evidence that exists.
your license isn't at risk, let's not be dramatic. tons of states have medicinally legalized it, and the prescriber list is growing by the day. hell, there's 40?+ and counting in brooklyn alone.
what about the symptoms when i go off, are mj withdrawals real?
you know that guy that has end-stage "parkinson's disease" up until the point when he takes a few puffs of cannabis and suddenly he's a normal person? or, the rick simpson oil peddlers claiming it cures cancer. these are two that come to mind.
actually i consider myself science-based. that's why you can find my old blog online, which discusses my thoughts on science and is called "science-ology" (not to be confused with the l ron club), my articles on the website sciencebasedmedicine.org, and my open declaration of science-based beliefs on one of my recent youtube videos. the difference between your evidence-based approach and my science-based one, is that you rely on evidence to substantiate your beliefs and judgements. the fact that there is a lack of research creates a disbelief in you and anectotal evidence is deemed too weak to be considered useful. i, on the other hand, read all studies with a grain of salt and weigh the complete literature with the real-world observations and common sense to create my beliefs. having a solid background in logical fallacy and scientific method, i am able to keep a skeptical eye and call out the false claims while believing in less-proven effects.
yeah but we're talking about iq tests here. that's a very grey area. assessing iq is very loose, objectively. i don't hold much weight in results of that nature.
not exactly the way you worded it, no. yours had a nice over-medication spin on it.
try moving to a pure cbd oil then, no thc. thc isn't necessary for treating majority of ailments.
when i smoked blunts on the streets of philly as a teenager, i knew the tobacco leaf was harmful to my body. when i became a doctor, i researched marijuana extensively and found that it was quite harmless despite what i was told. now, i'm discovering new benefits to its use with time but that's medicinal use.
as a regular pot smoker with no other conditions that's still a pretty normal response. i lose my appetite and have a harder time falling asleep when i stop. that usually only lasts 1-3 days though.
i used to consider marijuana to be about the same as alcohol.... good for enjoyment, but not really medically good for anything. ....then i met a girl with epilepsy. the fact that she literally upset her entire life and moved to be able to access medical marijuana for her condition and the fact that it has allowed her to (mostly) attend university "normally" changed my mind. how is medical marijuana **not even considered** as treatment for cases where is proven to be effective?!
sorry. i'm not a really vocal person pro/con on meds but when you have lived it.....significantly different. i have 2 degrees and run a million dollar restaurant in a town of only 20,000 people. the only reason is because of this medicine. i feel like i was a prescribed meth-head (ritalin/adderal from the age of 5 and finally used a natural medicine at 20. thank you for doing what you are doing! that's all it takes is you stepping up. we understand it takes serious balls to help push this and we all appreciate it. we (the u.s. people) understand the scrutiny that can comes with it. that's what i am here for. i am one of the people ready to back you for doing what you do!
as a canadian physician who receives no drug incentives whatsoever and makes no more money if i use medications with my patients or not... nope.
i have patients relocate not uncommonly like that, frequently for seizures. the status quo is hard to change but the pendulum is swinging in the right direction. times are a changin'.
that makes sense, but it could be a factor in the response op receives from american psychiatrists.
well, there can be some (mild) harms, which are exacerbated if mainstream treatments are glossed over. i want to highlight that as a science based physician with a background in pharmacology, i beleive that cannabinoid receptor pharmacology is understudied, though i also believe that so far, its use in treatment is very modest and conventional treatments generally outperform. i am all for research, but it has to be rigorous. cannabis deserves research and it will find a place. but its effect size is looking relatively small for most of the conditions it is heralded for, thus far.
right... but it's a trait that remains consistent. so whatever it is measuring (speed of processing, for example), is valid and consistent. so when we repeatedly see that regular mj use drops 6 to 7sh iq points, we can say that with confidence. that's not just random. working memory, processing speed, etc etc... whatever you want to call that collection of skills (intelligence and not), decreases by about 6% with regular mj use.
that's a very american view. if non american psychiatrists wouldn't prescribe marijuana in those settings without financial motivation, why would you attribute financial motivation to american psychiatrists?
from what i've heard, it's because he always had to go last. considering that hoedown was usually one of the last games played in an episode, it put a lot of pressure on him to close out the show with a big laugh.
my understanding was that he always went last because he was just bad at doing improv songs and flat out *needed* the time.
as generalised as it may sound, yeh, i think theres some credence in doing something like that - i know efforts are ongoing to tap into that superstition element and make out that rhino horn curses you or something like that. although i like the specifics of your idea!!!! i do agree its something that should be addressed with some vigour.
hardest was simply managing different identities, and constantly pretensing to be someone else. it was a bit draining! never found out, but close to it on occasion - if baddies were even a mite suspicious, they would often address you as 'officer' or something, just to see how you would react, and you are alwats somewhat paranoid so you begin to think 'oh no, do they know?'
no questions are stupid! the difference is chalk and cheese. interpol are not cops. its simply an organisation which tries to facilitate cooperation between countries. interpol staff have no powers, no investgative capabilities and no jurisdiction (unless they are seconded police officers working within theor own jurisdictions). it's a rather lumbering bureaucratic organisation, which does the best job it can given its limited remit. compared to being an undercover cop, it was much less exciting, but much more interesting if that makes sense?
maybe, but then are we not encouraging the concept that ivory as decoration or status symbol is acceptable, and perpetuating this ideal?
a bit of both, but majority of work is targeting those involved at the middle/upper end of the chain certainly from an investgation perspective
sometimes the most innocuous situations were scariest - just being in the company of very bad people, not knowing what their intentions were or anything like that. got stuck in a dead end road once, with a guy with a gun, and couldnt see my backup. sphincter was clenching somewhat. there were a few scary moments, but honestly, nothing which would make your hair stand on end! thats the reality im afraid!!
in some prvate game reserves, ostensibly, yes - i don't work in that sphere, but some reserves would consider 'conservation' to mean heavily armed paramilitary guards with shoot to kill policies. there are certainly reserves (especially in southern africa) where trophy hunting fees will fund actual conservation, but i retain a healthy level of sceptisiscm about that sort of thing.
theresa may. not my fave person anyway. its pretty damning really - we need to be at the forefront of emilinating the trade, which includes delaing with 'laundered' ivory which surfaces in europe. it's not (as some in the chattering classes may think) about ivory per se, it's ultimately about the destruction of a rather magnificent species of animal, and i think its incumbent upon governments to do their bit, and attack the issue from all angles.
- yes - my wishes would be better choice of tattoos, a permenant supply of strong ethiopian coffee, and an end to children needlessly dying globally - i'd be happy, but somewhat slighted, possibly slightly violated/used
i can help your friend if you give me his name and his current location. and his phone number. on a serious note, no-one is ever 'wanted by interpol' interpol sometimes publishes red notices to alert other national police agencies that someone is wanted by another country, so, if its true, your friend will be wanted by the state where he is alleged to have committed an offence, not by interpol. interpol have no powers of arrest or anything. the situation in venzuela is very grave, and hopefully some semblance of order will reign soon.
really????? interpol is an international organisation comprising almost every country in the world, regardless of our membersjip of the eu. the question should be 'do we get any benefit from interpol?'!!! it is a much misunderstood organisation!
yes often. in which case i am adept at using the inside of the toilet roll (the cardboard bit) to remove most of the detritus. after that, well, it gets a bit difficult.
yeah i get that, like the military vs the airforce. thanks.
it seems like the ideal is already there, otherwise there would be no demand for it now. plus, we still display ivory in museums and antiques
museums and antiques don't cause poaching and involvement of semi-organised crime the ideal is there based upon cultural percpetions and poor knowledge of the source of ivory and the manner in which it is acquired
plus, i sort of am not a fan of tarheting the poachers - often they are motivated by extreme poverty or they are simply being paid for a generational skill (ie hunting) which has been developed over generations - so anti-poaching education is more important for this level of criminal than fully criminalising them - we need to be getting the nasty people who are truly making profit
i like to think of myself as a living pez dispenser version of beeker from the muppets
each day is pretty unique, depending on the days news, if i'm out filming or down in an edit putting a piece together. it's a very communal office, so if you're not on the show you can hop into joke meetings or help out some other aspect of the show. normally if i'm not on i'm probably prepping for an upcoming field shoot or perusing the internet for some nugget of news to jump into. either way, there is still a part of me thinking about what i will be watching on netflix later in the night- but ultimately i'll spend an hour scrolling through netflix, unable to make a decision and thus leaving me frustrated by my indecisiveness. then it's the morning and i do it again.
i grew up in michigan where guns were much more normalized. it's always been an interesting issue in america as they mean very different things to people depending on how and where you grew up. also, ive done a few pieces on tds about guns and found the conversations on both sides of the topic to be fascinating. surprisingly there seemed to be a good amount of common ground that wasn't being talked about and i wanted to go back to michigan and hear some of the moderate voices than don't tend to get air play.
1. we were filming with pat mcnamara at a north carolina gun range on the back of his flat bed truck. it started rolling down the hill and while the crew stood dumbstruck, pat mac took off, full sprint and grabbed the truck, put it in park and also saved equipment that was near destruction. he is a super hero 2. giant step forward
the good guy with a gun piece was a favorite. going through the process of training to be a "good guy" was eye opening. those dudes who run the response training were really impressive. outside of guns i enjoyed sitting down and talking with pastor mark burns, and had me a blast doing the "future christ" segment. i picked three. i'm sorry, perhaps that's my vanity breaking through.
because then he would be forced to show reasonable gun advocates instead of crazy people like militias.
thanks! i gotta say alaska. denali national park. not only is it gorgeous and unique, but the people of alaska have their own pace and way of looking at the world that was refreshing.
it's not the only way, but it is one of the most effective ones.
this is a great question. i can't claim to have the answer but i do think it's important to study the links guns have to violence. it's too easy to automatically equate guns with violence, but at the same time, it's too easily dismissive to separate the gun as a tool from the violence that may result from it. either way, all of us can agree that we should be exploring how to lower violence in general. at its most basic level, i think funding to study the link is a good first step to see what the next productive step could be.
without knowing anything about it, just want to point out that a "balanced" special (on any topic) would examine arguments from both sides and challenge people on both sides. so in this case, challenging a gun owner in one part of the special doesn't mean the whole thing is anti-gun.
thanks for the answer! if you're looking for something to watch on netflix, i just saw a pretty good comedy special by this nerdy indian dude. you might have heard of him, hasan something...
what do you think about the fact that the nations with the largest amount of legal weapons have the worlds lowest murder rate, like switzerland, sweden, norway, finland, even usa is not even top 100 when it comes to murder rate, while the nation with the lowest amount of legal weapons and strictest gun laws are the nations with the highest rate of murders, like mexico, brazil, honduras?
have you spoken to pat about the negative fallout he has received regarding the clip?
that explains why my other comment disappeared so ill say it again: 33,000 people did not die due to gun violence in 2014. over 60% of that number is suicides. jordan you propagandist
germany have one of the worlds highest rates of legal guns, while brazil have one of the lowest.
he has no response because he is not an actual scholar, politician or anyone with any sort of extensive education. hes a comedian that went to a local college for theater, and what you stated doesn't fit his liberal agenda
yes there is hope. there is specific c -ptsd treatments like trauma focused cbt. i don't know your full situation. depression is like being in a dark hole where you are in the hole and people above you are trying to throw you a rope to get out and what you need is someone to get in there with you and show you the way out. i highly suggest going on psychologytoday.com and searching out a therapist in your area. also look into autism services or social groups. depression is deeply hard. trying looking on the inside and see where maybe you are hindering yourself from social interactions in your thinking. there is always hope. always.
yes.therapists should work on a principle of "do no harm". if i don't think i am adequately trained in something i will not see that client but will always offer a referral to someone who does. specifically i don't really treat border line personality disorder, schizophrenia (anymore) and autism. i am not specifically trained in a lot of these.
worst is pretty relative i suppose can you be more specific? worst trauma, worst mental health symptoms? as far as study tips go... sometimes caffeine works as a stimulant for adhd, so coffee works for some of my teens and kids. secondly studying in increments of your attention. if you find you can only pay attention for 5-10 min, study for that, take . break for 10 min and go back. don't beat yourself up if it's not a long time just study incrementally.
make sure you utilize the social supports around you, study groups, the college counseling facility ( free counseling!). make sure you balance social and study time and don't isolate yourself even if you feel like doing it, but do take alone time!
really finding a cbt therapist would be awesome. cbt stands for cognitive behavioral therapy. it is based on what we think deeply effects our feelings and emotions and looks to correct negative thinking patterns in ourselves. look up some cbt stuff as well if you don't have the money for a therapist and do the work sheets. cbt is scientifically proven effective. i worked with a kid who had significant problems even more so than yours to the point of suicidality. he put the work in and it drastically changed his life.when i met him he had tried to commit suicide the day before and by 6 months he graduated on his way to nyu and stated to me that he was glad he had not died.
so they have social workers who have a lot of the same training as therapists and can help navigate some of that. its not a bad idea however. they also have child life specialists in hospitals that are trained to help kids deal with illness and surgeries.
washington state is amazing. i actually reside in portland but am licensed in wa state...it's weird i know. different states have different licensing guidelines.
i know it's a huge cultural phenomenon right now and it is being addressed in mental health agencies right now, but i haven't seen it. i definitely should though. my only thought is that i wish netflix would put the suicide hotline up before every episode.
repeated answer sorry: i know it's a huge cultural phenomenon right now and it is being addressed in mental health agencies right now, but i haven't seen it. i definitely should though. my only thought is that i wish netflix would put the suicide hotline up before every episode. none of my clients have brought it up yet.
so most of my time has been spent with children, teenagers and adults up to 25 but really my most challenging adult was one who slipped into delusions every so often in session, where he thought we had met before and that people were talking about him and all sorts of things.
therapy animals are a tool, not a cure i believe so i think success is relative. to be honest i couldn't give you a number but i do believe the "emotional support animals" phenomenon is widely abused and not highly vetted,=. the fact that you can go online and order vests without a proper therapist or doctors note tells you something right there. puppies aren't emotional support animals, they usually cause more stress and anything. however there is a definite distinction between therapy animals and emotional support animals. a therapy animal has specific training to help a disability.
all the time. i currently work in community mental health as well where we have psych's on staff. i have worked pretty closely with arnp's as well and they have written me a recommendation letter or two when i was applying for other jobs during my career. also i have lots of respect for you guys in that field. so thank you for the work you do!
hmm i can definitely see where this might occur because trauma is often times blocked out of the brain or repressed and sometimes, sexualized behavior or other behaviors have direct links to sexual trauma and can't be explained by other things, so a therapist bee lines for that right or wrong...and it's wrong you should never try to press a client to remember things they can't. you might ask a question or two about a certain event but lots of time your own intuition is leading you. this is why supervision and consultation with other therapists is soo important. lots of therapists are isolated, without any support or a space to bounce ideas off of. i'll be honest, there are alot of crappy therapists out there whose intuition is off, or they have poor boundaries or they lack lots of empathy.
i would have a really hard time understanding why a kid would mistake me for sexual services.....and no i have never had anyone come onto me although this is one of the biggest reasons counselors get sued.
licenses re-issuances are due yearly on your birth date. so all my paperwork was done and put in in marchish and didn't clear until may and birth date is in august.
to be honest no. i am always trying to improve how i work with clients however. sometimes you lie in bed at night and think, i should have said this or that or the other, or i shouldn't have said this, but i am never afraid to admit to a client next week, that i may have said the wrong thing and clarify with them or re-hash what happened previous sessions. i have never had a client or former client commit suicide yet but in this line of business it is bound to happen, it's almost inevitable. i'm sure then i will heavily evaluate things i said or how i could have helped them further. it's just a fact of this work.
i was told by my therapist the prevailing theory in the field of psychology is that people who have had lifelong depression are basically fated to stay that way the rest of their lives. he does not agree, but is that in fact the prevailing theory at the moment?
it was just a simple question. seems if anyone is overreacting...
is there a reason you dont help schizophrenic patients anymore?
i have family in the metro portland area. any area close to the columbia river is great in scenery.
yeah definitely, the suicide hotline would be a really good resource for them to put out there. they put content warnings up on 3 episodes, two of which depict rape and the other depicts suicide, but i don't think its enough. you'll probably end up watching it eventually though and you can draw your own conclusions :)
i'm not sure about that to be honest. i have never encountered teaching or therapists who believe that dysthima is a lifelong thing. i do believe however that sometimes the best a person can get is managing their depression, not just having it lift completely. that doesn't mean you can't have a full life. some people will be anxious their entire life or have ocd their entire life but have learned to manage it in a way that works for them.
reading back through my comments, i sound rude and negative. i honestly apologize. i don't like people who spread negativity, i certainly don't want to be that kind of person. i'm sorry.
i don't feel i am trained enough to hep them. so i have worked community mental health and private practice. in community mental health you don't get to choose who you wrk with, they pretty much assign you who they think might fit no matter what the diagnosis is. at one point i had 60-70 clients on my case load (which is average) and had about 2 cases of psychosis and schizophrenia. i was not adequately trained for them. it's not a matter of won't it's a matter of, who do i think could best help this person and it's not me.
you would think but sexual offenders are shunned like you wouldn't believe. most get mandated sexual offender treatment but at that age they can be put on the sex offender level and have to register if charged and it will vastly screw up any chance they have at a job, college or life in general. they are the one true class that fall through the cracks completely.
definitely. i have been meaning to but my caseload plus moving right now has kept me very occupied!
your welcome. i am sorry for the crappy spelling mistakes. remember, you are worth fighting for.
well i hope you can still understand my skepticism. it's also dangerous to give advice under the guise of a person of authority. people tend to take the advice of a person who credits themselves as a professional, much more seriously than a person who does not. if you do manage to get your further proof, without putting yourself at risk, that would give me peace of mind. sorry if i've offended you in any way.
i have also been told this by tons of therapists. i had no idea this was not set in stone as a "fact". the way it has been put to me is that because things started to go wrong very early on while my brain was still developing, and because i haven't had the experience of not being the way i am, i will always to some extent have to manage my mental health in a way that someone who does not have a chronic problem would not have to manage it.
damn. i had a gf in highschool that had psychosis. it's was horrible
thanks for responding. it gave me some much needed clarity, i wouldn't want to hurt her or piss her off.. i guess i just wish i could ask her if she realizes how profoundly she hurt me. it's hard to reconcile who i perceived her to be and what i perceived our relationship to be worth to each of us with how it's all turned out. i appreciate your feedback, very cool of you to do this ama :)
even for a minor? damn, but its understandable tho. i mean, you can get away with petty theft, and other minor shit and live ur life fine. but with sexual violence, and even murder and other shit... you fucked up big time mate.
i'm not offended at anyway. i completely understand...it's the internet, people do sketchy things i get it. i am at work but tonight i will try and post a picture of me holding it, without showing my face or anything.
that makes sense. i don't think mental health is linear in that you get better one day and that's it, you're cured. i think you manage it and have great days and the occasional not so great days. i have my own mental health issue and like you, it was building early on but i can manage it where it's not as bad as it once was but may still linger here and there.
it's very hard on all parties. it's hard as a therapist as well because you cannot feed into the delusions yet you can't deny them either. you have to catch them when they are grounded and have some sort of stabilizing thought pattern to do the work.
one last thing. i realized my words said "doesn't sound like it can be salvaged with time" i meant my guess is that through time it probably could be salvaged but grieve right now and take steps to move toward her , if you want, minimally and see the reaction you get. at a certain point though you need to protect yourself from the toxicity of any harsh responses.
it's everything you dream it would be. also i've known her for a long time and everyone always knew she was going to be a star.
well i'm glad you liked it enough to see it 3 times! i'm a little hesitant to answer this one because of the ***spoiler*** aspect of it, but as you know, things aren't what they seem and our stripper character has a very redemptive story line.
no, sorry. the movie doesn't really have a lot in common with vbt except for the accidental death (spoiler: our girls don't kill each other). but i think you'll love it!!
1. literally what took you so long?? 2. rough night is actually rooted in similarly grounded characters who happen to find themselves in an unfortunate situation -- but if you like the show you're gonna love rough night -- promise.
it was amazing -- scarlett's such an incredible actress with insane range, and she was so funny and charming and improvised a bunch too. some of my favorite lines she improvised. i would make a million movies with her if the president of hollywood will let me.
bo plays tobey, one of peter's best friends (peter is scarlett's finacee, played by paul w. downs). he helps inspire peter with one of the most epic monologues i believe has ever been committed to film. he's incredible.
we wrote the characters based on real people/friendships and then re-wrote a bit for the actors once we cast. it helped a ton that they all bonded super quickly and all genuinely love each other.
i thought i'd have a lot more time to shoot than i did. shooting five women means a lot of coverage and we had to move very fast. thankfully my dp sean porter had designed an incredible lighting rig that we basically just turned on every day that enabled us to save a bunch of time which saved my life. my hero!
i started directing before i was in a writers room -- my advice is this: direct a lot. direct videos, put them online, and then keep making more. if you check out our old videos on paulilu.com, you can see the old ones are pretty rough (hey-ooo!) but got better as i kept directing. if your stuff is good, you will get work. work with people you think are talented, and keep grinding.
i genuinely have no idea what i'm going to do or what city i'm going to be in. where are you going to be? i'd see it with you if we're in the same town.
yes kate plays pippa, an australian that scarlett's character was friends with from her semester abroad. pippa is loosely based on our real friend pippa (sousstyle.com!) who is australian, and it was always scripted that way. also, if you're looking for good aussie comedy check out "summer heights high" and "please like me" (i realize that is unrelated to the question.)
1. yes 2. world peace, for my family and friends to be healthy for a very long time, and for mother nature to take back what is rightfully hers. 3. i do not shame the sexuality of lamps, and would be happy to have been part of it's pleasure.
i keep changing my mind on what my favorite scene is. right now it's when peter does his sobriety test.
agreed! super excited to see the movie and i'm a huge broad city fan. hope it's a big success. good luck with it!
ww1 and ww2 didn't have much in common besides germans.
hey thanks for the response! sounds awesome, love that guy.
heheh. this one knows how to reddit, like teflon, bitches!
why are you directing a movie, that in my opinion took "rough nights" to make, you know it will be on the internet right?
in case you missed it, it was the actor himself asking the director what it was like working with himself, for a laugh, and "who dat" is the director's response to be silly. who pissed in your cheerios this morning?
that director is a real pinnacle of humor and intellect. i'm sure the movie will be a hoot. that is a very canadian saying. are you from america's attic?
hahahaha. please tell me to wrote your comment like that purposely to show me and you don't actually write *that* way.
hush lil baby!!! xo thanks for letting me poke u while u at work!! see u this wknd!
no, but i'm originally from wisconsin, and my favorite movie growing up was strange brew, so i feel i'm at least kindred spirits with our friends from the great white north.
pretty sure this'll be reposted even after guardians of the galaxy 3.
it says, "we gotta make him a real redditor!" for anyone wondering.
if that was me making this, it wouldn't have been done until mcu is finished and the writing wouldn't move around... probably just subtitled... in slide format... and blocky as shit... like an 8 bit game...
i'm still a bit confused, is baby groot the same groot but a new spawn? or did the og groot die and this is sapling is sort of his son?
for this much karma, i'd make a new account about pp!
why are people so hesitant and afraid to give op credit in their reposts anyway? do they think that will reduce their karma somehow?
someone said it is an algorithm to drop old content off of popular sub
reddit itself has algorithms that lower the upvote count of popular posts so that r/all always has fresh content
it had around 22k upvotes when i first saw and upvoted it. now is below 7k. bots? dunno, i'm not a reddit expert. can someone who's more informed on the issue please enlighten me?
around mid 21,000 or low 22,000. it's a shame, this is high quality post and was going to in the top of all time.
just basic motion tracking a point in the video and parenting it to the text.
plus not everyone sees all posts. i don't know how many times i've seen something cool for the first time only to see the comments are flooded with people complaining how many times it's been reposted.
i fucking hate karma decay, its a nonsense way of keeping the front page fresh, but if people are still that happy with this post it should not be decayed until people are fucking done with it. doesn't exactly motivate people to contribute to this shit system.
yup, packing up. deleting account. removing bookmark. clearing all related cache. blocking ip. this will how i choose to remember reddit.
did you try turning it off and turning it back on again?
dude it was at 22,000. something is wacky as shit here. there is no way that many people came and downvoted this!
hi. i'm still surprised by how well it was received. lol, an ama on me would be the most boring ama ever. :)
i have upvoted almost every comment, but that's just one upvote. i can't account for the others, though. :)
lol, i'm rooting for you because you put as much effort into getting last comment as i did making the gif. probably just one more week to go, buddy. :)
this is like the 5th post i've seen in a week over 10k. reddit is either bigger than ever, or hive-mindier than ever. or, more likely, both. oh, and don't get me wrong, this is a great post; i upvoted too.
when starlord says "hey pp, no one cares!" op's username is u/ih8mypp
yes and the few frames before it says something about "use it correctly". really well done.
iirc from the comics, its a new groot but he retains all his memories from past groots.
it's not that they're afraid, it's that they (often) just don't give a shit
i think that's kind of bullshit if they have an algorithm doing this, because it's fucks up the top posts of all time.
you know, they say if you mention u/gallowboob three times in one thread, a repost of his will make it to the front page.
oh hell yeah. honestly it shouldn't decay at all, they need a system with how many upvotes/hour it gets, so if it is still popular, then keep it on the front page. but making us lose our precious karma that we rightfully deserve (if it's oc only) then it's kind of like taxing us for creativity.
yeah but 20k? 10k is definitely impressive but 20k is insane.
yeah, he is saying that, and is true that many times repost reach front page. but i don't know if he is mocking those who upvote reposts, those who take that fact too seriously or both.
yes and no. gotta remember he's a plant. he's a new shoot from the same roots. or a cutting, maybe. same plant, but also a new plant. it makes perfect sense in my head.
doesn't that mean he might have clones everywhere and not know it?
eh, do we know for sure that vol 2 takes place more than a few hours after the first one? i haven't seen anything to suggest a significant amount of time has passed.
and if you mention /u/gallowboob 4 times, nothing will happen.
holy fucking fuck darth jar jar just fell down and died
now it's 17k. did several thousand people downvote it? :-(
i wish more people i knew watched it, it's fucking hilarious. enjoy.
can you imagine how much child support he has to pay?
yeah we don't know how long it's been. though i hope they change things for the movie. baby groot is an adorable character, and fans would be bummed if he fully "grew up" pretty early in the film
check it again in a few hours. reddits algorithm will probably put it back down to 10-15k
i caught a caught a shiny magikarp 2 days ago and evolved it into a gyarados but it still had terrible moves, so i looked through my tms to see what i could teach it and surprisingly it can learn fire blast.
i think an interesting scenario to compare it to would be if you got an exact clone created from you that's exactly identical and even has your memories up until the clone was made. now, once the clone is made, the 2 of you will experience different things, and assuming your minds aren't linked or anything, the 2 of you are 2 separate entities with different emotions. so if you died for instance, there would only now be the clone, but since you died, it's not really you that's feeling those emotions of the living clone. now just remove the step in the cloning process where you live, and instead imagine you dying as the clone is created. if you were different from the clone before, i imagine that would be the case now too. then again, this still doesn't answer the question of what you are, other than saying an exact replica with your memories isn't.
disney can sell a lot more merch if he stays baby groot
how? and why? i know what you mean but i dont get it why some posts that have around 6k~ after a few hours have only 4k upvotes. and the percentage is still at 90% upvotes. how does it work?
is reddit where thechive gets its employees as well? content is definitely taken from here.
do i have to know who jan michel vincent is to get this joke?
i refuse to sign an order allowing more than...8....jan michael vincents
with the sound you hear the dick eagle laugh: "going on a trip? see ya next fall! ah ha ha ha ha ha ha!"
the longer a post is up reddit removes up votes. it's to prevent one post from always being at the top of r/all
i used to love the chive, until i realized almost everything on there is from here, just 3 days later. well, except the girls that write kcco across their bewbs...
that's a strange way of doing it when they could just weigh the votes but still keep the "approximately this many people upvoted it" metric somewhat useful.
couldnt remember. thought he was dragon/water due to the fact he looks like the way japanese and other asian cultures detail their dragons as flying snakes
blame /u/ducksonducksonducks, whoever that bastard is
yeah they could do that but that would make people happy and no one wants that
they only wanted one dragon type in gen 1. they made him into a flying sea serpent i guess.
we humans only leak when our bodies are pierced by the spears of our enemies, like the ogaphons of percei 6, which i hate as all humans do.
holy fuck, i smirked the first time i read that, then i reread it and entered a vortex of despair. dead on. dammit
not teddy roosevelt or george washington? just the one who supported welfare recipients
at least we finally got a good pm here to hold up our half of north america.
"if if if if if if if if" he had no teleprompter for once none of this would be true
could you imagine if guys like teddy were internet era?
he's planning on opening a beach front shop in hawaii where he will sell nothing but plain white t-shirts
yeah, also i feel very safe with him in charge - i know he will be very cautious with regard to using our military and won't start a major war unless it's absolutely necessary, and he won't incite anger from potential enemies by being overtly disrespectful. i don't like many of his policies (i'm mostly libertarian), but between him, trump, and clinton i'd re-elect him in an instant.
i truly appreciate people who can disagree with someone and yet still respect them as a person.
it has everything - nostalgia, memes, a high quality image, and that air of wistfulness that belies change
i think michelle wants to be oprah, not president.
having 18 years in so far, i couldn't agree more. he's been a respectable and noble leader.
lol, and my husband just said to me today "i have to go buy ammo it will all be gone tomorrow!!" (if hillary wins, he says).
i am (mostly) a huge fan of obama, but it's difficult to parse out what effects a president really has on a country, especially in regards to the economy. that being said, on the bro-scale, obama rates very high. he just seems like a good dude.
i'm so happy for you. i lost my boyfriend last week due to depression. i'm so glad you're better now, and were able to get help.
i would watch a netflix show where obama and george w bush sit around and review movies together.
same with me. when my own family says it i hear "i wish you weren't alive". then they get pissed i'm passionate about politics.
alright, you have to no rules mud wrestle one of the two nominees. pick one go.
"didn't do much for me... will make 8k more a year"
8 people control 50% of world's wealth. 6 gave to hillary campaign to keep obama practices in place.
scandals? you want to talk about scandals? i don't know of any that obama has had (not saying he hasn't had any) and trump had a boat full before he was even elected. i don't know how people can defend trump and call him a saint and a fighting force for the working class when he just made it so big corporations are held less liable for disregarding safety regulations and not paying workers wage. he did this by getting rid of regulations that obama put in place to help the working man.
someone's gotta slam some tall boys of milluwalkies best ice and wash an iroc z in cut off jean shorts on the white houses front lawn and diamond joe is just the man for the job.
have you seen the trump campaign? it's literally nothing but dank memes as far back as late 2015. i think they can keep it going.
he will always be barefoot and will forget what stress is. michelle and the kids will be playing in the warm ocean, bathed in sunlight. obama is home.
i'm not even american but i agree. whenever i watched his speeches or even pictures, i'd get some sort of special charm or charisma that he would reflect. atleast to me, he looked like one of the best presidents usa has ever got.
fdr did a good job too. fdr also served three terms, which we all wish obama could do now.
this. as an outsider who's seen other non-americans spitting vitriol online, how different would the last few months have been if more people could show respect to those with alternate viewpoints? easily the most hateful election cycle i remember ever seeing.
"do you have any idea how much power i'd have to give up to be president?" ~oprah, also lex luthor
it's actually really nice to see a bunch of fellow servicemen pay their respects to a president who deserves that respect. agree or disagree with his policies, it's got to be difficult to not at least grant him that. thank you for your service. and thank you mr. president for being a leader we can be proud of. i was disappointed that he wouldn't or couldn't deliver on all of the promises he made, but i never regretted my vote.
he's not wrong. tomorrow is going to be a great day to own a gun store if hillary wins.
not everything i wanted to have happen happened, but he did the best he could with what he had. nobody does everything you want, but he's waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyy better than these two twats.
i'd hug you if i could. weather the storm, and celebrate life with love and compassion.
"a gay pair of guys put up a parking lot" ...that's the words, right?
thanks for not getting assassinated too. i mean i was like 70% sure there'd be a really massive assassination attempt taken on him. not that president biden would have been a bad thing of course, just it would have been a shame to lose obama.
meanwhile obama's like "i'm not fucking dead yet!"
remember when we mocked romney for saying russia is america's foe? i do. it seems like he had a point.
in ten years that's all going to seem as quiant as bill's illicit blowjob.
i don't see why he got so much hate in the first place. from my perspective he did a very good job
even glenn beck has already admitted he was wrong about obama
hillary. she might seize up and help me secure a win.
i don't see /u/binkow saying he's done anything big. he's just asking what obama's done, no need to make things personal and insult him.
gee i wonder why hillary would feel paranoid about saying something that could be used against her.
bu-but but didn't you hear that hilarious pokemon go pun???!??
i don't understand a thing you just said, but i agree.
their memes have been nowhere near the quality of obama's.
after all the shit they've put up with the last 8 years, they have earned every second of it.
he wasn't one of the best presidents and i am a die-hard liberal and huge obama fan. he's very laid back but it didn't serve him well. he wasn't aggressive or strong enough to try to get shit done. bill clinton, on the other hand, was one of the greats. i don't know any president that actually got israel and palestine to sit face to face with each other and hash out a peace agreement. bill clinton got shit done in the face of huge opposition from newt gingrich, a man he despised. people may not agree with nafta or anything clinton accomplished, but he was willing to put in the blood, sweat and tears and get stuff done for the good of the country.
what about eisenhower? i'm not american and he was decades before my time, but he sounded like an extremely pragmatic and no-bullshit president.
without a black man driving, they'd never get pulled over.
obama is already the greatest gun salesman in history.
do you live in a state that expanded medicaid? if not most likely republicans fucked you on getting subsidies.
please, no! this was the hold music for it support. shoot me now.
i imagine the secret service quietly earned a lot of well deserved overtime.
are you referencing ray narvaez jr.? edut: you are! ;(
except after roosevelt they added term limits, so a third term was not an option.
she's also going to lose. i can't fucking believe this is happening but i think she's going to lose
yeah? well from my perspective the *jedi* are evil!
i'd say expanding nsa surveillance will go down as a pretty dark splotch on his record. especially if clinton expands them further or simply starts compiling a database on citizens' private internet activities from their computers and phones
having to choose between 2 shitty candidates (excluding the 3rd party candidates since we know they won't win anyway) really puts things into perspective.
this comment section is just wrought with right wing shills
ok how about take an economy with negative gdp growth and create 4% growth? incredible that bush inherited a booming economy and yet obama, who inherited a dumpster fire will put up better numbers in the last 7 years of his presidency and the first year of trump's. kinda helps when you have a basic understanding of economics and you don't say ignorant shit like "nafta is the worst trade deal ever".
right? are people just handing out gold this election?
damn. if he ever realizes this that would probably be a depressing thought for him.
probably about $30 a month. back before republicans fully sabotaged it and wrecked millions of american's lives just to make a point.
that was on purpose. they wanted you to hang up. source: used to be 1st tier it guy.
and yet they will face no consequences for crying wolf. ugh.
i thought so, read the "i'm not dead yet" in his voice
yeah which is ironic given that it was the third term that gave him the clout to get it done in the first place. an obama third term would be brought by a dem senate and the political reckoning bitch mcconnell and his goons are long overdue for.
they won't win because you didn't vote for any of them. til sadness
he was great human being, and a charismatic leader. i didn't agree with many of his policies and stances, but the man was one of the most down to earth presidents, probably ever.
that's the only way when you own a sweet mullet ride like that.
trump is their consequence. sadly the dnc became what it is, so nobody wins.
i agree. he got dealt a shit hand and then played it like an amateur instead of a president who is supposed to be a pro. he had probably the hardest term since wwii and just did not react the right way. obama probably had the hardest start since fdr as well and he did great. the more i read about w the more i move away from being pissed and more towards sympathy, understanding, but also disappointment. i really do think he is a good person.
they won't win because america's first past the post voting system ridiculously favours a two party system. you guys really need to fix that.
they're gonna build him up to feud with trump at the next ppv.
sigh, you are right. i'm dutch and we do pay a lot of taxes but because everybody give a little bit we have an amazing healthcare etc. it's a shame there are people who really can't understand these kind of things.
the red tape was they would have had to pay 10% of the expanded cost eventually. so federal money would have been 90% of the expansion state 10%.
my healthcare is great, thank you. i work for it, and i picked a job that could provide it. i wish people could understand these things
"picked a job that could provide it." - from an aussie, that sounds pretty weird. "if you wanted insulin you should have picked a job that could provide it!" nah. you can have that.
they teach us what to look for, but it's quite difficult in practice to spot such things. to be honest, if this had been on my flight to houston two days ago, i'd have just thought the dude was a jerk, and she was shy.
when i worked as a park ranger i came across a couple (around 30) with two children (boy 7, girl 5) and what struck me as odd was the "parents" were disheveled, their clothes was older and worn, and they were obviously quite poor. nothing wrong with all that; however, the kids were well dressed, clean, much more articulate than the parents, and just didn't really fit. i spent hours looking through databases, making phone calls, and trying to find out something about an abduction that would match them. went and spent time with them, not uncommon as a ranger and came to realize... they were just good parents who did everything for their kids even when they couldn't do it for themselves.
yeah. aren't human traffickers not nice ppl? i'd stay anonymous, thanks.
he kidnapped and trafficked himself out of the country to avoid justice
sees girl going to bathroom, "excuse me darling, i need to check something in there real quick before you go in."
you know who are the clients of human traffickers? the richest people in the world (underage boys and girls are the most trafficked humans). you know who decides where the money will be focused on? the richest people in the world.
they're afraid of the person they're with, they have usually had a life where they couldn't trust anyone, they are broken down psychologically.
according to the article, this happened 6 years ago.
in the last airport i was in there were posters everywhere about signs of human trafficking, so this is probably more common than most people think.
yeah according to r/pics there are "15,000,000 photographers here" and by "photographers" they mean people who post shitty jpegs of people's headshots or pictures of signs
maybe its just a gut feeling that something seems off or amiss? a thousand tiny little indicators that cause you to unconsciously add up to a conclusion...and manifest in a gut feeling. recommended reading: the gift of fear by gavin debecker
i imagine he must've scared the girl so badly she didn't dare to do anything drastic in public.
honestly, kudos to those parents. because many parents don't have that drive or character to sacrifice everything for their kids to boost them up into a better place.
i feel like every time a parent tries to claim their kids are shitty, i immediately assume it's the parents who are the shitty ones.
but what if they shit themselves? those economy seats are so close together it'd ruin my purple pants and cane.
i've been boycotting all shrimp for a while. is there a way to get shrimp that is actually slavery free?
people most likely to be trafficked are those that won't be able to speak out. i worked with the national center for youth law on trafficking in oakland. the girls that i met were quiet, meek, abused. some had histories of abuse from when they were babies and have spent their lives under someone's thumb. those girls had seen people in their situations murdered. some have stories about friends who escaped only to be found later and brought back. it's always worst if you try to run so they don't try. it's really heartbreaking because my first thought when i met some of them was to ask why they don't run or scream when in public. because that's what i'd do. but after hearing their stories you understand why they are victims. they are broken down to submission.
i remember reading an article about a girl (like a 10 year old girl) who had been a victim of trafficking in india (i believe), and subsequently worked with police detecting traffickers. they said that she, more than anyone else, knew what questions to ask to ferret them out.
dude you're so closed minded you're not even thinking about the potential karma
i'll have you know, i saw taken 1,2 and 3 and traffickers don't mess around.
help! i'm being trafficked by my alternate personality!
i kinda assumed the attendant onpurposly spilled a drink all over the girl. maybe that's going too far on a hunch but getting her to go to the bathroom and read your note otherwise seems difficult in my head.
it says in the article she was able to signal to the girl to go to the bathroom after she had left the message on the mirror.
sorry, but no. you're not going to convince me that *all* the richest people in the world are into underage children. or even a sizeable proportion of them. most x are y does not mean most y are x.
i'm sure they weren't just picked off the street and put on a plane also. girls are probably groomed after months/years of being held somewhere else. now they're ready to make big money in america, after being trained with fear.
post shitty jpeg, "this is __________ , they did __________ " reddit explodes.
a good. giving instruction manuals telling telling the traffickers what not to do
i'm gonna go out on a limb and say that this is happens way more often than we think. i don't remember the name of the guy, but someone wrote a book about how these people would basically "brain hack" their victims. like, if you are in that situation, you feel like there is nothing you can do.
you're constantly around people in abusive, semi-hostage type situations. learning to hide that in public is a survival skill. if you try something and don't get help you face horrific retribution from your abuser. the vast majority of abuse victims will be able to hide it from you completely. if anything the fact that this girl didn't is a sign that she wasn't yet completely under the control of he captor. the story of elizabeth smart is a good example of how victims generally comport themselves in public.
my parents used to tell me they wouldn't buy me clothes because my sister was a girl and needed them more (plus they thought a little boy having more than 4 sets of clothes made them gay). i wonder if those kids knew how lucky they were.
ditto. i feel bad now about making fun of my dads old business suits. didn't appreciate that all of my sister and my clothes were from nordstrom and the gap (big deal in '94 in the small town i'm from). he traveled all the time and sacraficed everything for my sister and i. he also completely changed the entire trajectory of our family.
what's truly sad is how many people misunderstood this law as 'legalizing child prostitution' and are fighting against it, claiming that teenagers get involved willingly. absolutely disgusting and i had to stop visiting many california fb pages and forums due to it. i expect that many of these people are privileged types who have no real understanding of the issue and terminology.
i recently watched the killing season and they spoke about how police used to describe violence against prostitutes including rape and murder as "no human involved." luckily that is changing and there are many police officers, lawyers, and organizations who do care for these women and men and want to protect them. but it is reprehensible how common it is for society to view them as subhuman, worthless, and disposable.
bless you. and yes--just make sure the shrimp originates from canada or a similar country
alcohol abuse is extremely high under humanitarian workers. it has to do with seeing so much suffering, putting so much effort in for so little result. yes you can help some people but you get constantly confronted with the huge masses who you aren't able to help. the situation and world become quite hopeless when you try to change it.
the real tragedy is there are none. there are girls who choose to work as prostitutes because they come from poverty and have shitty families and there are girls who are forced to do it because they come from poverty and have shitty families. good look seeing the difference.
maybe she saw the girl (with the man beside her or not) waiting for/heading for the bathroom, and went in do check on supplies/leave a note before the girl went in (alone).
it says she tried to speak to them, so i guess she knew that the girl spoke english
seattle to san fran is like a one hour flight. i rarely see anybody get up at all on a flight like that. my guess is the flight attendant somehow suggested she go to the bathroom. not sure how
wow this was insightful. thanks. thanks for doing that work too. pretty cool of you. it actually reminds me of the movie martha marcy may marlene (i think that was the name). essentially even after escaping such a horrible event you're paranoid for the rest of your life thinking your captors are right around every corner. that's terrifying.
wow. the telling security you have a bomb is a good one. i'll keep that in my back pocket in case i ever catch myself in a kidnapping scenario.
yea. i didn't even think about the no weapon thing at first. literally the only thing they could do is try to harm you with their hands but i can't imagine an entire plane full of people sitting by and ignoring a man physically harming a young girl.
internet points are ever so *obviously* worth more than human life, especially my life. shower my dead body in karma!
that's got me thinking...do human traffickers like the taken franchise? nuts to think these fucking assholes are among normal people, and masquerade as normal folks daily
have you reported your suspicions to the local police?
...by m. night shyamalan, in theaters this december.
what's the universal signal for going to the bathroom?
fear and drugs. get them hooked on heroin while controlling all of their money. the trafficker will give them the drugs for free and suddenly they have no option but to follow them around work for their next fix. combine that with physical violence, emotional abuse, and tell them nobody will believe them even if they did go to the authorities. people are fucked.
we just need more paranoid, negative thinking snoopy people in the world.
huge sporting events and large conventions always become hot-zones for human trafficking. my guess is that it is because you have huge numbers of (lets be honest) men who are traveling away from home with friends or alone on business and make for good customers to sex workers.
not to mention most people see the abuse as a domestic thing that is none of their business of if there is an age gap and really young girl its the father just disciplining the daughter. the bystander effect of thinking if its really something bad someone else will do something about it
i remember reading that if a certain south eastern european mafia type gang kidnap you for sex slavery, then if you escape or get rescued your family gets brutally murdered. i also remember reading that in rural russia, the gang would march into a home where there was more than one daughter, brazenly take one of them and say if the family make any attempts to get her back, then they, or other gang members will just come back and take the rest. people are the worst.
why do people keep misspelling clothes in this thread?
it's not hard because sometimes the kid is really just throwing a fit. it's hard because most of the time its a kid just throwing a fit.
true, but still will be an embarrassing situation when one of your kids gets smart ass enough to yell that even when it is you.
hey, i don't even like shrimp. bless me too, right? :p
but also that the girl refused to engage in conversation, so she probably didn't know.
yes, she could have. she had reasonable suspicion that something was up. police would have investigated further.
"here's your sprite, miss. and if you need to use the restroom, i know soda makes me need to go, there's a restroom right back there. i'd suggest the one on the left because the one on the right is always dirty. the one on the left has a note on the mirror for you asking if this guy you're with is a dangerous kidnapping rapist too, so use that one."
yeah that's a pretty good one, going to be my new go-to plan my old go-to plan was running as fast as i can in random directions screaming "fucking help me" if i knew the guy had a gun or a long ranged weapon of some kind i'd run into the biggest crowd of people (i'm sorry i just want to live)
yes, but that's eastern europe. i'm from albania (which the traffickers from all taken's were from), and it's very fucked up. the movies are definitely not exaggerations (except for the action shots), in fact, real life human trafficking in eastern europe is worse than the movies depict at times.
i'd like to think the flight attendant "accidentally" spilled some beverage on the girl so she would have to go to the bathroom to clean up.
i don't know how to feel about you posting the recipe here.
can confirm, i work in a hotel near cleveland, over the rnc we were told specifically to look for these signs. it's a big thing.
people who use the services of trafficking victims rarely know that the service provider is in bondage. humans are not only trafficked into the sex trade. they are housekeepers, nannies, landscapers, back of house restaurant staff, manicurists, etc.
it wasn't just your neighborhood. that shit fucked with the whole country. fuckin media.
being terrified. she was probably screaming it on the inside.
i know right! it's only a slight bother as i never expect much from the internet but i'm really surprised at how frequently the mistake has been made now
hipsters aren't really disheveled. their dishevelment is curated.
i would add, as a young and single person, i was honestly surprised how hard it was to tell between "fake" crying and legit "im in pain" crying. took a long while to recognize that half pitch down less sharp scream that is a kid just being an asshole.
i think you're supposed to post there too. who wants free karma?
i'm still confused. so, the flight attendant leaves a note in the bathroom? how is she aware that the girl is going to be the next one to use it? why does the bad guy let the girl use the restroom? (i guess so he doesn't get peed on). is the girl on the way to the bathroom (and the flight attendant knows which one) and then the flight attendant jumps in the bathroom, leaves the note, comes out of the restroom, the girl uses it, writes a note, then the flight attendant goes back in, gets the note? there's actually part of this story that still has holes in my head.
article says she was 14. maybe you should try it in that age range more
well the pilots reached out to sfpd so its not like the cops wouldnt be waiting at the gate anyways. also they could just land at the gate and not let anyone off the plane
the only furniture that makes me go are tables. sofas make me constipated.
it's usually scheduled for 2 hours 15 minutes but almost every time i've taken that flight we've landed 15-30 minutes early. source: live in sf area, family is in seattle.. i make that trip a lot.
read the story up thread where two girls were kidnapped, and the one who fought was burned alive on a beach as a warning to the other. people willing to traffic young girls are also very willing to kill to get away with it.
i hope they dont share this information... what if it's something they're taught in training to subtly do this and we're giving information to human traffickers and they watch out for it?
i mean, this is kinda smart. would it be smart to put a small notepad & dropbox in high-traffic transportation-related washrooms, or a panic button? seems like it would cover a lot of situations. then again, people are dicks.
the amount of prostitutes in northern michigan when deer hunting starts also escalates tremendously.
had the same in kansas city during the world series
the city is packed during these games. it's hard to notice things like a child disappearing from a crowd. the super bowl is one of the biggest days for human trafficking, because they're are so many people in one place. it's like hiding a tree in a forest.
yup, emotion trumps reason. that's why everyone is scared of terrorism but not human drivers. actual statistics and data mean shit
curated dishevelment is the name of my death jazz band.
am a father. can confirm, i keep important stuff in my sock drawer.
yeah, it's something you pick up really quickly once you have a kid. there's an almost primal element to a pain scream. i almost don't even hear crying anymore; it's completely white noise. but a cry of pain makes my gut drop and the hairs on my neck stand up. i think pretty much everyone reacts this way because it's just something you know, but you don't realize it until you're used to hearing "fake" crying so often.
haha baskets are also a marketing tactic. you tend to buy more if you're given a basket. so a lot of sales people are told to give everyone a basket since it deters shoplifting and gets you to buy more stuff. these are usually places that have lots of little items like boutiques for jewelry or makeup like claire's or sephora.
thank you but i will just leave it, i like the irony i'm like somebody losing an eye while trying to make fire
apparently she managed to tell the girl, under her breath, to go to the bathroom, at which point she left a note and the girl went and found it.
you wouldn't happen to be well dressed by any chance?
i believe this particular incident preceded the training given to flight attendants regarding human trafficking. as for what she did in this instance it wasn't specified in the article. in any case it wouldn't be too hard to indicate with a quick and discrete head nod to silently direct a person to go toward the bathroom on a small plane.
if you did these things they would quickly be figured out and the traffickers would avoid them.
now that everyone knows about that i wonder if it still works
really? they hang in the cheap motels up in hunting areas perhaps?
i used to work in a hotel in a big city. the general manager of the place turned a blind eye to most illegal things that happened there because he was far more interested in the profit from having more guests/customers. we were told not to rock the boat, even for obvious and very illegal shit. this fucker perpetuated the whole problem with rich people getting away with whatever they want. we were, however, instructed to bring the hammer down (when the occasion called for it, not just randomly) on guests who were not wealthy/famous/did not spend as much. an even more fun story is that the gm hates snoop dogg, because it took our housekeepers over a month to get the weed smell out of the entire fourth floor. apparently snoop rented a whole floor to himself, and in true d-o-double g fashion, smoked it right the fuck out. my hero.
very true! a lot of hotels don't do ppv anymore since the services cost too much and most people get their porn online, but any time they are there, huge increase in rentals. porn hub also reports the same thing with the rnc and any big religious event in online views as well. :) eta: rnc also sees huge increase in male escort services' revenue. one of my favorite fun facts. :) though this one is harder to prove given the nature of the business.
i think robert pattinson once used the phrase "pretentious dishevelment".
tell me more of this "white noise" that you've managed to turn regular crying into. i have a baby who is now 6 months old and even her non-pain cries shred my soul like a rusty cheese grater. how do i make it white noise? please help me.
and when i hunt for a basket, i can never find one! /cue me carrying everything from a candle to body wash to dog poo bags to a box of wine glasses last week at tj maxx.
wait, you're not guy noticing that's not username checks out guy. what did you do with him and username checks out guy?!
i would throw myself at a "fiscal conservative" movement that actually advocated fiscal conservatism instead of whatever the hell is going on with the republicans
it took me 122 comments to finally find this. gracias.
says she put it in the toilet?! so this girl just randomly went looking for a note inside the toilet? i'm confused.
it's news because from what i gathered, the lady herself is now leading classes for stewardesses (and stewards?) to be able to also catch these warning signs, that were specifically given before the super bowl.
are we still in character here? is this the human trafficker trying to correct her?
right, and that would send pretty much everyone to the bathroom but she had put up a note for one particular person.
yeah, i was thinking the same thing. from now on they would probably either stay away from planes or ensure the kid never leaves their side for any reason whatsoever. it's such a dark world out there, bums me out
of course it is, but you're missing the point. if he had prevented her from going then they wouldn't have received the confirmation they needed to intervene. regardless of how 'weird' it was, they needed a firm confirmation that she was in trouble. so i'm curious how she was able to be smooth enough to get the guy to allow her to go to the bathroom, not because i doubt anything, only because i'm fascinated.
and think about all the petulant children who would hit the button because they are mad at their parents.
you underestimate the level of conditioning in some kids. not from anything nefarious, violent, or pressuring, just the fact that they've been soaking in a natural order of things with parents and authority figures being the guides and authorities all their life, and they're not worldly or clever enough to realize they can step outside of the lines. it's just not on the conceptual map.
some (many) what motel owners know and accept that there will be prostitutes working there.
that snoop dogg story is cute but literally zero chance that is not a massive exaggeration.
what the hell. she needs to see someone. that is sad.
this sub is so depressing, and so full of hope and healing. just knowing you're not crazy or alone, sometimes gives you a thread of sanity to hold onto, until you can gtf out of the situation.
well, once they're 2 and no longer depend on you to stay alive on a minute-to-minute basis it's a lot easier not to worry about every cry. also being the dad and having a wife that is exclusively breastfeeding helps for infants, if you haven't tried that.
you can come to my show tomorrow night where i will be retelling this tale of everyday heroism through interpretive dance
in the uk they refer to the restroom as "the toilet".
as the prophecy foretold, there will be seven. not one more. not one less. will there be a hero amongst us who will come forward and, with courage and braverie, be ready and willing to be burdened with the responsibility of an answer? "so the flight attendant just left a note in the bathroom and hoped the victim went to the bathroom and saw it?"
you're right - it's a plausible out. however, the number of people creative and bold enough to do what this flight attendant did, i think, isn't too high. she's amazing!
i meant she could say it to the child and guardian without raising suspicion. it's not unusual for an fa to check up on or pay special attention to kids, flying can be scary for them.
the world is safer today than it's ever been in the history of mankind. because of the media sensationalizing terrible, but very rare events, our fear assessment of the world is completely out of whack.
very true. your comment made me realise somehow that this girl is very lucky to have had a language in common with the flight attendant.
exactly. as a kid, it's hard to distinguish what you can and can't say no to. you can say no to the sweater but try saying no to going to school and see how that goes.
yeah, i guess nothing short of a legal requirement to document property is going to be any more effective than a community driven app.
i wish she would but shes convinced every one that shes ok. when a person convinces every one that they're not the issue but "every one else is" it's pretty tough, lived in a echo chamber for some time now.
ikr i would have followed up on it but i was living at her place at the time so she was looking for a good reason to kick me out.
can someone give me a tl;dw of the dance when he's done?
he must have been a false prophet because having that very same question is the only reason i ventured into the comments.
seriously though the way he does a reverse summersault and flips his legs back like that. that's some serious shit right there.
5. re-assess and identify secondary threat 6. adjust momentum and reprioritize body position 7. lunge toward in-coming debris 8. use body to shield children from secondary threat time elapsed: 2.8 seconds.
i'm surprised i had to scroll this far down to see this asked. first thing i noticed after the dodge, was that the kid in the white looked knocked out.
you can see him pause for thought. he made the right choice and saved their lives.
can someone shop this gif so that the car crash never happens and he simply suplexes the kids?
might've heard the car getting closer than it should be, squealing tires, maybe they were honking?
wow, dude. that's a rough way to find out that his wife has been sleeping around.
the adrenaline rush that comes with thinking that your kids are in real danger is like nothing else i've ever experienced. it really is the mental equivalent of being clark kent when he rips that shirt open to reveal the superman emblem underneath.
someone else in the thread posted a slightly longer video of this. the guy hands off the kid in white to another person and the kid is conscious and looking around. if he did get knocked out, it was only for a fraction of a second.
for all you know the driver is unconscious from an undiagnosed medical condition.
any slower and this video would have been on liveleak.com.
and then right out of his roll he blocks the debris from slamming into them too. just incredible.
can confirm, dad reflexes are insane. source: am a father, and i caught my 8 month old son behind my back (without looking) as he rolled off his changing table when i turned to get a diaper. heard the sound of baby moving, instinctively knew what was going on.
holy shit! i was so impressed by the first part that i didn't even notice the second move. dad level off the charts.
how exactly do you see yourself in the context of this thread?
i think the split second of weakness is a split second of him formulating exactly what he is going to do. i have 2 young kids, and i've had many dad reflexes, and there is no hesitation when it comes to your kids. it's purely instinct and, unless something in you is broken, irresistible.
also looked like the man's leg might have gotten hit. hope they were all ok!
probably got his bell rung, but he's not crushed. as you well know, small children are amazingly resilient.
i wonder if they're his own kids or he risked his life for someone else's kids. either way he's a hero.
i think it's him trying to figure out which way the car is going. kind of like the way a defender in soccer/football will shift back and forth when the guy they're defending is giving them head fakes and weaving back and forth. he hears the car, turns around, processes the moment, then when he realizes they're in danger he drops down into the crouch, starts moving towards the kids, and is trying to figure out which way he should run with them to avoid the car.
as god is my witness, he broke their likelihood of dying *in half!!!*
probably. had his buddy crash into the place so he could do that move and impress the chicks
and the second guy was so smooth, like "ain't no thang."
this is true. i raised 4 boys, they're in their 20s now, and i can definitely say that hyper-awareness is a real thing. also, i would take a nap, but i could hear all the stuff going on in the background and could be up and in action in less than a second if need be.
i wouldn't be surprised, his brain looked at the car and computed "this is it, only dreams now"
the older i've gotten the more i realize this. people can be exceptional in the moment and still go home and be pieces of shit that night. best demonstrated by famous altruistic figures later being exposed as having very seedy hidden private lives. everytime someone claims something is "pure evil" we get that much farther away from real progress.
this is like the fight scene in the sherlock holmes movie
twist: man tries to kidnap children while driver tries to serve up hot justice.
i'm glad he posted it, but is a vertical cell phone video of a widescreen recording really the best footage of this that made it online?
you see the other dad sprint out of the way, away from his kid, if so.
this was seriously a "do i shove them out of the way to the left, or do i grab them and roll right" moment
yeah i figured it was this. they didn't look like they were with him before the car came. they were walking by and he doesn't look like he was watching them intently.
i mean they were at least better than being dead. so just imagine they're ok considering that's a step up.
human weight: 80 kgs car weight: 1,500 kgs i think i would also rather have the dude who saved my life sit on my head.
i feel like this is one of the most badass things i've ever seen someone do.
"hmm, what's the best way to fucking crush this move?"
it was obviously a "is that car gonna turn?....its not gonna turn." moment.
to be fair, it was probably both. judging whether or not you have time to do anything and judging which direction the car is going.
and the lives of those children's parents, if you think about it.
i was having a good day, but this comment ruined it, then thinking how the dad was so great brought it back
$10 and my childhood says this happened accidentally before and now the kid does it regularly. because when you're a kid you never think "oh shit i could have been hurt if dad wasn't there" you just think "awesome i can try to do a backflip off the swing set and i won't get hurt."
i love how when he first leaves the frame he looks so nonchalant. he made the switch from flat foot to track star in a snap.
yeah, bringing the car to a sudden stop, after it hits the toddler, and forcing the "driver's" head into the steering wheel. that's what i see myself doing.
we used to play a fun game with my dad whenever he would fall asleep in the chair where we would make background noise for awhile (which he'd sleep through) and every once in awhile sprinkle in "help!". as a kid, it was the most entertaining thing ever to watch him bolt up out of the chair, 100% awake, looking for the source of distress. now i realize we were kind of asshole kids. but good job, dad.
"that ninja is going to steal those children. i want to help..... but i don't want to get out of my car."
yeah he was just trying to find the best solution. there's nothing about the way he acts that ever hints at "run" to me.
not a parent, not even that coordinated, but i was babysitting once and the 4-year-old climbed up on the back of the couch behind me. i realized something was wrong, whipped around, and grabbed his ankle as he took a header off the couch. stopped him like an inch before he would've cracked his skull into the stone floor.
yeah, he looks way too relaxed beforehand. you can definitely tell he wasn't having to deal with two kids in that moment.
agreed. i hit my knee while scooting up to my desk going a velocity of 2mph in my rolling chair. i definitely cried.
it definitely is. that backflip roll while holding the two kids is fucking nuts. this guy needs a dad payroll raise.
yeah "is it going to miss? please miss. nope, gotta go in".
and the lives of those children's children, if you think about it.
sounds like you need to get your life sorted mate
i don't even know how he managed considering the size of his balls.
which is exactly why i let my kid fall if i don't think he'll be seriously hurt. trying to summersault over the arm of the couch? if i catch you then you're going to think that happens every time then actually get hurt when i'm not there. hit your head? well now you know that doing that hurts, don't do it again.
gee thanks mom! i didn't get a scratch on me let alone broken arms but whatevs.
sensible when a ninja is involved. if samurai had subarus instead of sashimono, the balance of real ultimate power might have shifted.
i think it was more of a "can i drop-kick through the windshield, grab the wheel and turn the car fast enough? -- no, i can't hit the brake from that position. guess i'll grab them instead."
hell yeah. something in our nature tells us to go out if our way to protect children. it's stronger, perhaps, as a parent, but when you're with a kid your mentality changes.
that's when you just start sending their family unprompted emails of things like the ps4, a new tv, etc. "hope the family is ok. what do you guys think of the ps4? never played one myself but it seems pretty awesome."
and the driver, he saved them from possible life in jail.
what's even more impressive is that he did that shit in fucking sandals. the feet shuffling, grabbing the kids, doing a backroll and maneuvering while keeping the sandals on is some next level dad shit.
now, if i watch a movie where some dude save lives by shoving people out of the way i'll be like pfft, mother fucker should have grabbed and rolled.
yeah, you don't want to be the guy who pile-drove two kids for a car that *didn't* smash through.
there doesn't have to be a goal in mind when you're getting up to redneck shit.
then make them top heavy and remove all abdominal strength
he slipped that kid a $10 for taking a prat fall.
if you have enough kids they'll eventually start taking care of *eachother*. the trick is not to stop at "too many" and push right on through so it wraps back around to "enough" ______________________ also 3 kids isn't a particularly large number
here's another weird thing. we spread that to other species and treat them as extended children. the pets we coddle and take in just for our own need to express affection and nurturing are an extension of an overdriven parental and altruistic traits.
a hero is any man that does his job. otherwise, he's probably a bozo.
"i wish someone would save a ps4 from the shelves..."
or in 5th edition, his passive perception was high enough to hear the car, then he rolled higher initiative than the car, succeeded on two dc 10 grapples and rolled two natural 20s on his acrobatics check (with disadvantage because he was holding kids) to get out of the way.
probably could've been holding a beer and not spilled a drop too
someone should offer him a ~~role~~ roll in an action movie.
i doubt he knows how to do it either, he just did it
he should get it put on tape with "the closer" written on it. at the end of a date he nods toward thr bartender who presses play on a tv abovr the bar. yada yada yada
on the other hand, just think how entertaining this clip would be sans the car.
i actually quite like fifth. it's got an elegant trim as far as rules, without sacrificing all too much. definitely a hell of a lot better than 4, which was dnd in name only.
he's a master strategist, attacking when you're most defenseless.
i was standing around 6 or 7 feet from the top of my stairs and i see my son, about 18mos old, wonder towards the edge. in a split second he takes a step and is gone. without having any idea what i was doing, i leaped headfirst down the stairs from where i was standing. i managed to grab him halfway down the stairs before shit got real bad for him. when i realized what happened, i was laying headfirst in the middle of the stairs holding my son against the stairs. i'm still amazed at what i did whenever i'm standing in that spot looking at the stairs. seems impossible.
do people not like 5th? i haven't played any other editions but from what i can tell 5e is fantastic. the older versions just sound extremely convoluted, especially 3.5 with the something like 200 classes or whatever.
that's some sun tzu level strategy right there. appear weak when you are strong, appear strong when you are weak.
i hope you bought a baby gate or whatever they're called after that. can't count on being there every time.
sounds like the optimal amount of alcohol? not too drunk, but enough that the "i can't do this" centers are distracted.
"officers please this man suplexed two kids right as a car was coming he is a maniac"
5e is like walking out the back of your house on a perfect autumn afternoon, onto your back porch with your favorite beverage in hand that has finally been prepared right. you can smell wood smoke on the crisp air; and the insanity of 3.5e and 4e still inside the house fades into quiet as the door shuts behind you. you take a deep sip, and sigh in contentment as you finally get to relish in the 2e experience with a more streamlined rule system.
when the pants are down and shit flowing attack with your full forces.
my wife's "excited" scream is this shriek that makes your heart race and the hair stand up on the back of your neck because you immediately assume someone is about to die. the last time it happened we were in the car...we had to have a talk after that.
lol, hindsight. anyone who has actually payed attention to hillary the last 30 years knew she couldn't win against a wet towel. some thought a orange toupee was shit enough to win against, but it wasn't. it was not even a minority opinion of bernie supporters that this is what would happen. this is the same story i've been hearing since february at least. it was prophesied in fire in the sky but hillary supporters couldn't see what was in front of their face.
it's not just fptp but a half dozen issues that are absolutely core to the rules by which the game of politics is played. money in politics, redistricting, fptp and not a multi party system, the electoral college instead of a straight vote, anti democratic policies abound that favor the 2 established parties. the whole bit must go.
**democrats are burning for not feeling the bern**
i said something similar. at the time, i'd conceded that hillary might even make a better president than obama. but, like you, it was obvious to me that she could never win a general election. she would have lost against dole, dubya, mccain, or romney... not a doubt in my mind. i thought trump might be able to take her down, but the "grab them by the pussy" video, i thought, was the end of him. nope. that's how much republicans hate her. they'll even take the sort-of-rapey guy over her.
they already collected their checks for their online manipulation "job"
this. i'm historically conservative and i can't stand trump but hillary was just too corrupt. as a conservative if it came down to trump or bernie. i'd choose bernie simply because he seemed like a real earnest guy with america's best interest at heart. trump not so much.
.democrats were arrogant after they turfed bernie . people don't want the establishment anymore . voters for trump by in large are just ordinary people fed up with the establishment and democrats entrenched them by belittling them at every turn . you became the establishment they fought against.
yet alone doing this while also pushing this ridiculous "misogynistic bernie bros" bullshit at the same time.
and they will all walk off into the sunset with their money bags wondering how everyone else messed things up.
they deserve to lose. but we don't. and we have to pay for their bullshit actions.
as a non-american, who knows jack shit about elections in usa, how was it rigged? and if you are kind enough to explain it to me, i'd also ask you not to use acronyms, i'm likely not familiar with them. thanks
that's very well put. she lost to *trump* for fuck's sake. a novelty candidate.
for all the hillary supporters who called me an idiot every time i said they were going to get trump elected. who's the idiot?
same here, never donated before in my life and i loved obama. i hope dws sees an end of her political career and a future in "would you like fries with that?"
it really was sickening seeing how truly desperate she was to win, with bernie it felt like he was in it for us and not himself
i'd love to say i told you so also, but if trump wins it looks like republicans are going to have the majority in the house, senate, and the president. that's new levels of scary i didn't really even consider happening tonight.
knives are being readied in the dnc now i hope. two years of this then a berniecrat landslide in the midterms.
they wanted hillary at any costs. elect clinton or die tryin'
i didn't agree with everything he had to say certainly, but out of anybody it seemed like he genuinely wanted to improve the country.
some networks have already called wisconson for trump
i thought the gop hated trump and tried their hardest to replace him up to the primaries? it was only when he threatened to run as a 3rd party that he was able to wrangle the party into submission?
republican have to take the blame for trump winning their primaries by stoking their base with misinformation, and democrats have to take the blame for letting trump win the election by being corrupt and neglecting their base causing them to not show up. both parties fucked up. this is wholesale rejection of the current state of politics. this is what happens when you don't listen to the voters. i'm not saying any of this is the smart thing to do, but desperate people do desperate things.
what if trump gets sworn in and then immediately resigns...and explains how he only ran to prove he could win & to save america from the clintons
you really think the same people that stole the election from him would let him decide the budget. seriously? still?
goddamn idiots. theyve ruined things for my children. we could have made real strides! we could have left parts of the past behind!
watching the blow-by-blow i reveld in how uncomfortable people like chuck todd were when it came time to anonce another state went to trump. he's a shit candidate but, watching this whole shit show crash and burn in front of them is satisfying to watch.
good morning, hope you aren't too fucked up from last night. the shilling was bad. they pulled funding, you can immediately see because of this 20000+ upvoted post.
i'd have liked an o'malley v kasich debate. they both seem like reasonable people who can articulate their points and have a meaningful, rational discussion.
bernie would have been a proud standard bearer of fdr & jfk's party. hillary has no place standing among great leaders.
the dnc, team clinton and the white house spent *years* making sure that clinton would be the nominee.
remember when he won the michigan primary and it was very unexpected?
the thing that bothers me to no end is that this was such a winnable election. there are hundreds of reasons why she lost, but the fact is had she spent her time campaigning versus fundraising, when you look at the margin she lost by, she could have. when was the last time she was in wisconsin? yet all you hear from mainstream dems and her is that the same electorate that twice elected obama was too racist and sexist to elect her.
during the primaries i tried to explain to hillary supporters that if she was nominated, that republicans wouldn't just crawl over broken glass to vote against her, you could set that broken glass on fire and they would still do it, with a smile on their face. i knew republicans and independents that were so excited to vote for bernie. not one of them would have even considered clinton. this was in n.c., btw.
the record has been correc- oops, wait, she lost and is an idiot along with the entire system that put her in place to do so. way to go dnc and media! you'll handwave and try to blame someone else, but we're tired of your bullshit rhetoric, obviously. you can't do that shit and talk shit to us and expect us to then bow down and back you. see all this? this is your fault - fuck off. this is the result of astroturfing and subreddits being flooded with fake narratives and bullshit. it all comes crumbling down because it's fucking lies.
dnc did, i think. nobody wanted to support the establishment by electing their people
that's exactly it. i think that if you want a silver lining on the trump victory everyone can share in it that us citizens have said no to dynasties in government and no to the biased media.
yeah she came in with ankle weight of whatever the fuck she was doing before on her. she looked to have a great lead then that email thing came up again and it crashed down. she had so much hanging over her from before the election and then it fell.
oh they know exactly what happened. the money bags they walk off with is proof that they were working with others to ensure bernie, the only eligible candidate for presidency, doesn't get elected.
an openly misogynistic, racist with **zero** political experience. yeah, hillary screwed the pooch big time.
today's been brilliant. i have finally gotten over all the negative karma i had in all the political subs so i can comment more than once a half hour.
it was such a gimme too... it was on a silver platter for the taking.
remember when people thought the dnc didn't collude with clinton? :)
the thing that made me register democrat and try to get bernie as the candidate was when i saw that he voted against the 2008 patriot act. the guy believes in large government (which isn't necessarily something i agree with) but still was able to recognize that the patriot act was a trick and harmful to the people. that says so much to me about his interest in politics.
as a johnson voter, i would have voted for him instead.
everyone is waiting. i suspect that tomorrow morning, people nationwide are going to start mobilizing to put berniecrats into local government.
wisconsinite here, bernie won! dnc, you think you might have fucked yourselves by cheating the guy who won in my state?
they don't care. they were willing to risk it, because bernie doesn't play ball with the establishment.
not to mentions likely two, possibly three, supreme court justice nominees.
na. they'll close ranks. if anyone leaves it'll be to some cushy roll in banking, lobbying etc...
haha i think we're all going to die... *begins sobbing*
yep. the point is control by the establishment. bernie is not on their team. a bernie victory in the general is a loss for the dnc.
a fucking republican trifecta with trump holding the reins. oh, ya don't forget the now republican supreme court. this is it... hold me.
fuck the stupid fucking dnc. i've been a registered republican for nearly 20 years and i changed my affiliation so i could vote for bernie in the primary. the dnc fucked their own party by rigging the primary and even helping push trump into the republican nomination because he'd be an easy foe. this is what you get you stupid fucking twats. i voted for gary johnson because fuck trump and fuck hilary - you smarmy bitches.
can somebody weigh in on the wisconsin vote here? is there a large city waiting to be counted?
except right now it looks like both houses of congress are going to go to the republicans.
the gop hates trump. many americans outside of the coasts liked trumps fuck the establishment mentality. plus a wet fart could have probably beat hillary in this election. dnc shouldn't have intentionally screwed over bernie.
i mean honestly the dnc has known for decades that the public hates hillary. they tried to force her down our throats anyway. they could have picked any other party stooge (or bernie) and they would have won in a landslide.
then we have mike pence in control of the house, the senate, the supreme court, and the presidency.
amazing how quiet /r/politics is in regards to her.
right and look at them now, biting their nails because hillary is behind. it's almost comical.
bernie vs kasich would have been fantastic in my book. bernie vs trump has a nice symmetry to it in that they represent productive and unproductive solutions to anti-establishment, but with a bern vs kasich race i would have been fine with either winning.
absolutely. the problem is that their game plan is to be 1% less repugnant than the gop and therefore 'the lesser of two evils'. this was the anti-establishment election and amazingly the gop showed integrity that the democrats did not by honoring the wishes of their electorate.
after this there will be a large amount of dems who feel disenfranchised after they had not one, but two of their votes considered null and void that they will likely not vote again for a very long time if ever. that is what the dnc did to their own party by forwarding a "champion" that no one wanted.
shit, they'd set it on fire themselves just to enjoy letting clinton supporters know how much pain they'll put themselves through to make sure she never reaches office.
dnc fucked everything up. trump will most likely win and its the dncs fault.
exactly. you hit the nail on the head. so many of us would have voted for bernie, but didn't because we felt betrayed and disliked hillary
fox news would have found (or made up) dirt for sure, but bernie still would have won. bernie's funny because he owns the socialist label, which makes it less effective an attack.
exactly. her smug attitude towards voters, her taking states for granted that she thought she had locked, and her obviously lying about her email server is what did her in.
they really couldn't help themselves. always looking for a way to twist the knife.
he had no organization, he was at war with the party, he was outspent big-time, ugh.
i'm with you on that. i love bernie but 79 that's a little too old. gabbard 2020!!
points to you for being honest. sadly, you've been vindicated.
yea he recognizes that "big government" and "effective government" are two minutely but critically different concepts.
i doubt it, i think after tomorrow people will just start bitching about trump and wait for the next election.
anyone not named clinton would have won in a landslide. imagine what the numbers would like if the ticket was sanders/warren.
yep. joke's on them. there's no way they don't clean house over there. they all deserve to get fired in shame.
that is the real nightmare. he could very well cause the overturning roe v wade. something i'm continually amazed is still a battleground.
seriously. give me some actual fucking change. let's shake this shit hole up. i'm a libertarian leaning person, but would have voted for bernie just to see what one extreme would do with healthcare. enough of this quasi bullshit. give me a true free market or give me universal healthcare. stop giving me this spineless bullshit system.
yeah this could be very bad. i don't want a party controlled government.
thank you. i am so goddamn angry at the dnc. the party deserves to burn for this one, as far as i'm concerned. as a lifelong bernie supporter, i can tell you i feel the sting like you talk about. the dnc fucked us all over, real good. i'm no hippie, but science is science - i really, honestly don't think the planet can withstand the climate-denying policies (and non-policies) a trump administration brings. at least with hillary she could be convinced to act, if not boldly lead. with this guy .... fuck. this outcome is sad and depressing on sobering and profound levels. it means we are our last option, so my suggestion to you is to get involved. /r/political_revolution has good resources, but so does your city hall. join a committee, bring and make some friends - real things can get done. good luck.
yup, if the republicans had put anyone else up i'd probably have voted for them just to avoid another clinton presidency. if sanders had been up on the dem side, i probably would have voted for him over anyone else. i say this as someone who has never voted for a democrat, and generally has a policy of voting against all democrats.
it won't. i thought *this* would be the year of the 3rd party candidate. with a full republican government i see them getting a lot done (for better or for worse) and many republicans will be enthralled and happily reelect them all in 4 years.
because uneducated masses are what big business want and all the uneducated masses are trending more and more conservative
that's what really scares me. there's a very real chance that trump will do something to get impeached, or otherwise be deemed unfit to serve, at which point pence takes over. just look at his history as the governor of indiana to see why that would be scary.
i'd be a little nervous for education had kasich become president...but that seems like child's play based on current choices
not a trump fan at all, but his anti establishment stance was tempting. i really wish i could have voted for bernie again.
i think that this time around it's less of the left-right spectrum rather than just putting up a good, honest candidate. in the year of the anti-establishment sentiment, hillary is not likely to do well at all.
"at any cost" - brazile everytime i was polled in the last 2 weeks i said they could have my vote if they canned brazile.
neither of these candidates personal quirks decided this election. this election was the result of people feeling disillusioned by their governments. this was a way of rejecting the "establishment" for many (despite many congressman holding their seats, so i guess we're fine with *that* establishment) but now it's the hard part: he has to run the establishment.
and within hours, he will be the next president of the united states.
he said he'd only run if he thinks he's in good enough health. if he thinks so, i'll hop in board.
*cuts to black screen ohhhh sorry, we must of lost our live feed with the_strat.
the size of it is irrelevant to me, it needs to be as big, or small, as it needs to be. i want to know how it functions, now arbitrarily grow _or_ shrink. undoubtedly many different parts need different action, you can't just flatly go "all need be smaller" and expect success.. but it's great rhetoric.
i already know 2 people that became seriously involved in running for local office immediately after seeing the bullshit caucus experience. shit, **i'll** run, there's dozens of local and regional positions. something needs to change and it starts in our backyards.
all the populism and working class support of donald trump without the sexism, xenophobia and policy disaster. moderates already hate trump enough to not vote for him, progressives love bernie. 3rd party shoved out of the race because bernie's already pretty much 3rd party. this would be a very different election.
"the clinton campaign were all doing an endzone dance while they were only on the 50 yard line." prescient.
think about what this means for the fighting climate change. the environment will be one big casualty to this. if we weren't already past the point of no return, we certainly will be now. it's going to be time for an end game strategy.
the only silver lining here is a satisfaction that they reap what they sow.
it's, uh, on all of them. kaine, schultz, clinton, belize...all been planning this, working towards this, since obama got the nomination in 2007. no other option considered, no contingency plan made. the same hubris and short-sightedness that lost the democrats the senate will cost them this election.
exactly. if obama wasn't the second coming of jesus for blacks then what would hillary be? turns out blacks were a lot less on the clinton side than ever before and it showed in the polls.
as a gun owner in a closed-primary state, i urged undecided democrat friends to vote for bernie, and would have happily voted for him over trump. could not bring myself to vote for hillary over trump.
exactly. careful what you wish for, you just might get it. honestly, i thought hillary had this one. i voted for gary johnson, but in a choice between the two, it's trump for me. why? i believe in the second amendment, and she's always been against gun ownership. she even said that she thought individuals owning guns was the wrong decision for heller vs. dc. i'm also in it, and as soon as her email scandal hit, every time she opened her mouth, i knew it 100% right away it was bullshit. she's hiding something, and the next few months or years are going to be hell on earth, as i expect president trump to assign a special prosecutor for her.
i think 2020 bernie is probably healthier then trump now
valid arguments but i don't see who else the berniecrats will turn to. aside from that. justin trudau is only 44. i think being a young, hip, and energetic candidate could be an advantage.
clinton couldn't beat trump.. donald fucking joke trump. do not blame third party voters msnbc. this is such a shit show that i saw coming from months away.
same. the use of that phrase shows, that even after all this, they are still negative of bernie. bought and paid for by the dnc. at least they're loyal to their masters.
i am so close to running for something. i literally would have no idea what to do but that didn't stop trump.
have faith in the brightest minds of human kind. science and economics will find a way. the days of accessible greener (and cheaper) energy may be closer than you think.
oh fucking boy kay, well, britain actually managed to basically save themselves from brexit, it seems. do we have any realistic mechanisms to alleviate this damage?
yeah. "just following orders" hasn't been an acceptable excuse for 70 years
i think professorpulp means wasserman wouldn't even be there if she wasn't on clinton's side. the clinton/new democrat wing of the democratic party has been the strongest force within it since the 90s. obama was on good enough terms with them and a lot more popular than clinton. sanders wasn't. he was an independent before the election, and was too left for their centrist ways, so they put all of their energy behind clinton, yet she still barely beat sanders, someone very few americans really knew anything about before the primaries.
by the "used to" measure democrats won this one because trump used to be a democrat. tulsi is a very, very good choice.
obama would've been an entirely different president if he had governed the same way he campaigned.
i can understand that, i would have definitely got out and voted tonight if bernie had been the candidate. with so much shit swirling around hillary and so many backwards liberals trying to lift her up upon the presidential pedestal, it just left me with an awful taste in my mouth.
probably, bernie still jogs daily, and he was much healthier than either of the other two this year, if he keeps it it it shouldn't be too hard unless he gets some illness.
i really, really fucking hoping this is a wake up call for 2020. trump, if anything, has to be a warning to history of what happens when you try to force the liberal vote through a funnel. a lying, corrupt, funnel.
i genuinely appreciate your optimism in an ever darkening hour. for some of us hope is all we have to cling to, right now.
well, a lot of us can individually be fine. i could move to canada, or latin america, or any one of a number of places. i don't really want to though. but the environment is shared by all of us. don't count on electric cars and solar panels being leading industries in the states. they will exist, but not with the subsidies the oil, gas and coal industries will get. there definitely won't be any cap-and-trade agreement or pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. not to mention all the bombs that trump will cause to go off. war takes a devastating toll on the environment, by the way. our atmosphere is fucked. so, what am i preparing my kids for? life in canada?
lifetime nightmare. trump will hopefully be gone from the presidency in 4 years, but his likely 3+ supreme court designations will shift the court rulings conservative for the remainder of our lives
ultimately it was up to bernie to make a stand after the truth came out. if he ran third party then he'd now be blamed for trump. he had no winning path.
this. thank god. why don't people understand this? the crew on pbs right now gets it. they're saying they need to take a long hard look at themselves and at the democrat ability to bring themselves down from the ivory tower.
this has the potential to be equivalent to the snowden leaks, but equally the public could lose interest pretty quickly. hopefully the former happens, and all those involved are prosecuted.
absolutely. it's incredible to see something like this in a sea of entertainment news garbage.
absolutely massive. hopefully this leads to some actual change.
are you going to do anything to fix it? just caring isn't enough, people raising their fists through their computers does nothing, your votes have no impact so all people do is just complain. not saying i'll do anything about this either, but it's much more complicating than just caring. maybe a massive riot in the millions would change things over night, but that'll never happen. people are too focused on trying to come up with a solution for the system by using the system but fail to realize that the system is designed to avoid you from having any meaningful change to it.
right.. but how do we actually *do anything* when everyone we've put into a position of power is corrupt? seriously though.
not to sound like too much of a shill, but i'm happy big outlets are slow with new big stories. i expect a big fact checked non biased summary (bbc) but ultra quick reporting requires sloppiness.
watching the biggest news channel of france right now, waiting for this to be covered, 30 minutes of ads later, i thought they were preparing some statement about this, but no, talking about brussels, migrants, and the fucking weather. and this is the "week-end-direct" program.
i'm looking at argentina. those people don't fuck around when it comes to civil unrest.
i never understand why people just toss off groups like bilderberg as if they are not important. there are well known clubs of the most powerful, most wealthy people on this planet. what do you think they talk about, their short game? they hold these meetings to set global policy and talk about how to get more money and more power for themselves.
the real disappointment happens when nothing changes.
hey cnn decided to go with the "before she was lady gaga" story
already did that as soon as i saw the importance of this.
all of a sudden "widespread terrorist attacks led by isis-westboro cooperative"
apparently americans are completely absent from the papers that have been leaked so far. that doesn't mean we'll hear more later as more of the papers are leaked.
at some point, if stuff like this keep being publicized, it has to blow up. it's like water boiling in a cauldron: you can take off the cover once in a while, but unless you turn the heat down by adressing the root cause of the boiling, shit's gonna happen one day.
if i had to guess, i would say people will be outraged for a day or two, then a police shooting or a terrorist attack or some celebrity gossip will grab the headlines and people will move on. god i'm jaded.
when your life may be in very real immediate danger i would imagine you're a lot more careful
its still gone way down hill. investigative journalism didn't get a financial boost, someone dropped a load in their laps.. that's not 'improving". its as much improving as winning the lotto is earning money by hard work. the problem was never the journalist,, kinda hard to be too investigative, when so much access is closed off, whistleblower laws silence people and the industry just doesnt fund investigation journalism.. its more expensive than trash and yet you make the same money for trash. this is free non trash for the price of trash.
it "hey, the server says it needs windows updates" phb "sorry, can't have any downtime, we'll lose money"
if nothing comes out about us politicians, i'm guessing that is a cia leak. the main focus of the leak has been putin, for starters
it's really crazy. the sueddeutsche said something along 'this is so big, one agency can't handle it and especially can't handle it well enough to inform the people in the way it should. therefore we set up the whole thing'. i'm mean oh my god how fucking awesome is this? they actually realized that this is far bigger then them and thus create the largest journalistic alliance i can think of! it's really time to get the popcorn ready. i can imagine people on the list willing to do almost everything to get their name off the list asap... i wonder how much corruption will be leaked as well or bribe attempts. what is kind of funny is that the prime minister of the only country who jailed banksters after the last big crash is involved and actually one of the first to be named...
they don't get better at hiding imho. they get better in distracting, as we all saw during the snowden/nsa leak. however, since there are so many journalists now involved it might make a difference. what i am thinking now is that this will be (as usual) only the tip of the iceberg. who, in all honesty, thinks that this was the only company doing such thing and offering such services. many more journalists should (and hopefully will) hop on the train to reveal even more dirt the large companies etc.. have in their pockets.
i hope so and i hope i am wrong but i doubt we'd even read about this in the morning papers. that is, the morning papers for decades to come.
the quantity of data is just enormous. a single newspaper would simply need years to work through all of this information.
hopefully the themes of these scandals bleed into eachother sufficiently that it serves draw more attention to the unoil scandal.
the bbc is one of the news organisations involved with revealing the panama papers leak at the same time, alongside the guardian and many others.
the hitchhiker's guide quote seems relevant: "on its world, the people are people. the leaders are lizards. the people hate the lizards and the lizards rule the people." "odd," said arthur, "i thought you said it was a democracy." "i did," said ford. "it is." "so," said arthur, hoping he wasn't sounding ridiculously obtuse, "why don't people get rid of the lizards?" "it honestly doesn't occur to them," said ford. "they've all got the vote, so they all pretty much assume that the government they've voted in more or less approximates to the government they want." "you mean they actually vote for the lizards?" "oh yes," said ford with a shrug, "of course." "but," said arthur, going for the big one again, "why?" "because if they didn't vote for a lizard," said ford, "the wrong lizard might get in. got any gin?"
revolution? worker's uprising? guillotines? the only limit is yourself!
oh, so it's basically just tax evasion? what will be the long-term implications of this?
chilean here! they don't, but you don't know us. we are a sea of people awaiting for any or every reason to complain, and this is a big one. also, a big periodistic agency called ciper was involved and will publish about involved chileans tomorrow if it gets through censorship.
i wish, but the people who actually *could* riot and show their disapproval without being gunned down or black-bagged are also the same people that are so content with bread and circus that they really don't care.
naturally, but this may cause a lot of these methods outside of russia to no longer be available.
maybe they split the story into pieces so it stays in the news, just like the snowden files
or it's gets normalized and people stop getting worked up
which is how big conspiracies like the one uncovered tend to survive. someone is going to be losing their head for this leak, and it probably won't be the banks.
not just sources - but the fact that this goes so deep and we've heard nothing across possibly hundreds of platforms is certainly impressive.
i think you're underestimating the work that went into this. someone didn't just knock on their door and drop off all of this data. the journalists involved had to build trust with whoever leaked the information. they also had to ensure they had the means to protect that person's identity. and that doesn't even count the year they spent going through millions of documents, indexing them, and making sense of it all.
tax accountant here. doesn't really matter that their salaries are known at all. c-levels of publicly traded companies have publicly available salaries too. income tax from salary would be easy to catch, but any investments they made with the leftovers wouldn't, and that's where the big money is anyway.
if so we'll hear more soon. no need to rush to judgement, but it's something to keep in mind and ask about. all things being equal, i'd expect americans to be all over this list.
i never knew how much i wanted that movie until now
it would end clinton's chances while locking in the nomination for trump if they both were implicated.
i would just give up on the system. i might just go completely off the grid, raise goats and sell illegal cheese or something.
if so, expect kremlin to leak something similar about u.s. politicians shortly. if that doesn't happen, you were probably wrong. in fact, if that doesn't happen the info probably doesn't exist because putin will be looking for absolutely *any* way to change the subject right about now regardless of the source of the leaks. eta: the inclusion of jordanians, saudis and others known to cooperate closely with us intelligence makes it further unlikely that cia is the source of this. still, i will be interested to see what the kremlin comes up with because they have every reason in the world right now to say, hey, we are no worse than the americans, if they can.
i'm with you on this one. this is grounds for at least removing her from any public office or the ability to run for one. sadly, the article is from april, 2015, so it must have had zero impact.
not that i'm advocating hauling the guy out of his house and chucking him into one of those ridiculously long-named volcanoes you guys have up there, but this sounds like the kind of thing that would justify hauling the guy out of his house and chucking him into a volcano.
he has always been a wealthy scumbag. his parents are rich and his wife is one of the richest women in iceland after her dad sold their company business. also, like was mentioned before, he is the head of the same party that was in the government which caused the collapse and has been linked with corruption for ages. he managed to bring the party from the ashes though be establishing himself as a nationalist that was going to fight off the "vulture" funds and give the money to the people. turns out he himself was one of the vultures, since his company in tortola was a creditor to the banks. furthermore, normal icelandic people haven't been able to transfer their money out of the country since the collapse but he has millions in a hidden fund in tortola. this is sickening.
you ever play the game mafia? its a common strategy to quickly go after your accused co-conspirators to divert any suspicion away from you
how it plays out? if this gets even bigger, more companies like mossack fonseca get revealed, there will be a sudden end to it. it will be when people from the leading countries will get involved..imho.
you could literally see his stomach tying in knots, the weird adrenalin/fear surge through his body and the fight or flight impulse takeover with flight winning. the only thing missing is if his voice would have risen higher.
you aren't kidding. total lack of a poker face there.
why don't you take a seat over there, mr. prime minister?
then they laugh at those who care enough to say anything about it
xi jinping is a huge one as well. he has been on a massive anticorruption drive in china, jailing people and seizing assets.
who is slave trading? how does a shell company hide that? i'm having trouble following exactly what is going on.
the world is maybe now talking about it. 100 papers, different countries. but yeah if there is no follow up by the media in the way they started it. the river they might have created will just be a bad smelling lake of unfollowed chances...
i'm reminded of this from hitchhiker's: the major problem - one of the major problems - for there are several - one of the many major problems with governing people is that of who you get to do it. or, rather, of who manages to get people to let them do it to them. to summarise: it is a well-known and much lamented fact that those people who most want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. to summarise the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made president should, on no account, be allowed to do the job. to summarise the summary of the summary: people are a problem.
a large-scale mass general strike would need to coincide. gotta hit em where it hurts.
it's not just tax evasion. it's using shell companies to skirt international law and launder money. people were using this company to get around arms embargoes and shit like that. people actually died because of this shit.
front page on usa today right now, went up 17 minutes ago.
yep, checked every major american news website, not a thing about these leaks.
incredibly impressive. 400 people over a year and this is the absolutely first time we've heard of this.
the quality of journalism hasn't dropped so much as it has been diluted by a lot of people claiming to be journalists. *this* is journalism, but it's vastly outnumbered by the number of people who think that interviewing ben stiller for zoolander 2's imminent release makes *them* journalists.
also just because they are on this list doesnt necessarily mean they did anything illegal. legal tax avoidance is a cottage industry and everyone knows it. exhibit a apple google amazon facebook etc with their offshore profit. worse come to worst, messi and others will just make some charitable donations to under privileged communities to repair their pr image.
for people that have lived in actually corrupt countries, the scale of corruption in the us is quite small.
not necessarily. foreign banks, for example, often won't take american clients at all now due to fatca.
is there any scenario here where putin is at any risk of losing control of russia? he will just carry on, throw a few more oligarchs in prison. bau.
iceland was one of the first countries to imprison heads of large banks for criminal activity. i would be surprised if they didn't do something about it.
you know what's on my mind right now? it ain't the coffee in my kitchen, it's the leaked data on the internet.
it was the glacier that had the silly name. the actual volcano was called dave or something
yeah, thats how i read it, but don't forget that the people with homes still had their own tax money used to give themselves debt relief. what a joke.
dunno, $2bn can buy a lot of polonium. i'd avoid tea for the next couple of decades if i were you.
no, most media outlets are about ratings and most of the time it makes sense to fall in line with their sponsors/corporate interests, but there comes a time when a story is too good to ignore. this has the potential to be like that. no one wants to bite the hand that feeds them, but if that hand turns out to be your favorite meal...
he looks like an alien is about to pop out of his chest
the closeup on the lip quiver. this guy is fucked.
probable not even sorry. just angry at whomever he deems responsible for him being found out. people like that don't get sorry, they get angry.
the idea about him is that he's cracked down on leaders who have somehow ended up with billions of dollars; he himself has been very restrained and only ended up with a few hundred million.
i've heard estimates that the saudi royal family is collectively worth something like 1.2-1.4 *trillion* dollars. the rothschilds are rumored to be up in that stratosphere as well.
not really. he has to answer to the military if nothing else, and i'm sure any number of high-ranking officials, businessmen, and international figures. there is no such thing as an absolute ruler--even in dictatorships there are still politics. otherwise we'd see much more successful dictatorships!
what are the odds of a coincidental, distracting terrorist attack happening soon?
the solution is to choose leadership from the unwilling to serve in areas that befit their technical knowledge. a technocracy if you will.
wait, explain to me how/why people died for this? i don't understand. thank you
the miami herald does cover it from a unique angle- while there arent us names in the leak, many of the foreign names are using their ill-gotten gains to purchase property here... which helps drive up prices and crowd americans out.
the new york times held onto the story where bush and the nsa were spying on americans without a warrant for a year before leaking it in 2005.
we found a document cache. you wont believe what we found in it.
messi could set an orphanage on fire and still be popular
absolutely not. the zeitgeist in russia has always been that corruption is just part of life. plus it is bt like putin's rep is built on the image of him as a saint.
this is a key point. people throughout this thread keep pointing out "well, there are no figures from country x..." but this is a leak about a single shell company. just one. i wouldn't expect every instance of corruption in the world to be documented here; on the contrary, i'd expect people with common financial advisers to be found here, because that would make sense as to why they all played an identical financial shell game.
when you came pullin in here did you see a sign on my bandwidth that said corruption data storage?
if you ask me dave is a pretty silly name for a volcano.
hey, maybe we'll break the yellow journalism cycle for a little bit. i'm so excited at the potential this has
i didn't even notice that the first time around but goddamn. that man is scared.
the people who don't matter and who are used to distract us on a daily basis. yeah, sad but true, you are right.
exactly. nobody is going to persuade me that bill gates or some such is the wealthiest man on earth, while there are trillions in tax havens and banks and we all know that the money gravitates to the wealthiest people.
yeah he's not totally autonomous but compared to leaders of other very powerful countries he definitely has less people to answer to and seemingly has huge political control compared to say the potus
one morning, checking your email: "congratulations, you've been selected to be the next president of the--" you: "oh goddamnit."
it's still early, but it looks like you can use these anonymous companies to send/launder money discreetly across borders this circumventing embargoes or sanctions. looks like some of this was used in arms sales as well as drug & sex trafficking.
it's cnn, what did you expect? they might have quite a name for themselves, but there's no way they're not deeply managed by someone protecting their assets.
this week is a great example of media's inability to properly cover what could negatively impact their financial interests, between this and unaoil a lot of faith will hopefully be lost by those that do learn what is going on.
more like a 7:00am phone call requesting you attend an off site breakfast meeting in a bad part of town.
at the request of the government. sitting on a story is different from researching a story where governments are spying on communication.
he just wants to light a fire under those orphans, get them running to their full potential. so motivating.
"top 10 celebs on the panama leak, you won't believe number 7"
iceland has done things to people who cheat the masses only a few years back. things beyond holding a hearing and asking for a minimal fine. this dude goin to jail, yo.
it was a really well done interview. there are three or four cameras around the room, obviously ready for when he storms out. the journalist knew exactly what would happen. i highly recommend you watch all of it if you can find it translated.
david cameron's dead father is listed on there for being a director of a company called 'blairdale' or something. not much from the uk that i could see.
bill gates is the richest *man*. these other people are not mere men, they are *aristocrats*.
i knew someone who woke up one day to find he had been elected water commissioner for his town of ~5,000 people. one of his friends wrote his name on the ballot and nobody was running for the position. he got one vote and won.
this is the shit we see in movies. a secret society. just without a cool shadowy name.
is there a reason these other countries didn't do the same?
did he really throw his wife under the bus within the first few seconds of this video or am i missing something?
can you show me the richest rothchild member? i feel as though these numbers have come out of air that estimate their wealth and aren't reliable. most of the saudi wealth (the trillion dollars) is based off of how large the oil reserve is underneath their land.
exactly, his 50 billion is legally earned and he can flash them, the people who have that money in tax havens cant
this literally the plot to daredevil season 1. like, this is exactly what wilson fisk and his crew were doing.
that is how sensationalist news covers things, it is one surprising headline after the other and old news doesn't catch headines like the latest celebrity gossip does.
if you don't mind me asking, what's keeping you and your family there? i'm genuinely curious about the circumstances of you living there.
there's options to fix things. there's expanding composite pipe for this type of job that goes in existing pipe and seals it back up. this would be very much cheaper than digging everything up and replacing it. this still isn't cheap and the problem is probably too big to fix. the only thing that could reasonably done is a government substadized overhaul, which honestly isn't likely viable as how more difficult it is to fix utilities after shit is above it. the government could buy out houses and such, but that opens up quite the can of worms. or do nothing. that's cheap and flint is a small sized town with not that many voters and support....
yep. that's nuts. we can only hope wherever we buy our own a house the water is safe..
i'm sure that the people of flint are thinking the same thing
crazy that imaginary points and useless 'gold' matter to you.
it's so true. people don't give two shits about local politics that's impact there lives daily.
have you seen the reservations? the natives are pretty much relegated to the third world.
it's fucking gallowboob. don't expect effort. he's on the same tier as a shitty facebook page.
congratulations, you just created a strategy for politicians to move populations they don't like, companies to get no-bid contracts to move them from their friends in the government, and an incentive for state and municipal governments to repeat the mistakes and crimes that caused the flint water crisis in the first place.
you could educated us and provide other examples of places facing similar problems.
she *was* a blond white girl before they contaminated the water.
i heard a report on the news last night that new jersey has a problem now due to lead lined pipes. to go a little off topic the bridge connecting pa and nj turnpikes is closed due to a structural crack. this is the infrastructure that is crumbling around all of us.
you forgot that congress approved 170 million to fix the pipes and the construction is underway... what else should we be doing?
signed the petition... had 60k at the time 2 hours ago. now has 1. wtf?
just stick a giant britta filter in it and let's go home.
i know very little about american cities so i probably speak for most other countries when i say it would be great if there was a compiled list of cities in this sort of situation. if flint was obscure until recently then i bet there are plenty more nationwide.
the thing is, old news isn't news at all. if you open a newspaper, it will give you information of new things happening at present. maybe some opinion piece or in-depth article might discuss an issue that isn't new, but that's not "news coverage" anyway.
like a lot of people it's a combination of many things, family, finances and being stubborn has a lot to do with it, but i love this city and the people here. i was born here most of my family was born here. if given the option to go somewhere else it would probably be a very hard decision. we don't have much but it's ours and even when it's in a place of violence and poverty a lot of us still try to make the best of it.
on a scale of 0 to "somebody poisoned the water hole" my expert opinion would be that there is a snake in your boot.
even russia sorts this stuff... and it's pretty cold there.
unfortunately they might have to do what migrants do. leave their community and face a new world somewhere else where they can create new lives. that sucks so bad man.
get rid of the epa and clean water standards. than flint water won't be in violation of anything. this is easy. why you didn't think of it loser. sad!
they can't tell time any more because of the brain damage
you mean nuclear bombs don't fix things? you're crazy!
i think you just took his comment to an extreme that he wasn't even thinking about
mdeq has been shady af in their practices. i would not accept any of their reports as factual.
yep buy everyone out like you said. then we ship all (a lot) the homeless there and let them form a society with all the buildings and no law. it could be a great experiment to see what would happen. this is just a joke
i showed my support of your support by upvoting you.
so why doesn't nj do something about their infrastructure?
mayor of flint at the time of the switch from lake water to river water was a democrat - hence some dude near the top of this thread blaming the republican governor.
republicans are stereotyped to be all about the wealthy. they believe that everyone should look out for themselves and if someone is poor it's their own damn fault. democrats are thought of as being for the little man and stereotyped to wanting to baby the poor and take all the money from the rich. democrats are blamed for lazy poor, republicans blamed for being heartless.
you would think that should've made it a bigger crisis.
i'd argue that an ongoing health crisis is not "old news".
its still bad in flint. as a matter of fact i just read an article today about 300 plumbers that are part of a union working there to install filters free of charge.
flint sounds like it's 1 blackout away from mad max
if you boil water with lead in it and don't collect the steam as condensation... you still have water with lead in it. unfortunately they have to advertise this on billboards in flint because people were doing that for a while.
nice words! i wish you and your family all the best!
ha ha ha, that implies we actually give a shit about poor people! i really wish i could use "/s" here but i can't. this country sucks.
except they speak the same language, have the same societal norms, are more or less the same color and have a government that *can* provide support for them if it felt like it.
real estate speculators who can pick up a house for 40-50k and just sit on it until the crisis is over stand to make a great deal of money. unfortunately, it doesn't seem like they ever intend to fix the problem so those houses are probably just enormous money sinks.
and hey, the new head of the epa said not too long ago that he wants to get rid of the epa. sounds like everybody wins (except the residents of flint)!
i mean if you can't get the job done go to the fed and ask for help. this isn't some isolated african country with lack of rainfall we can take care of our own.
for a 100% fix, all the pipe needs to be replaced. for a good enough fix, just enough pipe needs to be replaced so the parts per whateverillion is low enough for environmental standards. there are probably other, cheaper options they are considering though.
just because the idea was intended to do good doesn't mean that someone can't find a way to abuse it. he did take it to the extreme but what's going to stop someone else from taking advantage of the rule in a way that wasn't thought of? i think in theory what the original comment said is a good idea but unfortunately we always have to be skeptical of our government officials because they've shown in the past that they aren't trustworthy and are only interested in what is best for them instead of what's best for their constituency.
i showed my support of your support of his support by upvoting you.
it takes a long damn time to dig up pipes and flint needs to replace a lot of them from what i have heard but still if the government took this seriously it would be done by now.
people do realize that people other than barack obama actually make decisions in our government, correct?
a lot of them are donated. i think the red cross has been handing them out, but i am not 100% sure on that.
jeez, i've seen grade school kids give more tongue than that.
because nj has been showing the world how local government corruption is done since corruption has been a thing, mostly. money spent on infrastructure is money not going into their pockets. seriously, read some local political news about nj sometime and you'd think you were reading about some banana republic somewhere. the only difference is that the violence comes from inner city gangs instead of police and paramilitary organizations.
that means spending taxpayer money. something voters tend to frown on.
i'm sure it's covered in the local newspapers. nationally (or internationally, in my case), it's not news. they'd have to be able to update it in some way for it to be news, and from where i'm sitting it looks like the headline would be a perpetual "flint water still toxic", which isn't a news update.
i don't think it's so much not caring as it is busy working and putting food on the table and making sure their teenage daughter isn't sexting [edit comma: "," - their daughter is not the one at the bar] and drinking at the corner bar and questioning their sexuality and going home with some random tranny then regretting it later and getting a divorce because their wife won't accept who they are as a person then losing their job, not paying alimony and ending up living in a van down by the river. people care.
in fact it will then have a higher concentration of lead after boiling
damn dude that sounds rough, can't believe something like that can even happen in the us
the michigan government is what caused the poisoned water. snyder tried saving money by pulling water from the flint river. now that he's under the spotlight he has spent almost 4 million dollars. not on fixing the issue, but on building a legal defense.
i dont think the local government has the capability to fix it. the state or federal government needs to step in and actually put out the cash n3cesaary to fix the problem
this. it is like obama passing stupid laws like those that suspend habeas corpus, and such. he might have been jesus and never used them; the person after him 100% isn't and will probably use those powers for evil. when you give power like that you must think of what the worst person in the world would do with that power, because someday the worst person in the world might in fact be the leader who gets to wield that power.
has anyone been sued? if not, why haven't the people been represented yet? i'd imagine they might be able to secure a decent settlement
its not the main pipes which are the problem anymore, its the lead pipes in peoples homes. the problem is 96% fixed the last bit is just people not wanting to replace their pipes cause it costs a shittonne.
for people who live in these areas; do water filters alleviate the issue, or should we only drink bottled water?
true, but it at least gives poor families drinkable water.
they were on the detroit supply, but detroit raised their rates because of their *own* financial issues. because of this they were going to tie into another supply, but detroit refused to grandfather their existing rate until construction completed. because of that, they were going to use their back-up supply with the flint river. iirc when the water issues came to light, detroit did in fact offer to hook them back up until the construction was finished, but i don't know how that played out.
those stories keep the attention on officials and help resolution though.
you uh, you have experience in that? all jokes aside i do agree that yes it is more complicated than what i wrote but i have yet to find something that isn't.
dont be fooled, many places in the us are basically a third-world country, but we have midtown manhattan and beverly hills so people think its all rich and glamorous.
in the us, only failures are socialized. profits are still privatized.
the failure of the state government to solve the problem should have made it a federal issue about a year ago.
this is my thought. if the city doesn't have the funds to completely overhaul their water distribution systems, it's up to the state or washington to step up and help the people of flint. no american should live in a city that can't even provide the basic necessity of clean water. i don't know if they could just declare a state of emergency and get a shitload of funds to do something, or what, but *something* needs to be done. 3 years of lead contaminated water with no end in sight is fucking atrocious.
my challenge to everyone is to not start laying this at trump's feet immediately. considering the fact that obama really didn't do anything about it (because the president can't really solve state's problems without being asked), don't start calling trump a racist and saying he doesn't care about black people because of this.
but if he's cutting federal funding to cities that act as sanctuaries for illegal immigrants, why can't he do the same to cities that can't provide safe drinking water to residents?
rachel dolezal will be so thrilled to know transracial exists
and then bankrupt the town the live in... they're in a bad spot regardless.
should they have to pay? their water was drinkable before, albeit precariously on the edge of toxic if the deposits on the pipes dissolved (as they have), but to have to cough up the money to re-plumb their entire house?? we *are* talking about flint, michigan here. most of these folks aren't rolling in cash as it is.
ironically, that's how this disaster happened. a state appointed city manager caused this mess. but, flint city government should still largely be replaced. they are idiots. i can't fault them entirely as flint doesn't really have much budget to throw around at the decaying infrastructure and other problems.
plus customer trust in your brand, which is worth so much more than that dollar amount.
yeah, nobody ever wants to admit the detroit rate-jacking. everything is "flint emergency manager hates black people" and "it's all the governor's fault" and "this would never happen in the suburbs" that last part is true, but that's because sort of by definition the suburbs don't have money problems.
ha ha! well, yes we do, every day, week, month, and year!
news companies aren't in the business of keeping the attention of officials and resolving problems. they're in the business of selling stories that people want to read about.
i'm not sure how old you are but i can remember life before cell phones. it was not much different aside from if you told someone you were going to be somewhere at a certain time then you bloody well should make sure you're there because i'm giving you 5 minutes before i bail
i was reading about lots of americans who go to study abroad in germany really enjoy it and end up finishing their degree over there and even finding work after graduation
well i mean many people also live in these areas that are *very* first world (that aren't the two places you listed) so it's relatively easy to be "fooled" if you live in a bubble. they've just never been somewhere like atlanta's trap or south side chicago or gary indiana
the epiphany i had was actually kind of sad. that really describes it really well. would you say it's like how taxpayers foot the bill for failing casinos?
big banks and businesses are better than people. they are ageless and can't be imprisoned. they can also create fake identities at-will, whenever they want to do something shameful.
you can't just make something a federal issue because a state sucks at doing it. can you imagine the clusterfuck that would create? there are divided responsibilities between local, state, and federal authorities for a reason.
there's tons of cities that face the same problem as flint though. or something very similar. not to downplay flint's tragedy or anything, but it's not like the fight is over once they're taken care of.
sure. the city manager and his buds should go to jail. but that doesn't solve the current problem. those people need help now
to be fair, i am most definitely not calling trump a racist and saying he doesn't care about black people because of flint, michigan.
so we cut funding to cities that need funding the most? it's 'no child left behind' all over again!
red cross actually does a lot of good things for military, one of which is they get in touch soldiers downrange when a family member has an emergency. we had a death two days before thanksgiving, and red cross found my husband, got him home the next day, and arranged our plane tickets and a shuttle for us so we could focus on grieving. he had to go back two days later, but he was able to bury his brother and be with the family. they did the same thing for a friend who went into early labor while her husband was deployed; he was able to be with his daughter for her very short life because of red cross. we are forever grateful for what they did and continue to do.
and most of them don't own their homes. landlords aren't going to cough money up unless they're forced to and the government has made it very clear where they stand.
and therein lies much of the problem: the press is supposed to hold the government and the powers that be accountable, at least if we intend our democracy to remain healthy and, well, a democracy. but as they are in the *business* of journalism rather than the *profession* of journalism, they report on what people want to hear, rather than what they need to hear. it's not all "the people get what they want," there's a very powerful effect that goes the other way: the people want what they get.
i don't think they strapped dead bodies the vehicles as ornaments in mad max
that's not the same as something we use to communicate and navigate and socialize and watch netflix and read news and books and draw and listen to music on and bank on and take photographs and videos with... suddenly turning off with no explanation and no way to figure out what happened without that internet access and is this a full scale terrorist attack affecting the whole city or maybe even the whole country and oh my god i have to pick up my kids from school to protect them but what if my wife is already doing it and i can't find them or her is she going to her parents house to hole up or will she be home the highways are flooding with people fleeing the city in case of a nuclear attack traffic hasn't moved in an hour and i'm 40 miles from my family what's happening there's no way to get any information without internet here what the fuck do i do
any major city really. in phoenix i can name 10 areas off the top of my head that are ghetto as fuck, dirty, gang ridden, homeless everywhere behind circle k's, gunshots everyday, watch your colors when you there, etc. i was raised middle class but hangout with a lot of poorer people in "the hood" and fuck it's so jarring how different things are outside middle class-rich suburbs. people really don't know what the streets are like in america.
yeah, because in africa that's the norm. it might surprise you but africa is a lot more than mudhuts and starving people living in a dried up desert.
why do you think trump doesn't want to release his tax returns? doesn't want us to see the clever accounting that earned him piles of money that he doesn't actually need.
can't you, though, if the state government lacks the necessary resources and lives are at stake? i was under the impression that was one of the implications of declaring a state of national emergency.
exactly. in my hometown we got a letter for 2nd year in a row that says not to drink the water if your a baby, elderly, or immune deficient. then in the next sentence they say the water is still ok though.
you literally can't. kanye liked trump, and he's the expert on which presidents care about black people.
and we all saw what no child gets ahead did for public schools.
except i doubt that with their high admin salaries
well nobody is going to pay to keep reading about the same stories.
lol that's my gf as well. we'll be getting ready to go somewhere and i'll hear her on the phone saying 'we will be there in a couple of minutes'. i'm pretty anal about being realistic with times and not being late so i immediately say why did you just tell them that? it will probably around 5 minutes before we even get in the car! if it's a mutual friend, now i just text and tell them the correct time
yeah, the taxes thing seems sad in this respect. the rich, the ones who need the money the least, find ways to evade, while the poor, who need it the most, still get screwed over.
we had a bad storm hit my relatively small, poor city and the surrounding area some years back, 0 deaths but a lot of fallen trees/downed power lines/etc. i'm not sure if there was an emergency declared, but there were definitely federal "cleanup crews" or whatever all over within three days fixing shit.
reality - local municipalities need to start replacing the worst parts of infrastructure, as they should do. replacing all the pipes in every city is not feasible and not needed.
thats not the main problem about flint though. the biggest thing is that they tried to switch water sources without tellin anyone and without proper inspections and then they noticed how bad it was months after the switch and then finally came out about it. also the water is 19 times more corrosive than detroits, thats far more than then the average "dont drink because of lead" type tap water.
trump has said he wants to do that. idk if he said specifically anything about dod dollars. but he's big on infrastructure overhaul/improvement. i'm hopeful that he follows through on that stuff. one of the few legitimate applications of government, imo. for the record, i didn't vote for trump. since that will be the kneejerk critique i will get.
i really want a remix of kanye declaring that all 43 presidents either care about or do not care about black people. preferably with as little rhyme or reason as possible.
the biggest thing was they knew about it long before they came out about it. they changed gm's water supply because it was corroding cars. they were telling everyone the water was fine while supplying bottled water to all council/govt workers. it is atrocious.
he has already repealed tpp so that's one promise kept, so far so good.
i wish i could understand how they convinced the officials that they deserve the olympics. are the olympic officials trying to bankrupt shitty, oblivious countries on purpose now? conspiracy?
"hey guys i found a loophole so we don't have to go die in rio!" "drugs!"
go for it. i thought about doing it with zazzle or something but those guys would probably take it down for copyright infringement or something. then again, i am also lazy.
isis won't bother attacking because they'd be too terrified to go to rio
this needs more upvotes. weapons grade wordplay is why i come to reddit most days
if they can manage it... if you've seen the photos, it is a shame how greece has let the 2004 athens olympics site go to a complete ruin a mere decade after the games happened. it's hard to imagine you could let brand new buildings rot so fast. and this was during a period where they were receiving significant eu subsidies. maybe the olympics should be held in greece, but managed by germans or something. i don't have much confidence in the ioc's decision making wisdom.
parasailing isn't an olympic sport, now rowing and regular sailing are
they expect our athletes, from all around the world, to compete in human excrement... it's *that* bad. russia getting caught doping doesn't seem all too bad now, wonder if the rest could "find new evidence" on every other competing country.
reddit waters down the upvotes so it won't stay forever there on the front page =)
it really was. i was living in brazil at the time and nothing before has shown me how reddit is so full of people with very strong opinions on subjects they know nothing about. the amount of quite disgusting and ignorant things said about a country of 200 million people completely blew my mind, it was so strange to see just how strongly people felt about what an irredeemable shit hole brazil clearly is. any consensus about pretty much anything on this site has been suspect to me since then. i guess that's one positive to come from this?
this is a stupid reddit mechanism. it always has been like that with popular topics
and then you start there and nothing gets infected!
pandemic 2 i think, free online game. it was a major thing some years ago. reddit went crazy with the madagascar thing. the goal was to infect the world and madagascar was really hard to get. it became a meme... the president of madagascar one is pretty good. shut. down. everything.
i'm cool with it. i figure that must mean i'm talented or something.
it's called plain old bribery. a lot of it. the ioc and fifa should be dragged out into the city square and shot.
i would test it for you to find out, but you know, i'm lazy.
or maybe they'd intentionally get infected, then spread it around the world as quickly as possible.
you're bitter that an olympics *hasn't* been a disaster? aw, who am i kidding, me too. i've never been this excited for a literal shit show.
man, there have already been reports of the olympic village being unsanitary and broken. even if the events go fine, what about the actual tourists?
roses are red it's all the rage i have an infection bacteriophage
a lot of olympic venues end up like that. in sydney, however, the main stadiums got turned into sports arena, convention/event locations, etc. every weekday, and particularly weekends, the former olympic park site is packed with people. the areas around it that were athlete housing have formed the basis of some of the most sought after suburbs in sydney. all in all, it was a good result. same can't be said for everywhere. aussie, aussie, aussie, oi, oi, oi.
it's a pretty decent one, ya. too many arenas are left unused/decaying.
haha, yeah. but the 3 teaspoons part was released today. no way they'll get less than that in the whole time they participate. they should've just moved those events away from rio to clean water and explained why the did it.
this. it's not like the olympics fell from the sky-brazil buttered up the ioc to win the "right" to host the olympics in the first place
it's gone down to 8500 now, what's going on with all this downvoting?!
i've always assumed that plague inc. was made by the same folks. if it wasn't, it's at least a spiritual successor.

rio 2016! come for the olympics, stay because your life was stolen!
still gonna be better than waiting for care in a hospital
bio with the bottom line of the b a different color so that it still says bio and rio at the same time
wait.. isnt a side effect of zika the whole tiny headed baby thing? maybe they should do that.
it's gonna be a looong two weeks. when it's all over, i bet the athletes will be pooped.
there's *always* complains about the olympic village
drinking three teaspoons summer river's battle splash golden corpse showers
haha that's a nice way of saying blatant rip-off. i think it was made by the same people though.
meh. i figured a watermark would detract from the image. if people wanna use it i don't care that much. the process of creating it was so simple someone with a few minutes and photoshop could recreate it.
fortunately this is not winter olympics, else i would not want to go up against the world champions in curling.
who was promptly forgotten about because he was originally going to be the antagonist of re4 before it went through multiple redesigns. some say he's still out there, getting drunk at a bar with asagi while he waits for his chance to shine.
rio 2016! come for the olympics, stay until your family pays the ransom
yeah, but that plan only works if they can get laid.
only 12 of the 31 villages passed health inspection.
there was a disease from brasilia that they said was so bad it could kill ya but we told all our swimmers "if you want to be winners, dive in and don't let it fill ya."
thank you. it always felt weird seeing people pay for a game that was done just as well online for free.
we'll know it was your idea first. reddit remembers.
in other news, goats mysteriously born with tiny heads all across the middle east.
people look at it like that because it is not productive time doing something else. but then they forget that relaxing is a healthy thing and reduces stress, so i say they were playing the game for obvious health reasons.
new game does have slightly different mechanics and the new virus types seem pretty fun.
exactly. some douche nozzle in advertising would have spent hours coming up with a similarly simplistic concept for some corporate bull shit, only they would have gotten paid - even for that precious thinking time. op here didn't make this for anyone else, just for funsies. he had an idea, had the skills to make it, was probably more efficient with his time than that douche, but no profit. i guarantee you some other douche is gonna go running up to his boss after wasting hours online - "look at this! we can use this everywhere!" profit.
yeah. lets stop a billion dollar event with a petition signed by 300 ppl
in unrelated news, welshmen are guarding their sheep from any refugees
not at all, i would just hate to see someone getting (shadow)banned for such an innocent comment.
that's actually what reddit wants, people to praise products they like and then make deals with the product's owners.
whoops. cosmo got it. stick his dick in an outlet for some hot fun!
please don't let him turn into robert de niro and al pacino.
like, 3,000 up votes in less than 5 minutes. damn.
they weren't about to play that hurry-up music on old leo and he knew it.
right. leo strokes out on stage, grohl comes out and restarts "blackbird", someone up top throws together a quick leo clip...
such a great closing line too. "let us not take this planet for granted, i do not take tonight for granted."
and he didn't take the night for granted. he knew he had a massive audience, which grants him a very large megaphone, and he didn't waste that opportunity to deliver a message he felt needed to be heard.
he should've finished his speech by quoting lines from all the other movies he was nominated for and then thanked the directors and crew for those until everybody just went home
honestly, it felt like the speech of a man who came prepared even though he didn't win so many times before, all the while sounding like a man who didn't care nearly as much as anybody else thought he'd care. i was expecting some kind of smirk, or even grin, and a wise-ass understating comment. but no, we had a proper, even great, speech delivered nearly flawlessly. i'm impressed.
and now op is getting showered in upvotes and gold.
i don't know if he went longer than others who got the music, but yeah i was wondering if like, someone came in through the headset to the music team like "just let it slide this guy can take as long as he needs".
nah, if that happened he'd probably keep the acceptance speech going.
the most amazing thing i've seen today is my own post on a thread about leo winning an oscar. what a time to be alive.
not only this subreddit. look at the karma right now. never seen anything like it.
two things: 1) leo. we've had issues with leo at previous award shows. some hollywood people lobbied to bring him back for the oscars, feeling he deserved another chance. that was a mistake. leo is an ass, and we won't be working with him again. 2) as long as we're firing people, we're also firing the academy of motion pictures arts and sciences people that we've been working with on the oscars. they will be replaced by black people, and we hope to get this turned around before the next oscar season. as always, i can be reached at chrisrock@valvesoftware.com chris
no one would have batted an eye if leo had beaten him to death with the oscar if that happened.
well, i guess we know what daniel day-lewis's next movie will be.
til bernie has never won an oscar, the academy awards are 92 years old so lets each donate $92
the cinematography was probably the best thing about the revenant (and that's not a jab at the acting/plot).
he's not leonardo dicaprio. he's academy award winner leonardo dicaprio.
isn't he doing a movie about environmental catastrophe based on the future? i wonder if playing in the revenant had any role in this.
i still can't believe angry alex won all of those awards.
i would not be here today if it were not for the amazing efforts of leonardo dicaprio. praise be.
he did. the time limit is 45 seconds, at which point the music starts. leo went for about 2m30s, and no music was played. inarritu talked through pretty much the entire music piece, going for a total of about 1m50s, but they didn't cut his mic - typically the top awards get a bit more leniency.
did you know he really cut his hand during the filming of that scene, and then kept going? i bet you didn't. it is a little known fact here on the inter-nets.
still can't believe he didn't win for grape. unbelievable acting.
the opening scene where they come under attack is just beyond ridiculous from a visual standpoint.
im not fuckin leaving ##im not fucking leaving
speaking of strange last names we cant forget the famous suq madiq.
you earned it leo, he would say as he cried himself to sleep
if only you'd posted a link. think of all the karma!
they usually let the best actor and actress speeches go long - not just because they're big-shot movie stars, but because they're usually charismatic and entertaining so they give better speeches than everybody else.
wow, really?! that definitely shows his commitment to his craft! i think most people would've stopped at that point!
when that movie was up against the piano, schindlers list, the fugitive, sleepless in seattle, the firm, the pelican brief, demolition man, jurassic park, etc... that's a lot of competition for a kid. also it would have been a supporting actor nominee, with johnny depp as the lead.. and how does a kid compete with goldblum as a supporting actor!
those were all movies for which he was nominated, so no the departed. if, however, you were expressing surprise that he hadn't been nominated for the departed: i'm with you on that one.
it's gotten 1000 upvotes a minute - that's pretty fucking crazy
you won't believe what bernie sanders did! click to see!!
it was the same year as blood diamond. they gave him that nom instead. which i think i agree with.
just passed 25,000 upvotes in 15 minutes. history is being made boys
ah, didn't think of that. i'd have trouble picking between the two of them, honestly.
eh, reddit's system'll kick in soon, reducing the points dramatically.
what if he counters by saying its not exactly 100? ;-;
until op delivers, it is both a shitpost and not a shitpost at the same time. schrodinger's shit.
dude, you're taking such a risk right now by commenting this thread haha
even if the final price is around $2 million there are surprisingly many people who could pull it off.
/u/emobatmanreturns /u/elune /u/aryanshiro get in here for free stuff
doesn't work. think about it in an 'if, then' statement. if x happens then y happens. the x in this case is that he got 100 upvotes. that he got more doesn't matter. the y in this case is that everybody who upvoted gets a free copy of the game.
you are looking at it wrong. he did, in fact, get 100 upvotes. regardless of how many more there are, he got 100.
there is positively no chance that any court would take this to be a legally binding offer. i'm willing to bet somebody's actually going to post about this in /r/legaladvice though.
maybe just one copy for everyone to share. i'll take saturdays and alternating wednesdays
gawd, what are the chances? *hesitantly clicks the upvote and comment buttons, not wanting to be part of this sham, but wanting it to be real*
it's hard to be disappointed when you don't actually expect them to deliver. but, you know, just in case...
it doesn't say photocopy though. so it has to be 1:1 copy of sun and moon
sun & moon is only a track. the album is group therapy.
bad news, you were the 105th upvote. that's more than 100, so op's condition is no longer met.
i'll join you on the operation. we must band together to punish him.
that amount of money, hell even a tenth of it, would change my life forever, and pretty much solve every problem in my life right now.
have fun dying to death. i'll just chilling controlling the ocean with my moon!
if people keep it like that, we'll be able to make our own law & order: karma court
why did this make me question what that could possible be.
we've reached a new level of shitposting: **quantum shitposting**
but just think... if you deliver, you'll have enough reddit gold to last several lifetimes
wasn't there that one billionaire who donated 100k to a twitch streamer before? there's people out there that could cover this.
on my way */u/a_favorite_rug /u/amagrilbtw /u/ninetofivehero* get the limo ready
the wording matters, it doesn't say "least" or "more". it represent an exact number.
imagine some actual crazy redditor taking op to a proper court though. if all fails, /r/karmacourt will be in hearing for the ~17,000 link karma.
i got dibs on mondays and every 3rd friday of each month!
i'll do that even if he does deliver. in fact i did it yesterday
same, i'll be impressed if op can go down to negative karma.
a hundredth would change around a ton for me, even a thousandth would be a gamechanger. #brokelife
aw shit, wad up, furfam. o7 i couldn't get a limo, but i got a limo hotdogmobile
even if he only gave a copy to a single person he'd still be this subreddit's hero in my books.
but at one point in time...he did "get 100 upvotes".
i upvoted your comment, so one of your copies is now mine!
i would like one moon disappointment! (gotta rep the night!)
get your logic and efficiency out of this glorious day
correct: whether he got 18,000 or 134, he first must get 100 up votes. it's on him to clarify the 'exactly' clause.
i bet they're are a lot more than 17,000 upvotes though. reddit is likely doing some vote-fuzzing here, there are nearly 50,000 comments.
i would like one sun dissapointment...am i doing this right?
i remember being irritated every time my math teacher used the "x equals y if and only if ..." expression. now i'm glad, because it allows me to write a shitpost comment.
you can get them at best buy next to the outer space heaters
i remember seeing a thread a while back where someone found him and got their picture taken with their crack out or something.
well, since the proper way to prepare yourself for this guy's freedom is to pull your pants up, ideally and theoretically 0. we all know that won't happen. but we also know he doesn't plan on taking anymore. someone else could if they wanted.
my condolences to your sister. i hope she recovers. where is she going to be marred?
he already has the picture taken. just like controlling diamonds, one must control the flow of crack to maximize karma.
i won't lie to you you're my hero and got me to play magic i saw your post on reddit and i also had a few packs of journey to nyx from my local shop. you saved me from depression. you are a god amongst players.
it seems like someone who's been banned from tournaments ever since the incident happened is the *last* person who'd know the answer to that question though.
ostrasizing a large *large* part of the community, it didn't sit well with wotc. not saying i agree with the ban but it's not hard to see where they were coming from.
because either they mad or nah but this case they mad
i'm glad i could help, my friend. if you ever want someone to talk to our whatever, give me a shout.
just because he was banned from participating doesn't mean he wasn't allow to be in attendance.
i still can't believe that happened... but the pros that brought it up and harassed him (literally bullied him like they claim crackgate did) faced no consequences.
a whole hedron crashed into it too! creature - table 0/3 indestructible
read it, knew what was probably in there, and still clicked i'm awful
i had to google the streaker vs blm butt. holy crap. that's an amazing butt.
wow, its like getting to smell great food, but youre not allowed to eat it. that sounds... cool?
does it still count as a skirt tho? it looks more like a belt lol.
"so, ah, are we just not gonna talk about the grand prix smell...?"
if photos weren't permitted, the event would have said so. he got banned for bullying/belittling/humiliating people, which makes sense. a magic event is supposed to be a "safe space" for players (even if they don't call it that), so i can see why wizards would take this buttcrack expose so seriously. i both greatly appreciate his contribution to the world of found art, and understand why he would get banned from continuing to hone his craft.
he bribed the mtg officials with karma to unban him.
that's probably my most hated reddit meme of all time. it was just so *goddamn dumb*. idk how it wasn't obvious that he was clearly just bullshitting all of it.
because if you upvote it you get a hit marker... duh
i mean, we're comparing it to a collection of pictures of asscracks, so...
is it any different than taking similar pictures of women's cleavage?
yes i will. i'm debating on driving 7 hours just to play the pre release with you. you're a legend keep being you. thank you for the encouraging words.
as an engineer, i have to tell you that you're flat out wrong and are, quite frankly, a moron. as an engineer, it has been shown time and time again that there are in fact engineers of the highest class here on reddit. if you're taking a biology class at a community college, you are automatically qualified to address yourself as a biological engineer. if you are an electrician who has worked on a few house projects, then you work in structural engineering. if you are well on your way of getting a computer science degree and have taken a few programming classes and understand programming logic jokes on reddit, you are a software engineer. i'm telling you, as an engineer, there are engineers on reddit.
that's just weird. what he did was hilarious. fucking wotc needs to develop a sense of humor.
you say that like it's not part of everyone's daily routine.
wow. to be fair. 3.7mill for dorito jizz art does sound pretty sweet.
it's the all time top post of r/funny. almost 10,000 more upvotes than the second highest post. it's just too perfect
i just bring a box of boosters and open one whenever it gets to me.
i'm really wondering how everyone would react if it was a sequence of attractive female asscracks.
his face and poses were honestly most of what made it great. like looking through a russian family's vacation photos.
wow, sounds like the people in charge of those tourneys have no sense of humor
nope, and to be honest if you could find that much cleavage at an mtg tournament, and took pictures of it every time, and posted it on the internet and got internet fame for it, you'd probably also get a ban from wizards.
stop debating with yourself, get in your car and drive there!
amazing. that gets me so excited. what a time to be alive.
to be fair to wizards a bunch of butt-hurt mtger's kicked up a shitstorm on social media over the post. if i cared enough i'd have just gone to the next local tourney and called in a bunch of public indecency complaints to the police but i honestly can't be arsed to put the effort in.
its the top post of all time because of reddits weird way of counting votes. it got most of its votes nearly two days later because of the shitstorm, and reddit trims votes (no joke look it up or follow a rising post), but when the usual amount of votes come in late it bypasses the trim altogether.
i've been clean for years (of magic, i'm hygienic in general), and i swear i could smell the freshly-opened booster pack just now.
it would have been a top post for entirely different reasons
i could just imagine the scenario. "shit i cant get this fucking card on the field. how am i supposed to propose if she keeps wrecking my shit"
i thought it was hilarious and fun natured. that said, i can see why they wouldn't want someone taking pictures of the participants with the sole objective of making fun of them. a lot of the people that go to these events aren't social butterflies and you want them to feel welcome without people making fun of their appearance.
oh, i'm sure you could find plenty of cleavage. just not the kind you're looking for. moobs.
they should applaud him for bringing attention to the problem. if i ever go to a public something, whatever, i don't want to watch buttcracks of men. normal dresscode shouldn't be too much to ask, just buy better underwear or tuck in your shirt.
that was the very gif that got me to sign up to imgur, which inevitably led to reddit ;)
to be fair it was also extremely popular when it was released. #1 on the front page for god knows how long.
hoooooly mother of fuck i want one. i neeeeed one.
that actually, factually, really did happen. richard garfield originally made the card, had a handful printed up, and asked his wife to play a few games with him. it took him multiple games to draw it, she was getting bored by the end of it.
at the same time every venue needs standards. for example, i recall walking by a gaming store that had to put a notice/psa in the front window about basic hygiene, because i guess the regulars were that bad about it. i cant imagine how bad, because im sure just having the notice up would scare away some customers...but maybe the smell was worse. idk what exactly event organizers should do about excessive ass crack, but they could probably consult an hr person to get an answer.
damn we're going to have strange conversations in the future. "and this very gif, children, is the one that sprang about the dankest of memes."
they've changed the system (which is why you see 5-7000 point posts that stick around longer vs 3-4000 that cycle a few times a day) but it hasn't gone smoothly since as i said, posts stay up much much longer creating a stale frontpage.
yup, with 56273 points, followed by the rice post with 38455 points and then his post with 38159.
you know bfz, the upcoming set, is reintroducing *full art lands* right? and they're guaranteed in booster packs, or a pack of ~~100~~ 80 inside a fat pack. you always *talked* about pimping your special deck with full-art zendikar lands, right? well now's the perfect chance to do it.
no way, man. i've stayed away for 4 years now, maybe 5. i'm going to hold out for as long as i can!
my guess is because it costs a fuck ton of money like any tgc and consumes your life if you get really into it. it's like a drug, hence the "clean for years"
i think when running a chainsaw is the only time suspenders are fasionable its part of that whole lumberjack look.
i worked at a comic store for. a year and a half. we had deodorant in the bathroom (spray) and no it did not solve the problem. our back is super packed on fridays for magic and i would avoid it because it smelled like fast food and bo. and i've had customers who were so bad and smelled like literal shit that we would open all the doors and have purge the area with spray afterwards.
fuck you i've been clean for 6 months.... i just pulled out my legacy deck and looked at its filthy regular land...
this right here. i know i will get into it again, though. wife and i both have these big plastic bins full of cards. someday the kid is going to see it and want to know about it, and boom, we'll have bought a bunch of boxes for her to open. you know, for her sake. it's not for us...
i have these three inch wide ones that are monochrome gradient of stripes. i call them my gray pride suspenders.
similarly, my time spent in retail hell (read : gamestop) also had a consistently smelly customer base. at one point we had a female customer wrinkle her nose and ask "what's that smell?" to which austin replied by taking a large whiff of the air and exhaled it with the word "gamers."
yea, he never broke character during his buttcrack crusades.
now allow me to suggest how cool those new full art lands would look *if they were foiled*.
i find it's an excellent tool for keeping toddlers entertained on airplanes. also for making old people confused and vaguely bothered.
seriously, not even mentioning that this post is supremely uninterestimg
honestly i had no idea it would blow up this much, the most i expected was 20k or something. this is insane!
the cutoff point is when you realize the 90s weren't 10 years ago.
it's also at islands of adventure, not universal studios.
gotta be only her hands. i mean she wasted all those skill points on party trick skills, so she didnt put any into changing alcohol to water. plus she is a goddess stuck on the mortal plain, why wouldnt she want to get hammered to numb the pain that is a mortal experience?
"we can't just stop the future from futuring" holy fuck that is deep
i mean i subconsciously knew this, but after reading your comment i thought about it for a sec; and holy shit has time flown
i'm roughly 30, lol, and i have felt like technology was evil for at least the last 4 years.
good episodes but gawd, danny is ass at those games.
thank you! my family (and i) are only proud when i don't do this against my own well-being. that's why i haven't been here often as of late. the greatest pride occurs when i make viable steps to improve myself - and that's still a heck of a work in progress, as we all are. yet, it's the progress and the work that we should be proud of. the result is simply the cherry on top of it all.
i think we can safely say that beer loves *you* so much. you know what that means? it means *you* have the power over your beer, not vice versa. in fact, you're the one that has the power over a surprisingly large number of factors in your life. and that includes pulling yourself out of the dumps. can you feel yourself getting out of it, slowly but surely? you'll get out of there. keep on flexin' that mind of yours. you've got the power, mate.
quite the descriptive username you got there, bud, and from your very few comments you've made - you've got a bit of edge to your jokes. as any good buttslut should. keep it up (pun totally intended)!
generally when people refer to universal orlando they're referring the whole resort - universal studios florida is one park and islands is the other
they're also insanely different in who goes to them - the california one still gets a lot of tourists but i'd say the bulk of park goers are locals. definitely not the same with orlando - it's basically an entire town for just disney. california adventure or disneyland probably have more to do than any one of the four parks at disney, just more rides and more dense
care to elaborate? i just recently visited and felt like something wasn't quite right about it. it felt dated and neglected, but they tried to update it on the cheap with the lasers and such.
it will not! super nintendo world (which is what i believe all three nintendo lands will be called going by universal japan's land) will be on the studios side of things, and the current story is that it will take over woody woodpecker's kidzone, or as i call it, woody woodpecker's time capsule from 1995.
pretty much any comment of that length has me suspiciously scrolling back up to look up at the username
you are correct. although it's on the islands of adventure side and not the actual universal studios side. but it's all under the universal umbrella.
i'm roughly a few years younger than you, but this is true. i feel like stan in south park; everything everyone does is just shit. ps you like that fukin semi colon usage? it's not even 9 am here!
but that's part of what makes it funny. i love the ocarina of time series. it was so funny seeing danny getting killed all the time because he never used the sheild.
how to win an idle/incremental game. 1: purchase the first auto-clicker upgrade. 2: set phone down. 3: go play dark souls, you pussy.
at first i think thought /u/jrodicus meant for psp. your comment made me check the app store. this is your fault.
man it's like /r/wholesomememes up in here right now, this is awesome.
instructions unclear. parked outside adventure islands. please advise
til -step 1) make a community. 2) be super kind and thoughtful. 3) collect subs. 5) bury whips and chains separate from bodies. 6) label the vhs "1997 bowling semi-finals" . 7) take out small loan of $1,000,000 & profitttt
aka the best side. i'd you want bang for your bucks go to islands.
who are the fastest readers in the world? the people on the twin towers, 110 stories in seven seconds.
instructions unclear, dinosaur stuck in crackpipe.
until you hit that little patch of episodes where danny is constantly yelling beaaaaaaarrrr because arin is shit at not picking up bears... in all seriousness though, all the katamari series' have been fucking fantastic, i like that the games are chill enough for them to get pretty real at times, i've always liked that side of the grumps.
sounds like cookie clicker, but a version that just makes everyone angry.
i've think thought before, and it's never led to anything good.
i don't see why you would lie about something so trivial so this is going out to...who am i kidding i'm not cool enough for the twitter.
lucky. if i could live there i'd pack up and move in a heartbeat. "there" being in universal itself.
i am pretty sure everyone is wondering why you got kicked out!
does florida have it's own anthem? i feel like it should.
nah you can't, the parking areas are all by the front of citywalk
the new pay time jobs are full time jobs now. long enough to feel like worked a full week but you get paid for 37 hours and don't get benefits ( medical insurance or vacation)
but that's why hahah time goes faster the closer i get to 30 and the existential crises don't seem to slow down either
oh man, this is fun. i'm feeling pretty good already (so definitely feel free to help out more people feeling low), but it'd be cool if you did me next! love the positivity you're bringing to this community, we need more of this.
you're a wonderful novelty account - accidentally stumbled on you in this thread and it's been a fun perusal of your history.
as fucking nerdy as it sounds, the wizarding world of harry potter in universal/ioa is one of the reasons i moved to orlando.
i went out with some friends to city walk (universals boardwalk type thing) and got a little too rowdy. had one too many drinks and decided *i'd pee where i wanted*. security thought otherwise.
pretty awesome and sorta confusing the first time you have to drive there. source: ex orlando resident
i feel you there. existential crises have been hitting me hard the last year.
i really liked that version. i hadn't played the console one but it worked on my ipod touch and i could use the new gyroscope feature... 2010-odd
thank you! my more recent comments haven't contained nearly as many compliments - i've broken the mold of my username frequently. that said, i've been at it for, apparently, over 4 years - what a ride.
wizarding world is so fucking awesome. i took a trip down to universal when the first half opened. and had to come back when the second half opened. and the diagon alley side? it's so magical. slipping through a subtle entrance into the misty cold (in spite of 80 degree elsewhere) land with tons of nooks and crannies to explore. the gringotts ride is an experience in its own. i think the best ride at universal. breathless. you can wonder into knockturn alley and not even realize it. which is how it should be ! and hop on the hogwarts express and ride the train to the hogsmeade's side... and the train shows video of the british country side out the "windows" and you feel like you're going to hogwarts. olivander's is awesome. the journey through hogwarts while you're in line for that ride is even better. the paintings move. there are holograms of main characters talking to you! ok i'm ranting. you know. but damn, hp world is the jam
you're melting my sides with all this comedy fuel.
yup, if you edit fast enough it wont show up, which is very useful for me because my ability to proofread goes way up after i click "save".
please tell me you are a mod at /r/wholesomememes. you are a national treasure and we need more people like you to be the change they want to see in the world.
that is my second favorite we ride it all the time. **i would have enjoyed this interview a lot more if i had gotten my cup of coffee!**
i'm actually the creator and mod of /r/freecompliments - it's been around a while longer than wholesomemes (itself obviously a wonderful community - but it already has enough wholesomeness to run itself!).
i hate that this sounds like actual dialogue from the prequels.
i'll still be doing what i do now, only nobody will be paying attention by then. i'm surprised they are now.
it's a replica. the original is retired, son to be auctioned for charity. i hope it's still worth something. *update* it raised $10,000 for greater st louis honor flight
i'd like to imagine that got a solid eye brow raise from ken as he read this.
i upvoted the post and then downvoted it just so i could get the satisfaction of upvoting it again
at least one person lives chase. i love chase. my wife is right here, she thinks he's ok too. no strong feelings either way.
as long as it gets you to the polls to vote on the other issues on your ballot.
at least one person did, they posted it yesterday.
i'm already a lazy mod in a few subs. that's enough responsibility to ignore for one man.
obiwan kenboni sure knows how to ride the front page in style.
user name was for stan musial bob gibson mike shannon number 18 great st louis cardinals
yeah i was pretty pissed at that bone hit piece. i literally threw my tendies because i was shaking. "oooooh, he likes to look at naked celebrities just like every other american man! what a villain!"
shit, ken has my vote for most legendary redditor of all time.
ease of use and versatility. it's easy to pull on, and the zipper lets you customize the amount of shirt you want to show allowing it to be used with button downs, polos, or basic under shirts.
worse than that, it's a sweater. it was quite warm today too.
what scares me is that you might actually be serious based on your username
i hope they got 2nd place. i hope you won, obviously.
are you talking about your job and daily life and such? i assumed you haven't been trying to let that stuff change. i was curious about your reddit persona though. do you want to keep on raking in karma, raising awareness for things, and having fun while it lasts, or are you considering a new account?
you could have just un-upvoted, then upvoted again. not saying your way is wrong, just saying there's a way to do it without downvoting america's savior ken bone.
well, kids, ken bone was a meme that went strong for a bit more than a month during the 2016 election. it was a nice, lovable dude with a funny sweater and a kind soul. ... did i ever told you guys about harambe?
oh great so now i'm attracted to 12 year olds, pedophiles, and ken bone?
"no strong feelings either way"... in true ken bone fashion, he's decidedly meh about almost everything. god this man is a miracle.
well there is a regional transit bill to vote on, and i suppose it would be more environmentally friendly than the current transit situation while minimizing job loss for fossil fuel plant workers.
ken bone is the guy who acknowledges the originality of people who are literally pretending to be him.
you have made my night sir. i legitamly respect you for not only doing your ama on your main but for coming back to the site. i really hope to see more of you around oral benkenboni
hate to disappoint you, but it's actually luke's bright blue one.
add 2 spaces at the end of each line: user name was for stan musial bob gibson mike shannon number 18 great st louis cardinals
probably a lack of a uv filter on your camera and/or crappy automatic adjustments to levels and color correction. that particular shade of purple usually indicates the former, but the way the tv is washed out would suggest the light level was pretty low (probably to get a better glow effect from the saber itself i assume) which means it could also be the latter.
ken bone giving some next level, /r/malefashionadvice right here.
my bad, mr. bone. i think red anything would work. great costume by the way.
i'm sure she's gonna be great. the forest service will be lucky to have her, just like you are.
you could upvote, then downvote, then un-downvote, thusly keeping the upvote untarnished and remaining undecided.
let's be honest though, ken would be the *worst* trying to decide which restaurant we should go to.
and then one-ups them to remind them of their place.
*you shut your dirty trap and dare not question the boner*
low light level, taken on my phone. you know your stuff sir.
as a former jehovah's witness, i used to hear that all the time lmao
"the term gray jedi, or gray, had two meanings. first, it was used by jedi and sith to describe force-users who walked the line between the light and dark sides of the force without surrendering to the dark side, and second, it described jedi who distanced themselves from the jedi high council and operated outside the strictures of the jedi code. however, those who were considered to be true gray jedi met both qualifications and did not belong to any particular force tradition." so basically, not good, not bad and doing your own thing. pretty much chaotic or true neutral dnd alignment
every one talks about the sand line but for me this was way worse. it honestly sounds like a placeholder line until they could write real dialogue: "anakin says some shit about how from his point of view the jedi are evil"
with enough ken bonin', i'm sure you could make another
10 reasons ken bone is not the hero you think he is. by ima cochsucher.
holy hell, can you be anymore perfect? are you single? ;)
jedi loners, then. that's actually kind of bad ass. i'm assuming the sith (proper) still considered them enemies and wouldn't spare them in a purge. sith got no chill.
"god dammit, anakin, did you kill all the yuenglings again? not cool, bro"
someone on imdb had a stab at the finished product... *"the jedi took me from my mother, and left her to die! they used me my entire life and still never trusted me! and you obi wan, you turned my wife against me! chancellor palpatine was the only person who ever cared about me, and you have the nerve to lecture me about evil?"* nah. instead of that, let's make the most powerful force user in the history of the galaxy - a guy who was apparently *conceived by the force itself*, who would realign the very structure of the force.... and make him a whiny little bitch.
yea, "from my point of view" indicates that anakin is approaching this rationally, from a position that recognizes multiple points of view rather than absolutes (kind of ironic, given obi-wan's comment about absolutes), and that doesn't really seem to mesh at all with anakin's current emotional state. he's in a rage; he's not thinking rationally, he should be utterly convinced that his way is the only way. having him acknowledge that this is a "point of view" rather than the truth just doesn't fit in that moment.
he's had a vasectomy. a bit more difficult to reverse.
he's not just a regular goddamned person, all indications are that he's a _pretty okay dude_. that's a lot like a regular goddamned person, except more charitable.
married 12 years to my favorite person. she's amazing.
maybe network execs will pick up on this and give him his own news talk show. ***the bone zone*** *hosted by ken bone*
they would also sometimes have different coloured blades, orange, yellow etc. (instead of green/blue vs red etc)
i don't know why people act like if the dialogue in the original trilogy is a master piece. i mean... it's not. it's clearly not.
seriously, the jedi couldn't free one slave out of petty cash?
it makes me uncomfortable that this is common knowledge
i get more of a rafiki vibe. wise and quick-witted, and always popping in at the right time to steal the scene.
so what about purple? ive allways wondered what was so special about master windu.
do people act like that? most people are probably indifferent. not a masterpiece, but not glaringly cheesy and terrible like some of the lines from the prequels.
i, too feel uncomfortable knowing he has denied this world more of his bloodline. i feel like if we had 10-15 ken bones, the world would be okay.
we make our own bone and it is healthier with tastier flavor
i missed that bit. he also answers this question farther down in this post's comments, so i came back with the answer.
why'd he ask for purple, and in what way was he so special he got to go around looking like a grey jedi then? i suppose this must be answered in some book or something
none :( i spent like 8 entire minutes making this too.
wouldn't an artificial sled simulation just be an actual sledding?
i'm willing to bet it's not as enticing as you remember.
same here. runescape made typing easy eventually. my teacher said i was going to be a well paid secretary.
man those were the days, eh? having to sneak out during lunchtime (it sucked when they were serving the round red baron pizzas, but what can you do?), head behind the school, score some white magic, adrenaline pumping, then head to the bathroom and use a suppository to get that ever elusive ecstasy. ahhh, middle school memories always makes my butthole clench.
i mean if you are of age and into dudes i can send some.
obviously he meant an artificial artificial sled simulation.
boi im playing it right now and ***you are so wrong***
ahh the good ol glow2:wave:buying yew logs 200gp!@!@!@!@!@!@!@!@
they didn't serve pizza at my school because it's unhealthy...
me too. i thought it's some reddit inside joke i don't get.
i think it has been phasing out because newer generations grow up with a keyboard and don't exactly need a whole class to learn about it. i had a *mandatory* class my freshman year of high school that was dedicated to the basics of computers and 90% of it was just typing. that was 15 years ago though.
as a non american i am kind of shocked that routinely feeding kids pizza is considered normal in the first place. explains those obesity rates i suppose.
yeah if i learned anything from my physics courses it was that my prof wanted us to send him nudes.
you delete your cookies? still sharing a computer with your mom?
everything on reddit it is an inside joke that i don't get. entertaining nevertheless
we got dominoes and we also got that square pan shit pizza. it was $2 for the shit pizza, a side, and a milk. or if you were on free lunch you got dominoes and fries.
portion sizes and having an extremely diverse range of foods readily available in most decently sized metro areas. very easy to eat a lot, eat often, and eat a wide variety so it doesn't seem like you're eating all that much. if you don't know the glorious magic that is barbecue in the deep south then you won't understand.
i looked at my asshole in the mirror today. it blew my fuckin mind!
i do it every 3 or 4 weeks. some people like to keep their pc clean. besides, i was talking about cookies and not my browsing history. also, what if i lived with my mom(i'm not)? you don't even know how old i am. a bit of a childish pointless comment.
it just goes to show you don't always have to put the most effort in. just ride on someone's coattails that did
wait what's that thing on reddit. oh the thing!! cmon guys, you know!? the thing, oh the fucking thing! like they put a random s or t somewhere!
you shut your whore mouth, this game is my life again.
this. i also learned the meaning of the words "ebony", "cosplay" and "lusty" through the computer. thanks elder scrolls.
wait, so the ones on free lunch got a better lunch as well?
i don't care what anyone says. barbecue ribs are healthy for you
oh ya ive been around since early irtl days. my name was similar to this except had 2 additional names attached. acronym for me was ppt. what was yours?
i just realized that i've never actually seen my own asshole, which is actually kind of insane.
well the second guy was funnier and more to the point.
i really really want it to be true, and i think it is, but the fact i want it so badly makes me sceptical of my ability to judge it. what do you think?
it's a sub that is a rival of /r/avoid5. but you should avoid that sub and join /r/avoid5. ps: awful sub is called /r/emboldenthee
probably because the domino's was donated and the normal school food was not
that's awesome! they recently started selling a totino's one that is strikingly similar at my neighborhood grocery store. cheap as chips, and just as amazing as i remember. although my ex thought they were disgusting. she was a private school chick, though. honestly, they probably are gross, but it's a nostalgia thing for me.
purplepurtleturtle or something like that? it sounds super familiar. lineridercrazy was mine, but i eventually changed it to lrc, lol. high school me was not good at naming things. another handle i had back then was shaunwhitefan.
your _ are uneven there. i bet you're not even the reel deadpool!
haha my school called it "government pizza." i loved it also.
if you don't have high pizza standards little caesars is heaven. well naw hungry howies actually but caesars is a runner up. people judge me for how much i love those zzas
welcome to the internet, where small, silly things meet a level of dedication previously reserved for masterpieces of art. my bet is unemployment and autism.
ah yes lrc of course! wow crazy man. hope things have been going well for you
it is indeed. he'll send anyone nudes, all you have to do is pay me 3.50
i never got ellio's in school. don't even know what they served i always packed. my parents wouldn't let me eat that junk luckily. i don't understand how we spend so much on school food and get shit in return
kind of eye opening when you think that all the great artists during the renaissance and throughout history could have been autistic and probably were, but modern medicine had not yet discovered such mental illnesses.
the internet is cool. :) hope things are going well for you too!
i ain't givin you no tree fitty you god damn loch ness monsta!
every time i read something about michaelangelo all i could think about was just how far up on the autism scale he'd have to be.
i actually decided to look through an old folder of random screenshots i have from old irtl days. unfortunately skimming through i couldnt find one of you which is too bad. woulda been a cool trip back. i didnt take many but i figured it was worth a shot. still, the internet is indeed cool.
unless we can get 200.000+ signatures on change.org again.
somewhere a college prof is nodding his head in silent approval
actually monster is better for ceo positions, in my city it let me apply for cfo of the city zoo.
1) no comment 2) no comment 3) no comment 4) no comment 5) no comment 6) no comment 7) saw a really cute picture of a kitten
like the beast rabban paving the way for feyd-rautha?
i think you deserve all the luck in the world, but the way you've done this *might* be perceived as putting him on the spot in public. you should maybe delete this comment and just pm or email the guy.
thank you! i really hope i live up to everyone's expectations. the good ones, at least.
of course that's what we're going to pretend. this is reddit.
i feel weird when i even talk about reddit irl. i can't imagine being furious over it.
i'm sure kn0thing is watching this with his bag of popcorn.
i guess no one bothered to find and delete inappropriate moderators retroactively. there's probably no good way to search for them?
i don't think we're going to get details anytime soon. a line like that is meant for the press, not for us.
for what it's worth, i truly feel that redditgifts has enriched my reddit experience and has engaged me far beyond typing words on a computer screen.
... on monday morning when he logs in and checks his email of course!
i know. welcome back. i hope your time away from reddit served you well. two things to remember: one, friday is ultimate werewolf day, and two, /r/subredditdrama is a fickle mistress. buena suerte :)
one of the first things my current dentist ever said to me was "wow, you are dressed like steve from blue's clues." i love that guy.
1) popcorn tastes good. 2) popcorn tastes good. 3) popcorn tastes good. 4) popcorn tastes good. 5) popcorn tastes good. 6) popcorn tastes good.
it will be like the hilary duff ama where only some crappy posts will get responses..... top post? yea right not touching that.
i will never, and i mean never, get tired of the obscure dune references that i see all over reddit.
no way, he got 200+ karma for that comment. no turning back now.
our expectations of you: 1. don't fuck up. 2. don't fuck up.
yep it's not like we've had years of problems now or anything. ellen just bought a time a machine a few months back and then she went back and fucked up that older stuff. that's how i remember it.
thank you for that clarification. presumably the san francisco direction came from the board, not the ceo anyway. similar to my thoughts on respecting the knowledge/contributions of /u/chooter and /u/kickme444 on their area of specialty, i would hope the board would listen to people that they've hired. does /u/spez have the authority to make changes? the other thing i think about with the sf moves is that by forcing everyone to be together, reddit had to have an office space physically large enough to hold them all, as well as all the costs associated with that. whereas if i was living in new york and working for you out of my own apartment, you're paying me the agreed upon salary/benefits and not out any money to provide me with a desk, computer, power, toilet, etc.
they are right on the user page. but i think we can all accept that he simply likes to eat humans. i mean, who doesn't?
also, as much as everyone on reddit would love it, they're not going to trash talk her on the news. this is just a non offensive way of moving forward.
it's enriched my number of guinness world record certificates, too.
the best is when you get terms of service updates near midnight on a weekend.
oh and every other saturday, we all post pictures of ourselves in penguin costumes. it's a thing now.
dude, you have to admit. you wanted to dress like steve from blue's clues. nobody puts on that outfit by coincidence.
/u/shitty_watercolour *and* /u/poem_for_your_sprog? dear diary, today was a good day.
steve co-founded hipmunk after he left reddit. alexis drew the chipmunk.
i'm pretty sure a bunch of people in /r/conspiracy predicted this would happen as soon as the victoria thing happened.
good night, i'll try to carry on what you started. as for the graph, that's a job for morning badoit1778
no one's claiming that, but the idiots that compared her to hitler and made death threats and basically acted like despicable excuses for human beings probably made a real human woman's life hell.
he could always create pay to subscribe subreddits...
we have a ceo who knows how the community works. he replied with a gif for god sakes. this is infinitely more better. more dank memes for all!
the valley worships with the cult of colocation. they continually bitch about how hard it is to find talent, salary inflation, living standards etc etc but they rarely question their commitment to the cult of colocation and its perceived benefits. which is funny because they then just toss everyone into a big open-plan floor space where productivity has been scientifically proven to evaporate and undo most of the benefits of putting people together. but hey, at least they can monitor everyone constantly and enforce morale.
so does half-life 3 get delayed by a month every time the bot mentions it? so everytime someone mentions it, it gets delayed by 2 months? thanks obama
that's what makes a good ceo. don't get caught with your foot in your mouth.
im still waiting on my secret santa present. it's still coming right?
no one reads those even if they were updated on a tuesday while reddit is down.
this comment is on par with /u/khalchris calling daniel radcliffe a 'filthy casual'.
s h i t t y g o p o e m d e a r o a n d i a r y d a y f o w a t e r c o l o u r a r r s p r o g **score**: 103
i interviewed with him for a product design job there and told him i didn't like the reddit ui when he asked about bad examples of user experience. needless to say, i didn't get the job...
yeah. i remember seeing a post. unless this ceo undoes the changes then reddit just got played
was just about to ask about that. are old warehouse subreddits being turned into vegan restaurant subreddits or something?
she's built like a steakhouse but she handles like a bistro!
oh geeze i didn't even notice that name and my kids are in the room. maybe i really *should* pay attention to usernames more..
i love how i see her pop up sometime so casually like a regular redditor.
have you seen obamarobot around? also, since i'm here... *cough* it's biden time!
i mean, i agree with the first part and certainly /u/kickme444 deserves all the credit for starting an amazing thing. but, maybe he wasn't a great employee or have much to offer? i honestly don't know. only he and the other employees of reddit really know. but, if he was let go for stupid reasons, then certainly it'd be cool to see /u/spez figure that out and extend an offer if it's appropriate.
you're not missing much, it's sticky and moist and gross and... and... *bursts into tears*
or when some guy corrected obama's spelling/grammar in his ama.
or to update this old ass markdown implementation.
oh i agree wholeheartedly. i think the lack of consistency, like with kids, created a majority of the problems we have. it's insane. but i think the process of implementing that policy will be one fraught with a great deal of fecal flinging from many people involved. that's like the president of the us saying "we need to create a clear corruption and ethics policy for politics". it's one of the most necessary things, but would cause the biggest shitstorm with the possible issues it could create and implications in the short term. as we've seen, we redditors are a fickle, fickle, bunch.
i don't mean this to sound as judgmental as it probably does, but that's weird.
damn it, i'm going to miss strolling through all that urban decay on sunny autumn days... :(
she's like their victoria. imagine if they fired her
need me to bring anything? maybe a wine or a side dish?
according to wikipedia, one of the reddit founders was a major contributor to the creation of markdown. maybe he could update it.
how else are you gonna know who's a filthy presser?
they really need to bring back some type of reddit mold hybrid.
if you have any children or a spouse it would be appreciated
full of minerals that will probably cause cancer also, there's fluoride
maybe she posts pictures of non osha compliant actions while at work?
i see a new bestselling novel in the future: "if you give a cannibal a kid..." (he's going to want the mother, father, and brother too.)
~~you appear to be confused about how copyright works. copyright is not criminal law, so it already requires the copyright holder to take (civil) legal action against potential infringers. this arrangement essentially incorporates the active use "clause" you mentioned. [incorrect]~~ would the government care about copyright infringement that caused zero financial loss to anyone? i don't think they would. the problem is that copyright lasts 90 years after the creator's death instead of something more sensible like only 20 or 30 years after the creator's death. * excessively long copyright is one problem. another problem especially relevant here is the act of treating content in the public domain as if it had been newly copyrighted by digitizing it. that is a large part of what jstor does. the offensiveness of (de facto) copyrighting the public domain is probably what first attracted swartz to trying to pirate their content.

breaking news: dog memes on the rise /r/memeeconomy
black lab mix. looks very much like our lab/border collie mix
my dog sits next to me while i am on my laptop and slowly shifts his weight so that he is nudging the computer off my lap and simultaneously inserting himself into that space. if i let him do it, over the course of 5-10 minutes he will end up draped across my lap with his head on the keyboard. and yes, it is very annoying.
this is actually very, very true. give an inch and they will take a mile. this dog was very cute though.
my dog is a bit of a disappointment. she will pick up her favorite ball, run up to me, show it to me, jump up and down, bite down on the ball... and then not let me have the ball. if i somehow track her down and get a hold of it, she will go nuts until i throw it, go chase, and then resume teasing me with the ball. i get the impression she wants to play 'chase' more than 'fetch'.
dogs within memes are a pretty stable investment. especially with the introduction to /r/wholesomememes as a new market for memes, even old dog memes, previously thought to be retired, have value. due to the large distaste of 2016, the start of 2017 has a high demand for more motivational, happy, cute memes rather than the dank dark memes of 2016. there will be surges in the upcoming months as current events unfold and the market naturally fluctuates. but overall i would say that dog memes are always good to squirrel away for one of those rainy days when you want to make someone laugh and cash in on some light karma.
yeah, but you say that like it's a bad thing. if mine didn't insist on walks at a regular schedule, i would do nothing but sit and waste time on video games. he's the best personal trainer i know.
this is why i have dogs and no kids. plus its fun comparing your dogs to your friend's kids.
my dog regularly knocks my phone out of my hand with her paw.
as the owner of this dog i can confidemtly say it's still really cute. probably because he's pretty good after being told no. he has gotten really good at throwing his toys himself, so he'll usually just throw a toy on our lap and if we say no, he'll throw the toy around the house and chase it.
and she'll still love me just the same if she waits for me to finish the goddamn level before we go play. :p
your only response to make up for it is to act like a dog. roll around happy on the floor with it, then bury it in the backyard to suprise him with later. make your doggy proud he trained you well!
my roommates dog does this. i don't think it's so much a mental disconnect as it is conditioning. the way that food falls on a plate over a table is the same or similar way that food can ricochet or drop and end up on the floor, which the dog has learned before and is looking out for now. so when they look on the floor to find food you dropped on your plate, i don't think they're surprised when they don't find anything, they're just disappointed that it wasn't a drop lucky enough to end up with food on the floor. dogs are just this desperate for our scraps.
oh my goodness my dog loses his mind when he sees dogs or horses on tv. barking/wagging his tail/running around. he doesn't know what to do with himself. worst time was when i put the puppy bowl on when he was a puppy. he got his favorite toy and brought it over to the other puppies, barking and wagging his tail. he wanted to play with them. broke my heart. no puppy bowl ever again.
exactly like our dog. she loves to be chased around.
if she were allowed outside, i fully expect that to happen one day. i might have made a mistake when i named her and her sister from a different litter. i adopted two six-month old tortie kittens who were kennel mates a little over a year ago at the local animal shelter. i'm a fan of avatar: the last airbender, so i named the black tortie azula (her markings remind me of dark smoke and tongues of flame). the blue tortie i named katara. now the mistake is that these two cats have the personality of their namesakes. azula is crazy all over the place, while katara is contemplative. they do get along together, but every once in a while play between the two turns a bit more intense.
this happened to my dog when we first rescued her. she had just been pregnant, and stupidly we bought her a toy puppy which she seemed to like. i kept throwing it for her, she would fetch it and hop up on the sofa and i'd throw it again, thinking we were playing a nice game of fetch. it turned out that she was nesting or whatever it is they do and she actually thought it was her puppy. we asked the vet for advice and they said to take it away until her hormones settled down. she was really sad for a day or so and i felt terrible :(
same with my gf's. i like to think she's watching out for me. except sometimes she'll claw at the toilet seat while i'm still on there, almost like she's demanding to see what i produced so she can inspect it and watch intently as it swirls around and disappears when i flush. ...she was the runt of the litter haha
that is the classic labrador mixed with anything chest marking. i think you are right.
it's me, your dog. time for that walk fatass! woof woof
haha. well, everyone knows what's best for them! i am fortunate to have had children (now grown) and many many dogs and cats over the years. they were all great life choices, and i wouldn't change a thing, for me. the one thing about children vs fur children is that at 18, adult children are now amazingly interesting young people just really coming into their own. however, at 18, your lovely fur child is, if you were lucky to have held it so long, on it's way out. still, both are like cold pizza! still good!
when i'm playing pc games, my dog will jump up and sit in a kitchen chair next to me (for my so when he comes in to talk to me). she will reach over with her paw and slowly start pulling my mouse arm towards her until i start petting her haha. if i ignore her too long she will just start leaning really hard into me until she almost pushes me out of my chair. it doesn't happen often so i think its so cute when she does it.
and i didn't realize how much my dog meant to me until after he was gone. enjoy the time you have with others. it's worth it.
when his kitten was younger (and smaller) he would bring him to me.
my dog remembers where we kept the marshmallows. we haven't had marshmallows for almost a year. i'll be cooking dinner and all of the sudden he's standing beside me staring at the drawer. so i tell him they aren't in there. he insists by booping the drawer with his nose. so i open it up and let him look. he sees there are no marshmallows. he gives me that face, goes to the couch, and pouts.
it's the eyebrows changing that makes me laugh every time
yeah but it's like.. puppy, what do you want me to grab on to? the majority of the toy is in your mouth!
it's too cute. desperate is the right word, my little guy is so pitiful looking while i'm eating. have to say though, he's very well behaved. he never begs, and i can lay my plate down where it's very much reachable to him and if he wanted to he could take it and run, but he never will. he knows what's mine and what's his. he's a good boy.
i've tried that, but she only brings back one (and still doesn't give it to me). the other is still across the room and i have to fetch it myself.
aw! the poor girl. at least your intentions were good. i think my pup was looking forward to cuddling with his fox and ripping all of its fur out...i guess he was being lazy and didn't want to keep chasing after his new found catch of the day, haha...good thing they easily forgive!
can confirm. source: had a black/chocolate mix with a superman logo on her chest. fuck i miss having a dog.
i know this sounds stupid but i've never seen a dog sigh or burp as much as mine and i do both those things all the time at home. me and my wife always joke that he learned it from me but maybe he actually did
it's dangerous to teach dogs how to read. that's how the vietnam war started.
yep. when they're gone, you'll regret all the time you wasted ignoring them for what? facebook? video games? you were their whole world, and you brushed them off for literally nothing. the last few months of my dog's life i was really busy with college, i didn't walk her or spend time with her as much as i could have and i still feel like a piece of shit for it. i vowed to do better when she was gone, so when my wolfdog wants to play, i play. there's nothing i do that's so important that i can't take a 10 minute break to go run around the back yard.
same here with my golden. when i get home from work we have to keep a toy by the door so he doesn't walk around with a shoe. the butt wiggle accompanied by a low pitch *hooarrgghhrrggllelllllllllgrrrrrrl* and getting him more excited only makes the noises more hilarious
yep, did this with my mom's pit bull, amazing how quick it worked and how it completely stopped this dog from jumping on people.
get some more. or volunteer at a shelter if you have nowhere to keep them. my heart breaks every time i have to say goodbye to my fur babies, but i always end up getting just one more. there are so many out there who need our love, and frankly, we need their love even more.
i *just* realized that the different panels are literally the same drawing zooming in with only the eyebrows changing. this one now has new life for me hahahaha
hot steamy jesus, they're dogs. they don't care if your hand gets in their mouth a little and they're not going to bite you.
awww my flatcoat did that. mooing with joy and mentally wagging its tail!
if you ask me, it's hard *not to* get another dog. after i lost my last one, i only waited a couple weeks to get a new one. a lot of people said it as too soon but i didn't care, was too wierd not having a dog in the house. not a single regret that i didn't wait because i now have the sweetest and happiest dog i've ever met.
"dogs reacting to being called a good boy is the wholesome meme we've been looking for all these years!" says u/ervin_pepper of the chicago tribune
maybe it's because redditors post the same pictures over and over again?
my dog just likes to play chase. he'll walk up to me with the toy in his mouth and if i get my hand with the same postal code of him, he sprints away at mach 4.
i understand completely. i am torn about volunteering too, since i cry when watching "old yeller." now that i am retired, i want to help, but am unsure if i can handle the emotional side and end up being a dog hoarder.
so buzzfeed's gonna have a bunch of memes tomorrow about this or something?
i have been on reddit for 3 years, i have posted hundreds of comments, maybe even thousands, in a variety of subreddits, and you are the first person who has ever replied with the reference that my username is referring to. thank you, comrade vlad. much obliged
this is my dachshund's number one game. while my friend's dachshund will gladly bring what you threw...mine will only bring it back about 2-3 ft away from me and proceed to sprint off if i even make any motions to the toy. it's def a game you have to be in the mood for...
understand that a dog's mouth is both his mouth and hand. they can be extremely precise with their mouths. just like you and your hands.
my dog and i play "bito" where she will play attack me and bite my hands while i wave them around her face. i think this may be some kind of ritual thing for her, but am no expert. she has accidentally bitten me a couple of times, but mostly it's getting "toothed" with my hand and her teeth colliding. i have taken to wearing gloves when we do this now since it minimizes the damage.
what the heck. i didnt have to teach my momma dog not to bite through her kids neck or my other dogs not to tear each other up while they were playing.
that's surprising, considering how popular the wire if on here.
it's an especially fun game when he manages to snag a pair of underwear or something he knows he shouldn't have, so you can't just stop playing.
my dog is so gentle with my hands. he used to draw blood when he was younger but now he's so gentle, he totally doesn't want to hurt me when we wrestle.
exactly what i was talking about. there's a whole lot of "your sweet little baby wouldn't hurt a fly" on this sub. even if that were true (it's not), it doesn't have to be intentional.
no, because her "momma dog" taught her. it is a learned behavior.
to be fair, it's a super specific reference. i only picked as my little shout out to prop joe
i did the same when raising my dogs. one of them always bit too hard and i read in dog training books that you're supposed to yelp. supposedly it's the same reaction as if they played with the rest of their litter and they learn the difference between a hard bite and soft bite.
ugh... you are a good person. fuck your stupid boyfriends and his last owners. with love from the internet, cv
exactly! does no one on this bloody site understand what a nondisclosure agreement is?
could you shed some light on the "last employee"? don't think i was around for that one.
you either die an admin or live long enough to see yourself host your own ama
she could however talk about what she's going to do in the future and speak around anything an nda would cover.
more than that, i'm sure she signed an additional non-disparagement agreement in order to get her severance and continue benefits. can't blame her. now, if someone else is somehow able to get the true story from her, he/she could convey it in a way that doesn't peg her as the source.
it actually made it to 14k upvotes (twice). both times upvotes were suddenly cut in half. now its at 5k. something's definitely up.
which they can, now. it's one, big, gay, whistleblower wedding!
ne questions, it just gets gilded like a million times. actually that would mean buying gold. idk. some shit along those lines.
my guess is they are prepping for 1. sale to an outside company. 2. pay access. and ditching people with issues with 1 and/or 2. but im wrong a lot.
reddit's largest stake holder is conde nast, which is a subsidiary of advance publications, a multi-billion dollar enterprise. i really doubt any bigwig's contract includes a clause about getting bonuses of $4
she got fired by the company. the website loves her.
we might be taking a break from "reddit gold" for a while automoderator.
what if she liked dr. pepper, ever thought of that smart guy?
you deserve gold but reddit doesn't deserve my money!
he said he was laid off and talked shit so yishan, the ceo at the time came in and said he was fired for being an incompetent dumb ass and basically torpedoed the guys entire future.
i really hope she didn't have to sign an nda to get a severance package or something.
if she needs time to recover from the stress of being jobless and such, tell her there is no rush whatsoever. her well-being is the most important
well they could before, just not in parts of the us. and the us doesn't affect them since they'd end up in gitmo before they made it to the courthouse.
yeah don't let that happen. just reply to everything with "tom cruise" and call it a day.
new gold feature: you can only access non default subreddits if you're gilded.
yes exactly. no buying gold until all of this has been sorted out.
that wouldn't be very professional. even if she had done something terrible, it's in everyone's best interest to say nothing.
wow, she's helping with the ama of the 2006 time person of the year?
i wonder how much he actually meant that apology, or if he was advised to make it.
id have to move it off my homepage to have the same effect lol
public masturbation existed before the internet you know.
considering that she hasn't said anything when she could have before, this is most likely though.
she said this wouldn't be an optimal time until everything settles down. maybe she will get her job back.
you know that reddit has a few years of gold more than required? /r/thebutton paid 6,5 months of gold in 2 months. so we'd have to give no gold for a very long time.
and that's an excellent point, too. sadly, even if she was 100% in the wrong, the community will likely never know, so this assumption that she was wrongly fired will go on.
had to look that up. really cool cover by time, clever i'd say!
i need to be reminded of this comment in the week once it's completed lol
you have reddit as your homepage? how do you accomplish anything?
dang. three pages over? i have it right in the middle of my home screen. it takes up way too much of my life i think.
now i wanna make vacation brochures for other websites. tumblr; come and explore your sjw side! facebook; everyone you hate! 4chan; the department of state warns u.s. citizens against all but essential travel to 4chan. travel within 4chan remains dangerous given the security situation.
i heard that there's two of them now, they alternate every 12 hours
i'm starting to think it'll be impressive if reddit makes it long enough to still have "annual things".
how can the front page exist if reddit no longer exists?
have you properly researched health hazards of either eating underwear or not delivering on a promise to the people of reddit? either way, too late. you're on the hook now.
it's about the symbolic gesture in these dire times, not about the actual money acquired. i'd say that until we receive a proper explanation and a ***sincere*** excuse over all of this, we stop giving gold altogether.
that's actually a good tip. you don't need to be the best, you just need to be better than the worst.
snape kills gandalf on the bridge of the enterprise.
it's often misunderstood by people who only read the title though. it's not just dedicated to literally everyone
my last semester's 2.75 gpa would like to show you how i do it
there's so much else on tumblr besides "sjw stuff" though. how it works is, you only see what you choose to follow. and the porn is great.
there is but it's a disjointed fucked up way to internet just opening google.com and thinking of things to internet. life before reddit on the internet is a blur.
how can the front page exist if reddit no longer exists? ftfy
i have enough heart problems where i'll probably die before 40, 30 if i continue my current diet :p
i fell off reading as well, but those keyboard man... i had dreams trying to figure them out.
and yet any time someone says we should stop giving gold that comment gets gilded.
okay with the exception of the sf move (which even that i guess i can understand) those are dumb ideas in hindsight but i'd take someone being enthusiastic and trying their best over this.
no, absolutely not. but the rapidity at which /u/dehrmann beat tracks and dissappeared does not lend credit to his case. an employee terminated unfairly due to office politics or a grudge would have put up more fight that that.... certainly one as vocal as dehrmann. it would be interesting to track down /u/dehrmann; in that ama he said he had already had a new job lined up; and see if he's turned a new leaf and gets his work done, or whether he's bounced from there as well.
i can't tell if that's supposed to be good or not.
i know, i use tumblr more that i use reddit. i was just joking.
i seriously can't remember anymore. i think there was neopets? and yahoo?
are you implying you would eat said underwear regardless of reaching this milestone?
even the relocation doesnt seem too unreasonable as a business decision. i was expecting to learn what a shitty person yishan really was, not "uhhh he made a bitcoin clone and sold some reddit t-shirts"...
it's impressively average. 2.0 is passing for most american universities, while 4.0 is all a's.
i will eat some garlic shrimp with angel hair pasta if we can get victoria to do an ama.
so if i get good enough at musical chairs i could potentially become president?
yeah, it's hard to monetise a site like reddit. i'd rather they merchandise than try to sanitise the site for sponsorships and ads.
many programs require maintaining a 3.0 or 3.25 in your major. 2.0 passing would be pretty rare i think.
owners expect a return on the their investment. there's only so much revenue to be had from selling kitschy snoo stuff. if anyone wants discussion groups with no corporate owners (actually no owners at all) and no ads other than what the spammers post, they should go to usenet newsgroups.
well that's just some grade inflation there then, isn't it.
i don't mean any offense, i know nothing about children. but is it possible to convince/teach him that he should not do that
being senile is great, you get a chance to meet new people everyday!
i mean, i appreciated the shit out of my light up shoes when i was seven. i loved those things.
imagining that scenario gave me the biggest smile i've experienced in weeks.
i love old man curses. i say em all the time "oh for the love of pete" my favorite is "oh for cryin in a bucket" close runners up would be dagnabit, and horsefeathers
even down to the wearing diapers and pooping your pants.
the hate train came to town unfortunately and downvoted the living shit out of it afterwards.
i kind of miss college (i don't miss the hours of homework though) but i like having money and more free time in my dead-end 9-5 job nowadays. although soon i'll be having a baby so we'll see how i feel after that! either way i'm a helluva lot happier than i was as a kid in an abusive household, and a depressed social outcast in high school.
holy shit i totally forgot about that video. thanks for reminding me!
can confirm. i work in the dining room of a retirement home. yesterday i witnessed a lady dance her chicken legs across her plate while singing a little song, and had an entire table of old people insist on calling the potato wedges "potato wedgies" and giggle about it.
i remember the power went out one day in kindergarten. realizing i was the only one who could shed some light on the situation, i ran around the classroom like a maniac, trying to help everyone see... then i accidentally kicked someone in the face. whoops.
i like the younger generation's versions such as "shut the front door!" or "back the truck up!"
"these are some pretty neat shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhoooooookkh my god charlie is hiding in the shooooooeeeeeeeesssss!"
that was my first thought too when i saw his reaction. it wasnt until he recovered from being startled that he saw there was no imminent danger of death. then the big smile, like a kid on a roller coaster, oh i am not going to die, this is fun!
yeap my dad is nearing 60 and he was in high school during nam.
just wait until you are 47! every year is the best year of my life. however, a friend of mine who is now 60 says that stopped for him last year. :-(
this for me, as well. i'm happier because i'm way better at solving the problems life throws at me than when i was younger, not because i have less stressors in my life. i'm also better at enjoying life and making the most of my time. i spent my youth glued to video games. i spend my adulthood glued to video games in a way nicer chair and with frequent breaks for outdoorsy stuff. but mostly video games.
you mean 9 - 6 with 1 hour lunch and 2 hours of driving so 12 hour day not counting time to get ready and some cool off time so maybe an hour or 2 to yourself each of 5 days out of 7 a week. so you get 2 days and about 10 off hours to yourself each week. we've created a hell on earth.
everyone loves to complain about their job, but i sit here and reddit for a few hours a day, i make okay money, and i can probably go other places with my experience. i get up to get coffee or go to the bathroom when i need and no one bothers me and most of my coworkers are at least tolerable.
i once asked an elderly pt "how do you feel" "eh?" i repeated 3 more times, getting progressively louder. on the last "how do you feel?!?" practically screamed in his face. he wriggled his fingers at me, "with my hands!" with a twinkle in his eye.
i think a part of it is that as our children come into their own as adults, we feel much less pressure to be role models and examples. as a result, we let the guard down a bit more and allow them to see our inner child a lot more often.
it's because it's probably clipped from a longer video, and hosted by evolve as click bait at an attempt at viral marketing
i mean these are really neat thanks charlie, i mean bill
i'm honestly jealous :-( i need to give less fucks.
ok, 40 now... fun stops at 59. #59 #- 40 = better get cracking
and the high school girls? how are we in that department?
they are also more likely to get ill and die prematurely. they are more prone to addiction of all sort of things, which as a result may lead to overdose.
but are they happier now than they were then? i think that's the topic we're on anyway.
if it makes you feel better, i'm a senior computer science major without a job so i have neither.
really? man different perspectives are awesome. here i am, average 30 year old joel about to have my second child and thinking, "yeah he's already had kids, a fulfilling life, retirement, he's got nothing to lose anymore!" at no point did i wonder if an old man would worry about looking cool. fuck i'm already an embarrassing dad and i feel like i have soooo many more fucks to give.
the evolution of dad joke, the grandad joke. you were played by a master.
same. i think it's because of the subbed line "get outta town". it could only really be said with one voice in my mind and his voice fits that bill.
you and me, both. i love reddit as a group, but i can't understand its hatred towards videos.
protip: find something you love. do that thing. when something negative happens just think, "fuck this, i am going back to doing what i love". fill your life with only the best things in your life, and every morning while making your coffee/tea/cap'n crunch remind yourself how great your life has become, and work toward what can make your life a little better at a time.
you know you're old when the throwback movie to your youth is itself too old to be remembered.
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck. don't remind me about the mind wars. that's gonna suck. hard. my brain already hurts.
well that is great to hear! my friend is still enjoying life. his reasoning was more about how your body really starts to fall apart quickly and you don't have the energy that you used to. eh, he still seems happy to me when he is not complaining about his back!
are you *trying* to get me to commit suicide? because that's feckin' savage, mate.
well that's true i was kind of referencing a less modern us. but now i understand what your getting at.
how do you feel, cricket1904? geez, you *are* old.
it's not that i don't like videos, but there are so many times where having the sound play on a video would disturb those around me. i'm not gonna use headphones every minute of the day either.
but everytime i play world of warcraft my wife hands me a baby.
my grandma would ask anyone anything. zero fucks left. if called on being rude by family after, she'd say, "i'm a little old lady? what are they going to do to me?"
wouldn't got the lettuce if i knew they wouldn't fit wouldn't got the cheese if i knew they wouldn't fit wouldn't got the peppers if i knew they wouldn't fit wouldn't got half of it
to alleviate this, netflix starts streaming dazed and confused oct 1st.
... and call me a conspiracy theorist, but don't you think that the mind wars had something to do with that great magnetic reversal? shit's about to get real!
until the great recycling crisis of 2078. nobody cared that the poor were going missing. nobody cared that meat farms were all shut down but the meat kept coming. nobody cared until the laughing disease struck down almost a billion people over the next month - almost half of the surviving humans.
yeah, chronic pain can be hard for people to overcome. i know a lot of my friends my age are trying hard to get in and stay in shape so that the energy is there. helps that now there is a lot more time to exercise than when the kids were young.
go down into the basement and ungag them, i almost guarantee they'll say something to you.
holy shit they do booze?! this changes everything.
cleary they choose to remove the shoe laces. in doing that you both go wireless and hole-less.
no, i'm a girl and sometimes i wear high heels, which is perfect training for regular walking in heelys. the only time i have trouble is if a parking lot has some pea gravel in it. it turns the whole shoe into a skate, your foot will slip. it's just up to you whether you slowly sink to the ground because no brakes or if you're walking fast enough, bust your ass. i have some pretty cool scars but having wheels on your shoes is like asking to get them.
i don't think so. i actually read her story assuming she was male, and it wasn't any different honestly.
yep. you can either have moments of total amazement, change your perspective on life, feel totally fulfilled in having the job of preparing someone for the world, to better the world, be more terrified than you ever thought possible, frustrate yourself to the point of insanity, and hate yourself, and your own parents sometimes, or.... just continue on your path as it is.
i could have sound find things you love i suppose. yes, being well rounded is important (in interests, not appearance). for me i hated driving, so when i moved to a city where i didn't need a car i ditched it and just kept my bicycles. when i am out cycling i bring a notebook around to write down ideas (ux design, data science stuff, etc) and take photos. doing what i love is actually the only reason i am not any fatter. when people exert themselves physically they have dopamine released, so it is likely that finding something to do will not make them fat. there are even professional gamers not fat, so meh. **newly revised sentiment. find something you love mentally, and find something you love physically. do those things.**
get ready for that to happen more and more often. but also consider that wayne's world came out almost 25 years ago. when you were a kid in the 90s how many movies from the 70s did you really watch? i know i watched a few, but the 'style' of many were just too old and slow for me at that point. i imagine kids today feel the same way about the movies we grew up with, so it makes sense.
that sounds horrible. here, have some new coke, it'll help.
oooh i haven't perused the entertainment industry of /r/conspiracy lately... goodbye productive tuesday
soylent green is *people*! soylent green is *people*! soylent blue is.... well, nobody's really sure what *that* shits made of. hopefully, not worse than *people*! soylent green is *people*!
that is a good point. i spend almost all my free time with my two young kids. before i had kids i spent that time mountain biking all the time. once they are in college, hello free time again. or hello second job at mcdonalds!
i had heelys when i was in 4th or 5th grade, i remember there being an insert you could put in place of the wheels so you could walk normally
yep, all those emotions are usually within the same three minutes.
you won't get the appreciation you deserve for this either because i had the same exact response as your post
heathen, obviously he needs to get his hands on some crystal pepsi.
i've been part of the dead generation since i was born
soylent blue is puppies. continue eating soylent green.
yeah but it's terribly inconvenient to change them and you aren't always thinking about it. i can get away with just wearing the whole bit and carrying the plugs in my purse. very rarely do i have to actually put them in. super side effect: the shoes themselves are 13 years old. they're still as comfy as the day i bought them. easily the most durable shoe i've ever owned. i would gladly buy another pair and never put wheels in them just so i could have a pair of indestructible shoes.
seems like we're all just really enjoying ourselves here this morning!

for real. changing those wheels to the inserts was harder than changing the tire of a car. plus, i think losing one of those inserts is part of being a heelys owner.

if i dressed up as my dog's favorite thing i would be a turd. he doesn't play with toys but he loves to eat his own poop.
like when lloyde told harry "she actually talked to me"
and the moment it sniffs and knows precisely who it is.
was convinced it was going to be the dog panicking and running away for a cheap laugh. pleasantly surprised when the dog approached with reverence and awe.
mine too. i buy a couple of cheap plush toys for him to destroy every so often. have you ever seen a wolf pulling the fur off of its food?
one of those weird ones -- can a dog have the interpretive skills to understand that's a giant-ass gumby?
holy shit, that is crazy. wonder if it's anything to do with the reddit backend weirdness that's been happening recently.
we used to give my golden small waterballoons, he loved them and would gently carry them around. he would get sad if he busted one.
dogs can't even distinguish between green, yellow or red objects based on their color, and instead heavily rely on smells to identify things. my guess is this dog realizes their owner is being silly and is having fun with that.
yeah... this is super cute but the dog's reaction is less "oh wow a giant toy?!" and more "what the hell... uum... *sniff* oh hey, dave!"
yeah it's super annoying that many people can't read emotions of their own pets
my dog loses her shit if you put a ball cap on. no fucking way she could handle gumby.
they can recognize different toys when referred to them by name, and pick them out of a pile. source - my own chocolate lab
nah reddit just loves cats, and everyone knows that dogs are the best cats.
i had a black lab :( if only i could retrieve her.
she's a mix, but i have no idea what else she's mixed with. have any pics of yours?
have a golden who also loves rubber ducks! he just gently carried them around (like 10 or so floating around the house) for over a year. then one day something snapped and he ripped almost all of them to shreds and just carries around the surviving ducks' mangled headless corpses.
can confirm this is typical "oh my god it's my owner it's cuddle time" behaviour, probably doesn't realize the connection to the toy at all. source: have owned a dog.
go wait for your stupid peppa pig to come to life!
it's amazing how dogs can smell stuff and know exactly how to act, like when mine recognises my brothers dog isn't a threat or when he smells the vet and knows to shit on the floor.
unless he has some sort of cooling aperatus underneatg
neeeaaaoooooo, faarf, whoooooff, yarf, aaarf ftfy
apologising for being thoughtful is silly, your words are just as important as everyone else's here, it's the beauty of reddit.
yeah, the dogs barked and shit at walrus guy when he had adam face on. but when adam had walrus guy mask on they loved
yeah, but that's a completely different skill set from being able to recognize that a person in a felt suit is supposed to be the same thing as your six inch stuffed toy. for that matter, the example you give is the result of training, not the innate understanding that this toy is named fred.
see, that's what i'm assuming has happened more. dog doesn't care whether or not he's gumby, he's just "is that master? is that master? it is master!"
that made me laugh for a second then i remembered the context and now i'm sad.
if dave became a vet, would dogs be afraid of him?
dave is a great name for a dog. my cats names are rupert and phillip.
this. we keep calling them gifs, but really they're a short silent mp4 or webm or something. in reality, gifs are terrible; low quality video, limited color swatch, huge files and take forever to download... most video formats work way better. /* this is why the gifv bot exists, when you use imgur and ask for a gifv it converts the gif to one if these formats before delivering it.
perhaps the hardest thing to do is to retrieve your feels?
hahaha this response is representative of everything i am as a person.
a quick google search led me to the comedy central show triptank.
i find it to be the most infuriatingly uninteresting subreddit in existence.
"he harried around rocks in how mouth." sounds like you're harrying rocks in how mouth.
that's fair. i have a pug beagle mix and she's right in the middle of her fall-time sheddiness, i can't imagine how much worse it is with a bigger dog.
in my experience, people and dogs who work together have the closest relationships. source: grew up in texas, cattle dogs and hunting dogs everywhere.
yeah initially it was just higher quality versions of reaction gifs and classic gifs with text. now it's meta circlejerking short films.
yeah, there's one on there right now with predator, and it's pretty good but only has like 500 upvotes, in comparison to the meta ones that get like 5k.
hey, that self sucking takes a lot of effort! you can't learn that shit overnight.
dude, don rosa's 'the life and times of scrooge mcduck' is a masterpiece of western literature. we love 'em ducks over here. i never got america's love affair with superheroes, when there's the duck clan of duckburg, calisota.
blue heeler and other cattle dog owner here. we definitely don't call cattle dogs blue heelers most of the time (unless they actually are blue heelers).
i have seen the opposite (on occasion). people that see dogs as "tools" seem unable to see them as loving pets and treat them only as a thing and not a thinking creature. which i find disturbing.
yeah. if my dog isn't fetching he is not happy. i can't keep his favorite frisbee out of his mouth. 24/7 he has it
i totally get why people hate it but i love it. it feels like an actual community once you spend some time there.
this! i remember spending my birthday money to get that book as a kid and not regretting it a bit. also, remember crying at one point of the story. donald duck was also huge in my country - in addition to the donald duck magazine published every week or two (can't remember), there was a big series of comic books called giant that would come out once a month and had loads of stories, all of which of tremendous quality. still remember many of them almost twenty years later!
i have only seen man - dog relationships like that in movies.
do people actually hate it? i thought that was all part of the meta. i can't tell where the meta ends and reality begins.
i'm from germany, you'd be welcome anyway though :d
mine got neutered last week. the vet gave us sedatives because of his breed. he doesn't give a fuck. he learned on day three that if he just stays active he can beat the sedative. i think he runs around more sedated and off balance than he does when he's not sedated. if he chills out for a minute his head will start to drop and his eyes close and he'll realize what's happening and then snap he jumps straight up and just starts going again. you'll never take me alive he says.
i think that really captures the feel of wwi. like, "last month i was a dirt farmer and now the sky is falling"
he runs to the end of the zeppelin and jumps off doing a 360 no scope to an enemy pilot and then lands in the cockpit of the stolen plane and flies off into the sunset
someone needs to make a 'behind the gif' of this...
seriously, that was probably the coolest bf video i've ever seen even if it was something so simple.
*"i saw him deploy a parachute at 100 feet! his genes need to carry on"*
"oh crap oh crap oh crap, oh crap on a crap cracker!"
dishonor! dishonor on you! dishonor on your family! dishonor on your cow!
in reality, zeppelins could fly high enough that most planes' and ground-based weapons couldn't reach them. also, their interiors were segmented so a few punctures wouldn't deflate them, and regular bullets and shrapnel proved not to ignite them. special explosive and incendiary rounds had to be developed to do the job. when the war began, zeppelins were the most developed form of aviation in the world, and were the one area where germany were firmly ahead of everyone else. it would have been dumb *not* to try to use them to their advantage, despite their vulnerabilities.
i love that glance they give each other when they're blasting.
-music cuts-. freeze frame. "i bet youre wondering how i got on top of that burning zepplin."..
maybe the fire consumes the oxygen? that's the whole point of flamethrowers. point it into a bunker and asphyxiate everyone inside, and of course burn them to death. but, you know, from the lungs-out.
it comes out when the losing team falls behind by a certain degree, to give them a fighting chance. it can seat multiple players and has some hellacious firepower, and it takes a lot to destroy it. but when it does go...and it almost always does eventually...it's pretty amazing to watch. it's absolutely massive, so you end up in these nightmare-like scenarios where you're running, and *feel* like you should be safely out of the way...it doesn't look like it's coming down or moving laterally all that fast. but that's because it's so fucking huge. it's still over you. still over you. still over you. splat. some maps have an armored train or a battleship instead. it's not the same though.
then he pulls up, ejects, fires rpg at jet behind him, it destroys the jet, but not before the pilot ejects as well, so he switches to his sniper and headshots him in the air, wait a minute the jet did a full loop, he gets back in the jet. now the gif can end
good thing everybody follows all the rules of war!
i see amazing bf1 vids all the time on reddit. maybe it's time to just break down and buy the game. be a part of the madness!
he probably just died from the flames, nothing badass happened or it would have been in the video
yes, but parachutes take longer to deploy to prevent parachute spamming from pevious battlefields where you would jump off a one story building and hit the parachute button to prevent damage. ao depending on the height ot might be better to try to wait it out. also sometimes the zepplin falls at an angle so running off the side would just put you in the way of it
100 feet? do you want to get sniped out of the air? 10ft only.
i miss it. apparently you can play it for free somewhere and the servers are pretty active.
nah, it was the choppers blaring the ride of the valkyries for me.
sabotaging vehicles in that game was the best. invisibility cloak behind enemy lines, hide rdx in the back of a jeep, wait for a poor sap to jump in, wait for them to drive out of the base then... boom! i got a whole squad like that once. i hate that vehicles don't spawn in bases now.
well...it is a decade old. i honestly didn't think it was as bad as alot of people said it was.
it's an autogyro. a hybrid between a helicopter and a plane. so yes, technically they could do a slow moving hover.
sometimes i feel like every single thing that happened in the history of aviation is a super cool story. thx for the info
a redditor stealing content! now i've heard it all.
are we doing phrasing still? because if we are, somebody say so
i was thinking more like: fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
"well, it all started three weeks ago when..." *vhs rewinding*
and that is why the thermobaric bomb is the most terrifying weapon in modern war. you might survive the initial strike, but that blast is going to form a vacuum so strong it pulls your lungs out your mouth.
it is such a better gimmick than the bf4 levolutions. i thought at first i'd hate the behemoths but they haven't gotten old yet. they feel balanced enough for the most part.
well, if you don't, you'll get a strongly worded letter from the league of nations sent to your house
the geneva article only provides protection to crews ejecting from doomed aircraft. upon leaving their aircraft, they are considered non-combatants and it is a war crime to fire on them. if they open fire while descending, however, they void their protection. paratroopers, on the other hand, are not protected by the geneva article, and are legitimate targets even while descending.
it's pretty fun once you get a few levels under your belt. until then you're getting mauled by shot guns and russian snipers.
it was a joke, sorry. i assumed we all had some zeppelin reels.
im sorry, but swooping down in an f4 phantom and napalming half the enemy team has gotta be the best thing ever from bf:v
i've seen a dragon fly. i've seen a horse fly. heck, i've even seen a house fly. but i be done seen bout everything when i see a redditor lie.
exactly, and to hit him with artillery at that distance.. you'd need to aim so high you wouldn't see the blimp
no, i'm pretty sure that by the time the clip starts, it's already on to "fffuuuuuuuuuuuuucccccckkkkkkkk!!!!"
don't underestimate the power of a successful comic book franchise either. if he'd made the same movie 20 years ago starring a superhero that was a household name, it might have gotten 2 sequels as well.
i couldn't even pass the first level. i believe it was the plane racing. it was just flying in loops and i couldn't figure that shit out.
*rewinds too far* woops did not mean for you to see that
yeah but we're all gonna look metal as fuck when it happens.
i love assaulting that point. every time i die i get to try something new to break through.
it is an amazing gimmick imho. i always stop and watch it fall till someone comes and kill me.
or the lag comp bounces you back out of the cockpit a full second later and you land outside ground battlefield. within seconds your god of choice executes you for desertion.
"then the league of nations said 'no, if you're in the league of nations you're not supposed to take over the world'. and japan said, 'how about i do, any way!'".
how do you tell the difference if you don't see the plane?
same. i got a cod after bf4 and never really looked back but this time i haven't gotten the newest cod and the only reason i would is to play mw4 again...
a redditor stealing content! now i've heard it all.
a horse of autistic computer nerds whose highest values are plagiarism and job security?
cause she did that shitty horror movie with all the water
i had the exact same experience. i found out later that you were supposed to alternate pressing left, right, left, right quickly to make the plane go faster but there was no indication that that's what you were supposed to do. ahh, the good old days when you were expected to read a manual or just figure things out on your own. a blessing and a curse.
but wait a second i'm getting ahead of myself, let's rewind a bit. *1980s feel good pop song plays*
*fast-forwards for a sec* *freeze frame on the hero punching out a giant dude in a shitty tavern* "ah, there we go."
you head on down to the sipsco dirt factory of course. big money, big women, big fun.
i think i would rather be shot in the dick an bleed to death than have my lungs pulled out of my mouth and suffocate.
rifle grenades.... all of the rifle grenades ever.
i like to think my god of choice would have executed me for not dying on that burning zeppelin, like a true hero.
"can you call us something else, other than dipshit?" "how about *sunrise land*"
paratroopers usually descended in mass numbers, while an air crew would be only 2-15 men usually. not only that, but it's unlikely that paratroopers would be descending in the middle of a dogfight/flak field. the soldiers on the ground would likely see the air battle going on above or at least know of it and could infer that the airmen descending were from downed aircraft.
well for me the sad thing is is i did play bf4 a lot, but i've played so much bf1 now that i already have 105 hours
suicide is bad ass just aim for center of mass and splatter your insides against the wall
i've seen a dragon fly. i've seen a horse fly. heck, i've even seen a house fly. but i be done seen bout everything when i see a redditor lie.
the video game footage of the guy running on the blimp as it's exploding made the front page today as its own video and now it looks like the scene from the rocketeer was recreated using some of the video game footage. it's just a cool video. nothing more.
i think you folks that do these ironic shitty robots are really inspiring. i think a big barrier to people starting their own projects is coming up with that one project that is supposed to be useful in some way and it can be intimidating and paralyzing. it's too serious and intense. this technique of building robots shows people that you can still be artistic, funny, and lighthearted while still learning how to build things can really take that intimidating edge off the learning process for beginners.
most of the games i got from blockbuster or hollywood video didn't have manuals :( it was baptism by fire
the song is walking on sunshine by katrina and the waves.
just like me. except i wasn't punching anyone out. and instead of in a tavern i was in my own kitchen. the "shitty" part is accurate, though.
what if i can't afford the 17 herbs and spices carefully packed into sips co. brand dirt?
oh there was a part where an old soldier was talking about those bombs being used on the dead, only to have them walking around with their lungs hanging out of their mouths. shook up some troops real bad. that book was both depressing and metal as fuck

oh damn, i was playing bf2 revive a few months ago but didn't know they were working on a 2142 revival! defs playing when i get home.
thank you i appreciate that and i feel the same about making robotics less intimidating. you don't need to be good at it and you don't need to make anything useful, come to /r/shittyrobots and make shit with us :)
okay, but how did that lead to you running on top of an exploding zeppelin?
do it, its exactly how you remember it plus some bonus qol changes. northern strike and widescreen support are included.
subbed, i have arduinos sitting around, i just need to do something crazy with them!
do you know who i can't get out of my head? that burn dude's wife. my goodness.

you won't believe how he increased his breakfast taste over 250% with this one weird trick. denny's hates him!
it feels awesome. being a quadriplegic comes with a lot of mental anguish so when these kind of things happen it really puts your mind at ease and makes you feel hopeful.
i usually do my rehab in baltimore at kennedy krieger institute but lately i've been doing it at sheltering arms in richmond because i applied to vcu so i'm giving this place a test run in case i move there
it's kind of like a segway. you lean forward and it starts walking. my physical therapist also has it synced up to an iphone app to help control it.
i haven't. i broke my neck in a bmx accident 8 years ago. of course walking unassisted is unbeatable but this is still pretty damn awesome. i forgot how tall i am when i'm walking. it's also really weird looking down and seeing my feet move underneath me since i still can't feel my legs.
dun-dun-duunnn-dun-dun-daduunn-dun-dun-dunnn-dun-duuunnnn!!! m/
well they did just send the exoskeleton to get upgraded recently so fingers crossed for wall walking
not dumb at all. lots of quadriplegics have muscle spasms constantly anyways. some more severe than others. everything definitely feels numb. as far as putting a hotplate on my leg or feeling pain, my body feels it but i don't. it triggers what's called autonomic dysreflexia. so basically since i can't feel it my body's response is to raise my blood pressure very high to the point where i get really bad headaches and i get cold sweats. and this usually doesn't go away till i find the cause of it.
not a dick. it's extremely hard to offend me. rebel scum...
how have things been for you since leaving the hospital? was the first drive home pretty difficult for you? hope you're doing well man
and a couple of hundred years into the future no one will give him or any others of us here any second thought as our existence has faded into obscurity and no one will never know we existed.
i can. i asked them to turn on the breakdance feature but they said i have been earned that yet
hey good luck to the two of you. i believe he mentioned it further up if you haven't seen it yet. it's not the same but i was just bedridden and told that i may be disabled, for about 8 months and then i slowly got better, but it was definitely very tough. hope you find something that helps! i wonder if they make exoskeletons for activities of daily living (adl). they must, it'd be strange if they don't.
8 years. i've been doing physical therapy since the injury but just started using the exoskeleton in september. long term goals i guess would be walking and independence
what do you want to know? i'll answer any question you throw at me.
most quadriplegic men are able to get a priapism (hard on) by reflexive action (messages from dick to spinal cord still work - they just don't send that message to the brain and vice versa). some hard ons will last longer than others - just like most men. so yes for 'most' spinal-cord injured men their dick still works. (some may need medication to help) however not all sci men will be able to feel the same sensation (if any) like they did pre injury. however they might have deeper / altered sensation so having a body banging next to them will still register - and then there's always visuals to keep you going. i personally think it's good to ask. it's good to see people with disabilities as the 'same' in the sense that we are all, generally speaking, sexual beings and why should that change just because you happen to have a disability. source - ex spinal nurse married to a sci man ;)
i want to know the same thing. asking for my father.
a quadriplegic means the area of injury is high enough to involve the nerves of the arms. however, depending on incomplete vs complete injury, therapy, and other factors, some quadriplegics can use their arms amd hands with modified equipment to an extent.
it also puts *our* minds at ease and makes us feel hopeful. thank you for your inspiring hard work, and i applaud you for refusing to settle for the minimum needed to survive. if you weren't a fighter, they wouldn't have spent the resources and effort on your progress. this picture truly shows a triumph of spirit!
richmond's an a+ town. good luck on your application!
do your arms support a lot of your weight when you walk?
dang doing what trick? i am curious as to what almost dying literally feels like.
i hope they'll give you a powerful upgrade for free :)
we don't need any roads where we're going, other barry.
can you share a situation where a part of your body that was numb was being damaged and you had that autonomic dysreflexia reaction?
how often do you have to buy new shoes? possible upside
in all honesty i'm probably one of the luckiest guys to be in my spinal ward and now on the outside. i had massive trauma in my injury (motorbike crash) and my injury list starts at a fracture of the transverse process of c7 but my neurological injury is l3 incomplete, i can walk with crutches, my calfs are paralysed and my bladder and bowels are affected and i probably have 85/90% sensation in my body so honestly it's not too bad. thanks a lot, i onviously spent a lot of time in my rehab/physio and i made so many good friends who are para/tetraplegic and they all just made my bad days easier to cope with because i do have mobility, i do have sensation etc
i think you should start with something easier like tango, or twerking, then work your way up to amazing breakdancing!
i skateboarded seriously for 30 years and took many hard falls. what's your reflection now on the risk you took. do you regret it? do you feel you couldve been more cautious? i know i limited myself out of fear at times for the better. i broke an ankle and a wrist over the years. it's tough to see good people get hurt so bad. you know how riders and skaters are... i think i'm of the mind that everyone should just try to have fun at their pace. no one i hung out with would make anyone feel less for it. these are very dangerous activities obviously. anyways all the best. you keep going!
thank you, and also i am sorry that you had to go through that, it is definitely very hard, and i try to help her, but depression is a bitch... thank you for your good wishes..
in the case of your injury specifically, it possible that using the exoskeleton could help regenerate your nerves and eventually allow you to walk unassisted?
hey so you can still use your hands? i thought quadriplegics couldnt use any limbs. how are you replying to all these comments? (not trying to sound insensitive)
yes, but mass manufacturing and steady improvements will drop that figure quickly. recall the wheeled walkers now going for $50-60 once cost 15 times that. same with the exoskeleton. great for our injured veterans, too. is the va working with this, yet? if not.......
i don't think they are actually available to purchase. still in the testing phase of development. they choose candidates based on who they feel would be the best for testing and development. i'm just spit balling but i would guess at a minimum $100k maybe $200k for a full exoskeleton once they are in full production. source: read a couple of articles about these last summer.
as i got older i have realised that sex is not the goal, it's the intimacy and the connection with the other person that i crave. i'm glad for you guys. (32yo dude)
i now have "quadriplegic sex" in my search history.
they do. i usually have a walker in front of me that i rest my forearms on
i was trying to double peg a handrail. it feels like when you order a pizza but they accidentally give you a salad
they were the best of times, they were the worst of times... ah, who am i kidding, doc's got me down to 2 oreo thins a day and an insulin pump.
not really. because i'm quadriplegic i don't have very good control of my trunk. so usually when i'm using the exoskeleton i have to have like three people on me. one person behind. another guiding the walker. and someone by my side to kind of hold my chest up.
pt here- there are lots of advantages to being upright. exercise, weight bearing (helps bone density), extended positioning in an upright position helps maintain range of motion and prevent issues like scoliosis that come from constant sitting. not sitting also helps prevent pressure sores that come from only sitting. it's also good for breathing, digestion, and yes, your sanity.
i used to work as a pca for a c6 quad, and anything from tight shoes or clothing, to spilling something hot (food or beverage) on skin, or sitting on something sharp (fork, pen, etc...) could set it off. i saw it most with uncomfortable clothing, so i would always stick around for 15-30 minutes after getting them dressed to make sure they were ok.
i'm a wheelchair user and buy shoes when i want more. them always looking brand new is a definite plus!
you're just asking, nothing insensitive about it at all. i cannot use my hands. i still have use of my shoulders, biceps, and left wrist. for typing i use a combination of both voice recognition and typing with my knuckles one letter at a time since i have no use of my fingers. if i'm on my phone though, i have it velcroed to my armrest and i use my thumb to type and navigate.
even $100k is still a bargain compared to the potential future costs from lack of walking, muscle loss, full nursing care, wheelchairs, specialized cars, etc.
aaaaah, *a walker* is one of those trays on a wheel i see sometimes. i thought it was a term you guys used about people that can walk. now it makes sense. i thought you where careful not to squish the walker in front of you, maybe it was a child, or a very short person.
that's probably the greatest description for that feeling
time to build an exoskeleton that replaces legs with a bmx-bike lower body. half-man! half-pro-bmx-bike! i shall call it the wheel ch... wait shit.
you sir, underestimate the diarrhea caused by such an undertaking.
genital mattress yous ur new trump powa to reevive him. pls.
we had our days old chum. i couldn't imagine a better opponent.
they're able to give a guy a functioning exoskeleton but we still don't have a functioning hitler-lenny face.
so then what does using the exoskeleton actually do for you, short or long term? i always figured it was something you would use forever, but i guess not! (sorry if this was already asked)
is there any talk of ever being able to regain some sort of movement or feeling anywhere most likely through surgery?
you will still need most of those things; except full nursing care isn't needed for most quads. exoskeletons are not yet at the point where they are full time functional mobility for full time use. as the costs come down, you'll see the va adopt them first, then workers' comp, and then it will eventually trickle down to commercial insurance.
pay me 50 bucks and i'll make an extra big suit that fits both of us, we'll both wear it and i'll walk with him down the aisle. i will of course wear a black mask so nobody knows i'm there.
syrup wells to store the aunt jemimina needed for morning survival. soak some breadpatty in sugar? that's nasty, i need my sugar raw baby.
i don't know if you are being serious or not but i'm laughing like crazy
i'm picturing a bmx centaur. not clever enough to name it though.
shit, i was missing a disc in my lower back and had fusion surgery to remedy the issue and the price tag just to do that was over $110k. $80k to help someone walk again seems extremely reasonable.
tbh diarrhea caused by oreos isn't that bad. i've had worse by other things.
not sure op asked, but i'm pretty sure that something like this helps fight depression that most paraplegic and quadriplegic people experience. i mean, being told you'll never walk again is a hell of a blow to your sense of self-worth. doing something like this is probably offsetting that quite nicely. another issue chair-bound people experience is muscle atrophy. so instead of getting the usual "lie on your back and i'll move your limbs" physical therapy that most paralyzed people get, this is another function of that. yes, there's not a whole shitload of resistance since machinery is moving your limbs for you, but the sheer act of flexing muscles/tendons and testing range of motion can prevent a lot of issues down the line as well.
and you also defeated one of the worst enemies of the world.
english is not my native language, i had to use my imagination and the most reasonable thing was that a walker is the term quadriplegics use for able bodied humans :(
it's really interesting how extremely severe injuries don't really hurt. from my experience a shattered elbow and broken neck you don't feel (didn't realize the neck was hurt until the next day). broken finger? fucking awful.
the majority of people on earth will earn that much in a lifetime. it's reasonable in luxembourg, maybe.
these units aren't usually sold for home use they're typically utilized by the patient at the rehab facility. source: physical therapist
i thought it sounded like a bowling movie about a guy that's really serious about the game but doesn't quite gets strikes
oh i'm not a english speaker neither and don't know what a walker (besides the zombies in twd) just find it funny that people can't walk have a term to refer people who can.
usually adrenaline and survival instinct cuts through that pain as your body does what it evolved to do in those situations - make sure you survive. the body is really amazing. that said, i imagine he felt a lack of pain because he became literally crippled, and that likely involves the severing of many of the nerve systems that would transmit such pain ime - chronic pain is always worse than sudden pain. for example, i had my jaw smashed in, which took 4 years to fix, and 9 months wired shut. the actual smashing didn't hurt much, the following years did very badly
that's what i thought at first, but then caught myself. no one can be that callous, is what i'd like to believe. like to.
how'd you get your jaw smashed in? what was painful about the healing process?
yeah, fuck that guy. what a piece of shit. i wish i could reach back in time and hug the 11 year old you. how's your hand doing today?
i sprained a finger playing basketball and didn't even notice it until the next day. only reason i did notice it was cause i couldn't bend my finger.
you shouldn't be so worried about it if it was.... a best friend when i was in high school was quadriplegic. told me something very helpful on how i should treat him. since we ribbed on each other, but never messed with him, it left him out. he didn't mind jokes about him or his ability...as long as he trusted we didn't mean anything more than to include him. was a great guy, even if a shit diver.
stuff like this makes me happy we dont have such a health care system where i am from. glad it worked out though!
i understand, and those situations are cool with me. to me, it's why i don't take "terrorist" jokes or the like too seriously by classmates as its all said in good spirit.
on the pod cast 99percent invisible he does a whole episode about obama and the letters he receive, "ten letters to the president"
fun fact: the lincolns, before the presidency, were well to do, and enjoyed the victorian luxury of separate bedrooms.
and then make a film about it and call it hateful eight.
it's nice to be able to disagree with someone on policy, but still be able to realize they are a good person.
racial resentment is playing a huge part. i have been realizing more as the years go by that we would "pay" for daring to elect him before addressing deep rooted social racism. i think we needed him, but i also wish we could cryonically freeze him for better times. hmm.. i wonder if we can clone him. anyway, i hope they remain an influential family. we minorities need a level headed hero to remind us of what is possible.
president obama is a great example for your husband, handling pressure and resistance with grace and dignity. i hope your husband's tenure gets easier as well as rewarding. and girl, kudos to you, you're married to a mayor!
fuck, no. could you imagine if trump actually turned up? i wouldn't even take the risk.
as an aussie, when our last prime minister suggests that too many trees are 'locked up in nature reserve' and need to be 'freed', we knew he had to go
dear op, i'm glad that you like our parks. we have the best parks. our parks are so great. all these other countries, their parks are total disasters.
yeah, we're really sorry. well about 25% of us are sorry. about 25% are thrilled, and the other half or so apparently can't be bothered to give a shit one way or the other.
because we (as a majority, not me personally) are angry and when we're angry we make rash decisions.
i'm sure donald trump cares so deeply about this country that he's going to ask for 11 letters each night.
that's read not sent out. he also only reads when he is at white house not when away. so less than that but still probably more than others.
because we are conditioned to not like paying taxes. we are also very individualistic, and don't have a sense of sacrificing for public goods.
this can only be read in the voice of donald alec baldwin trump.
there has been more than one empire, many of which weren't fictitious.
conversely, you can agree with someone's policies but think they are a total piece of shit! not that there's been anyone like that in recent memory...
we have trump now. i don't think our collective nerves could take much more.
i was just in a class where we did a three day ride in the backcountry of colorado. he spoke passionately as we looked over the beautiful land how all these trees being there are a waste and we need to strip them so we can not buy from russia. it was so hard to hold my tongue. we saw plenty of stripped land and it was awful.
the national parks are one of the things that we did perfectly right. i have never gone out of my way to protest. however, i would do anything in my absolute power to protect the national parks. they are truly one of the greatest things our country has done as a nation and to watch them be privatized or stripped of natural resources/wildlife disturbed is just not something i can stand for.
yellowstone is already kind of burning from beneath, and someday it will turn us all in to ashes.
because i want the thing now and fuck the rest of the world.
you mean national forests? i sure hope they don't get rid of those.. my aunt and uncle live at the edge of pike nt'l forest in colorado and it's great! you can hunt, fish, four-wheel, chop wood and use the land essentially for free (taxes duh.) it'd be a shame to lose that.
somehow i've never asked this before, but where the fuck did he pick up his speech patterns? new yorkers don't talk like that. who talks like that?
"just read a letter from some idiot complaining about me. sad!!!"
ha ha yes fellow human. he should definitely have mentioned that he is in fact a robot.
ops photo, is it actually him writing or did someone else write it, he approved it/signed it and sent via post office?
"i'm not on fire, why should *i* pay for the fire service?"
this. recently, went through orientation with my new company. there were 12 of us, truck drivers, in class. we started talking about benefits and most of the guys didn't know they couldn't be denied for preexisting conditions. they hated on obama and the aca. then were surprised to find out they were benefiting from his work in office.
the most surreal argument i was ever in, as a canadian, was with my american right-wing ex-in laws as they argued with me about canadian health care. "you don't have regular doctors, you can only go to the er!" i have a doctor and i saw him like two weeks ago "no you didn't. and the government won't give surgeries or treatment to old people so that they die because it's cheaper" my dad is 74 and just had a very successful heart valve replacement surgery, he was scheduled in swiftly because they wanted to deal with it before the weakened valve became a real threat to his health. now he's in a fully-funded cardiac rehab fitness program as part of his recovery "you're lying. and you have to beg the government to approve your medical treatment" uhhhhhhh that's just... not true, and i don't even know what to say to that "yes it is, i heard it on fox."
guys i did some serious hacking and found out his address, it's 1600 pennsylvania ave., washington dc
i am a software engineer. if i get at least 20 obama letters as a reply to this comment, i will train a neural net that generates more obama letters.
i wonder if, when you become president, they make sure you practice a classy-looking signature.
after looking at them he thinks the letter is signed by the president and the sotu address is auto penned. i guess he did a little research into it. i hadn't seen another letter from the president before this post but you can see the signatures are closer between the signed letters and the sotu looks a bit different.
i'm going to miss having a president that is uber intelligent and can actually form a sentence.
there has been more than one fiction, many of which weren't empires.
you can also disagree with most of their policies *and* think they're a piece of shit human being.
i'm worried about how the team's gonna do next season
i don't know if you're pulling my leg here, but damn that was exceptionally shitty.
same, i would flat out leave my job and camp out if i had to. and much more.
shh, if donald goes to strip mine it personally he may be involved in a magma based accident.
i don't know, but somebody compared it to a little kid's book report, and on twitter #trumpbookreport started trending. good stuff if you want a laugh.
"i never said i read a letter from an idiot complaining about me. that never happened." [deletes original tweet 3 hours later]
oh it's just a letter from his lawyers threatening to sue...
that's a whole 140 letters per tweet!! trump has the best letters.
"dear guy who tweeted me on paper. i'm glad you finally realized that you were incredibly **wrong** for doubting me in any way. i'm amazing, i have words. i have the best words. and large hands with which to guide this country to greatness again, like moses in one of those crappy middle eastern countries awhile ago. anyway this is way over 140 characters and my large fingers hurt, so i'd just like to leave you with the advice that a noble spirit and a small loan of a million dollars enyugens the smallest man." sincerely, your president (lol seriously though, how did this happen?)
obama offers notes in the column on what he wants to say back and writers who know his diction and voice actually write the letter but it is obamas thoughts.
these lazy people just want handouts! they should pull themselves out of the fire by their bootstraps!
i'm not 100% sure, but i do recall a graphic years ago during the initial obamacare debate in 2008 which compared different metrics of healthcare systems in developed nations, and if i recall, the uk pays less per person for its healthcare system, hires more nurses per person, a higher life expectancy and lower infant mortality than the us. though take into account that the uk has geographical advantage given that a single hospital can cover more people, and the system as a whole being a single customer means it can haggle for significantly cheaper drugs.
same. i don't have children but i don't mind my taxes going to schools because i don't want america to be filled with stupid(er) people.
this type of thinking in america seeps into many aspects of life here. it really is a shame
i think about that a lot when i see pictures of people holding signs like, "keep government out of my medicare!" a lot of people are simply uninformed, and people in general don't like having their views confronted, so people double down on wrong information because they don't want to be seen as "stupid." an irony for sure, but human nature i suppose. but hopefully, yes, you're able to convince people by pivoting on something they already like. "you can get coverage despite that back injury from 10 years ago continuing to give you problems and it won't cost you literally a third of your salary? thanks, obama."
there's millions of people in the us who believe exactly what your family does so that's why we have terrible healthcare .
jesus! enough with your doxing dude, are you that 4chan guy?
i really appreciate you saying this. these days it seems like if you don't agree with someone politically, you just yell the craziest insults or disparage them personally. i like that even though you didn't agree with him, you're not spewing vitriol, *and* can give him credit for things he's done that you did agree with. more people should follow your example.
that is understandable since i'm sure there are many copies of the sotu printed out.
i'm going to miss being certain that the u.s. president won't start a nuclear war tomorrow.
this is certainly true, but he also pauses during extemporaneous conversation, although to a lesser degree.
nah he didn't delete them. just leaves the hypocrisy open to all.
kind of reminds me of the the hateful 8 and the whole backstory of samuel l's character having a note from abraham lincoln.
also, most of the time, he makes so many margin notes that he might as well have written it himself.
if i can do it anyone can and if they don't they're lazy losers and don't deserve it. 'murica is for winners only.
i own a house in a smaller town in the bay area known for its excellent schools... they probably increase our house value by about 20 percent. we happily voted in a parcel tax for the schools, and most people contribute to the education foundation. that adds up to about $2000 a year we contribute to the school. considering that that adds up to about $300,000 to the value of our property, it's a pretty easy decision to make. wealth is not zero sum. even if your motives are purely selfish, it makes economic sense to improve your surroundings, whether that's at a local, state, national or even global level.
it's a vicious circle. the worse educations gets, the fewer people are intellectually equipped to understand the need to pay taxes to benefit the whole of society in things like education. so schools (for example) get underfunded and the next generation is even less able to understand anything more complex than "the tax man took my money!"
now that a reality show star is president, your statement couldn't be more accurate. i would bet every dollar i have that if trump was never on tv people would have shamed him out of politics months ago. in all the debates he never once gave anything remotely close to an explanation as to how he will accomplish his goals. he was nonsensical and filled with piss and vinegar. now he wants his kids to have top secret security clearance... i am still shocked how so many people think he is qualified for such a job just because he is "not a politician" and "says what he thinks". that would be all and well if the guy wasn't a fucking narcissistic hypocrite.
ex-family, thankfully, because i really don't think i could sit through a visit with where they're probably at right now.
it was so incredibly surreal. i remember looking at my ex trying to figure out if it was just a joke they were playing on me, and my ex just subtly shook his head. that was the first time i met my (then) in-laws, too.
i went through his trash, i think he's booked some removal men
it's the only place in dc that isn't within 1000 feet of a school.
not to toot my own horn here, but i called my senators yesterday to message about an issue. it felt really good to communicate with my political opponents at the highest level in a cordial, polite tone.
yeah. to say he was excited and touched to get a letter back is an understatement!
im going to miss having a president the drops the mic after he respectfully roasts tf outta someone
"that atv accident wasn't huge. your head is what's huge. how are you gonna get a hat to fit that thing?"
"the redditor! in the stable! has a letter from president obama!?!"
every writer uses a template. especially if you write a lot every day. you got to imagine that obama sends letters to a lot of folks not just replys to letters he receives
that was my favorite bit. i can image the margins filled with complete thoughts and his writers simply rewriting it and adding punctuation.
you should read the article before you try to make this political. the person lived outside of the town limits, so they couldn't tax them. they offered firefighting service to nearby rural residents, but since they can't forcibly tax people outside of the town, they give them an option to pay for the service. i'm guessing if there were any other rural residents that forgot to pay the annuity, this was a good reminder to do so.
another thing a lot of people don't consider is that banning abortions and stopping them doesn't actually stop abortions. it just stops legally safe abortions. hundreds of thousands of illegal abortions are still going to be done and have been done in the past. these being unsafe and with a highrr risk of death or injury.
of course they want to keep the educated population down. you can't piss on someone and try to call it rain when they know how to think for themselves.
i appreciate his sentiment, but i disagree with his solution. from everything i've looked at, voting for republicans (after iraq, afghanistan, and their costly obstruction over the past 5 years) causes public expenditures to be less competent and less trustworthy than voting for democrats. i'm not saying that it's a binary democrat=good, republican=bad sort of deal (hell, democrats controlled the federal government when the gulf of tonkin incident was staged), but that democratic party governance has been the better of the two. he doesn't even think republicans are the good option, he just thinks they're the better of two. i'm wholly convinced that the accurate view is his, yet flipped.
this is what would happen in 'murica: you wake up in excruciating pain. you dial 911 and get an ambulance to take you to the hospital. they take your insurance card and process it while you're getting treated. you get out of the hospital to find that the hospital and doctors were out of network and the insurance company passes a huge chunk of the costs to you. then the ambulance ride ends up costing like $10k which insurance won't cover. since you happen to be on a low tier health insurance company from a small business your deductible is a ridiculous $13000. you periodically get bills from different doctors which you try to haggle payment plans. at the end of the month when you do your budget you're now suddenly in the red by several tens of thousands of dollars which will take years to pay off. this is why they say americans are one health crisis away from bankruptcy. the system absolutely sucks.
i'm not sure of your age but i know at my age he's the only president i have living memory of that deserves a place of nostalga. clinton with his scandal tarnished his presidency and george w. ::shudder:: that's a can of worms a lot of people wish didn't happen. this man, in my eyes, honestly tried his best and deserves the respect a man of that position should garnish. here's to hoping trump isn't someone who loses the respect of the people by his own actions and can gain my respect through his policies.
well done! sadly i think most of the people who call and write to their reps are lunatics, which may explain the nature of today's discourse. reasonable people are more quiet and polite, unfortunately.
that was brilliant. that was some princess bride level logic.
you buy your gloves in the boy's department, trump.
you really believe the president would send a letter to a blastin' redditor? op: "it got me to the front page, didn't it?"
and it's a reply to a letter. how much differently can you structure it anyway?
wrong! my style is so unique, i mean i have the best style. it's tremendous! -trump probably
honestly, i think it would be really neat to have my letter sent back with his margin notes written on it. obviously, getting an official response is awesome, but seeing the margin notes would be pretty awesome, too.
yeah, you're absolutely right in that respect. it's just, i live in nys and we have a nearby township that has the same setup. they've been offered to incorporate multiple times, but always refuse because of "taxes!" then i have to read a story in the paper every year about some trouble due to them not wanting to pay to send kids to our school district, or our fire service, or our water treatment. they're a heavily republican area that wants services but not taxes. i'm definitely transplanting my feelings onto this area, but from a glance it looks maddeningly similar.
thank you! i don't understand how education in this country is always such an afterthought. george carlin must have been correct all along that the government wants a dumber constituency. focus on education and helping all americans to be successful is the foundation of making the country great. but no, that costs money and money is supposed to be hoarded in the cayman islands.
as a former congressional intern, this is sadly the case. correspondence for me was 90% form letters/emails from some group or another, 9% weird/crazy/hateful screeds, and 1% genuine messages from actual constituents. the latter were always appreciated!
"i will be honest with you. i didn't fully read the letter. i did not need to. i read the headline and i knew what was coming up, so i responded right away in the most respectful way that all my criticisers deserve. fuck them, but we need to treat them as if they were honorable people."
some people on the internet are saying how wonderful your style is, believe me. i don't know who those people are, but it's what they are saying.
absolutely - i personally have never been through it (and thank goodness for that) but i can only imagine the type of guilt one who has just go through. no matter what justification you are given, you will always live with the mental scars of "what might have been".
i live in australia and have never been in snow, so forgive me if this is a stupid question but: what the fuck did they think was going to happen? i mean the snow isn't hidden, it's *right there* and it seems obvious that the snow is going to get rapidly displaced when the train arrives. did they think it was just going to get squished down small or something?
they had like 10 seconds to respond and run. maybe even longer depending on how slow their internet connection was.
the platform could form a spot for the snow to drift.
as an englishman, i agree! i'm also irritated that there was no personnel there to stop people from going to the platform.
they will have to put a stamp on the phone: "things you see through your camera may be closer than they appear on your screen - baaang" the bang is for what will happen anyway...
unfortunately only one phone was recovered. this is the unedited footage. *warning: the following clip may be disturbing to some viewers.*
some did- you can see them moving back at the beginning.
they were thinking falling snow, which is soft and gentle as it covers stuff in a layer of fluff. they were not thinking of how much accumulated snow weighs, or how it gets squished into basically ice as the weight of the snow above it compresses it. i'm sure you've seen people knocked over by waves? same idea. they think it'll be like in the shower or it'll be misty or something. had a cousin do a full faceplant in the sand because he didn't brace for a wave on the beach.
they could have escaped, but they preferred to take a snow shower and record this video for a story :)
it's like people driving through a flooded road not realizing how powerful rushing water is.
well that doesn't change the fact that these people had no idea how much was going to go flying.
probably not if it recorded in slow-mo on a phone.
if i were standing on that platform and a bunch of people looked out, saw a train approaching, and then backed off to the other side of the platform i'd probably be joining them. as to the woman in the white beanie, even if there had been no snow on the tracks she shouldn't be standing that close to a train that doesn't look like it's going to stop
if you watch the video, this is exactly the case. the video starts with the train further off, and you can see some snow, but not nearly as much on the track further out.
thought something like this would be the top comment. they should have not let people walk out there.
plus if they die they can get lots of likes and comments from their video
am i the only one that wants to see the aftermath of this? where's the rest of the footage? *i must have answers!*
they were probably thinking what happened was what they expected to happen but had to stand as close as they dared anyway to get the shot for some social media points/a cool experience. and lo and behold, whoever recorded the video in the op was covered in ice and snow like those other folks and here we are admiring his/her handiwork.
"a person is smart. people are dumb, panicky dangerous animals and you know it. fifteen hundred years ago everybody knew the earth was the center of the universe. five hundred years ago, everybody knew the earth was flat, and fifteen minutes ago, you knew that humans were alone on this planet. imagine what you'll know tomorrow. " -men in black
at one point there was this bridge on my commute where the road dipped under it for better clearance. sure enough, after a big rain there's cop cars blocking it off since all the water gathered there. there's also half a car sticking out since someone thought they'd just drive through.
yeah, i don't think this is a rural/urban thing. most people don't have a lot of experience with trains plowing through snow.
as a kid from a rural area, i consider suburbs as part of the city...
it was based off a comic. but in general yes that movie was a plothole driven mess. hell you could have driven a train thru the plotholes. oh wait they did...
can i just say, that's a column, not a beam. beams are horizontal structural members. source: am structural engineer
excuse me sir or madam, may i interest you in some /r/bitchimatrain
she had way *too* much time to react. why would you stand that close when you obviously see a fuck ton of snow on the tracks?
also why did they decide to hit stop in the middle of being covered in snow?
you mean when it wasn't throwing snow quite so crazily, and was *presumably* going to slow down to pick these folks up?
and a lot of people *did* step back before the train hit the snow.
the ***engineer *** probably saw it way before the conductor if the conductor saw it at all.
met a couple on a 14,000 foot mountain in colorado a few summers ago who were severely dehydrated, had second degree sunburns, and were in need of a rescue. they went out to the wilderness with no water, no packs at all, and were wearing flip flops. the lady looked like she was going to die, and we gave them a few liters of water to rehydrate with (lucky for them we had enough, and a filtration system at base camp) and i radioed the nps ranger to get them some help. blew my mind how careless and dangerous people will be with their lives.
it's most likely amtrak's fault; amtrak shares rails with the ny metro lines and amtrak, always scared they'll be late because they're always late, ignores a lot of the regulations in place especially when it comes to things like speed while going through a station. trains are supposed to slow down, but many amtrak trains don't since they just don't give a fuck and fly through. it's an issue year round, but definitely worse in winter weather conditions like this.
having lived in both, i can tell you that the city and suburbs are about as similar as a house cat and a lion suburbs are like city lite at absolute best. really more like a rural area minus the 'area.'
you can say that, yes. sorry! i couldn't resist!
they are cars in the us and canada. wagons in uk and whatever the hell the iur is. til.
she's recording it. just like the person that recorded the video we all just watched.
pretty sure at that point his attention was turned to not dying.
i'm betting this is the real answer here. snow collected at the station tracks because it is more protected there.
plot twist, the husband rehydrated a lot right before the hike and took a large life insurance policy on his wife out beforehand
i'm surprised they're allowed to drive through snowed-over stations. enough snow, especially when it gets compacted or does the fun melt/freeze thing that turns it a nearly solid block of ice, must be a potential hazard to the train, too.
you've clearly never been to a party full of engineers; they're the best!
i think this point is really being missed by some in this thread.
in her possible defense, she could either have been filming it herself, underestimated how bad the snow wave was going to be, or both.
and he would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for you meddling redditors
you'd be surprised. there are very few things that multiple thousands of tons of steel moving at speed give a fuck about.
engineer confirmed: provided a lot of interesting information, didn't answer the question.
ah shit, i just saw your comment. whats up homie, we have the same mind yo.
it's swallowing him! and then it's going to swallow me! oh my goooooooooooooooooood!
not every single one, but if you think someone should have died, and you saw it on liveleak, then yea, they probably died.
true. since graduating, i haven't been to a single party :(
i saw this video of a guy on a moped get crushed by a semi truck. he exploded like a watermelon. is he dead too?
when you can't see their shoes they ded. even if they shoes are obscured by their motor vehicle.
it rolled back over again. he was submerged for a short bit of time. i'm sure he made it. does nobody have a source on this? why are we even speculating?
yep. i remember that canadian kid a couple years back that got rescued on longs in the dead of winter in a tee shirt and shorts haha. sneffels is no joke though, it's a supremely dangerous peak, and its ease of approach gets people caught with their guard down. earlier that same day on our ascent, we saw a dude fall off the saddle between gilpin and sneffels and get a helicopter rescue too. people get a false sense of security in sw colorado and i'll never understand it.
a traveling job that sucks like all the rest. until 50 years ago most railroad workers stayed half drunk at work to tolerate it. now you are supposed to pretend to enjoy it. zero fucks given.
hey it worked with my snowblower yesterday. trying to ease my way in in 2nd gear didnt work, but bashing the fuck out of the snow pile maxed out in 6th moved it alright.
wouldn't bigger tires hold more air, increasing the buoyancy? (spelling?)
i read in the comments that he walked it off later.
now i understand schrodinger's cat. you can't check to see if it's shoes are still on without opening the box.
we're still alcoholics, we just have to wait until we're off the clock now.
i'm confident that the first time i find one, the plainclothes officer will be there to arrest me.
reason #749 why banks being closed on the weekends makes no sense. /bitter guy who gets paid on fridays who is fed up with not being able to access his money until wednesday morning because the bank isn't open until monday, but they process everything deposited on monday, on tuesday morning, and require 24hrs before funds become available.
shake it once, that's fine shake it twice, that's okay shake it three times, you're playing with yourself
that would just mean the scammer could max out your card + whatever negative balance on the account. it's a better plan to just keep your cc maxed and ur bank acct empty
exactly, why not just make the face completely flat with a flush slot in it, then any protrusion would be immediately obvious.
i almost always check my atms now (when i remember too). i don't know why these devices make me feel so uncomfortable. they're like those creep-crawly sci-fi **brain bugs** that attach to your spine and control your mind, but you never know it's attached until it's too late...
wonder how many were found that caused them to implement that policy. that the the less comforting part.
just imagine how many are looking at this thread as a potential new source of income.
better drill all the way into the interior and check the cash-dispensing mechanism, just to be sure.
instructions unclear. ended up beating up a fellow redditor who checked the atm for skimmers and found it cause i thought he was the thief
does a huge steel door slam down cutting off the hands or fingers of the person who was using it? one can only hope.
po: "it's bad to break stuff" op: "stuff was easy to break..." po: "hmm... should we try break the other stuff to see if ez to break?" po: "other stuff was apparently virus stuff. you free to go."
see you people and your fancy plastic cards are going to get screwed by identity theft. that's why i only use old world currency like livestock and hookers.
maybe he's the person who installed the skimmer... or maybe he's clueless. hard to know for sure
keep that up and you might wind up president of the united states.
honest question, even if i have a chip on my card, isn't the skimmer still getting my info from the magnetic strip anyway? for all the places in the us where you see the sign 'no chip', the magnetic strip works fine.
don't be paranoid, be aware and in the know because it's half the battle.
hi this is the bank. please be so kind to copy and paste your debit card number and an expiration date and my colleges and i will check your card to see if has been stolen. thank you for using bank, and have wonderful day.
if they do this, do you really think they give 2 shits whether it is right or wrong?
better idea: or they could embed a pair of modulated ir leds pointed outwards from the card reader (hidden behind perspex) and every so often turn them on to see if there is anything obscuring that area like a skimmer. if there is then the atm should alert the bank/authorities. now you don't have to deal with anything sticking out, no need for movable parts, and it would not be obvious. location around the card reader slot can be randomized so that the thieves would not know where the sensors are. false positives would be avoided by having a time out feature so that a person using an atm who may just have his/her hand obscuring the sensor would not be registered. something like if it is obscured for more than a minute or two then there may be a skimmer rather than a hand.
heh. i work in the credit card processing industry. there are so many reasons to hate humanity in this business. scammers skimming. machine leasers ripping businesses off. shell games, shady crap. we try to fight it, but. david, goliath, etc.
sure, just give me your 16 digit card number, cvv code, zip code, and pin number so i can bill the postage to you.
some of the more advanced ones use bluetooth. gas pumps and self-checkout lanes in grocery stores are big targets for these.
i haven't found one but if i did - i would call the police and get their advice!
good ol' plainclothes, always on the lookout for thieves such as u/geethekid.
that actually surprises me, i wouldn't want any signals coming off of the atm. if i where to do this i'd probably use rfid. just walk up, make a transaction like normal, and set your phone on the skimmer while you get out your wallet.
do _not_ take it. the owner might be nearby watching it and they'll be pretty unhappy with you.
no direct deposit option available where you are?
at least one method: they'll wait a couple days, and then try a small purchase of a couple dollars, either with an online merchant or in a store, to ensure the card still works. then when they have assurance the card is still good, they'll go for a large purchase or withdrawal, usually around $500 to $1000, and then keep going until the card quits working. source: got skimmed, got account number stolen. though the bank was really good about it and i ended up not losing any money. i had to wait a couple days for a replacement card, though apple pay continued to work. now i try to use apple pay whenever possible.
unfortunately, it is rather common to see security tape placed in ways where it is not activated if the covered is opened.
i pre-pay now because of this. so does the rest of the office.
reddit has made me realize i don't have a single unique idea
you guys are chumps. i just skip whole "money" and "employment" middlemen scams and live underneath a pedestrian bridge in the park. skim that!
because how would the atm customer know that no protrusion is what it should look like?
or follow them, break into their house, and steal their credit cards.
my brother worked at a large box store and it was an issue. they would check, not sure how often but the would. he also said some crooks were really good and could swap out a reader in a minute.
that doesn't stop anything from being stuck over the reader or in the slot though.
great idea.... come along with me to watch out to make sure no hackers or scammers watch me in the process
seems like it would just be smarter to switch to the chip and pin cards that the rest of the world has been doing for a long time.
i'm imagining the next wiggler is just another innocent person who gets hit, you apologize and they join you to wait for the next guy...a few minutes pass and you've slowly amassed a small army of black and blue, beat up people, hiding in an aisle, waiting to unleash fury on 'the real guy'
its a steel cage actually, then the whole thing is carried away by helicopter and stored like shipping crates.
actually yes, thats the whole point of the police investigating. to investigate and see if with reasonable force they can pull off the card reader, or did i freak out and rip the thing of the machine intentionally knowing i would break it.
"ok crystal, just run your nipple through this strip reader..."
magnetic stripe isn't necessarily only used for credit cards, any shitty badge at any job could have a mag stripe used to open certain doors. this is one of the major reasons behind the drive to the chipped cards because of how non-secure the magstripe is.
i'd like for my bank to send me a push notification every time my card is charged and let me decide whether to approve the transaction.
probably both. somebody told him "i'll give you $50 to put this on the atm at your work"
i always use my middle finger so the thief knows i hate him.
the payment networks really need to put a stop to this. if the terminal supports reading chips, it should refuse any card that has a chip if they swipe it. period. set a deadline, force the companies to fix their garbage. i'm so tired of seeing perfectly good chip readers with a ":) no chip please swipe (:" card stuck in them.
unless it was from a transaction months prior at a merchant that was later breached. or it was at a skimmer but they didn't use the card til months later. ya never really know.
some even go as far as to use cellular. the cons of the cellular ones is that they suck lots of power so you might only be able to have it running a couple days.
i understand that. i didn't see any header pins on the circuit, just wondering how it's connected to the computer.
or the plaincloth just installs a skimmer on top of that other skimmer.
what are they going to do? tell the cops i stole their skimmer?
it just depends on where you work. some places offer it, others don't. neither of my roommates are offered direct deposit. they work in a fairly nice restaurant in southern ca. we've had to pay late fees on rent because they get paid on friday and it takes so damn long for the bank to process the check.
this is because the people who work at a gas station are not the brightest light bulbs in the bunch. hell, two months ago we got a call because all of his pumps were off. so we dropped a scheduled call and ran out to help. when the tech arrived on site, he discovered that the building was on fire. the fire department had both entities blocked off and the store was on fire. the man who called failed to mention this or the fact that his phones and building power was also off.
not to sound stupid... but, how does pre-pay for gas work??
bank - "sir, can you please stop swinging that sledgehammer at our atm?" me - "i won't be scammed"
no, no. shake it once, that's fine. shake it twice, that's okay. shake it three times and you're playing with it.
now we need someone like nic cage or indiana jones to find it.
this in brazil, and i belive they did it at night. the banks here keep the access to the atm machines open the whole night long in some places.
it honestly looks like it could take under 10 seconds to just pop on a new cap..
did they have you open the front panels and look inside? all the skimmers being found around here now are actually placed *inside* the machines, as the criminals apparently now all have copies of the keys to open them up. there was surveillance footage on the news of how they'd do it. park a big van in front of the pump, obscuring it from view inside. one person would go inside to make a distraction while the other would unlock the pump's front panel, quickly stick the skimmer chip next to the card slot with double-sided tape, and then button everything back up. it's all bluetooth now, so they don't even have to come collect them anymore, just park nearby and sync the data. they said the battery pack attached would be good for up to six months. as busy as the stations around here are, that's a *lot* of stolen cards.
i'm no expert, but i can imagine the slot itself would get expansions or scam readers inserted. every obstacle you add to deter theft has a countermeasure for a thief to exploit.
look we might as well just take it with us so we have time to verify all components, i got the bed of my truck open, help me with this dolly....
next thing you know you'd have us switching to the metric system. crazy talk.
it's legally required in most places that doors can always be opened from the inside. an alarm may be installed for it happening after hours or a specific emergency exit. those push bar handles on the inside are for that. if a fire started somehow, she could've died, even.
nipple insufficient, additional strip required for payment. please use attached verification post.
of course, the linked msr010 doesn't even support that, all it can do is read swipes, store a few thousand encrypted, and then download the data the data via usb later. it's totally for card skimming
"hello, i'm cliff from verifone. someone reported an intermittant problem with your card reader. i need to put this testing device on it so we can troubleshoot it. i'll be back in a couple of hours to collect it. sorry for any inconvenience."
as someone from holland where the magnetic strips have been gone (deactivated unless specified) for years, it really baffles me that this is still a thing in the usa. it's so susceptible to skimming..
i find it so weird how slow chip technology is rolling out in the us. tap to pay only became common in canada a few years ago, while chips have been standard for at least 8 years (probably closer to 10). afaik it's pretty much the opposite in the us. i just find it weird because canada and us usually have similar systems for stuff like that; and swipes are clearly not that secure.
top left of the skimmer in the image is a micro sd card socket, just left of the battery. pull off skimmer. swap card. replace skimmer. take card home and read it.
probably kick the shit out of you, given that they are are already criminals.
i work for a bank in the u.k. and reading things like this is amazing. your banking system sounds so old fashioned and dreadful. we get paid instantly straight into our accounts on the same day every month or week. banks are open monday - saturday. you can bank online and transfer between your accounts and send money to other people. you don't get charged for withdrawals. there's no minimum balance requirement or time it has to be in there.. it finally seems like we're winning at something for a change!
cheaper and more effective to replace the pump locks with unique keys held in the store, or bolt-on padlocks.
you go inside, hand the people your card and they set the amount you want on the pump. then you go outside like normal and the pump will stop right at the spot you wanted. the best part about pre-paying is it avoids pre-auth charges on your card. sometimes they take a few days to clear.
but sir. here at suntrust, we are the ones out to scam you. destroying a single atm is like capturing a single pawn on the chess board.
as someone who serviced atm in public places, nobody cares what you are doing.
go in dressed as maintenance and act like you're supposed to be there. that's the key to life and theft.
i suspect they make a pretty substantial amount of money illegally.
chips are one part. some atms have also moved to inserting the whole card sideways which requires a much bigger reader (since it has to read the whole thing at once, not just a little strip).
keys are notoriously insecure. there was a talk at a recent defcon about elevators, but they showed how the elevator panel keys are all mastered across entire regions of the country, and in some cases, high definition images of the keyed masters are available online, ripe for the taking. it doesn't take a stretch of the imagination to expand that possible vulnerability to any other small keyed lock system.
which is why i'm surprised retailers aren't pushing mobile payments (nfc based stuff like android, samsung and apple pay) more. everything i have read has them being way more secure in almost every way.
the metric system is a tool of the devil! my car gets 40 rods to the hogs head, and thats the way i likes it!
she seemed senile and was really freaking out. my guess is she unlocked it but didn't know how to open it.
interesting i didn't realize that actually but yeah when you say that there is little legitimate use for it :p
more likely just swap between two skimmers. they have to recharge the battery as well.
we have that in america, too. direct deposit. the vast majority of banks will also usually have money from checks available immediately, even while they process them.
probably can't, maintenance/equipment owners wouldn't be able to open it if something happens. most stations lease the brand and the equipment, you can't start tampering with corporate equipment.
when playing chess i prefer to take out every pawn before going in for the kill
of course. the bow. my bow. its right here. my bow. just let me get it. the bow. the bow which is mine.
as someone who used to work for fedexkinkos (the shirts look like fedex shirts though) you can wear a fedex shirt, and carry a white box into just about anywhere. you just have to look like you really don't have time for this shit.
friend and i were late for a final and didn't have time to park and walk to the building. (20-30minutes depending on the spot) we tossed a huge tote in my jeep with heavy stuff in it. then i simply turned on the hazards and drove clear across campus between buildings making sure to waive at campus police and administration. parked right next to the biology building doors, opened the tailgate and set the tote down with some other worthless stuff stacked on it and went inside. an hour later we loaded back up and drove off.
i think you are technically giving them all of your credit, not too much of it!
i know right. i mean we all had jobs before lol. at some point there os a diminishing return at the workplace. a few skimmers in a metro area is much more cost efficient for their time.
see the recent tsa master keys being plastered across the internet. anyone can make a copy of them and open practically any luggage no problem. you can even 3d print the keys. this is exactly what will happen to encryption if governments are allowed to enforce back doors. except as soon as the back doors are leaked in that case, the damage will be extremely wide spread, extremely fast, and far more harmful.
there was a few cases on the london underground recently where people would have small handheld nfc payment readers, and slowly shuffle up to people in crowds and subtly make transactions on their cards/phones. pretty sure it was just a proof-of-concept rather than a legitimate criminal operation, but it just goes to sure, nothing in this world is perfectly secure. e: didn't realise there was a security feature in the phones, maybe it was just contactless cards then?
also there's a mattress in the back, don't mind the cameras. that's where i do my fappin
and i'll ask for something in the back to get the cashier to walk away.
only thing i can think of is buying drinks on an airplane.
especially payroll checks. they usually have a number printed on them for verification for the bank.
oh, right. the poison. the poison for kuzco, the poison chosen especially to kill kuzco, kuzco's poison. that poison?
my time in the army has taught me a similar trick: if you are carrying an expanding file under your arm and walking with a purpose, no one will give you any shit. if you replace that file with a clipboard and adopt a slight scowl, people will actively seek to avoid you.
a bandit robbing an atm at a rodeo with a sherif posted outside?? haha this is the most southern thing i've ever read about happening. how did the dude get into the atm in the first place to just be able to grab stacks of 20s? it's locked up pretty good.
exactly. i participated in some white-collar crime a few years ago and it sure as hell beat any job i had. having to wake up at 5am and then go to work, doing shit that you hate for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week for a $1,500 paycheck at the end of two weeks is a complete shit deal compared to spending like a week tops to cook up a scheme like this and then earning $10k a week. the tradeoff is the stability and risk of going to jail. criminals don't get guaranteed paydays, but when they do get paid, it is a ridiculous amount for the work.
i work at a place with a lot of vehicles. i gas them up when needed, i once told the same guy pretty much every day for 2 weeks straight that his receipt paper was out. after the second week i gave up and started driving further to a different station because i was tired of having to go inside and wait in line to get my receipt. this store has lost literally tens of thousands of dollars from my company because the employees dont care.
those tsa master keys were pointless to begin with. those locks were a joke to pick anyway
don't you have to have authenticated a purchase by pressing the home button to bring up apple pay / android pay, and using your fingerprint or password? it's not active for purchases otherwise.
oh this thing? thats just my semi automatic rifle. its to protect against the scammers. the bullets are also untraceable for protection
i don't understand. do cards in the us not have those sim-like chips on them?
funny, i also took some of your money out of an nyc atm today.
they use satellite internet to prevent people using expired cards or vanilla visas' with $0.50 on them or something. but before that, i believe they used pretty much exactly this.
if not if you cash cheques constantly from the same place they usually clear them as there is a good history built up.
we are both wrong. i bamboozled the maths. it's actually 9449.84108333 almonds
in my defense, all your poisons look alike, you might want to think about relabeling some of them.
the funny part about all that is that none of that is guaranteed for non-criminals either. i mean most people dont make $1500 every two weeks and with the way vacation and holidays work in america, a number of people may go without getting paid for a stretch of time if something happens. and the funny part is that a criminal job forces you to adapt evolve and challenges you (cause you have to stay ahead), whereas work involves following the process and not speaking up due to office politics, etc. not to mention the skills you would pick up as a criminal versus listing something like "good at word" lol. not condoning criminal behavior but people never seem to evenly compare being a criminal versus low-end white collar/blue collar work.
i read that as "piece of shit" rather than "point of sale" initially. i guess both technically work
i believe with phones you do. but if you have a contactless enabled card then no such authentication is required. its far too easy to like and use, yet so damn useful. i can't decide if i love it or hate it.
android and samsung pay are the same, what he's referring to was the "tap to pay" credit cards that you'd touch to the kiosk. essentially someone just had to get close enough to trigger the chip in the credit card and it would transmit your card number back to the individual.
we should probably forcibly check the pockets of everyone in the building to make sure they aren't holding anything suspicious
most cards issued within the past couple years have them, yes, but a lot of merchants still don't have the hardware/software to accept chips and require you to swipe your card.
i like the idea of talking about a duane reade you go to like it's a general store in a one horse town
i think my math is still acceptable. i rounded from 724,800 to 725,000 but i figure that's acceptable because the variance in weight of rice grains will more than account for that.
if you cant remember all the poisons and that theyre alphabetically sorted you shouldnt be playing with poison.
systems administrator for point of sale systems here. yes, they do both work just fine.
wow that does make it much easier. i don't know why i didn't even consider that.
i'm glad android finally changed this. i seem to recall when they first started rolling it out that they required no physical authentication from the user before making a charge. looking into their latest features, it seems like they've done a lot of improvements on the security side of things. might be time to start looking into using it.
also, confusing as hell in the us to pay for things with a chip. even if they had the machine half the time you can't use it. lego store, sketchers and topshop seemed to be the only places i could use mine. the rest made me swipe and sign, something i've never done here in the uk.
people would stop and watch to see what is going on, but nobody would call 911.
or until someone reprograms amazon drones so they return to base and steal next deliveries and deploy them into a hidden drop zone after disabling gps loging.
the cashier just turns their head for a second to grab a pack of cigarettes and a nascar pit crew runs in, installs it, and runs back out before she turns back around.
plus, she made it into a (dumb, might i add) political video accusing trump of hiring people to kill opposition. i mean, i really think people are going a little too far with this hate/terror speech.
going to reply here since it's at the top currently - @op - you need to report their video. - click ---more then report - infringes on my rights that should lead you to another page where you can select "copyright infringement (someone copied my creation)" i'll admit i don't know how they handle this stuff, does something you create and upload automatically have a copyright? anyway that's probably the best thing you can do.
not to mention the horrible idea to use masks. loved that it was an actual person in the original. seemed more real
if you watch the entire thing, the big twist is the guy with the finger guns was trump!!! what a twist.
right? it greatly annoyed me that they used a handwritten check with $1 million dollars on it. then she doesn't know it was from trump until she gets the note, but then it flashes back to her seeing trump at the end. original video was acted and produced so much better from start to finish.
right? there's definitely way less cleavage in our version. maybe that's what we're missing...
what a about "an ivanaa creation" or whatever her name is at the start.
yeah, this seems like something h3h3 would definitely enjoy talking about.
i'm sending it to everyone, that ending had me in tears
she doesn't even act it out well. the original guy at least looks disheveled. she looks like she just stepped out of her makeup trailer.
i just hope they keep it about the plagiarism and not do what youtube commenters always do, and migrate towards attacking ethnicity or gender, completely negating any criticisms and negatively tainting the protests. then she looks like a victim. then jezebel starts an article about the injustice against her, a legion of women descend on the issue, and before you know it, the world has ended and *nyarlathotep the crawling chaos* has made _earth his bitch_. alright i might have gradually started talking about lovecraft but you know what my point was.
phillyd would be a good call for something like this.
that was my first thought. i'm suspicious of everything these days. op's title just said to me: "watch my video."
you know, making this a link would have been useful.
copyright exists at the moment an original expression of an idea is transfixed to a medium that may be observed or reproduced. in other words, forget youtube itself being the determination of whether a copyright exists, the moment you put this on your hard drive to upload to youtube you have a copyright. hell, the moment you shoot the video and have it on a memory thingie-disk-thing copyright exists. ial.
i agree. the original deserves waaay more views.
and the terrible idea to use clinton. a relatively unknown politician makes the whole story more plausible. besides that, a million dollar payoff? no reasonable person would believe it. why not a gazillion dollar payout? bad acting, bad writing, bad shooting. the whole ripoff video was like watching a middle school remake of a hollywood movie.
disliking is interaction, it's the same as liking a video.
i know right? definitely didn't see it coming after the target was hillary clinton and the check said donald trump and that you can see him when the envelop is dropped off and the message says make america great again. but apart from all that, totally fresh and unexpected.
easy: stretch the video from 3 minutes to 5 by adding unecessary filler shit and unfunny gags, not to mention the awful acting and terrible direction. that's how they ruined the hobbit too. though the acting might've been fine in the hobbit, i literally couldn't give a shit
copies joke in thread that denounces copying of material
send me a check for $25,000,000 and i'll go get a sex change to do it with boobs.
and how did she not realize killing clinton would help donald trump
definitely. remake it and have lucas show some tit.
didn't that guy partner up with a lawyer to start a thing specifically for helping people against these types of bullshit? it sounds perfect for this.
happy to help. shoot me an email :) not really a fupa issue, but we still will take care of ya!
i bet. they genuinely seem like very cool people. i am happy youtube is working for them.
and her video didn't make any sense. she killed clinton - woo, fantastic. it was ordered by trump. oh, fuck, that changes everything! it was basically dumbed down version with worse acting, worse camera, worse lighting. but, yeah, it has boobs.
i swear i'm half deaf. or my hearing goes in and out. thanks for the correction.
it was up to around 75,000 dislikes when i last saw it (vs 15,000 likes), i'm not surprised
he tends to cover stories more in reaction to what the nation wants rather than individuals messaging him though. those among the nation should be signal boosting.
eu high courts came in... health and safety... blah blah blah... now we gotta use this "trial" shit.
this is the right answer. there is no way there is enough money at stake here to take this to court, especially given that the chances of winning are not high.
good on you op for confirming /u/youknowit36 is tyler falbo. however, it's far too late. we are all tyler falbo. we are one. (brought to you by tyler falbo)
there is a difference between copying style vs copying shot by shot plus the idea of the narrative, many youtuber copy others, there are lots of vlogers now using casey neistat style of filming, but casey is influenced by tom sachs. a bugs life- ants, expedition to mars- red planet, armageddon- deep impact. but this video on yt posted by op shows a 100% copy of everything.
and "this is behind the scenes of my *second* official youtube video..." i wonder who else she ripped off?
"when hitler thinks your a scumbag" was my personal favorite.
not even mediocre. it's straight up terrible. it is so full of itself it makes me sick.
also, the click bait title. thats "helpful" also..
the only reason it has more views is because of the election, the person who copied it probably thought, "how can i cash in on youtube and make a video with a lot of views, i know since i am not original i'll rip off this video with few views and put clinton in the title along with other popular key words like donald trump and reap the real karma, cash when it blows up just from keywords and not content. " bout as bad as those iphone 8 videos which are bullshit.
that's completely false. dislikes affect youtube's search algorithms and are extremely important to a video's reach.
i saw the trump mask when the envelope gets dropped off. spoiled the surprise, for me.
same chick. she's wearing the same necklace and the same shirt. lazy production.
ya but trump was able to pull off an assassination of a decorated politician and presidential candidate for $1m...that's actually pretty impressive.
which makes theirs flavor of the month and the original timeless.
i get what you're saying but all i can think about is crutches for large busted women to prop the ladies up.
actually, they were defending against a claim of copyright infringement and defamation. op needs to be on the offensive and file a claim for copyright infringement.
damn, you're such an awesome dude. thanks for all that you do to help out the little guy!
what is the copyright claim? the videos aren't actually the same.
don't forget the racial stereotypes added at the end.
it also says it on the check so maybe half blind too ;)
even at 2.5 billion views it wouldn't be worth going to court. taking a contested ip case to court would be closing in on half a million dollars. ip lawyers are the farthest thing from affordable. it's also be a massive risk. this is not a clear cut case as people try to claim. it goes to a jury, nothing is guaranteed when you put an issue to a jury.
i bet the ripoff is bad enough they could claim it's a parody of the original.
shes a low class thief. there will be no response.
is tyler falbo the new kojima? -produced by tyler falbo -written by kojima
it's a bitch to match everything up though, need to have some pretty good actors that can say the exact same line in the exact same way or it'll look weird.
she was a famous viner so her talent can only last 6 seconds.
i love how the thumbnail is classic click bait. like what did her in a bikini have anything to do with the video?
i mean you're technically correct, which is the best kind... but boobies! the original was much better.
i wasnt going to watch either... now i have to watch both, brb
it's *worse* than that. the scene where they give her the envelope, he's wearing a donald trump mask! it's the same scene they replay at the end where he does the finger guns but they just don't show the full face the first time... even though she clearly looks up and sees him... god this is such a shit copy.
i wonder how her and her friends have so many subscribers for channels lacking videos. seems like they bought their subscriber base to get a jump.
she gives an "inspired by" the op creator in her credits... that's virtually a flat out admission she ripped him off.
never underestimate the power of boobs in the thumbnail on youtube
"you should brush up that cv. because your yt days are so over." was mine
plus there's the fact that it flat-out misunderstands what the original was trying to do. the political commentary is not the point. the political commentary is the setup to the joke and has an element of surprise that makes the payoff so much better. yet the remake is *all* about the political commentary and absolutely abandons any semblance of subtlety in the process.
i cant believe how noone here has brought up how racist the ripoff was! a shirtless stereotypical mexican working on her lawn? and for god's sake she had a black slave, wearing jeans and a straw hat, feeding her!!
that, and being a viner, with other popular viner friends to play small parts in the video to promote to the masses of teens who follow them.
while youtube do use the dislikes as a signal, the relationship between dislikes and search position will not be as simple as people expect. the youtube algorithm is designed to give you videos that keep you on the site for as long as possible. if the algorithm thinks people will dislike a vudeo so much they will leave the site in disgust, it won't show up. but if people dislike a video then click through to a bunch of related videos to see, like, a better implementation of the same idea the algorithm will still promote it.
i'm being overly simplistic. if you read the imdb the full story is when he was a kid a stranger knocked on his door and asked for someone that didn't live there. the guy left. he later found that some houses were robbed later. doesn't say whether or not that was the culprit.
there are some best practices to avoid getting sued in the opposite case, such as saying that characters are fictional and do not represent any actual individuals.
i mean, its really only relevant as long as isis is, or its in peoples minds. so while not "timeless" it certainly has a longer lifespan.
i can't speak on that since i can't view the videos at work. but from the sound of it it's a shot for shot "rip off" or remake of someone else's work which is similar to a note for note remake of a song. it also sounds like it is clearly not a parody. i can't pretend to really know what i'm talking about but this stuff always seems like a tricky legal grey area - but if you add in monetization it makes it a little more easy to side with the originator here. i was more just trying to correct the info about fupa.
big corporate america trying to keep the little rioters down.
just one of the many things tyler falbo is capable of. tyler falbo lives this way every day.
which is interesting, because it seems no one realized that it was dubbed until the creator mentioned it (i certainly didn't).
parodies are not automatically exempt from copyright infringement claims. some parodies will fall under fair use, like 2 live crew's parody of roy orbison's "oh, pretty woman." but a parody is not automatically fair use. courts consider four main factors when deciding whether something is fair use: 1. the purpose of the infringing work, including whether it is for profit or not 2. the nature of the original work 3. the amount and substantiality of the copied portion 4. the effect of the copying work on the market for the original work see copyright act of 1976 section 107 and campbell v. acuff-rose music inc.
i'd say she has a few years left before her "talent" starts to drop.
they took the original, wrecked the pacing, and added cleavage, politics, and racist stereotypes. i can see why the creator of the ripoff is popular.
i think she was trying to change the angle to *make* it political commentary because idk i guess she felt less bad for stealing if she gave it her own twist. problem was that she absolutely cocked up her own twist and it ruined it
the dark skinned dude was latino as well for what it's worth. everyone in the video was latino whose face we saw. heck i think literally everyone might have been latino which might be why the hilary was a mask.
i still can't believe "viner" or "vine star" was a thing. hey there you go people, in 2016 we got rid of vine.
that's why i always open reddit comments with "score below threshold". curiosity.
most likely it was the thief. we had a guy open the door to our office once and ask for a job application. it was a usaf office so we don't just hire people who walk in. later we found out "someone" took a bunch of laptops from another floor that had an open door.
eh. eventually isis will go away, but the idea of "generic terrorist group" will be easily understandable.
yea, but they have rudolph pitchforks!!!!! {_} 3-= ____( _|/---_
now i've only done it once in a school project about 10 years back, there might be better software now and we were quite young. but i'd still say that you probably did a better job than we did. it was pretty obvious in our movie.
also blatant continuity issues. i mean, the fucking video is 4 minutes long, how do you fuck that up!?
yes, the problem isn't that she derived her film from someone else's, it's that she attempted to copy someone else's work and only made a token effort at adding some originality. this is something a first semester film student would do just to prove they know how to work a camera and video editing software, not something someone who is trying to make a original (albeit derived, but what isn't?) and inspired piece that provides insightful commentary would do.
yeah, basically vetting the neighborhood. like joe pesci in home alone when he's pretending to be the cop. i was just clarifying it wasn't fact and the writer was making a (likely) assumption. i've had someone random ask me if i was home alone, which is weird as fuck. i said no.
are you absolutely certain that this isn't ascii art of a reindeer deep-throating a dick? because it looks like rudolph is gettin' a dude off.
you did it wrong. almost every movie has about 90% of its dialogue adred. the key is to take small segments from the scene, and have them redo it over and over again. you put it on repeat. you can do it with most sound programs.
i mean, the payoff didn't even make sense, not only for her but even for the audience. she assassinates hillary, and we/she are supposed to be surprised that she helped trump? that was literally the whole joke and it doesn't work anymore.
christ, i'd probably get pissed off at the person asking, but then again they'd probably stab me.
more often than not people don't get downvoted by their opinion but by the way they express it. even if you are voicing a pretty normal opinion it's not surprising if you get downvoted for doing so unpolitely. half of what you say is how you say it.
the title of the video will have made a difference also.
i wish i could agree with you. a lot of the times, i agree it's because they were being rude. too many times i've seen a downvote because of a simple opinion, usually in anything politics related.
he's from virginia and was involved with the sentencing of our corrupt republican governor (mcdonnell - "indicted on federal corruption charges for receiving improper gifts and loans from a virginia businessman"). boente stated "no one is above the law... not a high public official, not even the highest public official in [virginia]." interesting pick.
dude it's going to suck in may. this is reality now. this is the new normal.
wiki changes fast with news, those sections won't be reliable for a few days at least.
very bad. presidential cabinet positions exist to advise the president. trump did not allow her to see the executive order before issuing it.
i can dig it. the left's bench is pretty fucking light these days. "fell on sword to defend constitution against orange nemisis" is some easy to spin bona fides.
my first political memory is watergate and the resignation. you aren't wrong here at all.
until you realize trump could cut the cord in the mission to save money.
trumps on a straight path to being impeached. my theory is, is that this is what the gop wants. they'll let him go crazy, get impeached, and then pence will be in office. after trumps craziness everyone won't both the gop too much with their laws because they won't be as crazy as trumps. it's the perfect bamboozle, just a theory though.
imo the scary part is that this was never run by her beforehand, because trump presumably knew the answer already. so he puts it in her court, publicly, knowing very well she would object. now she's publicly defying the president, and her firing is the next logical step. seems very calculated.
the greatest thing that can come of this is a renewed public interest in politics and a strengthening of the legislative branch
which is ironic considering he doesn't trust vaccines
plot twist: he says tomorrow he won't defend the ban either and gets fired as well.
if someone really drained a swamp, they would be removing mostly water. the muck, mud, and rot would be left in the swamp. so i guess he's making good on that promise.
soon any and all voices of reason will be replaced by yes men. then, presumably, he starts nuking everything.
more desperately than ever, we need you president underwood.
you're killing me, sauls! it ended on such a cliffhanger too.
i highly recommend it. i decided to catch up on it last year when the new season aired and it's so good. even if you don't care for the story or the atmosphere or any of that, the quality of the content is phenomenal. kevin spacey gives a powerhouse performance and so does robin wright. and the cinematography is amazing too. just superb "television", honestly.
alternative words, alternative facts, alternative right im starting to see a trend
yeah, clearly jeff sessions is megatron, not red skull.
he also didn't show his new head of dhs. we thought there was a problem with transparency before? now even the people in charge of enforcing shit are out of the loop.
yeah i've been freaked by this and my dad just went into a long ramble about the saturday night massacre. i guess i can see it.
2 years actually if people get out and vote for senate and house elections in 2018.
such a nice change of pace not being mauled by grizzlies throughout the school day.
alex jones has finally exposed himself as the "controlled opposition" many accused him of over the years. the dude is literally making up news now about how trump's approval ratings are higher than they were 1 week ago, and how everything main stream media is saying are all lies. alex jones is going all fucking in on trump. he's no longer a conspiracy nut, he's a propaganda mouthpiece for trump.
though after everything we've seen thus far, what makes anyone think trump will leave power peacefully? whether it be through losing in 2020, conviction by impeachment, or even pence and the cabinet utilizing section 4 of the 25th a., have we any evidence that trump & co. will respect those processes and abandon the office?
wouldn't that be something. all these twists and turns it's like we are living in a political drama on prime time tv.
ssshh. don't tell the_donald. obama was already deporting more people with criminal records than previous presidents.
i've noticed the same thing, normally i'd be balls deep in the overwatch event, cods 2xp week, or grinding it out in destiny. barely done any of that the last 10 days. there's dickery afoot in america.
yeah, it always struck me that draining a swamp would just leave a murky cess-pit full of exposed skeletons...
yep. purge the system and deregulate as much as possible. president bannon and king trump have a plan!
is it fucked up that i would happily take president underwood over trump, knowing full well how underwood got to be where he is?
as of today, "yes" and "no" will be replaced by "donald"
honestly, even when obama made an order that was being obstructed by congress et al, i didn't see anyone wanting complete and utter loyalty to the president, rather that they wished there were less republicans in control to obstruct what obama wanted. i feel as if trump supporters have this ill-informed notion of what exactly liberals as a whole were complaining about and are using that view as a means of "getting their turn", despite the majority of liberals never even wanting a turn.
time to get a little scared? no my friend, time to start collecting riot gear.
nah, megatron's views on race were pretty progressive.
he also bounced a bunch of people off of the us security council, as in more or less everyone from the military that you know, likely should know about that shit? goood times.
presumably because he suspected she would react as she did, and didn't want to fire her preemptively.
i saw on cnn "monday night massacre". i wondered why the title was that, now i know...
the house is up for grabs, but there is a near-zero chance of democrats taking back the senate in 2018. to just tie, they would have to keep all of their current seats, and get *both* nevada and arizona. to get a majority, they'll also need one of the following: * mississippi, * nebraska, * tennessee, * texas, * utah, or * wyoming. the incumbents in each of those seats won their last election by more than 15%.
and it tells us he was furious. so furious that he insisted this exact statement be released and wouldn't leave it to his staff.
it really does and thats exactly what he apparently is. seeing his twitter rants would make you think in a joking matter "who gave this idiot a twitter account haha..." ...who gave this guy a country.
"you said you wanted to be around when i made a mistake, well this could be it sweetheart."
first they came for the... highest positions in federal government???
trump will never resign voluntary. even if they impeach him, i imagine they'll have to drag him out of the white house kicking and screaming.
exactly. a trump supporters i'm friends with on facebook lauded this act and trump's executive orders as the beginning of a revolution.... (in a positive sense)
y'all better start building that wall because, you know, the wall we're building down south works both ways so the only direction our refugees can move will be your direction. with global warming it ought to be pretty nice up that way in a few years.
executive orders are not laws. only the legislative branch has the power to write laws.
he's just whoring himself out for a position in trump's government. trump just awards cabinet positions to whomever rubs his back. that's how bannon got in.
hey, just in case you haven't seen the rest of the world (literally every continent including two separate protests on antarctica) is with you. toronto and london (and i'm sure others) had protests outside embassies and consulates. this is your fight, but you've got a friend in like....a few billion people around the world. let us know and we'll help.
who is the "& co." in the scenario where pence is taking over? are there a significant number of people in important positions who would break the law to keep trump rather than follow pence? is the secret service going to stop the u.s. marshals from executing a writ from the u.s. supreme court to enforce the removal of the impeached and convicted president from the white house? are the generals going to follow orders from trump rather than pence?
it's such an arbitrary thing. i don't get it at all. i asked the sane when i read his 100 day plan. why would you arbitrarily limit yourself to eliminating 2 regulations every time you want to enact one? eventually you're eliminating stuff that shouldn't or doesn't need elimination because you tired your own hands.
i feel bad for house of cards, how is it going to top this!
they're aware, they often quote that. well, that and drone strikes.
the thing that worries me is if we eventually become numb to trumps antics. we all need to be mindful about resting and not binging on information. unplug for a while and don't burn out. we all need to be politically engaged these next 4 years. i'm saying this mostly to myself but i imagine others will agree.
i've always thought it was like mr. burns hiring homer simpson as the nuclear safety inspector. burns knows that since homer knows absolutely nothing about nuclear safety he won't have to pay for any of the costly safety precautions that would otherwise have come up had a competent person been given the job.
it's fucking mind blowing. how the hell can someone who would publicly say they want to defund departments whose functions they don't understand get nominated to run anything? this is a god damned circus.
but he's black. black = urban. stupid libtard. /s
"doctor, is it cancer?" "aladeen...... i mean, donald "
i didn't like obama using executive orders as much as he did but obstructionists didn't leave much choice. trump hasn't even given the option of a balance of power.
because even they aren't dumb enough to vote these things in.
wants the apocalypse or something to that effect, you can read about it in his book.
coincidentally, both were portrayed by hugo weaving. also agent smith, v from v for vendetta and elrond. what a great actor.
or because he didnt know he was supposed to because he has no idea how government works. that's the funnier option i guess. and not unlikely.
it mostly depends on how well trump polls and how closely those senators identify with trump. if he pisses everyone off, and those senators have records of supporting the decisions that pissed everyone off, they could lose their own primary to a challenger from the right who is anti-trump, and then the new person could lose to a dem, or the new person takes over and becomes a trump-dissident on the right. it's unlikely, but it can definitely happen. texas is probably the most likely, depending on how it goes down, because texas has really large liberal blocks in the cities.
every seat in the house of representatives is up for re-election, though
we should be hearing directly from him, in all his idiocy.
especially when it was immediately followed up by his normal writing style a hour later.
the odds of america surviving a trump presidency are 3,720 to 1.
don't worry, they'll find a way to victimize themselves one way or another.
actually they came for the muslims first, then the government employees who stood up for them.
has it really been 10 days? i guess time flies when you're...terrified for the future of humanity.
i can't think of anything i'd rather see right now, than trump being dragged screaming from the white house.
i left a post of mine open to the public recently and you wouldn't believe the kind of things i'm hearing from trump supporters about "liberal biased news."
until they are struck down by the supreme court, for all practical purposes in people's lives, they are laws.
hell yes this 100%. i live in canada and was at the toronto protest, there are tens of thousands if not millions here in canada who want the situation in the u.s to just be a joke or bad dream. i have family from all over the country (from the west coast, to maritimes) and all of them and their friends are willing to fight for our neighbors down south.
this was the most accurate description of politics i've seen in a while.
this isn't a tv show? but it's on all the time when i tune in.
combat outrage fatigue, like david brock was saying!
fucking ditto. i can't stay off reddit or twitter longer than an hour.
grimes will forever be the person i most identified with on that show.
as a texan myself, don't be fooled for a fucking second that he wouldn't be interested in the oil business. the problem is that he's been given a green light to outright lie to the american people with a smile on his face and expects them to bend over and take it. businessmen are up there with lawyers and politicians in terms of general distrust among the public, and we just elected the shadiest businessman on the block because, "at least he can't be worse than our politicians." we're going to be proven wrong, and we deserve what happens because of our ignorance.
looking back now vinnick is errely like a republican bernie sanders.
do you want the donald news or the donald news? the donald news...? you're hiv donald. :( ... ? :) ... :( ... :) ?
at first i was going to mention the difference between "so little" and "so few" but you're right, all of them use tiny and oft incorrectly spelled words.
no no, focus camps where you learn to focus on whats important through fulfilling work!
it's not a guess, it's the truth. the lead-up to his inauguration was fraught with stories about the fact that he didn't have cabinet picks lined up because he didn't realize he should have. hilary probably had a list drafted of who she'd nominate to the positions, as i'm sure most presidents elected in the past have. all trump cared about was getting himself the big chair and then was told after he won the electoral vote that he would have to replace the entire white house staff. he had to scramble to figure out who was going to do what, instead of being able to transition smoothly into a new cabinet. but, ya know, i'm obviously being biased. i mean, he ran for the office, but how was he supposed to know he'd have to do all that? it's not like he's a politician who's familiar with the law and how the country is run.
with occasional dad jokes thrown in both to annoy, *and* to solidify the point for later recollection!
especially how texas voted in the presidential election, it shows how much people really didn't like trump. and that number is only increasing in parts around the state
an absolute boat loads of gerrymandered to heck and 100% safe.
this is tremendously true. people get tremendously wrapped up in the tremendous way trump speaks. they just don't understand how tremendously the man trys to be a tremendous speaker. tremendous tremendous tremendous.
the funny thing is, we are. i think the whole inauguration size came down to trump being mad and forcing the press secretary to say what trump would.
pretty sure that's exactly what they did when they elected him
the muslims were bait. now trump has an excuse to replace people who don't agree with him.
thank you! maybe i should run for president... actually, that's a terrible idea. i'm stubborn as shit and cry *way* too easily.
getting repeatedly punched by the fists of life tend to do some brain damage.
well, i guess we can count it as 11 now. at the very least 10.5. it's perfectly normal to use decimals when figuring out how long into a presidency we are before a government official is accused of betraying the state, right? right??
"the facts have a well-known liberal bias."--rob corddry
i'm sure there was already a term in russian as it's a standard method of death over there.
they can be struck down by lower federal courts and not just the supreme court. eos don't have nearly the power of laws and can't involve the appropriations of money.
that is because texas does not really want the wall.
ever say a word so many times that it loses all meaning and you forget how to spell it? now i can't spell tremendoas right.
keep your eyes out for even more loyalty tests. 25% of the population has already proven their loyalty by accepting his blatant lies over plainly visible reality and trusting trump's word over verifiable facts. now he is determining which agencies are headed by people sympathetic to him and which are willing to disobey the judiciary and support a supreme executive.
and tried to strip down the epa people who believe in climate change... right? did that happen? did we confirm this with a reputable source?
before the nazis, the boogeymen of choice were still "the hun" (in both meanings). let that sink in: it took over 700 years for the world to know a terror greater than the huns. it's absolutely necessary to make the comparison now and again lest we forget what happened and suffer its repetition.
the whole fired apprentice from all season appear in final episode and then point to trump ala phoenix wright yelling 'you are fired!'. and then donald breaking down in emotion screaming 'noooo!! this cant be! i am the-----' 10/10 best ending ever
tell that to people being kicked out that wouldn't have a few days ago. i mean understand there is a very real difference, but eos still have real effect on people's lives.

not that he is the greatest speaker at 33, but compared to the incoherent rambling that comes out of his mouth today i think it's night and day. in the video he doesn't go off on a tangent at the end of every sentence or rely on his hands to talk.
this smells like a disease. some kind of dementia or senility.
reminds me of that old family guy episode where lois just repeats 9/11 to become the mayor of quahog
nine... *(crowd leans in anxiously)* eleven *(crowd goes fucking wild)*
is that the secret? i know someone who does exactly that and i was always bewildered as to why everyone always found this person charasmatic when they first meet her. and then as you know her longer you realize she literally parrots exactly what you say but in an excited tone.
/u/evoxio better send it in! it's certainly worthy.
i give it 12 hours before the facebook post: "on july 25, 2016, god performed a miracle. in the two cities struck by this same bolt of lightning, two children were dying of cancer. god struck them at the same time and cured both instantly, leaving doctors and scientists baffled. liberals say miracles don't happen but this is proof!!! like and share to spread the word of god's great power!"
had i not known any better, i would have thought someone drew the lightning on paint or something.
as someone who caught a cp 97 rhydon today... -_- still, nice to add something new i guess.
i would absolutely love this on my computer as well. what an incredible shot...
this is a picture of jersey city, taken from nyc. that's exchange place in the photo
i don't think i've ever been through a thunderstorm like that in nyc. i visit family here rather often and the storms usually ain't much. this one was fun, especially in the ues with the thunder booming off the buildings!
that is how you get lightning shots. probably a long exposure to get the lightning layered with a long exposure for everything else. this erases most of the reflections on the water and makes everything look nice.
the storms we just had in the nyc area were obscenely heavy. some of the heaviest i've seen. now, to anyone from somewhere they get real weather, feel free to call me a pansy. but today's storms were no joke.
tripod and a long exposure and what seems like a healthy bit of editing
look at those upvotes rise to drown out what is actually going on. impossible upvotes.
you may be on to something. the bolt that hits the tree is the same diameter as the bolt that hits the building across the river. it's as if the bolt is on the same plane rather than having any sense of depth, such as the depth between the trees on this side of the river and the building across the river.
it's got to be multiple exposures, at the very least.
why do i have you tagged as "gorilla suit banana party dude"?
i'm calling nil on facebook odds. your comment didn't contain a single spelling or grammar mistake.
spoiler: there is no such thing as a pure image. all of them are processed and edited to greater or lesser degrees. even ones straight off the camera are processed by the onboard computer to make the best shot the camera can estimate. half the talent of a photographer is the processing. and if you don't believe me, look up videos on ansel adams.
i know it is, the title just says nyc. wanted to make sure my city gets some love!
somewhere in that picture is me completely wrenched waiting for my bus, that storm was brutal and scary. edit : eh i'll keep it
i think the strikes aren't hitting all at once. these photos are made with long exposures (10-30 seconds) that catch multiple strikes.
it's probably multiple very short exposures stacked together which is why it's so dark. you can trigger the camera off the flash of the lightning. i've never tried lightning, i just know it's a thing you can do.
an old ask reddit asked what prank you would pull with a few thousand dollars budget. i thought it would be cool to rent a truck and a few gorilla suits and go to a smallish town and buy up all of the bananas in every store. no words exchanged. no theatrics. just a dude in a gorilla suit loading multiple carts with all the bananas on display and paying cash. then, after word started spreading around town about the weirdo buying every single banana in town, circulate ads for a "banana party" at a rental house. the party would be you and your friends in costume, sitting on a giant pile of bananas, giving them out to whoever shows up. no other food, booze, or music. guests just eat as many bananas as they like then leave.
so are we just skipping over the fact that /u/iamgmoney discovered that this photo documents the complete disintegration of a tree? my mind is fucking blown.
seemingly blown to bits, based on some other photos in this thread
hey montana! you might be from montana if you know how to pronounce helena and havre.
that will only work once, the next time they will steal the "proof"
i am interested in how this works. care to explain?
watermarks in your pictures would make me less like to hire you as a plumber fam
exactly. looks more like evidence of a long exposure shot (see the ship's masts in the foreground), along with some possible overlays completed post-shot.
yea, but it doesnt storm as heavily as it did during this incident. i spent a month in jacksonville and thought it was cool that it stormed basically same time everyday but besides the thunder and lightning it never felt like much of a "storm" if that makes any sense, at least compared to some of the ones we get in hawaii
i wouldn't worry about it. you can trace the origin of a photo online so when seen (obviously nat geo check) the original sender will get messaged. alas, karma is served.
how about the complete disintegration of the wooden pole also on the front page today?
well you're in luck because i live in a 3 bedroom, 1 1/2 bath home worth 70k, and my house payments are about 700/per month. but you don't really need much by means of resources. it's the 4th largest state in the country and we just now got a million people so if you like to be all by yourself, you'll do just fine. we also have lots of of murder-animals, just to keep things interesting and make sure we don't get bored.
i think the town's name of hill valley is just as funny. i mean which is it?
yup. posted a pic of me and a friend drinking 6lb milkshakes in a comment section once. chive jumped all over it, and we've appeared in their shit a few times now
he intentionally posts images without watermarks and tracks their reuse with reverse image search services so he can extract settlements.
3 posts later - "eh, everyone's already seen it anyway."
i'm guessing it's two shots, one where only the lightning is exposed (i mean, look how thin it is, it didn't even bloom), and one where everything else is filled in. that'd explain the lack of reflection even though the lightning is brighter than things that do reflect. also, the total light emitting volume of the lightning is extremely small, even compared to a building.
can confirm, was in miami earlier this year and the lightning was so bad it looked like there was a faulty neon sign outside of our room. a couple hours later we left the room to hit the clubs and the streets looked like it never even rained.
probably multiple long exposures. one for the general night scene, and another for the lightning strike. at least.
murder animals? you mean like wolves and cougars and shit?
i am from montana and currently visiting in seattle. wa has such diverse landscapes! it's really quite amazing. and the food in seattle is so great. ate at a little mexican joint on the other side of the block and it was better than any mexican place i have ever been to in montana. had filipino food yesterday. you'll never find that back home...
a large valley between two very large mountains, in the valley is a hill.
shit. i bet that brought a lot of boys to your yard
"you posted an image on the internet! gimme 10 thousand dollars, broke colkege student who just wanted to show his friends a cool photo!"
missoula and bozeman have some pretty good mexican. but, yeah, most of the state is pretty homogeneous as far as food goes.
obviously the target is sites like buzzfeed that make shitloads of money via advertising. by using his pic, they're making money off him, which means he deserves compensation, which he executes. i don't see a problem at all. he even mentioned how facebook is problematic, he's obviously not going after some students sharing a cool pic.
it just shows you where else the link has been posted on the site.
the guy on the right looks like he has a comically small, average teenage head with a soldier's body.
i wasn't even going to give it a second thought but knowing it's close by i think i'll make a trip there soon. thanks for saying something.
everyone on the stage wrote their own questions. we shared them with the moderators, then the mods got to as many as possible while maintaining the flow of the debate.
i saw a man with no teeth and no shoes standing on a corner in my new hometown when i moved there 3 years ago as i'm driving the moving van. here i am bringing all my stuff to a bigger, better house, thinking what hot shit i am for affording the place. then i see him and realize that he has literally nothing but the sign in his hand. people driving by him giving him no more mind than a street sign or a shrub. i drove on by, reasoning that i was too busy to stop and help him out, it was moving day. somebody else will give him a couple bucks. i never saw him again. is he ok? did he move on out of town? turn his life around? die in a gutter od'd on heroin? i'll never know cause i didn't give him the time of day. i was too busy pretending i had arrived. these are people who deserve love and happiness as much as me or anyone. but that day to me he was a shrub. never again.
too many weird, wild things to count. the most surreal was hearing back from @midnight which i love.
fake internet points are the best compensation. except money. i likes money.
gallup does a random sampling of undecided voters in the area in which the debate is held. this time it was my home town and i was lucky enough to answer when they called.
between that and what south park might turn me into i'm pumped. i know bobby moynihan would crush the bit, but maybe go leslie jones for shock value or something? i don't know. i'll get with my writers.
st. patrick center provides temporary housing, job training, drug counseling, and help with mental health issues. there is a severe homelessness problem in this country. most of us are one or two paychecks away from being homeless as well. we need to start seeing and intervening on their behalf.
i'm already the sexy ken bone so i'm thinking bust out the old jedi robe / lightsaber combo and be obi wan kenboni
we need more clean plants like mine to be approved for construction. older plants can't retrofit to be best in class environmentally because it would drive them out of business. that means we need newer ones manned by the displaced workers from those being retired.
be who you are. if people don't like who you are, they're not the right people to have in your life.
several companies have approached me for endorsements. i have 2 rules for working with them. 1)it's a responsible company that i believe in and that i vet to the best of my ability. i will do my best not to associate with any companies that hurt the environment or their workers. 2) 10% of all money i receive must go to my local preferred homeless charity the saint patrick center in saint louis, mo. same rules for paid appearances.
my uncle called me today and seemed genuinely star struck as if we hadn't been drinking beer together the week before.
radiohead is my all time favorite, nobody blends genres like thom yorke and the boys.
i know i look old cause i'm fat and bald and dress like it's 1954, but i'm only 34 and ineligible to run! there are over 2000, yes 2000 legally registered candidates. one of them must have something to offer. get your voice out there for one of them.
obviously reducing energy usage in the winter by providing everyone with stylish red cable knit sweaters, duh.
he talked to me about the peak of the coal industry in the 20s and how it has evolved with the nation's infrastructure over the years. then his security team reminded him that it was time to go yet again. i think his wife was waiting on him.
on soft ball and hockey rec teams i wore 18 for the great 60s era saint louis cardinal mike shannon. he's been the voice of the cardinals basically my whole life. stan gibson is for stan musial and bob gibson.
he sort of? answered this on his jimmy kimmel appearance i think, basically said he turned on his cell phone as soon as he was allowed and had a thousand+ messages lol
i'm sorry you're confused, ken bone is the cable knit sweater wearing a fat guy.
ken bone does not ask. he commands by his imposing yet cuddly presence.
yes, definitely. being undecided is not the same as being indecisive. we just have a lot to consider this election.
my power plant supports a robust drug testing policy, sorry dogg. my dad on the other hand is all in.
i'm close, but i will not be announcing my decision. i want you to all make up your own minds. don't rely on my opinion, just the positive message.
it's been unreal, both the good and the bad. everybody has responded to the positive message with the exception of a few nuts. some of the stuff makes it tough to stay positive, but i try to spin it for the good. for instance, i've had almost a quarter million new twitter followers, and only 3 death threats. great ratio! seriously though, thanks to my home town pd for making me feel safe when the creeps come out to play.
i wanted to hear more about environmental protection from mr. trump, and more about jobs from secretary clinton. they both did alright, but all answers from politicians are pretty much canned and rehearsed. kinda like the ones i do on the radio.
it was a bad call. i need to fire my agent, except i can't because i'm my agent.
it's flattering, but please don't. i cannot serve since i'm not old enough.
somebody set one up on my behalf, but jimmy kimmel is buying me a new one since i did his show. i guess if go fund me sends me that money it'll go to the charity. you'll see me wearing it on his show next week.
i had this weird hallucination where all the sudden everyone gave a shit what i had to say. bizarre.
i don't even go to hoa meetings, but if i really thought i could effect positive change i'd consider it.
i'm in la late next week, maybe we can hook up. big fan here. my dad wants to roll wit da dogg big time, you me and him could do some tight stuff. that didn't sound cool at all, did it?
without our future generations of doctors we can never solve the healthcare dilemma in this country! you are the future! you are going to improve the lives of your future patients and their families every day for the rest of your life! stick it out, i know you are sacrificing a lot, but they need you.
we both worked at a bowling alley in granite city called amf bowland. i was a lane attendant which meant i walked around cleaning, throwing away beer bottles, and getting stuff from storage over to the bar and snack bar to restock during shift. she worked the snack bar, which meant i did none of the stuff listed above. i just watched her clean the grill cause when she bent to scrub it i could see dat ass was fat.
only the head nurse was able to speak up about it.
any president would be instantly twice as good for the country with this one simple step. appoint experts in each respective field to cabinet positions. not political donors or old friends i owed a favor. 2nd action, get blasted at camp david till i pass out.
i have 4 cats. 1) angel female, a mostly white calico. she was a christmas present to my wife. we were too broke for me to get her a gift while i was working through school. i surprised her with a kitten that a coworkers cat had. i wrapped a cat collar in an old jewelry clamshell and put it under the tree. heather and angel are friends forever. 2) daisey - female, a tortie with white gloves and ascot. my bff. she was a full grown cat we adopted from a shelter at about 1 year of age the christmas after angel. 3) zero - male. my son named him after the borderlands character. black with wisps of gray. rescued from the shelter as a little kitten. chosen by our son. name changed from ringo when we adopted him. 4) shadow - male. an asshole we lured inside. he was a stray living in our storm drain, a small kitten weaned too early. heater got him inside. he loves to piss on stuff sometimes, but for some reason we still like him.
they have been thinking it since the days of my great grandfather (swear on my life it's true) bentley bone and his son, my great uncle oriel (pronounced oral) bone.
when it's cold in your jail cell. i'm not big on stripes.
what's an nfl? i'm from st. louis, something called an nfl has abandoned my twice in my lifetime already. that's more times than a typical dead beat dad and still they want my money. not happening.
the mods got to as many as time permitted, but we did not know the order. the reason is, let's say the economy discussion is going great, they do another audience question on it. name calling gets out of hand again? total topic change, skip all the rest on the economy. because of this mod controlled flow we got a better discussion, but the audience has no warning that their question is coming.
had a goatee for a while, full on neck beard for about a year. clean shaven for a long time. the stache is for my grandpa, the first ken bone who tied in (not lost, it died too) his battle with cancer two days before christmas last year. his stache was unparalleled.
i breathe the same air and drink the same water as you. my job doesn't change that. we only get one earth and we're doing a shit job taking care of her. i feel that my plant is operating in a responsible way, but as a whole we are going to need big energy innovation if we want our grand kids to have the same planet we do.
when i was 17 i spent a winter homeless. even as a young white female very few people were willing to help me out, there were nights i spent out in 3 degree weather because i didn't make it to the shelter on time. it was one of the hardest things i ever went though in my life. now as an adult i do everything i can to help the homeless who want to, get out of their situation. people like you give me hope.
we love you too, kenneth. it actually delighted me to hear you read my tweet. thank you for doing the show, encouraging people to vote and being an all-around good dude! ps - team mystic
i hope if south park does feature you its in some completely crazy random way, like you are a galactic invader with the bone-ers.
i heard moynihan and piece of toast have huge creative differences
man are you seriously that good? wow!! insightful, conscientious, super funny, compassionate and intelligent. why the fuck couldn't you be our president?!
paging /u/awildsketchappeared or /u/shitty_watercolour we need a mock-up of obi wan kenboni.
can you elaborate on what processes makes your coal plant so environmentally friendly? i did a co-op at one and we were one of the cleaner plants in canada by a long shot but it was still a long way from ideal. that said, i completely agree with your statement that clean fossil fuel initiatives are necessary while we make the switch to sustainable green energy. easier said than done, especially considering our current tech wouldn't be able to accommodate peak loads or uncooperative weather conditions. also, you seem like a dude with a good sense of humour about yourself. you're good people mr. bone.
that is incredibly kind of you to share your good fortune with those in need. thank you.
i think you are making a lot of people happy in a good way.
i really hope you hang out on /r/radiohead :) i mean, they are a pretty great band. you're even cooler now!
so you're saying that a 2020 candidacy is possible?
i'm not gonna say you're wrong... because you aren't. cable knit sweaters are a gift.
i like to think bill went around to each questioner and gave the answer he imagined himself giving if he were in the debate. excellent that he had something like that teed up to talk to you about. did trump or anyone from his team talk to you after?
you should drunkenly shitpost with us in some /r/cardinals gdts next season!
i could not imagine having so much attention drawn to me in only a few days
we support this indecision like your sweater supports you.
many lives were claimed but eventually the victor stood, the rest saw their better. mr. rogers in a bloodstained sweater.
you're like mr. rogers and ron jeremy mixed together
this is a man who understands that no matter who he supports, the internet will turn on him.
what about a sub sandwich where the bread also wraps around?
hey it's me, your dad. can i get snoop's number???
not hiding behind throwaways to comment on porn subreddits, you are an inspiration to us all.
we'll keep obama until your 35th birthday, then it's the bone show.
i can't buy you an olive suit, but i have some olives that i've had for a long time if you want them.
the day anybody thinks ken bone is an asshole is the day we really are in trouble
if mr. bone agrees, i'll name it whatever he wants and give everyone red sweaters.
you say this, and we're all creeping the shit outta your post history like "he was among us the whole time!"
you would have the honesty appeal of a bernie sanders, the outsider appeal of a donald trump, the foreign policy experience of a gary johnson, and you'd be up against likely incumbent hillary clinton.
we need a tv show give a dogg a bone where you and snoop are detectives. his old partner (one day from retirement) is gunned down and you're his new partner. it's like a photonegative miami vice.
id say its probably the best thing to come from the election thus far.
every president needs a portrait of them done, ken
mine was "so long and thanks for all the fish" so you got me beat
the bone abides. i don't know about you, but i take comfort in that. it's good knowin' he's out there, the bone, takin' her easy for all us sinners.
listen, how is every one of your responses perfect? how is it possible? great people can be at a loss for the perfect response, but bone, never.
dang. before i was joking, but you're actually a viable candidate.
hats off to oriel for bearing the name with pride.
ken the very fact that you're still responding 2 hours after the ama gives me all the proof that you are capable at handling the highest office in the land.
ken... i don't know how you are still going. i have never enjoyed reading an ama so much.
the rams just went for some smokes, don't worry about it. -los angeles
6 hours later and you're still replying to people, that's commitment.
your way of looking at the hard problems of the world (cancer, homelessness, the environment) is a lesson to us all. i would ask if you would consider being a philospher, but you already are.
just give this comment in with your essay op. ken's already marked it for the teacher.
hey i just want to say i'm glad you aren't in that position anymore.
ken's too big for you now. won't even you hit u back up in his ama.
this current season has so far had a strange lack of any sort of sci-fi element. what gives?
because he's 34, and you have to be 35 to be president. i might vote for him anyway.
with how toxic this election cycle has been, this is the healthiest thing to happen to the country. we desperately needed a distracting laugh.
i did a video shoot for jokes for votes today, check them out.
he's always known as one of the best networkers and connectors in the entire world. he can make you feel genuinely important and befriended in 30s.
dude, as a formerly undecided fan of yours, i've decided now to endorse you. bone2020(theyearnothisvision)
it's a good thing i'm not running for office. i'm just trying to get you all to vote, you don't need to have another fat guy trying to convince you who to vote for.
ken is a straight shooter with upper management written all over him.
i made a comment earlier today. it was in regards to a guy with a two-tone dick. i'm locked in on my vote.
i don't know if i should feel bad or good about this. i like to think we're all a little bit of ken. maybe we've all got a small bit of bone in us.
what this guy is trying to say is, it would be a landslide.
snoop is the old school, by the book, partner and bone is the hot rookie coming in playing it fast and loose
it's like he's made from reddit. skynet has begun. there's no way he can be human.
chris wasn't with him when he was shooting in the gym.
perhaps real life is strange enough on its own right now
if i promise to vote, will you teach me how to meme?
i think so, just a little rushed. it'll set in when life slows back to normal, but i'm trying my best to stay the same old me. i like me.
he's probably more worried that he's been replaced by ken bone in the hearts and minds of americans.
i think he would be more depressed that his decision influenced anyone. ken bone seems like the kind of guy that ask "what does this say about our political system?".
the ol' reddit dillemma-- we all look smart, but it's just a few good comments standing on a pile of shit. still better than youtube/facebook
we don't take kindly to people who don't take kindly to things.
i'm a texan muslim. you're right! i was pleasantly surprised to find that out for myself.
same here. maybe i'm more prejudiced than i like to think
he's actually in front of the mexican taco joint.
i believe/hope that you are wrong. for instance, you just described me politically, and i'm sure a lot of other redditors sitting on their toilets right now as well. i think that the two extremes of each side would have us believe that we're more different than we really are. i look at all of this "we are so divided" on tv and think to myself: "probably not, in reality."
also you drive for 2 days and you're still in texas. the fuck!
austin is nothing like the rest of texas. austin is amazing.
texas's cities are very tolerant yes. the trick with texas is there's a lot of people not living in the cities as well, and out there it gets not so tolerant at all.
pines trees. i'm in east texas. hate em. dang things shoot up to 100ft with practically 6 inches of root system, and then fall on your house at the next ice storm or heavy wind. stupid freaking pine trees.
i wouldn't be suprised if texas has more of these.
everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not his own reality. do not expect people to respect and coddle the fantasies of others.
cool guy online mocks people for liking things that make them feel good, is very edgy, very cool, very fringe.
and 3 word slogans "build a wall!" "lock her up!" etc. oh and rhymes, a good rhyme will get you off a murder charge in america, "if the glove don't fit you must aquit!"
maybe because other counties don't have us style loitering laws. in other countries you don't see other people walking round and round in a circle protesting. if you can't stay in one place and shout for hours you need a way of getting everything you want to say across quickly.
it was, "i'm against picketing, but i don't know how to show it".
people everywhere suck, but people are generally good too.
i do, it's overrun trumpeters atm though so i've avoided it...
my sister came down to dallas from oklahoma for thanksgiving and after a few hours driving around town shopping remarked how she didnt know there were so many muslims in texas. i informed her at the time she made this comment she was looking at a group of sikhs.
that's kind of what i was thinking. i've lived in texas my whole life and this kind of thing isn't uncommon. not necessarily with the mosque and the sign but texans going out of there way to make others feel accepted is pretty normal. sure there are a few ass hats but most people are genuinely nice
then why did they vote for the man who promised to round up all the mexicans and wants to start a registry of people from muslim countries? it's not a false narrative that the media is painting, it's his own twitter stream. you can pretend you voted for economic reasons or whatever, but you voted for a man with deeply racist policies who is actively trying to divide the country. edit- i'm referring to "you" as the average trump voter you're talking about, not you in particular. should have realized this would bring out such wonderful responses. rather than respond to everyone individually i'll just say- if you are calling *people* illegal, you may be on the wrong side of history.
nah, man, i think he looks more like colonel sanders, the burger king mascot.
know any horses? they'd all be wearing capes if they could. and goggles.
i'd rather see the altruists getting attention though. but you're totally right...need some synonyms in the dictionary to keep from completely diluting the word 'hero'
as a veteran and (very slightly) part-time texan, 100% concur.
i want to believe we really aren't so divided... but with t_d topping r/all every single day and the shit people write in there... it makes me think otherwise.
i totally agree. i'd like to be allowed to focus on the policies and problems, but instead i'm subjected to various attempts at making all segments of the population feel marginalized and threatened. both sides are guilty. both sides are guilty of persecuting anyone that doesn't agree with them fully. both sides are guilty of attempting to segregate, divide and polarize. and for the record, both sides are filled with whiny crybabies.
i drove from san diego to houston. i was excited when i reached el paso until i realized i wasn't even half way done.
i had the wrong impression of texas. i drove there from fl this year and i can honestly say that i would have never expected there to be a single progressive/liberal city. austin was amazing and is now a frontrunner to where i want to move next .... i thought denver or boulder would be, maybe atlanta or boston. i usually get tickets to festivals/events so that i can check a city out while also meeting locals. which cities should i check out next? i've got a year and a half left in fl and need to plan more trips!
if it's the big one in richardson, then i've been there and there a couple of blue collar types with heavy accents. it was so weird hearing them talk about allah without it being tied to a racist sentence.
most people may think like him, but most people don't have the courage or conviction to stand alone holding a sign standing up to those louder voices of hate.
they still wear cowboy hats, but it's done semi-ironically with skinny jeans.
just like anywhere. even in california when you get outside the cities you find rednecks. i'm from colorado and damn there are a lot of them there. it's the side of colorado that people never tell you about. outside of denver and the major cities it's a bunch of coal-rolling god-fearing country folk and trailer-trash types. where i grew up just south of denver icp and heroin were huge.. and strange reclusive mountain people.
almost every new group of immigrants coming to america since the late 1700's was treated poorly.
i bet he has the best katanas. ayyyyyaaaaaaaaaaaaa
ha! norm macdonald once made a comment about that. he saw one of the oj jurors interviewed on tv and when they asked her how she could let him off she just repeated the rhymes johnny cochran said.
we have road signs that say "bump ahead" for like a one inch bump... i think you can get mini sized ones to wear as a belt buckle too...
dude. they use protest signs in the rest of the world too.
lol, this is extreme hyperbole... if you think i-35 is one of the starkest racial divides in the country, you probably haven't even been out of texas...
the assholes get more attention and are louder. that's the problem. recently there was a hate crime against a mosque up in north austin which got national attention. 1 person's actions. however the hundreds who showed up the next day to help clean the mosque and show their support got no attention. this ends up enabling the bigots.
he wants to deport the illegal immigrants that are convicted felons how is that racist? and they have come out to say that a muslim registry is not at all what the plan is. that's all a farce.
people liked clinton _even less_. and trump is more likely an idiot, than a racist. i've known people who supported stop and frisk, not because they held anything remotely negative towards black people, but because they were too stupid to conceive of any other solution to a perceived problem. stupidity can make you support policies that are racist, but that does not imbue inherent racism in you for supporting such a policy.
yeah but if we act like only hero's can do it then us every day schmucks have an excuse to stand by and do nothing
when ~~everybody around him~~ a vocal minority who gets media attention is losing their heads.
bring money. you're late to the austin immigration trail. it's expensive to live close-in. but if weren't for the allergens i'd be all over that place already. never a dull day.
agreed, i think also most people don't realise how bad racism is. if you're not exposed to it you can't really know. i heard a story once that a sikh british guy was in europe and had queued up for a coffee, but when he tried to pay he couldn't pay, so the guy behind him in the queue paid for him, saying "what's the world coming to if a brit can't buy a fellow brit a coffee?" the guy said it meant a lot because he'd never actually been referred to as british before.
i grew up in a white area with no outside influence and after 9/11 i thought it must be a shitty religion. i didn't have a clue until i was 20 and actually visited countries where 90% of the population were muslim. people were so lovely. they went out of their way to be nice to me. it made me realise how skewed the media was. i went to university and learned a lot about a lot of different cultures and religions. i visited america recently and in my opinion, people in the arabic countries that i visited have a better quality of life than americans. there's just more of a strong community feeling and helping each other, whereas in america it's all about helping yourself.
**news flash:** big cities are different from rural areas. they tend to be more liberal, even when they're deep in the south (or out west, as you prefer)
because we used to need immigrants and now we don't; fancy that
shrimp fried rice.....shrimp fried rice..shrimp fried rice!!!!!
yet, no sign for the 3 foot deep pothole! agggrraarrlll!!!! that's the noise i make when i hit a freaking pothole!
not sure about germany but when skiing in austria so many things have an "achtung lebensgefahr!" (attention danger to life) sign. almost to the point that you start thinking you might not survive the first day.
can you just summarize your comment as a gif or mp3??
waiting tables made me want to blow my brains out. two years was enough.
hey man, in addition to reading signs... i also pick up on that subconscious, non-verbal, design-language you guys put down. when i walk into a kroger that i've never been to before, i pretty much know where i can find cereal, because you've trained that "layout flow" in me. likewise, i can drive into a completely new town, and just wayfind my way to a gas station or a fast-food joint. i mean, i'm not gonna drive into a neighborhood to look for a walmart, because i know what zoning is. i'm less than a year away from turning 30, and my younger friends think i'm some sort of wizard because i can intuit an urban plan, or a find a bathroom in a supermarket without pulling out my smartphone.
put a joke on top of a joke. i didn't tell it because i like little laughable words. i like jokes man. file it home in the filing cabinet under j for joke.
if i won the lottery i'd start an uplifting news site reporting on stuff like that.
this is not what he said during the campaign. he explicitly said during the campaign that he wanted to get rid of all of them. this means that he used the bigots in order to get their votes, and now he's softening that stance. so don't try to deny what he has actually said and done. **tl;dr: you can gaslight some people but not all of us are going to forget.**
maybe you're mistaking him for kayser soze of jurassic park
oh man! you just reminded me of when i was a child and used to read them comic books of tony soprano the vampire slayer, good times
3/4 of trump voters believed obama was a foreigner.
british guy ordering a *coffee*? i call bullshit.
yeah some people might have better qol in the gulf states compared to the us, but only if you don't include the southeast asians they keep in slavery.
most corrupt state in the union? yea i would trust those gangsters for anything
idk about you, but if they took the time to put up a sign i'd kinda prefer they just fix the pothole.
i used to work in a pharmacy in a mall, the grocery store across from us was being completly overhalled, it was all boarded up with a huge construction sign posted on it. had a guy walk in the mall doors, look at the boarded up grocery store right at the giant sign, then walk up to me in the pharmacy and ask if the grocery store was closed on mondays.
ditto. i'd have gone the fuck off. *"listen here asshole, even if i did work here, i wouldn't help you because you treat people like shit. so fuck off and buy whatever is so god damn important that you need to have your hand held during it's purchase. dipshit."*
conservatives have no problem tolerating religions like hinduism and judaism. but in the modern day, islam is the religion that's most affiliated with militaristic extremism, unfortunately. if there were much fewer attacks and terrorist organizations that cite islam as their inspiration, i'm sure it would be welcomed, even. many of the founding fathers actually admired islamic leaders
there has been a concerted effort to make sure conservatives hate and fear all muslims. it starts with a germ of truth and (like so much we see now) ends up in "my goodness, people believe that?" territory. selling hate and fear is a thriving industry. this american life did a very good show on this recently.
the same can be said for all sides. remember those riots in milwaukee that everyone blamed on blm? whelp, the milwaukee branch of the blm organized a massive clean-up and donation drive the next day to fix up the affected areas. the media only reported the riots and not the volunteer clean up crews.
god yes, a thousand times this. i know leftists (won't use the term liberal, because the meaning has been hijacked) who are the ugliest people you will ever meet, and right wingers who will give you the shirt off their back if you are truly in need. political ideology -=! compassion.
i would wager i could walk up to the next 50 people i see in new york city and say hello and none of them would tell me "fuck you". they might be terse in their response because they assume i want something from them, but that's not the same as outright hostility.
not only that, but he wants to get rid of birthright citizenship, and force americans with foreign parents out.
i mean tbh his beard is kind of similar to king leonidas of sparta's beard from die hard 2
tacos are nice, but i don't want them to be ubiquitous. we need a new wave of immigrants with different food. what's good in syria, and can they sell it from a truck?
3/4 of trump voters who believed obama was a foreigner got media attention. don't believe everything you see on tv kid
we drink things other than tea honest. it might only be alcohol with the occasional coffee for the morning after....oh and iron bru if your scottish but it's not all tea!
mine would have been very similar, though i might have thrown "stupid motherfucker" in there somewhere.
except withing the sphere of sign holders in front of mosques, it's a different story. this is an exceptional case within that sphere. i don't think of the average, texan, american, white man, or whatever as hating muslims, but if i see anyone with a sign outside of a mosque of course i am going to assume it is a negative statement because it almost always is.
you guys are saying the same thing. in terms of "people who hold signs outside mosques", someone holding a sign of acceptance rather than hate is the exception. in terms of "what people think about muslims", acceptance is probably the norm.
the fact is that a lot of people choose their ideological side or beliefs on what benefits them most. most men's rights activists only became so after they felt screwed over by the courts - suddenly they have a new ideology. plenty of feminists are the same way. i have actually read and heard women say that they thought feminism was all "silly nonsense for lesbians" until suddenly *they* felt the pressure of discrimination, and then they "saw the light". saw the self-benefit, more like. these people will continue to seek their own benefit even after their ideology of fairness and equality triumphs. just as always has and always will happen; it's why we can't have anarchy or communism or nice things in general.
yeah i visited ny last spring and i found everyone warm, welcoming and friendly and they loved to give our constantly lost selves directions.
he does sort of look like an old tyler durden from legend of zelda though

tundras are also really solid trucks for the money. just saying
you drink squash too, which americans have never heard of. i regret i never got to try irn bru.
just so we are clear here, i want to reiterate. people normally hold mean signs outside of mosques. that's why this guy holding a nice sign outside of a mosque is a pleasant surprise. the pleasant surprise is what got this post so many upvotes. are we all on the same page?
too be fair most people don't go and hold signs at things they approve of it's when they disapprove that people show up. not disagreeing with you. i think your mostly right
kinda reminds me of the sultan from disney's *tarzan*
i like how you threw the tiger remark in there. joe roganism?

wow, that's a frank dog. just started watching that show recently. pretty good so far, almost finished with season 1, will probably give season 2 a shot.
and then sniffed the ass where that shit came from.
me too, but in a brother-sister sense. "imma just gunna take a selfie here in this nice forest. just caught a mouse and gave the heart to my owner. she was disgusted...it was awesome! "alright...a little higher...fluff out the whiskers...blink a little for the cute eyes...aaaaand..." "heyea sis! whatcha doin'?!" click

what is people's issue with the dog filter on snapchat? it has no harm...
i'm jealous that you get to watch it from the beginning for the first time
i nominate wire-haired dachshunds for looking like john hurt
for a meme, thatd be best... but j4ckr4bb1tsl1ms was trying to make it look like an album cover, and it ended up looking pretty dope even though its silly, so it doesnt need to be made to look bad just for a little more readability it doesnt really need.
can you post a picture of the dog? with the instagram info cropped out obviously. also, i feel bad for laughing at that thought of a down syndrome looking dog.
1: buy retarded dog. 2: instagram. 3: ?? 4: profit!
well that burn was kind of lame. i don't think it counts.
i also thought it was a your mom joke, then i thought the ig handle was an oddly placed your mom joke, and then i learned the owner of the cat is a dude named yorem ahm. what a wild ride.
i don't know man, i thought their comeback album was pretty dope, maybe even a classic.
til. can't wait to boast off my newly learnt australian lingo to my colleagues.

it's hilarious, she has no teeth on one side, so she has to be fed with a syringe, and food gets everywhere. her face is a mess after dinner.

they are umbleputs. they have to grow into their flutters.
my shit is all fluffy her shit is all furry this shit is radioactive like marie motherfuckin' curie
it's actually fluters with one t, according to the flumbleputtomology, the second u is pronounced long, as in pooters, making the fluters they grow in to sound more like flute, that way their puters can really poot!

it's the pixels. source: i have seen a few shops in my time.
i'm glad someone else noticed the intern - that dude is swept away.
the right honourable prime minister steal yo' girl
the rolled up sleeves look is really flattering, too.
can confirm, it's weird hearing all of my family in ab spit hatred about trudeau and what a terrible job he's doing, especially after getting major pipelines approved for the province (something i don't think harper ever could have done). everyone i talk to in bc that doesn't like him is due to either actually approving those same pipelines or his flip-flop on changing the electoral system. most people i talk to love him though.
he goes for a handshake and you kiss his hand instead?
i feel like most guys may have had a woman give them that look before, but like most pics, they're looking in another direction.
her mother was quite a beauty. and really, trump wasn't a bad looking guy in his youth - it's just the years of smug that have built up. and the horrible fake orange tan and comb over.
the king in the north takes what he pleases. winter's not the only thing coming
this is so true, i used to have his teen beat posters on my wall lol. if he had hair again he'd probably still look very handsome. i mean harry does.
you should listen to the joint press conference that he gave with drump. he answered in english and french, and he sounds like a drang hunk.
any time i hear someone use the word "cuck" my immediate thought is "this dude has never had sex".
men can ovulate if they want, don't let that this matriarchal society make you think different.
i think you mean articulate. the vast majority of politicians are articulated.
"now look. you and me... uhh, we're never gonna be, you know, exclusive. but that doesn't mean we can't, uhh... "play doubles," if yaknowwhatimean..."
once you meme, you can never go back. wait...is that right?
that look totally says "i don't care how far down the list i am, i'll wait for you tru!"
mr. the right honourable prime minister steal yo' girl
canadian hate: "i wouldn't even mean it when i say 'sorry'"
i bitch about trudeau much less than i bitched about harper. that counts for something.
where can i read a summary of the electoral reform issues and proposals going on up there?
i hear a lot of anonymous internet people declaring that they hate him but nobody that i actually know regrets voting for him.
more like he goes for a handshake and you bat his hand away so you can vault up and leglock him around the waist. then see how long you can hold on and keep necking with him while laughing rcmp do their best to separate you two.
kates first thought: his kids would always have hair!
isn't trudeau a fairly competent* fighter? boxing or something?
you're extrapolating a little much based on a single photo imo. she was adjusting her hair and someone happened to take a picture right then.
for a good looking politician? probably feels like a tuesday. they call politics "hollywood for ugly people" so a good looking politician is godly by comparison.
i feel like you're just saying that to make us feel better. thanks.
yup, trudeau is good but he's got nothing on obama when it comes to the "young good looking suave leader of a country" schtick.
studies show any man that can immediately transition from english to french within a single conversation has a 97% chance of stealing your girl.
i always think "this dude is 14, lives in his mother's basement, and wouldn't know what to do with a girl even if he found one at the bottom of a bag of cheetos".
his beauty comes from his shiny teeth. just like how chip skylark's beauty comes from his shiny teeth.
supposedly he had a botched hair transplant back in the 90s that he's been working with ever since.
if the universe is infinite, the events of that fanfic are actually happening somewhere right now.
i read this in obama's voice....but the more i read things in obama's voice, the more he starts to turn into elvis presley...if yaknowwhatimean

til i need to send my resources to my neighbor to be more attractive.
can confirm, sex appeal went through the roof *after* i got married and had kids.
how to get someone to like you: step 1. be attractive step 2. don't irrationally hate on them
nah, in this case it's real hate. they're just toeing the party line for the conservatives they'd like to see back in power.
so far, that's what i've seen. i've asked family for specifics about things that he's screwed up and they flail trying to answer it rationally. after that they like to make fun of how he used to be a drama teacher and how much they love his hair (no joke).
i voted for him even though some of his policies hurt me financially. i like him as a prime minister, and think he's going to do a lot of good. if this topic were about wynn i would have a completely different frame of mind.
try to get a golf ball through it. any method you like.
now i imagine some exasperated rcmp officer going "*sigh* not again. ron, get the prybar! we got another one!"
i think the baldness gene actually comes from the mother's side most of the time. so her kids are probably still fine.
ok, but to be fair. the prince has served actively in several of the uk armed forces, including training in marines and special forces, is 6'3", and is 10 years younger. i think the prince is going to win this one.
she's 5'9", idris and william are each 6'3". so she's wearing 4" heels or so here, depending on the camera angle.
i'm a straight man and recently i've been noticing how insanely handsome other guys are, like trudeau and elba, like "wow, that guy is super attractive. like so attractive i wanna marry him and have two kids, a mid sized house with a white picket fence, and a golden retriever."
inferior to the effectiveness of the irish accent, which is basically a season pass to poon-town.
you know to be entirely fair to 14 year olds, i don't think most of us would know what to do with a girl we found at the bottom of a bag of cheetos.
anything is possible in the infinite layers of the tingleverse.
well, some of us do get pretty territorial aboot it.
i still don't know how trump got the whole #gaysfortrump thing just for holding a deformed, upside down gay flag.
shirtless vlad doesn't do it for you? *gag* but true, compared to world leaders he is.
do they want a donald trump? because that is how you get a donald trump.
"pffft, he was a part-time drama teacher before he became pm." "yeah, but in between those jobs he spent seven years as an mp, learning how the government runs." "..."
even though i support the liberal party, wynne can go fuck herself.
and then the torrent of "sorries" as they muscle the prybar between the prime minister and his admirer and wrench them apart.
is 10 years younger, but looks 30 years older. monarchy. not even once.
also, remember hair poof. that looks to give her almost an inch.
that's the beginning. eventually you'll be giving handjobs to strange men in airport bathrooms and running for congress on the republican ticket.
hm... i think certain british accents supersede the irish for me. but not by much.
ask her how she got so small would be my first thing.
what's the point? what's the point of fighting for his right to have babies when he can't have babies?
if you're a midget named calvin you could call it "low cal's local socal lo-cal calzone zone"
no if people start taking kevin o'leary seriously then we might have a trump.
i'm in ontario and my parents fucking hate him. they hate the refugee thing. that's where it started.
yeah, i don't know anyone that hates trudeau. but i know a lot of people that think wynne should go fuck herself.
"okay okay, i'll let go." "now, miss." "yes, yes. i'm doing it. i'm going, right now, see?" "you're still holding on." "i'm just about ready. juuuuust about there." "*sigh* get the prybar boys, we have another 'quebec' situation."

has anyone compiled a gallery of before and after pictures of presidents along with their defeated opponents from their first election? i.e. barack 2008/2016 and mitt romney 2008/2016. mitt romney doesn't seem to have aged much since 2008. but i think he's older, so he may have already gone through the aging phase that obama has. obama's looks may not change much in the next 10 years, but that may not be connected to no longer being president.
i love it when people try to do this to me. i just grip their hand firmly and look them dead in the eye until they let go.
conservatives tend to disrespect art, calling it useless or immoral, unless it promotes their own values.
exactly. i was mulling over voting mulcair but boy was i right to avoid voting ndp. those guys are a shit show. i lost all respect for mulcair after that elbowgate nonsense. the dude is just weak and can't keep his temper in check.
putin was kgb for decades. he has *literally* killed people. justin was a snowboarding instructor. i am putting my money on the guy who knows how to really use violence.
in a stunning betrayal, ivanka steps into the ring and hits putin with a metal chair. saying: "i did it all for justin".
that was the first thing i saw idris in, since then i believe i've seen his entire catalog but it's a trip to go back now and see him in the office. also more of a trip to see how walking dead pulled that move too and half the cast was the wire actors as well, especially the blatant omar whistling farmer in the dell scene they paid homage to
no way downey is 5'9". he wears gigantic shoes (even with tuxedos). he is 5'8" at best. willis is 5'10" at best but yeah, actors tend to be short musicians tend to be even shorter
mitt romney was 2012. he's had four years to age out of his candidacy, when we would all be familiar with mitt romney's look. mccain was 2008, but he was also in his 70s when he was running, so the aging process is going to look different because of the dramatic age gap alone. bush/gore would be a good one to look at, though
it's called the "trumpshake" and trudeau shut that shit down. of note, autocorrect corrected my misspelling of trumpshake and changed trudeau to strudels.
yet they also disrespect science, math and empirical evidence
same here, completely lost respect for that. totally miss mr layton.
it needs to come back "up next we have trump and bernie sanders in the octagon!"
given the trumps' affinity for pro wrassling, i wouldn't be surprised if she has learned chair-fu from mcmahon himself.
you guys have really weird standards about what is considered short. the average male height is around 5'8-5'9. why is it abnormal that actors fall within this range?
"as long as they ain't fighting, the hump's good, right brian?" "oh, the hump's good, yeah!"
fuck mtv. put that shit on comedy central in one of the south park timeslots
and then kim jung un could appear outside the ring wearing a cape and carrying a drink with an umbrella, taunting them both with the spot light on him.

didnt click the link but i know the quote from those pigeons from animaniacs
i think its from the train that runs through hackney downs into liverpool street
ok ok now say something funny! say "mah vagaaaahna".
i can assure you those were not the pidgeons from animaniacs in that picture..
oh! oh! member when we were allowed to watch every episode of south park? member the super best friends?
that's probably my favorite quote from the earlier seasons!
i'm with you, so 6 + 2, but what's greater than a squad but less than an army?
dennis' "pretty sure you did" was perfect. wording, delivery and tone...
i love when rp accounts follow through. best of luck with your greek prostitutes and phoenician destruction.
read this as george constanza. "i don't wanna walk through the puddle!" replied, jerry. "you got some of those nazi boots, didn't you?" said kramer.
dammit, himmler, i never said get rid of the jews, i said get rid of the shoes!
"i've tried a lot of boots, but these will be my final solution" great work guys
or they are being sold at cost because of the design mistake.
1/5 stars "shoelaces came tied in little knotsies"
i'm surprised there isn't a "user's also bought" section with red laces and mein kampf or a buy all three offer
glenn gives some of the best deliveries on the show. dude's such a phenomenal actor.
"it's still standing, so . . . no. also, carthage must be destroyed." -cato, probably
"they are not nazi boots! it's a tread! don't you know about tread?"
exactly. the soles don't look *that* much like swastikas, but the prints are unmistakable. and whoever made the soles would have understood that.
in an alternate universe, that's currently the unifying symbol for earth and humanity. maybe these boots belonged to an inter dimensional traveller?
or they were made for skinheads, who often wear workboots as part of their outfit.
there's a ton of facebook pages that link to cancerous slideshow websites that copy paste comments from reddit. check out these crazy stories from fast food workers! then every comment is broken up into fucking three pages. for this thread i'm sure they'll pull some of this shit did *next* nazi *next* that coming.
til the holocaust was all just one big hilarious 80s sitcom misunderstanding.
hahaha that's amazing. my other favorite "i bought these for camp. when i got there i found out they had piles of free shoes. oh well."
to blatant. you need a little more subtlety like the "i've tried a lot of boots, but these will be my final solution" one.
the comments are flowing now. pretty much swastikas galore. this company will have to pull them from amazon now. pretty sure their target audience just shrank considerably.
how did hitler tie his little shoesies? oh, with little tiny knotsies. and where did hitler keep his little armies? ...poland.
white laces, not red. red is for the original skinheads, the good kind. neonazi skinheads (aka boneheads) wear white.
his acting in mac and dennis move to the suburbs is fantastic. i live for dennis' meltdowns.
"oh i know about tread. don't tread on me, nazi boy!"
elaine's boyfriend keeps saying subtle anti-semitic things and everyone sees it but her.
and i thought the seinfeld reference was funny. i didn't realize til now there was a second joke in there.
also, it might be a bit of a stretch, but there's eight of them, and 88 is the numeric abbreviation for heil hitler.
or in this universe, it is a symbol of good and one guy used it for bad stuff and the other half of the world doesn't care about one turd.
this. that was on purpose, so skinheads can stomp swastikas into things.
oh damn it, now i'm the asshole who laughed at the holocaust joke.
kinda stinks for them though if this was a honest mistake
their work was done and they simply dissolved around your feet all at once. they'd given you all they had.
the whole colored laces thing is weird. there's different meanings for each color. like, blue can mean straight edge or cop killer... red laces are usually worn by white supremacists that have killed for their cause. but they're also worn by sharp's(skinheads against racial prejudice). like, i don't wanna wear blue laces because i'm straight edge, then get my ass kicked because someone thinks i killed a cop lol.
his meltdowns are always incredible. look at mee when you're talking to me! i like to bind! i like to be bound! you haven't thought of the smell, you bitch!
his cheeks and jawline in the implication bit are priceless when he goes form slightly laughing to stone faced serious.
elaine: "who cares? it's ancient history! now me on the other hand... "
during the scuffle, we see that jerry inadvertently steps on the wet concrete at the gravesite, forever imprinting the nazi symbol in the headstone.
if this is done on purpose than i really don't think thats a stretch. neo-nazis love that shit, and also 8 on each foot so 88.
the soles would have been produced in a factory using a mould which is the inverse of what's on the sole. so whoever made the tooling to make this boot would have had to cut out very clear swastikas.
your account name is a lie and you should be ashamed
it's the tilt that does it though. i'm thinking they put the nazi one on backward to achieve this effect. maybe not though.
and if it wasn't, i am sure they'd be happy to put in a purchase order.
why did hitler kill himself? he got his gas bill.
i loved them so much i'm goering to buy another pair!
it's why it's my favorite. all the others are way too obvious about it.
someone needs to modify the upvote gif and then post that as a customer image.
now this is a story that does not reflect positively on anybody, including you
agreed. if unintentional, can you imagine the "oh you gotta be kidding me..." moment someone is going to have. that would be a terrible revelation.
i'd be okay with that. they really did earn it. 8 years of work, building trails, hiking, winters, salt, rivers, mud. the most they got was a couple days off. they're relaxing on that big goodwill shelf in the sky.
i like it, i like it. maybe he sees jerry's boots and likes them and elaine just got him to start wearing suspenders and then he gets gum in his hair and has to shave his head so he steps out looking like a skinhead and it ends with a freeze frame of him with his hand raised trying to get their attention? just brainstorming, no bad ideas in brainstorming!
i bet that employee was on the way out of the company when they did this! maybe a going away present, if you will.. or maybe it's for their target market..
tl;dr: that can't possibly be unintentional it all comes full circle!
*as he was dragged into the truck he looked back at the red armband on his captor, in the middle of the band was a round brilliantly yellow smiley face. he was doomed.*
fun fact: a "razor" is basically a rule of thumb that lets you "shave away" unlikely possibilities. that's why they're called occam's razor and hanlon's razor. i just learned this recently and i think it's really interesting!
dark humour is like a kid with cancer. it never gets old.
it cracks me up every time. i was so caught off guard the first time watching that episode.
below someone found the company sells nazi merch. op doesnt know he's buying from nazis.
we don't have to do anything. to about a billion people in south asia it's already a symbol of good. and it's been that way there for centuries. that will persist in another few centuries, the little fart that was hitler in history will be a distant near forgotten memory
fun fact: a "razr" is the hottest cell phone of 2005.
payoff when kramer invites him to his accidental jewish gathering and he hits it off with everyone, revealing that he's jewish on his mothers side. of course after the party while elaine is apologizing, he reveals he's a young earth creationist and elaine kicks him out of the car. (or is it better if he's just clearly racist against another group.)
cool, i was super excited for the series just based on the previews/trailer. watched season 1 episode 1, felt like a 2 hour slow-burn thriller only to realize it was like 45 minutes... i haven't been able to make myself watch episode 2 :(
not just nazi but lebensborn, so like a nazi supermodel orgy
yeah, i had no idea there was a new season coming. this year is looking up already.
i was kinda in the same place. i only pushed myself to watch it last month. it does get better.
square-cube law! grip friction goes up as square of size, weight goes up as the cube. it's also why little kids can fall hard and not get nearly as hurt as an adult would.
i got to fly in and out detroit yesterday and today. i get motion sick, and we circled detroit before landing yesterday. it was fucking miserable. today i took dramamine and did much better landing in detroit. i'm half surprised that whole area of the us is still there today. so windy.
a pump at minimum, and many come with a spring / safety chain to prevent the above from happening when the pump is disconnected to open the door further.
how do you envision "door" and "dor" being pronounced differently?
when you're 3, and new shit is happening every day, you don't know that a strong dust devil isn't so out of the ordinary.
then people who have never had kids inevitably start with the "you need to watch your kids." you literally can't watch them every second. that'll make you go mad.
she handled this probably better than i could now. the gif cuts off a little early but it looks like she's done significantly moving and still has a solid grip on both the door and the phone. someone get this kid to a climbing gym.
her: "if you drop your phone i get your passcode" me:
for sure! i also want to know if she ricocheted back. as well as if she survived... since i am laughing at her.
as a scot if this were truly the case i'd need to make a correction: doormat: "welcome!" door: "u gonna naw touch ma knob m8, fuck right off ya cunt!"
true. tried doing the monkey bars the other day. made it halfway and gave up.
this is what i tell myself at the rock climbing gym when a 12 year old warms up on the stuff i'm currently struggling with.
that's where i'm from! but no, i decided i had enough tornados and moved out to cali last year lol
go ahead and make the subreddit and we'll observe from afar.
it's what he deserves for pushing the can instead of pulling, wind is just trying to educate.
one is pronounced "door" and the other is pronounced "dor".
the pictures weren't for jokes, it was to raise awareness about the opiod addiction in the area.
my sons are beating each other up right now. it's the least dangerous thing they do.
i just started climbing the rocks.... this girl would wreck me.
" c'mon then ya little speccy cunt square-go-like!"
halfway? you must work out. i can't even climb the rungs.
this is why i am so baffled by how everyone was like "ermagherd rock climbing legend" for that 12 year old asian girl who is like 16 or something now. i got shit on for saying children have jacked power to weight ratio's basically.
i think she as looking for *how to react* from her mother. she didn't know how to process it. this is why i laugh when kids that young run into walls or fall down. they take cues from those around them on how to react. freak out and they freak out. laugh and tell them "good fall!" or "awesome landing!" and they won't cry unless it really hurts. but you gotta be careful in how far you go with it or you end up with steve-o.
an important lesson if later in life he has to move a mop bucket full of water....
my god! how are you commenting? are you a wizard, too?
hell it was so bad dte's outage map webpage went down yesterday. not sure if it's up yet.
what the fuck? "i'm offended you pointed out obvious things about weight and gravity"
i had to watch it like 6 times to absorb just how incredible it fucking was.
i've been seeing it around for months now, they post low effort content to look like a normal user, if something catches on they'll edit the post to include jd spam. it used to be two-video youtube playlists, the first video would be semi-on-topic, then it would autoplay the same jd spam. just report it and move on.
just some guy on here. can confirm, seen kids before.
it's insane how much upper body strength kids have compared to their weight.
your comment deserves more visibility. i spent too much time as smokey the bear getting punched in the junk by snot nosed little shits.
yup! mascots are generally considered the power forwards in football, sort of how you use special teams for punting the football, you call on your "driving" team, wherein the mascot takes an extra position on the field.
well come on now, you said think big! future actress that does her own stunts and is wildly successful.
thankfully i'm at the height that i can just walk underneath it and slap the bars with my hands amd say that i did it
okay but there's a difference between a kid breezing through a v3 or something and doing a v15+...
if he didnt do the backflip thing i think he would have broke atleast one leg under the tire
i was seriously so confused with wtf his edit was talking about. the guy was on an ipad and was somehow bruce jenner? like wtf is going on?! makes more sense that it's a bot and he just says that on any car accident vid.
thank you for your sacrifice, sir. keep fighting the good fight! xd
and power too. damn kids are like spider monkeys.
i accidentally tripped the (then) knoxville smokies mascot as we both rounded 3rd base in one of the greatest memories of my 1990s childhood. so, my thanks and my apologies go out to you and your kind.
how.. how have i gone my whole life without saying this?
check out [famous bodybuilder] over here who can lift his hands over his head.
right, did this guy just downplay ashima? a global prodigy? bro...
depends how strong they are relative to their size, which is where kids excel. it's probably around the same
they are both extremely skilled, unquestionably. however, they both have huge advantages over other people in their fields. i assure you michael phelps' deformity is actually the only reason he was the best swimmer in the world. with the same amount of effort and not having his unique physiology he wouldn't have earned a quarter of the medals he has.
pssh one year. we don't get big ones very often. we really haven't had a noticeable quake in the last year.
this doesn't seem like an odd question to me as nearly every ice skating rink nearby where i live is made primarily of a solid polymer synthetic ice material with very little actual ice laying over top of it. seems like an honest question when you know a lot of ice skating rinks aren't made from just frozen water.
actually, the formula for energy due to gravitational potential energy is e = mgh.
sitting in a room right now with the biggest windows in my house. sad thing is that the blinds have never been opened in the past 7-8 years. i'm starting to think i should change that.
well, once i was casually browsing in a supermarket, when an apple rolled out of the bunch of apples on display. it was at my side, so only on the periphery of my senses / eyesight. however, somehow my reflexes kicked in, and my hand involuntarily shot out and caught that sucker before it hit the ground. i think of it as a movie scene, and the apple is a very unstable ball of explosive, and we're in a very delicate situation, and lara croft is my sidekick, and sees me catch that thing before it hits the ground and destroys all of us, but mainly me and lara. then her pussy gets really wet for me and a lot of the rest of the movie is me and her shagging like our plane is going down.
needs a freeze-frame as they hit the ground and add in some like, energy shockwave anime effects with that flashing/flaming diagonal anime background that they always have for intense moments in anime or some vidoegame cutscenes.
that "dude" totally failed the turing test. nice catch human teammate.
go play on some monkey bars for 15-20minutes a day 5 times a week. you will be hanging around like a monkey in no time.
if half the internet has seen it then it really isn't obscure...
yeah i haven't felt any at all since i've been here. i'm in socal tho so idk if that makes a difference lol.
yeah... except that most of these people watch it get resurfaced *with water* before asking that question. or they ask it after falling on it and getting wet. when little kids ask i don't mind, but when adults are asking if it's ice when they fall on it and get wet, or watch it get resurfaced...
yeah, me too. not 7-8 years, but i literally always have my blinds closed. i hate wearing clothes and am literally 100% of the time naked at my house. first thing i do when i get home from work is take 'em off. so the blinds stay closed. girlfriends coworker apparently saw me once.
was this before or after 1998 when the undertaker threw mankind off the top of a sixteen foot cage?
hey there fellow "bro". did you catch the recent team game?
man it's random shit like this that makes me realize, over and over, that i don't know a fucking thing.
do you think the littlest kid was hurt? the way the dad tumbled i mean sure much better than getting hit by a car but he looked knocked out.
good god almighty! was the announcers' table alright?
serious question.... after a 5 second review of your comment history, i see you comment a lot on xbox forums. how do you game without using your arms?
i'm paralyzed. i told maybe like 2 ex girlfriends and 5 normal friends when i got my shit to work finally. its like flying an airplane blindfolded only using a jerkoff stroke on the joystick. you don't realize how much your top head controls when your bottom head blows
i guess it would depend on how far below the waist they are paralyzed. if he can still have sex, i assume he can feel it.
much like her husband, about the only thing she uses is head & shoulders.
you are 2 for 2 on some bastard gold in this thread.
no, it will grow up hating the elderly for assuming a handicap pass comes with your social security card at 65 no matter how able you are
spinal cord injury paraplegic here. you'd be surprised what you are capable of when it happens to you. i always thought the same thing. 4.5 years later, i'm no less happy than your average american.
haha well i wasn't there to witness the act, but based on the writing on the wall i'd assume it was all natural ;)
my dad never played with me fully and i've never been to disney land. my dads also not paralyzed.
fun fact, the xbone controller has lots of onboard controllers and is great for reprogramming for accessibility, a friend of mine did his thesis on reprogramming the controllers for different types of disability. i'll ask him if his github repo is up and you can check out the calibrations.
my first time experiencing orgasm after my accident went like this.. my gf at the time was riding the shit out of me.. i was 18yrs old (2yrs after my accident). as she was going all cowgirl on me, i started to feel that feeling when youre reaching that point where you cant hold back. it was new to me, being paralyzed and while this shit felt good, i had no idea what was happening so i pushed her off of me. i shot a rope stronger than i ever had when walking -- got her right in the eye. i guess that 2yr backup was eager to get out. lol.. we both laughed, i hugged her like i'd never let go... then, right there naked on the bed, i proceed to call everyone in my family. aunts, uncles, parents, grandparents to tell them what i could do. it was 6am. lol edit for context: i'm a full c6 quad. no feeling recovered since my accident 31yrs ago.
they can get erections from thoughts, touch, but they don't feel orgasm exactly. only 10% ejaculate.
are you telling me that there are people out in the world that know exactly which vertebrate you need to break in order to paralyze a mans penis?
sex is 90% mental. paraplegics get almost to cumming, everything everyone else gets to. so what is the point? is 90% as good as cumming? yes. if you want to have hot, passionate sex with a paraplegic, you can. if you have issues with the disabled, maybe not, but thats really on you personally.
wow, please don't edit your damn post thanking people. it's perfect the way it is.
i legitimately thought you were talking about how they had intercourse with a flaccid penis before i realized you were talking about her hair
so what you're telling me is that you have crippling depression and existential dread?
my dad says, "it's like trying to shoot pool with a rope."
can you do me a favor and ask them? thank you, looking forward to hearing back from you.
father of 5 boys here... your dad thought that phone call was amazing. so did your grandpa.
wel i was sincerely disappointed. i was expecting a gif of the undertaker throwing mankind off hell in a cell, and he plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.
out of anything i would think you would be most likely feel the orgasm since it's more than just a super centralized experience.
this is true, but keep in mind that orgasm is a combination of nervous activity and also biochemistry. there are a slew of hormones released and chemical activity, which are mostly responsible for the "feeling" of orgasm. the ejaculation is also not solely sympathetic. it requires sympathetic stimulus, but it actually is a combination of both systems working together.
i needed to give gold to you for saying that thank you
my thoughts exactly. it seems early, but i have trouble fathoming a better response to anything.
"top half" jesus if half the comments you read are as good as this then please let me know which subreddits you browse cause this is like top 10 for me.
step 2: have nice hair step 3: don't not have nice hair
probably easier to realize for folks from the west; we don't see hair that nice all too often.
i think i'm part indian. i've got this big frock of thick, full, brown hair. every hairdresser i've ever had has mentioned it.
hahah, yep. (crippling depression... i see what you did there.)
small world... i went to the same school (i think i graduated a couple years before him), i'll give them a vote!
it's like trying to put a soft penis into a vagina
evidently the penis pump is option 1 for guys with spinal injuries.
yes please get all the details. diagrams if possible.
you'd think so but actually erections happen due to the action of an enzyme telling the entrance to the cavernosal bodies to loosen. don't quote me though.
a lot of times, the breaking of the bone causes nerve damage to the spinal column. every nerve in the body is connected to the spinal column. if the spinal cord is cut during the break, then the communication between nerves is shut off. sometimes it can heal and you can regain function. depending on how badly it's damaged, then you'll be more paralyzed than if it's a more mild injury. i recently learned about the different kinds of paralysis in my low-incidence disability class. basically, there's different degrees of paralysis. you can be quadriplegic like the other person in this thread and still have pretty good functioning in your arms or legs. you just don't have the functioning level of someone without paralysis. in quadriplegia, all four limbs are affected, but there's a second scale, the severity scale, that describes how badly the functioning is impaired.
thanks man. i just hate to see something that's probably about to become reddit history be all fucked up like that.
you have no idea the struggle with irony i'm dealing with over here. *must not edit post!!!!* seriously though if the person wanted you to thank them they wouldn't gild anonymously or they'd just tell you like /u/theanonymous227 did. it's all good though, if we can save this one post then my job here is done.
some people look up at the sky at night and feel connected to the universe because we're all under that same blanket of stars. i sit on a toilet and feel like i'm connected to a bunch of shitheads around the world because we're all on reddit with our asses a mere few inches from the sewer lines that connect us all.
then it all falls out when you have the baby. we had to snake the drains almost every week it was so bad.
hahaha - thank you so much. and here i thought my valentine's day would be devoid of any such compliments. i am a lucky dude indeed.
thank you so much. it has been one hell of a journey. lots of highs and lots of lows. five years, three surgeries, and several other procedures later, i'm happy to be walking on this here earth, sharing dong pictures on reddit.
jesus, that's like something an evil genie would grant.
"you'd think so but actually erections happen due to the action of an enzyme telling the entrance to the cavernosal bodies to loosen. don't quote me though." - u/golnarth
listen to this guy.. pretty good explanation summed up nicely fo a quick understanding.
it's really annoying when you stumble onto these threads like 4 years after the fact and everyone is upvoting and loling but there is no way you'll ever find out what was so funny and meta....
i upvoted that comment. just now. hours after it blew up. does that mean i'm now a part of this magical moment?
it just looks stupid when you start thanking for the gold.
i'm in bed and it is an absolute fucking disaster in here.
pfft, once. c'mon man, believe in yourself. you've always been a pretty princess.
yes, congratulations on the penis... i mean, recovery.
"i wish i can last super long in the sack" *becomes /u/mrnillows*
have spina bifida. have always been very sexually actively and have a significant amount of partners and tons of sex with them. never once have i had trouble getting a erection but i've never once felt it nor have had a orgasm. i've actually never even produced semen. and i've had more than a handful of partners make it their personal mission to get an orgasm out of me literally blowing me for hours. no dice. it's definitely not mental and is completely disability related. the shitty thing is, no one really cares about the sexual health of people with disabilities so no money is being put into studies and as a result you get different answers from every specialist or physician you talk to. have asked many of these people if i could indeed orgasm or ejaculate somehow and half say yes with no pointers and the rest say no.
*i'd like to thank my mom, the cat, god & my barista, tarquin*
hopefully your sheets are brown, or that shit's gonna stain.
it is however, outfitted extensively with brakes.
"thank christ i can last forever in the sack, who needs legs!"
a trick i learned over the past years: if the stain takes up the whole surface area of the object, then it isn't a stain anymore. so, shit away my friend.
it's our turn to defend the immigrants who defended us.
that was a dark day for me. i was on the verge of browsing fark. luckily, i stumbled on pornhub first. still, it was a little too close for comfort.
my iranian friend in college fled the oppressive government and his family has resettled in the us. he is one of the kindest people i've ever met, he has an american flag in it's flagpole sitting in his room, and he has nothing but love for our nation. you and him both make our nation stronger, i'm sorry we are all quickly becoming strangers in this country.
there are lots of positive comments in this thread. people telling their stories about how the united states came to be--a group of people who believe in the dream of freedom and some who came here from other countries to sacrifice for our freedoms by fighting and defending our way of life that allowed for them to be here in the first place. we are a united place--and that hasn't been defeated yet. keep your head up! "the people--united--will never be defeated". we need to be reminded of what makes this country positively great, and that's all the people from all over who have come to live and risk their lives for the freedom of america. if we aren't reminded, we simply become complacent. and that is the last thing we need right now. i hope you are having a good day, too. thanks for wishing it to me!
my father was a syrian immigrant. my cousin is currently in this country with asylum. his father was tortured to death. he's very smart. he has a full ride (and a near 4.0) at his college, in his third year of his chemical engineering major. he went on a co-op last year in germany. this year he won't be able to go again. he visited his family. his mother and younger sister have resigned to not seeing him for at least 4 more years. this sucks. thank you guys for taking a stand.
i have a very mixed opinion of miltary intervention. on one hand, you end up with people who go off to war and don't totally come back - who have experienced things man was not meant to deal with and whose families must deal with the fallout for the rest of their lives. on the other hand, us militarity intervention is what stopped the holocaust. military force is a necessity - but we must be careful in when and how we apply it. it is too easy to forget that the living are sometimes little better off than the dead.
yes it was, though it probably was to further the sultans own goals of showing that morocco was a strong independent nation. the us needed good relations with them because tangiers was an important port for american ships and in the end therefore the american war effort. they sought official recognition (and later a treaty) which was granted in 1777, well before the revolutionary war ended.
unfortunately it probably is deliberate. the us republican party needs a credible threat to the american people so they can convince there supporters to keep voting for them.
nationalism mixed with religion. that region is still so fucked and complicated because of the connection between nationalism, ethnicity, and religion.
it's amazing what people are capable of when there's no other choice.
agreed, growing up in america is great but we take it for granted. the immigrants i know absolutely love this country, and they are so proud to live here.
my home country is still feeling the post-khmer rouge consequences. some youths in the country don't even believe 2 million of their own died during the 70s :(
it's one of the more tame fleeing vietnam stories i've heard, unfortunately. a lot of them involve pirates, theft of everything, rape, sinking of boats, etc.
that's why the st louis project is about. over the weekend, they tweeted names and pictures (where possible) of attempted immigrants who were turned away at the border, but, i didn't understand the significance of the st louis part. thanks!
i had to do *work.* it was as terrible as it sounds.
these dark times call for more beautiful expression like your own. keep it up, we appreciate it.
russia has sucked for as long as sucking has existed - it's why there are so many great poets and writers from russia
lincoln was literally the first person to say, "if trump gets elected, i'm moving!"
i know you were being sarcastic but just in case people don't know, the know-nothings called themselves that.
and what if the people don't retain their virtue and vigilance? it's going to be an interesting four years.
or when those whack jobs fly the flag of a nation that lincoln defeated.
i hope this fire engulfs the nation and purges the hate and bigotry down to smoldering embers, where they may put off some heat but not enough to provide substance. i hope the words touched you, but that it reinforces the dire need that solidarity in our hearts means nothing without action with our minds, hands, and words. there are people out there who don't see us eye to eye, and we shouldn't belittle them or fight them, but learn to emphasize with their fears and attempt to educate them out of their own ignorance. cheers.
i agree with you completely. my grandfather served in wwii as well and received a purple heart.
at least two of my irish uncles fought in the vietnam war in exchange for citizenship in the usa. i still can't get my mind around that, since ireland wasn't nearly as bad as the countries i'm reading about here. all they wanted was opportunity. did they strike it rich? nope, they just worked blue-collar jobs pretty much their entire lives, with a modest retirement. maybe this is why i've always been sympathetic to the plight of immigrants, legal and otherwise. to me, an illegal immigrant is simply desperate, and i can't blame them for trying. regardless of whether it's a democrat or republican in office, big corporate is running the show. they want us to focus on those that can't defend themselves, rather than notice the real problem draining the economy, the 1%-ers.
something unique that differentiates the usa from most other countries in history before it is that it was not built on ethnic heritage, imperial borders, or religion. it was built on the social contract and civil society that sought to provide a framework through a constitution for a rational, free people. this has come under threat many times, but it will always be the defining thing that makes americans "americans", not race, religion, or ethnicity. edit; thanks for the gold but go buy a copy of on liberty by js mill instead of wasting your money on the internet
my father is a bit of a strange guy. way back in the day he was a huge hippy (met my mom in a commune) and was practically a member of the communist party at one point. he taught in inner-city baltimore, yet has no sympathy for teachers today. he takes a sort of park-and-ride route with a company-subsidized mass transit pass, but opposes funding transit projects. i wouldn't call him an irrational man, but sometimes he lets his feelings cloud his judgement.
they were promised safety! that was the exchange. trump is betraying a decade-old promise just to further his own fucked up agenda. it's madness.
trying to imagine the productivity of that day must give ceos boners
"uh, guys...what does a pregnancy test look like?" "it's like a thin piece of plastic with a thing on the end of it." "okay, so this is definitely a gun."
don't worry in a few hundred years captain kirk will come back through from the good timeline, meet up with a vulcan named spock, and turn our dark mirror-verse back to the timeline that it was meant to go on
we are looking to coordinate with bigger subs to establish regional and local level organization. join our cause! /r/bluemidterm2018
as the old saying goes, russian history can be summed up with one sentence: "and then, it got worse"
i thought they called the party "the american party". i think it was the democrats that started calling them the "know-nothings" because they kept their activities secret and when asked about them they would reply "i know nothing". (can't see that without hearing german accented english in my head).
i wonder if that's why big cities tend to be more liberal. you meet a lot of different kinds of people in a town of three million. more than in a town of three hundred, at least.
firstly, i wholeheartedly agree with your statement. but i disagree with your edit, while i'm sure many people could be enlightened by the book you mentioned, getting reddit gold isn't a waste. it provides a way to not only thank contributors on our wonderful forum, but also helps to enable our access to it in the first place. the cost of reddit gold offsets the costs of running the reddit servers, which in my opinion is just one more way of supporting the freedom of us all, by providing us with a free, open, and accessible forum to not only share news stories, pictures of cats, and things we think of while bathing, but also a place to discuss things in a rational and open manner, as well as giving us exposure to new thoughts, mindsets and perspectives.
i think many people just genuinely don't care about the plight of people they don't know. i'm not casting moral judgments, i'm saying this as neutrally as possible. i think a lot of people deep down just really don't care about something until it affects them, because why not? most will probably make an attempt to appear empathetic as a social courtesy, and some won't at all, but many just don't care. a couple days ago my roommate said "why should i care about a few muslims somewhere? it doesn't affect me." although this line of reasoning disturbs me because of how much it conflicts with what i believe, it is a reality for many people.
fox news, talk radio and facebook echo chamber. my dad has always been very traditional conservative. he was military intelligence and a cop. he hated russia, and trump when he first started running. now he loves russia, trump and does trust our intelligence community. i never thought i'd see the day. he's a good guy, and i love him to the ends of the earth, but propaganda is a hell of a drug.
all this will fucking do is make more extremist and terrorists. his executive order is just making everything worse, its literally throwing fuel on the fire. i dont get it.
no no, paul ryan is going to send a free and open internet to a nice farm upstate! he's also going to send your cousin with als there. ...maybe a few muslims. they'll all be happy and play games and maybe do a little work and be free!
it never really felt like donald glover was given the best jokes community had to offer. he would take a joke that regularly would get a smirk from me and just sell the hell out of it and make me lose it. his timing and delivery perfect.
doesn't that lead to earth being enslaved by the bajorans and cardassians?
i'm sure it was also a warmth issue as well, i grew up in a house that had a wood stove in on room, and a gas stove in another (aka no central heat), and my bedroom was on the second floor. it got really damn cold at night during the winter, i slept with a ton of quilts and blankets, and my bedroom was above the room with a wood stove, so it was relatively warm.
i more meant that the systems of government have always been oppressive to the point that - for most people - life in russia has sucked since time immemorial. i recommend you read some dostoyevsky to get an idea of pre-soviet life.
putin could have led his country into an open alliance with europe and established a lasting world order that doesn't rely on grinding people into the ground for stability. instead he decided to dismantle the part of the world that was making progress in that direction. it's a tragedy for the world.
basically the exact same thing as now identifying yourself as an "anti-intellectual". essentially "i'm an idiot and proud of it!"
they didn't call themselves that because they were anti-intellectual, it's because in their early days as a radical anti-immigration group, when questioned as to the motives of their party, they replied "i know nothing", and thus, the know-nothings. the name eventually stuck, which isn't very good branding to be honest.
yes, one often ignored side effect of the trump presidency and his bromance with vladimir putin is what it will mean for the balkans. we know that putin wants to undermine the eu and nato - and he wants serbia to be more aligned with russia - and to that end he is openly stirring and supporting serb nationalism, which could have untold consequences for kosovo, bosnia and the wider region. if putin feels trump will not intervene or will even give tacit approval for more aggressive moves by russia in the balkans, who knows where this will lead.
i live in a town of less than 300. its a 20 minute drive to a town of 900. everyone around here is a gross fat fucking racist blob of shit, a couple cheeseburgers away from reaching critical mass and colapsing in on themselves taking everyone with them.
man, you just put that guys edit in its place. well said.
i think you should stand up and cast moral judgment. i'm trying to stop being neutral. it's time. speak out for our brothers and sisters. we are americans, we are good people, we stick up for what is right!
when i first read your comment, i didn't understand. then i clicked the link. i made it all the way through, but i wasn't sure i was going to. had there been anymore i wouldn't have. my chest burned, and i held my breath trying to get to the end. that is a powerful use of twitter.
bannon is a christian dominionist who wants a holy war.
honestly, i think it's high time that g. w. pays trump a visit and gives him the fatherly-type talk that trump needs. he needs to tell him that some things are crucial, and that they're not really open for discussion unless trump wants a new or renewed war. then again, trump told the cia that they may get another crack at seizing iraqi oil, so maybe he is working toward starting a fresh war. who knows...
i got some bad news about your beloved childhood pet, too.
how about i come over there and pound you like a boy, that did not come out right...

and there's also the fact that he probably was sexually attracted to men in a time when it was even less permissible to be open about it.
there is actually interesting anthropological stuff on the rise of awareness of homosexuality and the decline in male-male intimacy. when everybody pretending that same-sex sexual contact wasn't happening (even though it definitely still was) men were comfortable being physically intimate with each other in non-sexual ways and even speaking of their friendships in almost romantic ways. when gay people started demanding to stop living in the shadows and having to hide who they were, the straight men got terrified of being lumped in with them, both because of prejudice and because the suspicion on being gay put someone's life in serious danger. all that intimacy became frightening, which leads us to where we are today. i feel like we're starting to come out of it, but only just.
indeed, russia has a time honored tradition of ruthless dictators/kings
"people say there are no comedians in russia, but they're there! they're dead...but they're there."
you know putin was elected as the previous pro-west leadership proved to be the most disastrous most russian people alive had experienced, right? sure, right now there's no democracy in russia, but russians don't mind, they find order and stability without democracy preferrable to a repeat of the 90s.
well, no. the name came from the group being secret. if a member was asked about it, they "knew nothing"
the 19th century was strange. heh, still today's context works with this.
you believe that because you live in a place that has diversity. almost everyone around you is already way on that bandwagon too. the issue is rural places where you have no exposure to that and all you get is an earful from some talking heads on a tv/radio program that you've been trained to believe. they are still producing and creating children who have no interest in those changes you, me, and our kids are hopeful for.
for everyone reading who is turned off by this vitriol, just imagine being forced to read the worst subreddits every day. that's what being in a small town of racists is like, except worse because you have to look and listen to then. you'd be venting a lot of steam too.
it is always terrifying to realize that all the greatest deeds of the past can be undone by failing to act in the present. the united states has entered a series of crossroads where our character will be tested, where we can absolutely fail, and all the citizens of america will be responsible for any mistakes we make.
and he wants to fight it in the most retarded, ham-fisted way, apparently.
there's a joke there .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. don't eat the crab dip!
to be honest, i think dan did a real good job with shirley. the fact she could have easily been the one-dimensional christan housewife character and then it turns out she was an ultra competitive, drunken bar fiend who had got her life back on track was pretty cool. yeah she got less one-liners than the others but her character and her character's secrets were probably the most surprising, imo.
meowmeowbeanz is so good it inspired a black mirror episode.
not saying you're wrong but do you have any reference on that? i've never heard this before.
there's a lot of research waiting to be done in porn. i'm not kidding. according to some porn site (pornhub, i believe), the most searched term in the southern us was "milf (mother i'd like/love to fuck." anecdotal, at best, perhaps-- but when you couple it with japan's--a place where pda (personal displays of affection, such as kissing or even holding hands) is taboo--while their porn is big on incest, you have to wonder, what do our social repressions have to do with our expressions? many philosophies and schools of thought will tell you about, "our shadow self, our sub-conscious, our underbelly," and they also say it holds greater influence when we don't face it. but who would fund porn research without backlash? specially if it would reveal a shameful side of our society?
for all those famous political icons who had secret bros on the side. hamilton and laurens, lincoln and speed, and trump and putin.
it has seeped a lot into the culture tbh. russians are weirdly appreciative of strong governments/leaders since the few "democratic" attempts where for the most part failures. even without the propaganda and editing of statistics, putin is pretty popular.
precise? god...that isn't what i remember. i recall getting through das kapital at like 10 pages/hour. shit was *dense*. and had some really weird uses of metaphors. it's been 15 years but i remember something about him comparing people to doors.
but it definitely offered a pretty nice double entendre for mocking them.

my friends wife uses the scooter at walmart because she is to fat to shop for an hour. besides morbid obeasity she has no current disability. she eats two packs of ramen noodles and mixes butter and two giant spoons of mayonnaise in it as a "snack " i'm not just being a dick. it makes me physically ill to look at.
democracy means all the citizens share responsibility for the mistakes made by the government. up until now, the mistakes didn't look so bad, regardless of what they may have been in practice. this is a good thing for america, potentially. a whole new generation will truly learn why it's important to fight for the right things.
this is a misconception from learning evolution i think. we tend to think of evolution as a continuous march forward, a constant progression. and that carries over into how we see the world. but the truth is evolution is simply change, moving in neither direction. and like evolution, the world is constantly changing, not always in a good or bad direction but simply changing and adapting.
my dad is in his deathbed. cancer. he was born in africa. america and it's medicine gave him an extra 12 years of life. he is an american citizen. he told me, he wants to be buried at home...here in america.
there is some research into pornography going on. not a ton, but some. the problem is that concepts like "the subconscious" are speculatively scientific at best. it is also a big leap to go from repressions to expressions in a scientific way. we can observe some correlations perhaps, but showing causality is nearly impossible.
you have better ideas than me, clearly. added as mod.
hopefully a better law is put into place, i suppose.
for centuries it took a very authoritarian government to simply keep russia together, given how large and disparate the country is. russian culture knows nothing besides despotism, and so the culture is strongly inclined towards authoritarian rule. democracy is as much cultural as it is political. some cultures simply aren't naturally compatible, and must change to accommodate it. russia's, as of yet, has not.
i don't mean in terms of linguistic style; obviously, he was using more or less ordinary language of the time (i.e. in comparison to other similar essays and books from that time). i mean precise in the rigor of his dissection of the mechanisms of capitalism and its relation to labor, etc.
i'm about 80% certain that trump won the republican nomination because of dipshit btards trolling on a national level.
and more importantly, two or three generations isn't enough to see any significant change across the entirety of the species.
maaaan, this is the kinda stuff that literally makes my eyes well with patriotic tears. and now our cheetoo-hued, short-fingered vulgarian of a president is trying to take away our greatest asset as a country and the thing that makes me actually somewhat proud to be an american. i'm sorry for your loss and hope you and your father truly enjoyed those extra years of life. sounds like we lost a true american.
i added "ad infinitum" because i knew in reality, it happens fairly often. it just usually stops at some point.

i think we can give op a pass on this one since he's *the* op.
she's a nice lady and you should be ashamed of yourself.

we lived in a condo (limited/no traffic to our door as we lived on the top floor) before buying our house and we were woefully unprepared for the tide of children that swept over our poor front lawn. i was handing out individually wrapped vitamin gumballs while my wife frantically tried to make it to the store to buy whatever candy they had left just so we wouldn't be the house that got 'decorated' later. knock wood, 10 years later and we are still tp/egg free.
most people just call that going to a bar. certain bars are more 'trick' than 'treat' but the alcohol is consistent.
just turn on your porch light and fill a bucket full of your candy. leave the bucket out on your front porch.
give me your address. i'll send you a single, fun-sized. *snickers*
i said "i ain't giving you no tree-fitty you goddamn loch ness monster! get your own goddamn money!"
is this from discworld? i've never read them but this is hilarious and i may need to
reading that i decided to imagine dr cox from scrubs as death. it could work i guess.
i like to leave out an empty over turned plastic bowl on my stoop with a "please take one note" on the door. the trick-or-treaters assume that some candy snatching ruffians took the entire bowl. i go through the night with no doorbell to upset the pooch and never have to worry about buying candy or having a boatload left over. i'm a terrible person, but i've made peace with it.
yea right like anyone talks to their neigbors anymore.
but the first kid takes it all. might as well leave an empty bowl out.
i was sitting here thinking "what are you talking about thats exactly what they said"
the books with death in them are by far the best of the series too.
it looks almost like the font death speaks with in *discworld*, but the 'f' seems off.
should i up vote for honesty or down vote for being a stingy bastard? decisions decisions...
hey i got my friend one of those thunder jackets. really helped with his anxiety.
i do this every year and have never had that problem.
perhaps focus on the fact that they're kids and all they care about is the candy.. the absolute most you would have to do is drop it in their bag and say "happy halloween." what about the process evokes the anxiety in you, do you think?
seriously. i read and reread it like 4 times before getting it.
expressing gratitude on the internet? holy cow almost seems too little.
just change the name of the candy every time and see who bites?
*snack size* is a more appropriate name i suppose
ok so from a quick google there are a lot of them and no numbering? which do i start on?
i have seen what happens in my neighborhood to houses that turn the lights off ever. it should be noted that i do not live in a great neighborhood.
depends, have you considered using this tactic for your trick-or-treaters???
the halloween before, i had a ton of kids come by. i ran out of candy. the teenagers that came by at 11pm got leftover peanuts & pretzels from southwest airlines. i had to hit their bags fast so they couldn't identify the non-candy. it was that night that i concocted my life-changing epiphany to completely phone in every subsequent halloween. even so, to this day, i save all my southwest airlines handouts.
can confirm. am the first kid who takes whole bowl. have never had a problem.
seriously, buy like 30 of them, and ignore reality for a couple of years. it's a lot better.
depends - the first 2-3 books in publication order are a bit rough - more "generic fantasy satire" than true discworld. i usually recommend "mort", the first book with death as a major character. you can always go back and read "the colour of magic","the light fantastic" and "equal rites" later.
lmao! hey you dont double burn a self burn its just rude! lol good one tho
glad to hear it well. just curious why you posted it in the middle of a random thread? wishing you two continued happiness.
i own them all, already. but more couldn't hurt. plus my copy of jingo is signed, i should probably put it away and buy another one.

either that or my finger would be covering the lense
some people don't care about ip and just want to share things they made.
are you doing it as a career, or just for funzies? i'm like 3 classes away from getting my associates of visual arts, and am starting to think it's about as useful as a poopie flavored lollipop...
poor op is not going to be able to handle the pressure... he's going to sit at the same spot for the rest of his life trying to re-capture the image to deliver for reddit....
iphones have burst mode which makes lightning shots very simple too.
yeh, there's no way it came out of the iphone looking like that.
it's actually not. complete freak accident that i captured lightning. it hadn't lightninged all night, and this was the first one, was honestly just trying to grab a picture of the cloud
all with an iphone. op should contact apple. they might use his picture for viral marketing for the iphone.
he accurately predicted the lightning strike and was able to time his lens shutter just right. that same lightning bolt took 10 attempts.
is it f1.8? my nifty fifty is (if so, suggest change of user name to "buttplug_bokeh").
and he only has one and he doesn't even want to share.
degrees in art are only as good as your work. the actual degree means nothing. the only thing that matters is your portfolio.
yes, it looks familiar. i saw that same cloud in dc the other day. it pissed all over my donuts.
i'm dubious. you need a slow shutter speed to get that kind of shot, and while the new iphone might be able to do that, there would probably be some shakiness to make the photo unfocused, unless he had the phone on a tripod.
i mean, seeing as based on your account you hadn't posted anything since this in like 9 months, i'm inclined to believe that you aren't just a karma whore and genuinley took this super fuckin awesome picture
even if we can't find him in the cloud, all that really matters is that we always find him in our hearts.
so they rip off a cropped version? i usually only post 300-800 pixels wide of my best stuff. looks good on screen, makes a shitty print.
no, the only thing that matters is the networking. who you know is more important than a portfolio any day.
ayyye! i was an apprentice commercial plumbing for about 3 years, and *loved* it. very hard work, but the pay is nice, and i always felt fulfilled at the end of the day. the company went under, unfortunately, so i had to seek out other endeavors.
pro 'tog here. it's possible to do with a cell phone, i've done it in the past. however, the light trail on the truck doesn't suggest a cellphone's rolling shutter, to me. that says long exposure. i'll admit that i haven't played with the iphone camera, as he suggests it was shot with, but given the crispness of the lightning, and the straight lines of the truck's motion blur, i have doubts that this was shot handheld, or even a cell phone.
just some redditers trying to keep things grounded...
i saw that clip last month. it nearly made me sick and i'm not all that squeamish. terrible
what are you talking about, it follows the rule of thirds pretty well...
eh, i find unless you use it for a job purpose, buying a camera is a giant waste of money. are the photos nicer than say the latest smart phone? yeah, of course. is it worth to spend at least 3x as much on a device that solely has a camera function (especially when you will get a smart phone anyway) to get a marginal increase of like 10% better quality? not for the average person.
but having a good portfolio will only help sell yourself better. source: professional artist
yeah this photo kinda looks like a bad long exposure to me. from op's comments though i kinda believe him i guess. op either knows what he's doing, or he got extremely lucky though. that combination of teal and orange is a classic combo of colors that adds to the dramaticism of the lightning.
yep. moto x pure killed a memory card within a week.
niiiiiiiiiiicccceeeeeee shhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwt
they probably sue you for not sending the picture to them earlier and for taking the pic in the first place.
made literally within less then a minute of each other, and i've never seen that been an issue before, but sure man.
that doesn't mean that the majority narrative is positive about apple. the rest is a matter of opinion i guess.
getting downvoted on here is often a very good indicator that you are a normal human who actually functions in society. i personally get some major reassurance when certain things i say get a shitload of downvotes, it validates that a ton of people here all blindly agree on certain things simply because they feel like they're supposed to. basically, you have a ton of nerds all desperately trying to prove to one another (and themselves) that they are true redditors, whatever the fuck that even implies. the more you look into it, the more you cringe.
me and you man. can't wait for that. crispy clear hand held night shots anyone? yes please
except when talking about the *quality* of a picture and comparing it to professional cameras. then it matters quite a bit.
but that guy said the only thing that mattered was networking? i just got a 5mhz router for my photography business
network, at the very least, will get you free weed and food (if you're a shit artist that may only last a little while).
that's why i say hey man nice reference to a song about r. budd dwyer
as much as i would like nothing more than for that man to retire to the outback and never be heard from again, i always derive great pleasure from seeing his stupid mouth parodied well. kudos.
i can't wait to save up for a dslr with a full frame sensor. only problem after that is the lenses.
also depends where you view the pictures. canon pics and iphone pics will mostly look exactly the same on instagram and facebook.
even a non-slr canon or similar quality camera will take better pictures than a phone
with the beastgrip you can use dslr lenses on phones. the results are pretty incredible.
5mhz ain't gonna push much. maybe you should try 5ghz.
wow, you guys are unlucky. my vive has been rock solid 99% of the time.
your boss expects you to actually to actually work on friday? when i had a desk job the only thing we were expected to do on friday was eat the donuts in the conference room.
straight to r/watchpeopledie, bud. you'll love it
what's crazy is dwyer was posthumously completely vindicated and the people who railroaded him never faced any reprisal at all, although the shitbag william t smith who lied in testamony is rotting in prison on other charges. was truly fucked up what happened to dwyer.
i think it's a lot less than a penny to them, relatively speaking.
do you have a dslr at the moment? if not i'd first get a cheaper model of the brand of your liking (so you can use the lenses later on with your full frame, if you decide that you like photographing enough) i have a canon 1000d which my parents gave to me years ago, and i still use it to this day. i've been thinking about upgrading to a 750d or 70d, but so far feel like i don't do it enough
i disagree. as a result of high-quality lenses, large sensors and higher resolutions along with superior image processing, you'll get *far* less noise, better dynamic ranges, fewer chromatic aberrations, fewer lens flares, etc. even if the images get uploaded to social media, the quality difference is tangible. the differences are less noticeable in daylight photographs, but they're still there.
i only do low rez russian dash cam shots so it's enough

american house hold income =~50,000 apple profit this year = ~50,000,000,000 50,000,000,000*(.01/50,000) = ~10,000 is a lint penny

it's hard nowadays, the good ones are all quarantined or even banned
you're about to learn a whole fuck load of things you never knew about civics and society.
that's pretty much what he tweeted a few hours ago
i'm pretty sure that trump could murder someone on camera, then the next day claim that it didn't happen or people are remembering it wrong, then his supporters would call it a hoax.
this isn't a red flag when everything this man does is a red flag. trumps campaign slogan "make america great again" should be on a giant red flag and parroted around like a giant fu to everyone who knew better. and what's worse, he's turning old glory into no glory.
it's not a story the democrats would tell you. it's a republican legend. darth trump was a dark lord of the alt-right, so bigly and so tremendous that he could influence his supporters to lie about pretty much everything. he had such a knowledge of alternative facts that he could even keep the more qualified candidates he was running against... from winning. the alt-right is a pathway to many abilities, some considered to be full-on fascist. he became so powerful that the only thing he was afraid of was having a small inauguration crowd, which eventually of course, he did. unfortunately, he taught steve bannon everything he knew, then steve bannon took over the government in his sleep. it's ironic; he could save others from fake news, but not himself. sad!
what did she do to stand up to trump? not sarcastic.
i think trump fired her, or whatever presidents do to people in those positions.
except when god-emperor trump leads humanity to a golden age under the pax americana. /s
thank david brock and his $40 million donation to "share blue." the information war continues.
first... they came for /r/politics, but i said nothing, for i was not a subscriber...
everything is r/liberal except r/the_donald. this is how reddit dies. when the admins are so focused on their political view they suppress anything that opposes it. you would think 99% of americans hate trump if this us all you see but recent polls show nearly 60% agree with that immigration ban. the reddit trump outrage is fabricated.
i'm getting a funny feeling that this isn't organic. it's just a hunch but i think we're seeing a resurgence of the paid trolls we saw so much of before the election. only now they're more organized and they have a bigger budget.
this is almost as bad as using a blog post to make a political statement.
careful. rational, level-headed comments such as these will get you downvoted to oblivion. tread carefully!
the office of legal counsel (olc) reviewed the order and deemed it lawful, which she admitted in her statement
this is fucking it, i'm done, i hoped this sub would improve a little after the election, it's just gotten worse
shhhhhh no logic here it triggers the little delicate ones
seriously, every major subreddit is awash with this garbage now. i used to hate it but the /r/videos "no politics" rule is looking pretty attractive to me right about now.
asking the guy who edited pro trump posts to end anti trump spam. funny. have you not seen the alien on the main page or the sticky blog? they are 200% anti trump.
religions don't issue marriage licenses in the us.
by denying the us government its day in court? how can you preserve, protect, and defend when one of the litigants doesn't even show up?
she did her job and was fired for it. her job is to stand up to this bullshit.
that's not how public service works. first and foremost, you serve the people.
i'm not a staunch 2nd amendment supporter or anything. but trump is making me rethink this position.
that's good to hear. i was hoping i had just misunderstood the implications.
well then, give op an upvote for his/her demonstrated psychic ability.
yeah? she prosecuted eric rudolph. he was convicted.
stop with the nwo crap, trump is part of wwe, not wcw
trump just fired her for "betraying the department of justice".
a bit different. she was expressly *refusing* to comply with the law of he land based on religious beliefs, which is different from the us ag having a professional opinion on the merits of a case involving the constitutionality of an executive order. she's obligated by professional ethics and her oath of office not to argue a case she feels is without merit.
holy shit he warned us that that would happen too.
any other president would have done the due diligence to make sure their executive order was either legal or at least been justified by the ag (see alberto gonzalez memos to justify legality of torture)
but it was also because she believed that it was a violation of legal precedent and was in agreement with all of the circuit judges that issued stays on the executive order.
being legal and being just are two separate issues.
i agree that "crimes against peace and crimes against humanity" may be a little overboard, but the "immigrants" aren't just anybody, it's actually u.s. legal permanent residents.
a post said she defied trump for not defending his stance on the muslim ban. i think that's the basic jist of it, someone will probably specify later.
had security grab her by the pussy and escort her off the premises? i'm guessing that's how it works under this administration.
then they came for /r/pics, and i said "fuck it, i was thinking about unsubscribing anyway."
then i guess i better start coming up with witty protest signs to offset the karma slaughter.
i was looking at pictures of it while on the toilet, kids. i'll never forget it.
appointees don't serve the public. you obviously know nothing about real politics.
need lotto numbers, will share with first 3 replies.
we bitched about it 24/7 when they did it, are we really ok with our hypocrisy?
mcmahon owns the rights to the wcw therefore it's all one in the same.
do you have a link to a well written article about it?
although your statement implies that you believe that trump ordered her to violate the constitution. it seems like there should be some consequences for that. sigh.
which is sound legal advice and exactly what her job requires her to do.
this is exactly why those in the government should take a stand when they are given an order they feel like they can't follow rather than resign or quietly comply. it will bring more attention and scrutiny to the issue, not compromise any morals, and at least for a short time delay tyranny.
there is no check on the executive branch *within the executive branch.* the eo is shit, but this is basic stuff.
theft is illegal. not to mention that theft tends to be a state rather than federal crime. which is why presidential pardons don't work for state convictions.
haha this made me laugh audibly. lmao. im so tired right now
if you think eric holder was impartial, you have a unique definition of the term.
fired yes, hired no. they must be confirmed by the senate to become the ag (not just acting)
pretty sure an anti-nepotism law was passed specifically to address that problem immediately afterwards.
you can bitch out the guy hitting you. if he doesn't stop, i don't think it makes you a hypocrite to punch back.
that kind of thinking isn't allowed in trumps america! you're fired!
i see what you are saying. but as the admin's lawyer, she enacted the policy in the way that it was most legally sound. its sort of a soft check. she acted as a filter for the things that would not stand scrutiny. it was in the best interest of the admin, which is one of her primary objectives. its not often that an ag would dismiss an eo so thoroughly, but its also not often that a president would issue an eo thats been so poorly vetted by relevant departments within the executive branch. in a different scenario, this would have been brought before the justice department before being signed and they would have suggested it would not stand to scrutiny and then perhaps the eo would be modified. ag has a lot of pressure not only to be responsible to the president but also to the constitution and the law. i am sure she knew how trump would handle this, but she ultimately didn't break her oath, which is to the constitution.
yes, but they swear an oath to uphold the constitution and not the president. administratively, trump had every right to fire her, but her ethical duties compelled her to serve her client and not its current executive officer (in much the way that lawyers in the private sector run into an ethical buzz saw if they forget their duties lie to corporations they retain them and not to a corporation's current management team).
you do realize that checks and balances can occur within a branch of government and aren't entirely reserved for across branches?
on my to do list for tomorrow. i make phone calls a lot, these next few will make me happy.
yeah to live many years with such a stigma that his heart gave out early.
with today's attention span, i wouldn't be surprised if it were a less sustained frenzy. may be heavier up front, be we as a society can't focus on shit for more than a 24 hour cycle. i'm from atlanta and was actually hanging around the bronze sculpture where the bomber dropped the backpack. a group of friends and i were watching a concert in the park and at some point decided to leave that spot and go to the waffle house for some gut cleansing. 30 minutes later in the cab ride, radio announced combing occurred. a few days later, the ajc fingered r. jewel as the perp. it was a low spot for the paper.
your answer contains the answer then. if his order, which included permanent residents, was deemed too broad, then she has the duty refuse the entire order. unless you want the attorney generals to have the power to follow or refuse parts of these orders selectively, which i don't think any president would want.
then it's not a checks and balances argument. i also think the eo is shit, but the guy i replied to is straight up wrong.
i contradicted the statement that "the attorney general is ... one of the checks and balances between the three branches of government"
when one person has supreme authority over that branch? no. any check or balance that can be swept aside is not one to begin with.

the parts in question were already challenged in emergency injunctions and have been generally sorted (hence the people allowed to leave the airports). as for the rest, of course an ag is expected to defend 'what they can' of an executive order. this ag, in her statement, made it clear that her decision was ideologically driven by a 'higher calling of justice'. again, whether you agree or disagree, an ag has no higher calling than the constitution, and if it doesn't explicitly oppose what her executive is doing (and here the general order doesn't quite appear to) then she has one job to do...
whoops my bad. i misread the person's post before yours. though the ag does advise the president on what will likely be checked in the judicial branch, so it is kind of a pre-check, if you will.
president pence and paulie are feeding the man "the greatest" executive orders.
1:40 for me. "there must be a lot of nevers because this is pretty subtle." i'm not a smart man.
my attitude is i already gave it another view, so might as well ride this sucker out until the end.
it is the closest thing to a classic meme i think. most others go in and out of fashion, but a good rick roll? it's a classic.
i even convinced myself for the first few nevers that it had sped up a little bit.
same. if it makes you feel any better about yourself, i actually thought i could hear it speed up a *little* at one point.
i have it 2 never's just to make sure i wasnt tone deaf
not necessarily, if someone were to download the video in order to edit it to make it speed up, the watermark would still be there
i was in denial until finishing the video and coming to the comments.
i didn't notice the vevo mark, but going into i was thinking, this video must be like 45 seconds long. when the scrubber loaded and it came up as over 3 minutes long i just had to shake my head in defeat.
i looked at the view count. i was like: "damn, this has a lot of views for a sped up video." then it hit me.
there was a really good one a year or two ago. somebody posted that youtubes copyright system took down the original video, that it was a sad day for the internet, etc, and linked the presumably dead youtube page. it wasn't dead
my workplace constantly plays it out the speakers. i just love the song too much at this point and none of my coworkers know why i giggle whenever it starts up. got the dance down and everything. truly a masterpiece.
it's because rick rolling becomes funnier as time goes on.
most people enjoy it! it's just harder these days to do it in an original way like this!
same. out of respect for rick really. it's not his fault the song became a meme. i want him to know the joke involves him, it's not on him. besides, hes got a great voice.
i came here to say that after the first chorus it could have been nightcore
rickrolling is only funny if the only person doesn't expect it. by clearly linking to a video that looks like a rickroll, the video now can't be a rickroll because that wouldn't be funny. also you can just skip to 2/3rds of the video to check.
unfortunately the scaling constant is too high, so it jumps too much at the first speed jump, and just gets higher from there. near the end it is like one of those yt trash videos.
first and only time for me. i've been so goddamn careful. this is some evil-genius, inception-matrix level rick-rolling. or, i'm an idiot.
it's become like an auditory stockholm syndrome for me. i never used to like it, now i'm grinning pretty big when it comes on.
2016 was fine. there wasn't even a world war. yet.
see i just opened it and put it on my other monitor screen and was listening i wasnt even watching the video and then it hit me after about 2 minutes it wasnt getting faster.
this is what everyone on the internet needs to do. teach their parents about it so that it stops becoming cool for younger people to do it sort of like we did with facebook.
that one didn't make me watch the entire first verse though...
fool me one time shame on you. fool me twice can't put the blame on you. fool me three times, fuck the peace sign, load the chopper & let it rain on you.
shh.. they'll find out about people like us! *hides, listens to song again*
mainly because it is a legitimately good song but we're all so tired of hearing it. you can't be too mad because it's not offensive or annoying, you just sort of shake you head, smile, and laugh.
i really like that whole album to be honest. together forever is great. it's just good, fairly wholesome pop
what *is* nightcore? i just looked some up on youtube and it's all anime.
but because of this logic you won't be expecting a rick roll when it's obvious therefore when it does end up being one your surprised in the end anyway
both? the two aren't necessarily mutually exclusive.
2016 was more shit than 2015. maybe 17 will be alright? (please let me be right)
i clicked anyways, thinking that it was a new feature: "oh it picks up the media within the reddit post." bugger.
i refuse to let this meme die. i want to rick roll and get rick rolled well into my senior years
no you're thinking of darude, and that one song he did.
that explains why nobody can sing the chorus properly.
it's a name people give zero effort edits so they can pretend that they're artists.
naw l just walked right into it. l'm going to dress like a raccoon and go to the vet and have myself put to sleep.
i was proud of myself for *not* getting rickrolled for the first time *ever*...as right before i went to click the op, i thought twice and came to the comments first. then promptly clicked on that stupid manning mug. no link can be trusted!!!
like, every time i see it, and i saw it in its infancy, i wonder "that voice does not belong to that face and body". i'll always watch the whole thing through, because it's an amazing song and dance.
at about 0:50 it started sounding like one of those catchy kpop songs
historically it was a norwegian duo who "remixed" some songs and released them, but the internet made other nightcorelike songs. and just titled them as if it was the nightcore group who made it. so it just sort of became a thing to do when making nightcore
haha. i think as much of a joke as rick rolling is, the reason it works is that people really like the song, whether or not they would admit it.
that wall climb round over from the background dancer looks way more natural at ludicrous speed. they should play this at the amas and open up a worm hole back to a time when the winning acts had talent.
that's peyton manning? why the hell do people keep posting it? i keep seeing this pic but know nothing about it...
"they're asking for a call sign...what should i tell them? the narwhal. the narwhal bacons at midnight."
it's supposed to be a form of rick rolling. but less enjoyable and a fuck ton annoying.
"crocodiles are easy. they try to kill and eat you. people are harder. sometimes they pretend to be your friend first." -steve irwin
every time a video shows up on reddit (with either kid) there are always snide comments mentioning how fake they seem, and how they're under pressure to be happy, etc. almost like, *i don't believe someone can be that happy after their father was taken from them unjustifiably.* well, let's not forget that they were extremely young when their father passed. but what's really sad to me, is that so many people can't even believe that you can be as happy as the happy-blood that runs in their family. it's rare, sure. but i find it to be genuine, and intoxicating. i also go to the dog park, and don't own a dog, so there is that.
i feel like once the world lost steve everything started to go down hill. of couse statistically crime and overall human suffering has also gone down in general. but the worlds a little less fun without the crocodile hunter out there.
i don't really follow main stream celebrity going-ons, but when steve died i was absolutely *devestated*. such a passionate animal lover.
my parents intentionally hid it from me because they knew i'd be devastated. i wrote him letters every week and he sent me a signed shirt for my birthday that i have cherished ever since.
i wonder if steve irwin used "cunt"as often as the average aussie seems to in his off camera life...
even though it's a shame to have missed that opportunity, it sounds like you made the right decision.
i grew up down the road from australia zoo and had the pleasure of meeting both steve and terry a couple of times steve was exactly as the same as his television persona just a lovely bloke used to buy flowers from my mother every now and then. terry was generally lovely however she did have a go at me one day due to my supermarket selling kangaroo meat. its good to see the family and the zoo are still dedicated to fighting for conservation after his passing.
the two for me were steve irwin and robin williams. grew up watching those two constantly in tv shows and movies as a kid.
one you see later and the other you see after awhile
a steve irwin, paul hogan ticket would get my vote. they, along with mad max and outback steakhouse are all i know about australia though.
yeah, it reminds me how i have achieved nothing in 11 years.
i was thinking the exact same thing! i think it's because kurt died so young that i never thought of his actual age.
unfortunately, the discovery channel has gotten pretty shitty.
he was a major world presense with animal conservation of all types. he traveled around the world showing amazing animals. he had several shows. his specialty was reptiles. his goal was to make it known that all animals are important and not really scary. he was very hands on but made it clear that an animal wont harm you if you give them the space they need. he is an inspiration and hero to millions. many that are in my age group (27 here) really looked up to him and still grieve to a certain extent. thats how much that man touched lives.
i almost got choked up watching his son. really made my heart smile seeing him!
"i'm gonna jam my finger up its butthole." -steve irwin -trey parker
did you see his son on fallon? his legacy lives on through his children, which is fantastic
"the light that burns twice as bright burns half as long, and you have burned so very very brightly" - tyrell from bladerunner
haven't heard that one in... gee i don't know, every discussion with the name "irwin" anywhere and everywhere any time, place dimension and/or alternate realities. so not long.
but...he also isn't around to fight against it either :(
i respectfully disagree -- the man clearly held animals very dear to his heart. if you were to ask me, while steve was alive, if he would step in front of a car to save a crocodile, i'd answer yes.
bindi was definitely old enough to remember her dad, i remember her speech at his memorial. robert was like 2 at the time and definitely doesn't except for maybe vague memories. but you're right, that pisses me off too. both have grown up at the zoo, with people who treat them like family. their grandpa bob who as far as i know is still alive loved animals just as much as steve. bob and his wife opened what is now the australia zoo in the 70s. terri still owns the zoo. those kids have literally grown up with animals, with people who had just as much passion for animals as their dad, i think bindi had kids shows when steve was still alive even. animals are in their blood so to say they don't have as much passion for animals is ridiculous. they do their own shows at the zoo and are very comfortable talking. they are clearly passionate about what they're doing. i don't get why people are cynical. i am happy we have two amazing people to carry on what steve started.
his kid bindi has had a show on australian tv before.
we should go find that stingray and beat the shit outa it
yea but as a kid i always thought he was invincible. i wanted to meet him when i got older.
he passed in the hospital of the town that i was attending school in, the whole town was sad for weeks. such a tragedy
my dad always used to say he's gonna die from the animals one day and when it happened he was in full "told u so" mode and wouldn't shut up about it. lol he got chewed out so hard by my mom that day.
nah he'd be throwing out shit like "struth" along with his crikey
i'm 27 too. heard the news that he had died when i was 17 and i bawled crying like a baby for 2 days. i crew up watching his show and wanted to work in the same field along side animals.
i'm 41 and own a business now. in the us. that time is past me i'm afraid.
crocodile hunter: collision course. i don't see it on netflix in the us but definitely a fun movie!
sometimes, just going on with life is an achievment on its own. you don't have to do great to be great :)
my very first thought too! kurt just seems so youthful and steve is so larger than life, it's hard to reconcile them.
this dude had balls lmao i will definitely check it out tomorrow morning
his son is the spitting image of him, right down to his mannerisms and the way he explains things. so cool to see.
the joke was good for the first 10 years. its getting fucking old yet people still guild it. might as well throw out some "thats what she said" jokes and try my luck for some gold
and yet its guilded. it was funny for the first ten years
damn, that hits hard. i'd like to think that steve's sheer irwin-ness would convince trump into saving the environment and the wildlife that inhabit it.
the us had a chance to help pull those nations around. we had the resources to innovate and serve as a model to the world on how this could be done, and i felt that under obama we were slowly making progress in that direction.
steve irwin is like the bob ross of the animal world
dude this is reddit, where people pretend obvious things are some sort of hidden esoteric knowledge only they realise. get with it.
the accident occurred while filming for his daughters show, if my memory serves.
those people want his kids to be as bitter and lonely as they are.
it's like those old ladies that sit in the park and throw bread crumbs on the ground for birds... except with dogs.
they're both do shows for the public at the australia zoo which is owned by their mom and dad. they're more than comfortable talking to an audience and show just as much passion for what they're conveying as anyone else who speaks publicly. i know people who are that enthusiastic talking to the public. just because everyone on reddit is an introvert doesn't mean everyone is. also if you ever watched steve irwin on tv or talk about animals then you'd know he was just as enthusiastic about animals as his kids show in themselves. it isn't an act and they aren't exaggerating for the audience. you sound like someone who never watched the crocodile hunter.
agreed, i hope he features on more shows so he can spread the love for animals!
that is the exact opposite of what steve irwin would have wanted. incidentally that's exactly what happened after he died; people went out finding stingrays, mutilating and killing them, it was really sad.
i was just thinking he was basically superman to me growing up
if any event ever tarnished the reputation of an animal, it was this. totally prejudiced against sting rays now.
it is a hard thing to assess. i read that if he left it in there was a big chance his heart would have ripped to shreds from beating against the teeth of the barb, which would've been an infinitely more painful death
wait... 10 years ago was the '90s... right? right?!
the new 5 is in circulation, and the 10 has been finalised, but 20, 50 and 100 are still available for him.
something about this entire post gave me the biggest nostalgia blast i've felt in a long time. the crocodile hunter still alive. late 90s. a young man, lost opportunities. wow. life goes by so quickly
omg, i love that movie. my favorite part was where the government agents were doing their mission briefing and talking about how steve irwin might be a spy, and they talk about the multi-million dollar expansion of his zoo as proof. "you can't make that much from doing cable tv shows!" lol
full of rich cunts who actively ridicule the lower and middle classes. only most aussies are too stupid to realise.
much in the same way /r/australia in no way reflects how the nation votes.
i think hes trying to emulate steve, more then it being his natural state. nothing wrong with that, steve was an amazing dad and person, you can't blame him.
you don't remember the controversy when he was holding baby bob in one arm and feeding a crocodile with the other?
thats pretty much the same shit that happens to every golden joke on this site, prime examples i've noticed are the "m'laysia" joke on the discussion about malaysian airlines, fucking hilarious at the time, now people apply "m'whatever" to anywhere and get thousands of upvotes and gold, where the fuck is the joke? doesnt even remotely relate to neckbeards at all. another is "to shreds you say", at the time that genius somehow pulled this random quote that no one gave a shit about and turned it into a meme, now people piss it about when harm to somethings comes even remotely close. my gripe is when a great joke comes along try to remember it great by keeping it relative, cant go putting square shapes in round boxes. /rant
at least in australia, he would've been a loud voice against australia's trump abbott...
yeah, he took a break from filming his show in order to get some b-roll of swimming with rays for bindi... :(
yea it's bullshit. steve would be very proud of his kids, i'm just sad that he couldn't see them grow up. i hope they follow in his footsteps, he was so great and genuine.
i guess "saying hi like a dog" was a weird way to phrase it. i meant, "like dogs will do."
hell yea he was. the man would spot any random deadly creature n chase it down just to pet it n tell us about it.
if you ever do, just remember that he wouldn't want you to feel that way. he would hate to hear about someone harming any ray because they were sad or angry of his death. iirc, he died so he wouldn't have to harm the ray in an effort to help himself*
yeah, it's hard not to come to that thought when i'm thinking it watching every one of his tv episodes
i used to be a diver and we used to fuck with rays all the time. they have to be the most tolerant animals ever. i don't get it.
i read that it was a freak combination of the number of stabs plus the location. rays don't usually sting a bunch of times but this one freaked out. and it was unfortunately right next to/on his heart. if it had been only a couple stings by the heart, or the same amount of stings in a less vital place, he likely would have lived.
sorry friend, you're getting old. i'm seventeen and i wasn't even alive during the 90's.
i actually remember 9/11, but didn't quite comprehend the scale of it at the time. also, i'm not american, which had an effect.
if he doesn't make it on the $100 note i'm gonna be so pissed!
not quite, but almost. we still have universal healthcare :p
i wish someone would create /r/fuckthelibs so i could actually visit /r/australia once in a while.
their mother did a sensational job with them. both of them make me miss steve irwin less. it's honestly great to see them at an age where they can be on tv and the public eye and keep doing their father's work.
he really is. i forgot how much i enjoyed terri. maybe she's stayed out of the spotlight since steve's passing? but he has her eyes, and her gentle approach somehow mixed with steve's enthusiasm.
spent an afternoon with him (as well as terri and bindi) at aus zoo a couple years back and i think it is just his natural state. very easygoing, friendly and mature for his age!
i remember that. i think it was the fastest turn from outrage to understanding the internet has ever known. it's steve irwin ffs, dude knows his shit.
this isn't reddit it's life. our levels of communication have just increased so much we more often hear classics repeated.
honestly... it wasn't that. from the very beginning. i even quickly thought, "how cute, referring to his/her child as pup" and, i completely prefer dogs to kids, i don't know where my brain was going with that one.
shortly afterward he was killed some cunts on the gold coast (of course the gc) started cutting rays wings. steves dad had to go on tv and tell them to stop.
i'd prefer him on the 50 myself, when was the last time you saw a hundred dollar bill? exactly.
i'm guessing real life practice from zoo animal presentations and probably a mix of idol worship of his father i can totally see him in front of a mirror trying to pull of his dad's mannerisms
terri was in the news lately for allegedly shacking up with russel crowe but that's mostly it since his death and bindis various franchises.
steve's dad?? damn, pretty heavy name.. looks like a great kid to carry it on.
not trying to compare myself to them cuz i don't at all, but when i work with the public i have a public face and a private face. it wouldn't surprise me that when he's in the zoo or in front of cameras he has a natural public face at this point.
also, i have my biological dad's expressions and mannerisms but i wasn't raised by him and we've never lived together. sometimes it's just how things turn out.
lost my dad when i was young. didn't know him all that well for several years growing up, just memories of a certain time. photos and distant memories are all i had. this kid has his father's legacy, youtube videos, people's adoration of his father etc.. believe me, he's emulating his dad. never underestimate a sons need to do this. as you say not a bad thing, but this kid has probably felt inclined and encouraged to keep his dad's "spirit" alive.
i took the same journey. i thought it was a bit cruel to refer to your child as a dog so many times. then i thought he was just setting up for a joke that would reveal it was a dog the whole time. then i realised it really was a dog the whole time, and was never a joke.
maybe his presence will make all the drug dealers rethink their lives.
fuck imagine just being able to call ya 100-bills "stevies" that'd be great
good for her, man. i heard she hadn't dated since steves death. it's good to see shes giving it a shot again.
sadly steves dad had a falling out with the family after steves death, can't remember the exact cause but there was a tv special in australia about it at the time.
i'm sure there is a lot of truth in that. thanks for sharing about your father.
yep. if you're not there for a weekend holiday or permanent retirement chances are you *might* be a fucken dipshit bogan. (explanation: if you can collect the dole [welfare] why not collect it at a beach paradise? welcome to straya...)
it's the bbc's graphic. the brit's won't forget you! (nor will you forget them, i guess)
i would watch a station that used this graphic lol
same i was on my phone trying to get to another sub and saw this right as i clicked. heart skipped a beat and thought trump did something really big and bad and now i'm here...
"there are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen."
or trump again, but it is 2am where he is so not much happening in trump land!
''aliens come to invade the earth and instill a new world order'' ''oh, thank god. i thought trump launched a nuke''
yeah i feel the same. i don't know what it is, media saturation or something, but the world feels ... intense.
nah, it will just be the reverse of all previous afd's, and will likely contain headlines like "trump resigns", "trump hospitalized after coronary", or "impeachment proceedings begin at 10:00 am", in other words stuff that everyone would want to hear and would latch onto in about 18 or 19 nanoseconds.
i popped over to this universe to let you know that our top headline is "bill has decided on a name for the new white house cat"
let's think positive thoughts, like... how's that moon base coming? hope the martian weather is nice....
it's the bed of needles theory all over again. this anti-immigration decree has already made people forget trumps decrees about the wall, or the pipeline, or the anti-abortion gag-order. tonight he'll insult some celebrity over twitter or something and everyone will focus on that next.
ooh, let me try: "it's really the stupid pretentious left who spend their time unemployed, protesting and giving marginal real benefit to society that will probably be replaced in a few years with a robot or a shell script." or another way "everyone who doesn't agree with me is an idiot. i've checked, idiots believe different things from me. low smart people cover the country and vote for the other lizard politician. but not smart people like me, and i know this as other people who believe the same as me tell me i'm smart"
it almost looks like something the daily show or john oliver would do. "and now, on to our new segment, appropriately titled: *oh fuck, what now?*"
it's like /r/floridaman/ personified on a political level. jesus christ its one clusterfuck after another with this precedent trump guy.
like replacing the joint chiefs of staff with bannon on the nsc on saturday following the immigration ban
fada (bill that will allow discrimination against lgbtq) is probably coming this week...ugh.
um, yes. sadly i can't start construction on a fallout style vault until the ground thaws.
i'm excited for the rapture. according to all the bumper stickers i've seen, i'll be getting a lot of cars.
except the possibility of funny/really destructive tweets
honestly, regardless who's the president, as long as the new world order wasn't horrible, that would be really good. at least it would mean that we probably survive as a species across a cosmological timescale instead having an unfortunate artificial intelligence accident that basically allocates most of our future light cone to something we wouldn't genuinely approve of.
relax there, satan. we're just trying to fool people, not get their hopes up so high and drop them into severe depression.
and?! don't leave me hanging!! it ducks that even in the alternate reality there's still clickbait headlines.
i feel bad for all the mean things i said about 2016
i've taken to calling him the mangofuhrer. it's not rhyming or alliterative, but it makes me laugh every time.
did you forget the 'this is the best sign ever' type comments? there's also the pics of someone's kids holding a sign usually representing something way beyond their understanding.
it's an abstract depiction of the globe. red is used for europe-asia-africa and then you have whiteish superimposition of new zealand and australia. new zealand is 'above' nigeria-cameroon-chad region of africa, (partial) australia is on the left, over western africa.
and of course, i heard that all in john oliver's accent, very good :)
i always saw a robot head for a while. always thought it was something anime related whenever i saw this on /r/all.
no kidding. i went out for supper, and when i came home, there was a terror attack, and a neo-nazi using it to further his case for white supremacy. then i went to bed, and when i woke up, it turns out the attacker was white, and the neo-nazi was **still** using it as an example for why islam is evil. to to it all off, this neo-nazi is somewhat mainstream and fucking verified on twitter. i can't believe i'm going to say this, but fuck, i miss 2016.
to think that without me there would only be 99 people shoving up a toy car in their ass tonight
luckily we have each other on reddit to survive the next 8 years. i've been so anxious i'm actually gonna apply for disability soon since i can't even go to work. this is just all really terrible. for the first time in my life i'm afraid of being a muslim. afraid they'll take me from my home.
for just 3 easy payments of 19.99 you'll get our top of the line shit can. but, wait! if you call in the next 37 seconds, you'll get a second shit can absolutely free. *just pay separate processing and handling*
i just love how stupidly he threw away his only good maneuver at the beginning. pulling out of the tpp is litterally the only thing he promised to do that most everyone agreed with, and like a fucking novice that was one of the first things he did. instead of waiting to play that card once the shit was hitting the fan like it is now and he needed to win some people back, he just threw it out right away. now he has nothing to calm the anger. it's all bullshit from here.
and that's why i don't want kids, best outcome we achieve meta-stability and the world doesn't further devolve into civilizational collapse in my lifetime, worst case it does and i only have to worry about riding it out comfortably until offing myself becomes an alluring perspective. i'm not saying it's for everybody but it definitely gives me some peace of mind.
i wish i could tell you with certainty that everything is going to be alright. what i can tell you with certainty is that we will stand up for your rights as a citizen of this nation, but more importantly, as a human being that deserves to be treated with the same basic dignities as anyone else. it is a scary time. i myself am scared. i just hope that you know that a small right-wing minority does not represent america. we will march for you, we will fight for your rights. and it may not matter coming from me, one working class citizen. but people with much greater influence than i, such as sally yates, would do the same.
thanks for this comment. it made me realize i needed to take a step back.
i think that's an unhealthy way to look at it. look, we live in a time of unprecedented communication, we can see in real time whenever anything bad happens anywhere. we have a 24 hour news industry that feeds off the attention. so now, when some industrial plant blows up and kills four people in bumblefuck, instead of it being a blurb in the paper it's cnn's top story for four hours. the shit that worries me is stuff that might spark large scale conflict. like when turkey shot down that russian plane.
i'm a little over a year clean from being a heroin addict most of my adult life. i don't want the world to end, it just started getting good for me! sometimes i think, "wtf, man? i got clean for this shit?" still worth it, though.
also, maher has had it out for trump for years. i remember a few years ago trump threatened to sue maher for saying that he looked like an orangutan.
it's monica. y'know. for his favourite friends character.
don't. 2016 was still a dirty whore. just because 2017 is turning into a steaming pile so quick doesn't excuse 2016 for being a dirty dirty garage pile.
but it's not breaking - they cry wolf with this tactic so often it ruins it when there actually is important breaking news
because the shit he promised he'd do was bat shit insane and now 70% of the country is tethered to this crazy ride the other 30% concocted.
it looks like he's going to go for the wall, at least.
or "aston" in the uk, for the same reason as chyron (company name)!
jon stewart needs to come back, we need him now more than ever!
i'm a formerly undocumented iranian immigrant who came to america via mexico, eventually got a green card, and now citizenship... so it's been a rough week.
oh man, if they're not already mad that you're muslim, a muslim on disability might make the apoplectic. you stay safe, bro.
oh christ, i haven't even seen this yet. i don't even know if i want to right now without booze on hand.
heh you really think that debt will ever be paid back... do you?
you can actually just pop regular popcorn in a paper bag in the microwave. it works surprisingly well! the only thing is that you have to melt your own butter and put it on so not quite as convenient. sorry if this is common knowledge and i'm just an idiot
do you want to die knowing all of humanity's hopes are lost? most died knowing things were carrying on, their kids had a chance. how do you fancy dieing knowing all our thousands of years development led to this? some brain dead cunt-puppet was given enough power to destroy us all and all our slow rise to civilisation.
good on you! if not for reformed heroin addicts i probably wouldn't have met my gf (she wasn't the addict :p)
2016 was the dirty whore, 2017 is taking delivery of a crack baby.
and now i am reading all the comments in john oliver's. thanks for that lol ugh i want john oliver to come back to make me feel better about all this.
significantly more upvotes for the suggesting you were going to hang yourself. that's nice isn't it?
damn. you've lived quite a life. don't let anyone tell you you're not an american.
you have to know you're in a shit show when the koch brothers are calling trump dangerous, and a loose cannon. how loose does your cannon have to be to get a jimmy russle out of the koch boys?
the person you're replying to pretends to be people he's not. check his history. at different points he claims to be both a man and a woman, and he has some really weird made up stories in there. most are meant to make people dislike muslims.
i don't think you wanna be drunk when shit goes down
exactly! trump is just mouthing off on twitter and signing shit that is put in front of him. even if he goes for whatever reason, the cabal of assholes that have been put in place will remain, and continue to exert yuge influence.
trump, bannon, pence. marry one, fuck one, kill one, go.
what i want is irrelevant, i firmly believe everything works out in the only possible way it can, there's only what can or cannot be according to natural laws and reasonable probabilities. if we do end up destructing ourselves then it means it's probably a nigh-impossible outcome to avoid for intelligent life, it's some form of natural order. being mad at that would be like being mad at the wind or gravity: you can, but there's not much point nor sense to it. also i don't believe all of civilization hinges on the us, you guys may collapse, disappear, without necessarily the world doing so: the us or western civilization as a whole wouldn't be the first empire to fall, doesn't mean it's the end of it all.
in the uk we call vacuums hoovers, even though hoover is a brand.
he's back on in like two weeks i think. he has *a lot* of shit to cover
as a brit, i am just happy my apology was recognised.
those are always the people who have no understanding of constitutional or american history. i like to tell those people to get out of my country. :)
the kochs are just afraid of losing power. trump is making them look bad. they know that if they don't get out in front of this asap, they're going to lose a lot of ground.
then we get mike pence. the more you pick on that presidential scab, the pus gets worse that comes out of it.
he really can do no wrong in the eyes of the members of the cult of personality he's created. if a democrat criticizes him, they're a no-nothing liberal, snowflake demoncrat. if a republican criticizes him, they're a "rino" or part of the establishment.
oh no, i've been tricked into being kind and empathetic towards a stranger. now i look like a total idiot.
that's not that far fetched, actually. that's 100 more years of research to fuck with our life expediencies.
he is just a tool for other elements around him, but i honestly do think that if trump goes, bannon goes. pence has his agenda, but it doesn't involve shock-and-awe style politicking. his game is more of a long-game.
actually, on second thought, not too hard. marry trump for the money, fuck pence because he'd die if he ever was in the same room as a naked man (let alone fucking one), and kill bannon because he's a douchebag piece of shit
hard to tell if loose or has been smashed by our black feathered friend above

hey, you seem like a nice person. i hope that you stay safe and everything is peaceful in your area. i am always glad to meet immigrants! it is so important for loving people to band together in tough times. :)
maybe that's the probalem nowadays? not enough chill?
2018: 2019: ....... 2057: first civilizations emerge.
i have always been a staunch liberal since high school (maaany moons ago) and i would be ok with pence. i feel trump is a loose cannon and he is so impulsive it will be hard to guess what he will do next. however; pence, i feel, would be more methodical and it would be easier to guess what he will do next (chuch+state, anti-gay marriage, etc.) when comparing the two it is easy to choose who i would rather have leading the country and being the face of our country. a crazy, loud lunatic or a crazy, quiet lunatic. easy choice for me really.
don't you know, everyone who criticizes trump is apparently a liberal/libtard. there is no other option
give my popcorn liberty or give me death - poptrick hencorn
you water them with hydrazine though, right? checkmate martian hippies.
his game may not be all that long... - 1) get on the ticket *(check)* - 2) win the election *(check)* - 3) wait for trump to get impeached *(pending)*
"marry trump for the money" isn't really working out for melania. her face is in a constant state of "get me out of here."
even if they were joking, you'd be a good fit over at /r/wholesomememes we need more redditors like you. :)
there are powerful people working hard and spending billions of $$$ to divide the nation
i think straight, white men are very frequently victims in western society; the problem is they don't admit that *rich* straight, white men are the people victimizing them. it's always women, or minorities, or sjws... you name it. i don't think that we should just say, "hey, fuck it, you're uneducated and out in the sticks, eat a dick," but it's hard to feel bad for people that blame *other* unfortunates for their bad lot. so. i don't know. i think people have a lot to be angry about, they in fact should be angry, and everyone should be open to understanding other people's struggles. i just wish the obvious enemy of the vast majority of humanity (monied interests) was the target and not teenage kids with foreign parents, or whatever other scapegoat is in vogue.
if 100 people can each stick one toy car in their shitter, what's keeping you from putting 100 toy cars in yours?
pence is a different kind of batshit crazy than trump. it is a kind of bsc that most of us are familiar with and is much less unsettling. pence would follow the rules and i feel significantly less likely to die under his reign than i do under trump's.
dude as a form of address is completely gender neutral to me. i call everyone dude. men, women, my brother's cat....
hydrazine? wow you don't even use dilithium chlorate to grow maze?
there has to be some dems that think they can make a deal to confirm the trump sc nominee without obstruction, in exchange for (blank)
can you imagine her face if she were married to steve bannon?
the massive electrified butt plug he's got in there already?
i only take uranium as i read on the facebook it is the healthiest from uraniumsponsor.org
that is some seriously high-proof snark right there. jesus.
i wish i could sob airports. would get me out a debt at a much faster pace. in like... 20 years.
can we just put that into every offical report and biography, wikipedia etc.? i mean, how much of an effort can it be?
well, that's just being stubborn. i'm not surprised.
"oh god, it's a long line bra. get the jaws of life!"
i want to watch rouge one but no one wants to watch it with me
instructions unclear: am now dead by bra in moonlight.
meanwhile every ship in that universe clearly has artificial gravity and pressurized interiors. at no point are they weightless.
there may have been a little snark involved when she wrote that, but i'm guessing she'd be pleased nonetheless if that was how it was reported.
copiously covered by or surrounded in. like you would drown a pancake in maple syrup. since in the imagery she's invoking, she's in space, drowned in moonlight gives a beautiful, otherworldly image of floating serenely in space bathed in moonlight that contrasts with the mundane absurdity of being strangled by one's own bra.
the people we grew up loving are all starting to die. 2017 will bring more of the same. :(
sounds more like he just wanted to watch a braless carrie fisher run/jiggle all over the set of new hope.
as conceived by the director that had queen amadala fall in love with a 10 year old boy instead of ewan mcgregor.
interesting tidbit: ssris can be dangerous for people with type 1 bipolar disorder because they can trigger manic episodes.
i fully agree! i only learned about this quote tonight as well. but it is so spot on. it should be celibrated for the positive "daring" aspects of the illness. of course there's a lot of suffering, but it can be pretty awesome too. bless you and hope you see the upsides as much as possible!!!
sad to here about the spending but good on you going to group therapy! my dad used to spend it on records and then cds (the eighties). he would always say "at least i dont spend it on buying cars". so look at the bright side :)
go check out /r/bipolarreddit it's a great community.
i laughed and then immediately dissolved into a flood of tears again. :(
"no, we have to wait for hazmat, there is just too much moonlight in there. it isn't safe!"
in all seriousness, you can totally see a movie by yourself. i think sometimes there's a stigma attached to doing something like that alone, but fuck it. you can't talk to anyone during the film anyway, so why does going to the movie have to be for two or more? :)
i'm pretty sure her bra wouldn't strangle her even if she was in zero g. more importantly for a movie, i don't think anyone expects her to be strangled by her bra in zero g.
i'm going to miss carrie's snark, especially after reading her books.
just a slight example of the beauty her writing injected into things
unfortunately i think 2016 was only priming us for the coming decade.
they taped down her tits. the real reason was because bra technology in the 70s was terrible and you would've been able to see the lines through the lightweight robe thing she was wearing.
i don't think she would have cared if he was honest with her about. what's amusing about the quote is how his condescending nonsense rationale was just pretext for more boob jiggling.
should see her twitter. gave me a chuckle when i found it the other day.
to be fair it was the 10 year old boy that fell in love with the hot older chick. she didn't fall in love till he went all awkward clingy while they were hiding out on her planet
so anecdotally i had to have a bra cut off in the er they had used a gas to puff my abdomen up, while obviously the bra stayed the same. it made it very uncomfortable and hard to breathe so they cut it off. maybe a bra could theoretically do that, but worse and in space?
bp2 as well, which i learned from personal experience. the biggest danger per my pdoc is taking them without a mood stabilizer.
i used to spend it on strippers and cocaine. then i'd date the strippers and just spend it on cocaine. this is a much better solution, video games. your dad was right, there's always something worse we could be doing. we experience life in the extremes. extreme happiness and sadness. in times of depression and mania it's good to remember that were simply beings that feel emotions too strongly.
the comments below yours don't seem to understand bipolar disorder.
whoever manages her dog gary's twitter posted something like "mommy's gone, i'll miss her". when i saw that i just bawled like a baby; does the dog understand why she's not coming back? is it sadder if he understands or if he doesn't? i'll miss carrie, she was amazing.
totally agree with this! i went off to see 'rogue one' on my own last week in london, and was 16 when i saw a film on my own for the first time. honestly, i think this is a lesson most people don't learn until later on in life, that there is no reason to not do the thing you want to do, just because you're alone. all it means is that you would miss out, and no one really regrets doing something they wanted to do (even alone), but everyone regrets not doing something! :)
unless death tries coming for keith richards - keith will take him out.
1/10/2016, a date which will live in infamy. i wasn't ready to let bowie go then and i'm not now. i can't believe he's gone. :( we ended 2015 with lemmy's passing, and started 2016 with bowie's passing.
my guess, apart from what was undoubtedly a bit of that (boobs are never bad), is that george didn't want to have to worry about his costumes showing brief / bra lines, as it might remind folks that these are just actors and not actually space men.
a lot of scifi women have stories to tell, from troi/mariana sirtis to carrie fisher and uhura/nameslippsmymindatm.
gl didn't know luke and leia weren't siblings yet when that movie came out.
oh, of course. i'm not knocking her in any way, she was a great person.
and she didn't really fall head over heels until he brutally killed all the sand people.
well if someone has a bipolar disorder diagnosis and is not on any type of mood stabilizer, that's a red flag that they aren't getting competent psychiatric care. i see it surprisingly often, typically in clients who got meds from their pcp rather than going to a psychiatrist.
oh absolutely, people should take their medication as prescribed. but people should also be informed about effects, and be able to ask questions like "do you think i need a mood stabilizer in addition to this prozac?"
seroquel sucks because of the weight gain and connections to insulin resistance, too. according to my psychopharm class, however, the seroquel-lithium combo has a high efficacy rate.
bipolar maniac here.. i find it so strange to see people talking about it without apologizing for it right off hand. happy to know i'm not alone, even if i'm 22, broke both my feet after a strange career as a bodyguard. i think i should go into entertainment, it seems like my kind of people do better there anyways.
have you ever strangled the devil with her bra in the pale moonlight?
already done: *"in her book, wishful drinking, fisher wrote: 'i want it reported that i drowned in moonlight, strangled by my own bra.' several obituaries and retrospectives obliged."*
he was at the hospital before she died, so i hope he got to see her one last time. dogs don't understand death unless they actually see/smell it themselves. bringing a dog to its dead owner sounds super dark, but it's the only way to show the dog what happened.
we had two dogs and one got very sick to the point he had to be put down. we ended up using a service that sends a vet to your home so the animal doesn't have to endure the stress of a car ride or vet visit in its last hour. the other dog had been upset for weeks that his "brother" was dying. when the vet showed up she said "it's ok to have the other dog here, it's actually better for him in the long run." so he was there sitting by his brother's side when the deed was done. it was **so fucking sad** but i think the vet was right. i think it helped him understand what was going on and he didn't seem to stress much. i think of the other dog just "vanished" one day it would have been harder on him.
isn't that where the infamous hacker 4chan resides?
wouldn't that be a twist for 2017. "death has passed after suffering keith richards."
should have realised something was up when the starman said "fuck this, i'm out"
that does explain the natalie portman nippage in attack of the clones.
with *his* own bra? does he wear a bra for his chin?
yup. i gained about 50 pounds since i started seroquel 4 years ago. luckily i managed to get myself of of it and have been on a topamax regime as a light mood stabilizer. it's not as effective but man it's so great to be losing all that weight. i'm going slowly but i'm down 30 lbs already, we decided to stop the seroquel because my blood sugar was in pre diabetes levels, and i don't even eat that much. hah
so what's the story about your feet? yes don't ever apologize for having a mental illness. nobody apologizes for having diabetes as far as i know!
of all the things in this post. this is the comment that makes me tear up.
when i went away for college my parents said my dog checked my bedroom every morning to see if i was there. she was always so happy when i came back to visit.
gary originally belonged to billie, but the two fell as n love.
he died too of heart failure from being 400 pounds. rip 4chan. 2016 is the worst.
it was a rebel that said it! propaganda, i tell you!
ugh, that phrase just reminds of that nightmare of a game that has a great title but is just volleyball.
it's *cold* on that desert planet. she must've had the ac in the ship cracked all the way up.
you just can't explain anything about tie fighters. they have insufficiently size thrusters, inconveniently placed power cells, and ineffective "solar panel" "wings" that increase the angular momentum of the ship, which greatly reduces the maneuverability, (not to mention those panels are held on by struts smaller than qui-gondamn womp rats). and you want to know why they have fucking panty lines? because fuck you, that's why. they do what they want.
does anyone really? isn't that a myth like santa claus, fairies and the country of finland?
he had a vague idea for a big story beforehand, but it was not nailed down in detail at all.
... obviously, luke *was* interested. he didn't know he was her brother, and there's no genetic block to incestuous feelings. when you've grown up together, things are different, but at this point luke and leia are complete strangers and he's *definitely* interested in her. that they turn out to be siblings later is just amusing and awkward.
originally the story was going to involve luke searching for his lost twin sister who was a completely new character. i think he just burned out and rushed through rotj to quickly wrap things up and walk away from the series for a while.
if you scroll enough, you see a tweet where she breaks character and admits she's trolling us.
cher's political commentary was fantastic this year, i love her twitter
to be fair, when my wife asks me to unhook her bra, i would much rather cut it than try to find out how to unhook it.
i spent a lot of time training, ended up collapsing halfway through a sparring match. found out from my doc that i have a genetic weakness in my ankles that caused them to collapse from all the strain. ended up breaking a few bones and tearing a few tendons and other soft tissue. now i need surgery and recovery and physical therapy. lost most of my progress physically too, which sucks big time. i'm a big, big guy. and when the muscle went it traded places with soft flabbyness. haha. i gotta find some wheelchair exercises. but yeah, i have to be constantly doing things and it was amazing to find out that i wasn't broken just designed differently. when i found that out it changed a lot of things for me, and slowly i see more and more people with the issue coming out proudly. which is amazing for me, personally.
this is true. more like i assisted the bra really
my wife is bipolar type ii. that joke fits her perfect. she's the first to acknowledge it.
that sounds so tragic that i'm almost mad at the dog for being so innocent. i wonder how it feels when it doesn't kow what's going on but cares about you enough to miss you.
i don't know about the empire, but for how much it's censored, the female nipple will surely fall western civilization.
don't forget the mythical place called belgium, in the sea of luxembourg.
-pointy finger behind the hook, thumb and middle finger on each side. -use pointy finger to hold hook area a little bit out. -grab the hook area with your thumb and middle finger, you should now have about an inch of bra between those two fingers. -make a slide motion kinda like you are snapping your fingers (keep in mind which way the hooks are, snap opposite way. most bras are left shoulder to right, this means thumb goes out middle finger goes in). -bra is now unhooked with one hand, you look like a seduction god.
thanks for your story but not cool about your ankles. :( that's a beautiful way of putting it, "being designed differently"!
i made sure to visit her lots and always take her for nice long walks when i visited.
australian, male, no idea about bras. but, out of interest, what sort of price are we talking? i will ask the girlfriend later haha. "why were you talking about bras?" "jiggly tits and the empire" it'll be fine.
indeed, belgium is a conspiracy and this message must be spread far and wide.
i'm not arguing whether it was right or wrong or gross or icky, but sticking to the scripts: luke expresses romantic interest at some points, and yes that would be incestual.
when i die tell my fans i was strangled by carrie fisher's bra in the glow of a movie theater.
as someone that wears bras, i'm actually having a really hard time picturing what you're saying. i always thought it was easy to just apply pressure to the clasp side of the bra with a middle finger, then use the thumb and pointer to tug the hooked side out. although to be fair, explaining bra hooks and clasps in general without visuals is no bueno.
well american. a cheapie bra can be as low as 20$ but it basically a nipple shield becuse theres no support. a "good bra" usually a box store can be from 40 to 120$ and lasts about 2 to 3 years with diligent hand washing and hanging to dry. a great bra. one that fits, supports and covers the nips. ah starts at 100 and has no ceiling. this is all assuming a small cup size. if you're endowed, everything scales up.
"movie idea: laserswords! robots! aliens! spaceships!" "sounds good, but what about the *plot*?" "i dunno, just some basic hero's journey type thing."
yeah, but instead of looking like a smooth god of seduction you now have a screaming woman yelling at you for ruining the one bra that fits just right and that cost like 50 bucks.
in west zimbabwe, bored and crazed on victoria falls bridge i spent one of my days chillin' out maxin', and drinkin' like a fool i thought maybe bungee jumpin' might be kinda cool
i think this would actually work, you would just need to change it up a bit. trust-fund baby shouldn't be evading anything, he should be sent there by his parent, carlton, who's wife left him or passed away. he is sent there because he is treating everything like it's nothing more than his right. while will is living in west philly, he has made something of himself but is still the free spirit that he was when he first went to bel air, and sees his nephew more uptight than carlton when he moved out there, but also shallow and believing that he deserves anything and everything, just because he considers himself above everyone else. will tries to introduce him to the real world, and show him that not everyone is handed everything and that they have to work hard and earn it. holy fuck, i need this show now! someone get a hold of will smith!
and played war machine in the first season of the iron man cartoon
hillaryyyy bankssss yes trevor will you marry meeeeeeeeeeeee splat
and they'll be latinos. sitcoms with latino families are the big thing on netflix nowadays. the "one day at a time" reboot and "cristella" are excellent!
agreed. i don't think bungee jumping makes for the most flattering pose either.
"he's uncle will to the world, i call him father phil." - jayden smith
will's mom and vivian were sisters on the show; will's character was not a blood relative of uncle phil.
then a couple of guys, relatively good, tried to sell me stuff carved out of wood. i looked at my handler and he got scared, he said, "mr. smith, please get back in the van so that we can head to the airport and get back to south africa."
netflix please write will a check and fire up the cameras.
great! he'd make an excellent rich kid with overblown sense of entitlement.
i didn't even know there *was* an iron man cartoon. now i know what my childhood was missing...
i think the reason he added that was so that he didn't seem insensitive to the uninformed.
it's the best scene ever. we have never seen uncle phil become such a major father figure when his own father leaves him
it is exactly that :-) awesome place. i've been there at least a dozen times... source, lived in zambia for a while.
as someone who never had a father growing up this really hits home.
my unknown uncle phil, i heard it in his will that will would talk about phil. it was a paradox of times, sometimes unseen. sometimes i see when phil would talk to will and i thought, you know what? when phil is around will, i thought about writing a will, but then phil came into my mind and told me "hey smith, you don't want to write a will right now, not for me and not for uncle phil" and i thought, why not? i mean, he said that he took a pill once and that if i worked for a mill, i could totally chill. and then, the unicorns man. i mean, you haven't seen these things at all. so, when i couldn't see what he was sayin', i just couldn't be playin'. so in the end, i can see that we can't see so we got to be. and that's how we be.
i know that(though i wasn't really thinking of it at the time). but either way they look like they could really be related imo.
actually they're all just actors with no familial relations whatsoever! i still think they look like they could actually be related.
we had a good thing going. you just had to go and fuck it up huh??
if you tell will smith all the profits go to the church of scientology he will probably be unable to reject the deal out of fear of ritualized murder of his whole family by the church! aren't cults fun!
i can't take more than a few seconds of that kids wrinkled-brow, mouth-open, thinking-too-hard face. his dad however. hot damn.
every. god. damn. time. i need to start checking usernames.
oh don't worry, you weren't missing anything. the first season is legitimately some of the worst children's tv i've ever seen. it was completely changed and nearly entirely recast in subsequent seasons though and then it got slightly better
yes! that was definitely a powerful line. i get shivers every time i hear it.
definitely. remember that episode where will got drunk and got visited by a kid that was killed by a drunk driver? the show is a comedy, but when it got serious, it got *serious*.
raised by a single father and a mother who abandoned at 10, so i have so many memories of her and how much i loved her and she just left and dropped contact with me. to this day i wonder why and i cry nearly everyone i see this scene.
the way his eyes bulge out of his head, while that smile gets increasingly sinister.
... so you're saying they look alike.. because they're black?! found the racist, guys... /s
so now the real question. what black person do all black people look like?
i started rapping this in my head thinking it was part of the song.
wait. seriously? they got will too? that's fucking news to me. 4 hours a day on reddit is letting me down.
maybe they could give him the jazzy jeff role. he gets literally thrown out the door every time he shows up.
chillin out maxin investin all cool and all sippin some pinot outside by the pool.
shit. i upvoted before i finished reading. what a rookie.
he will erase it within a few minutes. i still don't know why
it already happened dood. clinton started a shadow war back in syria, and that escalated tensions with russia. your going to get plucked out of that class and put on the front lines tomorrow. hope you know how to carry a machine gun!
also the episode when carlton's in the hospital and will makes him give up his gun. the show holds up very well. i'll still watch reruns when it's on.
nah don't wonder why, just let it out man. after 20 years of nothing, i finally reconnected with my dad a couple years ago and we've been hanging out and shit and it's awesome. but lemme tell you this shit still makes me cry watching it. even seeing the gif online. memories are a powerful thing man don't feel bad about that shit, or question it. it made you who you were today.
stop right there... media watchdog bot says there is deception detected in your comment.
not to mention how he sounds exactly like the shredder from the old tmnt cartoon. /yes, i know he did the shredder's voice.
i've been to idaho and i haven't even seen two full sets of teeth in the same place at the same time.
he and jada dabbled in it a few years ago but they're no longer involved in the co$.
and we should make a show about making the show, like how seinfeld used to do standup intro to his show, except its infiltrating church of scientology.
when a couple of suits who were up to no good, filed fraud cases against my investment group
you literally had no other tv show tear you up? wtf, man, you're cold.
they keep getting better and better i'll give him that
join the rest of us where any paragraph of decent size gets immediately suspicious, only to be bamboozled deep in the thread after you let your guard down :/
really? i guess for us older folks this was a huge deal at the time. wrestling was super popular at the time. it made a lot of us think owen hart's fall wasn't real for a bit.
mind. blown. it was the same damn clip every time and i never noticed that he would be wearing the shirt prior to the event.
bruh bryan cranston is obviously the best tv dad! malcom in the middle = life
i thought this was going to be that damn sr-71 story
and a gif of mankind getting thrown off a cage by the undertaker? wtf?
i filed counter suit after counter suit but my lawyer got scared, he said "you need to run away, now! to phil-air!"
he really has a talent for coming up with creative entrances for his joke.
except, both falls were real. when the announcer screams "oh god they killed him!" that was him breaking kayfabe. mankind hit hard, even undertaker thought he did major damage to him.
there were a lot of things you could do in an sr-71, i'd post them all but i'm on mobile. -sr71 guy probably
he gets you invested in the first sentence. of course i want to hear a cool story about my favorite tv dad.
yeah, i know. i watched both ppv's live. owen's fall they didn't show the ring for a long time. camera kept on the crowd or jr and lawler. never to the ring. so it took a bit to really tell it wasn't scripted. wrestling at the time was about extreme and one upping each other (wcw and wwf).
now, i ain't no bungee expert or nothin...but i don't think he suppose to be slammin into the ground like that
and then he traps you. you can see he even says it in his flair! i haven't seen talent this good at trapping since nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.
mankind pours out the tacks, and attempts to slam undertaker onto them, but after being overpowered he is slammed down on to his own tacks! oh the horror!
i just watched the match for the first time (i never stayed up late enough to watch these matches growing up) and that match was brutal. he's lucky he survived both falls and i'm surprised undertaker was willing to continue with the match.
the stand off between him and a really big squirrel about 4 years ago...he never really fully recovered...
i was like "my dogs a can?" yeah i sent them an email with a link to the post. thought they'd get an chuckle out of it
didn't think i'd like them, til i got to know a previous girlfriends chihuahua... best dog ever. didn't bark, easy to take care of, and just wanted to sit in your lap every time you sat down. big personality and kinda quirky. definitely want one myself - similar to you, i'm a 6'6" guy living in the south.. if i do get one i'm sure i'd get heck from all the friends i grew up with, but eh...
he's a tri color (dark brown, tan and white) chihuahua named zombie
i don't get why people do that on snapchat, i usually try to out the text box on the bottom or top.
dark, violent version of those beverly hills chihuahua movies.
i wish i could see it with you. i mean overall, the impact isn't so strong--the plot isn't all that sophisticated or anything (though it's entirely fine and handled well, the production values are great, it always feels big-screen/big-budget), the characters are good but it's not like you get deeply invested in them. but it more than makes up for the lack of overall impact, by pacing the action scenes with a patient extraordinary professionalism that puts it above any similar movie in the past few years. you won't come away thinking "what an incredible story" but you may well come away thinking "what an incredible handful of action scenes" and also wanting to see more of one character, either in prequel or sequel form. overall i'd give it 4/5 stars, or 3.5/4. because i'd like a more engaging storyline, but everything else is goddamn perfect.
you should. i loved it even more the second time around, and third and the fourth...
i don't know what it's name was...just the noise it made when it cleaned...
he thought it was food. now i know the reason of his expression!
yeah, i was thinking - this is so far off from how we spell it. i googled it to see if it was spelled differently regionally, but nobody on the internet spells it cozy.
dude vargas commented on your post. you've officially made it on here.
how big/heavy is he? my dog is half chihuahua and i so badly want to get one of these for her, if it would fit.
***no animals were spared in the making of this movie***
he does but he also does a bang on jfk from time to time
this is spot on. also, benicio del toro's character is played really well and the the shocks in the movie make it a really great experience. i mean i wish the movie was just a little longer just because i wanted to see and know much more of benicio's character..... or maybe i loved him because they made him just vague enough....
i had negative expectations for it, thinking it was just a cash-in on the popularity of narcos and some other similar stuff at the time. so i delayed seeing it until some months after it was released. nope, it fucking rocked. i can't remember any time i've felt as much tension as the border crossing traffic jam, except maybe the heat bank shootout when i first saw it in the theater. (you think that shit is loud on your home speakers...)
probably just a phone pic under some good natural light. judging by the background, looks like he just bumped up the clarity/sharpness.
he loves clothes. i have a generic grey sweater looking thing that he wears in the winter when it gets cold. every time i pick it up he comes flying over.
about 10 pounds...his chest is roughly the width of a nerf football
i've only read four of your comments and they've consisted of almost dying while eating goldfish, losing it at a hardware store, and pissing your pants. you seem like an awesome person!
the sunset in the desert silhouetted march, shivers.
listen, i have bobby the baboon in lockup, and he says that for 20 bananas, he'll provide evidence that john chimpo is the pimp in charge of the cartoon network whorehouse
you could trouble me for a warm glass of shut the hell up!
it's funny though because if this was dog attire it would easily be around 100$
you only get one turn riding this big blue space marble...make it count, right?
the cinematography *made* that movie for sure. the story was pretty straightforward and the acting was pretty good but it was just shot so beautifully.
that's a photogenic mother fucker right there! no wonder he got the part.
the cinematography *and* benicio del toro made the film. his acting was top notch and i don't think the film would've been as good if he hadn't have played alejandro.
adorable, loyal, and highly perceptive to training. but most definitely retarded.
you're just gonna drop that there? accidentally? mister, we gotsta *know*!
jfk: are, uh, you drunk enough to sleep with me? [joan of arc kicks jfk in the face] jfk: answer the question!
its probably the breeding and selecting for adorable, loyalty and susceptibility to training that made them retarded.
dude, stop doing things while reading these comments, it's just not safe.
joan: you make me so mad sometimes i could kiss you! abe: what did you say? joan: you make me so mad sometimes i could.... piss... glue.... it's a common expression.
yeah i'm back home sitting on the couch laughing away...zombie staring at me like i'm nuts. he has zero interest in this whole fiasco
it's all a matter of perspective. i literally put a beer cozy on my dog and now it's the number 1 post on all of reddit. hard not to laugh at that!
"are those decorative rotors? what a weird species."
it is frame rate. shutter speed basically controls motion blur.
put it on the flat earth society and watch them lose their fucking minds.
it just has to sync up with the rotation. not necessarily that each photo is taken with 1 full rotation but it can be a number of rotations. i highly doubt the camera is capturing that quickly, but if you can sync it up close enough with a multiple of the period it takes for a full rotation you can get this effect. any photographers want to chime in with the technical explanation?
i'm trying to teach myself not to be bothered by stuff like that, but it often does.
now *you* know that, and *i* know that. and lots of others commenting here do too. but apparently the op doesn't !
not a pro but i think the description explains it quite well. the frame rate of the camera is in sync with the spin of the rotors. basically every time it captures a frame, the rotors are in the same place so when you play the film, they appear to be stationary. have you ever seen film of a wagon or another wheel with prominent spokes & at some point the wheels appear to spin backwards? similar concept, the camera is capturing the spoke pointing up at 12:00, then it rotates clockwise all the way to 11:58 when it another frame is snapped, then again at 11:56, 11:54 etc. when played at regular speed, the wheel appears to be rotating backwards.
they are clearly backup-rotors in case the anti-gravity drive fails while exiting the atmosphere. the blades can be run by batteries charged through solar power, neatly sidestepping the fuel requirements of traditional rockets while giving more control than a parachute. these humans must be a clever race indeed!
if they can play this video they would likely be familiar with the concept of frames
what the fuck? flat earthers? minds? you can't have both man...
as someone else pointed out, there are multiple blades and it's unlikely we could tell the difference between them. in other words you don't have to sync to an integer multiple of blade rotations, but rather e.g. an integee multiple of 1/5th rotations, if there are 5 blades.
well.... i didnt know for sure? so i was asking more of like... clarification...
this reminds me of that slaughterhouse five passage... a passive aggressive commentary on how reality and humanity fall short.
what if alien civilizations watched videos based on moving pixels than the change of pixel colors.
that commercial bothered me so much bc he was holding the rod upside down
because the ferries themselves haven't changed in 30 years lol i was last in hk in 2013 and stayed at a family's spare flat in tseung kwan o. the last time i was there in 1986 (i was a kid), most of tko was still in the water!
it's actually the wan chai helipad by the expo/ bauhinia square.
camel case variables in python? blasphemous! if shutter_speed == rotor_speed: gravity = false
personally i'm a fan of: gravity=(shutterspeed==rotorspeed)?false:gravity;
mate, thank you for trying to brighten people's days. i see a lot of hostility and anger on reddit. i'm really fucking happy when i find people (the hostility is in the minority, but i remember those comments more than any others) who just want to see people smile, even if it's just for a few moments.
fast shutter speed is pretty trivial, especially in digital cameras and especially in daylight. you can set the shutter speed as fast as the exposure will allow, you just can't set the shutter speed *slower* than the reciprocal of the frame rate (e.g., can't go slower than 1/25s shutter speed at 25fps).
then they would really be amazed by what we have achieved. if the next humans saw this video first, and try really hard to rebuilt this helicopter the way it's shown in the video, then their tech would have really advanced!
well it was a joke on jeb bush, aka john ellis bush. they made many jokes about the bush family and administration.
pun threads are childish. you all need to aperture age.
as i said, it's been 30 years since i visited hk. i can only imagine how much it (apart from the star ferries!) has changed. but in 2012 i visited singapore, which i'd previously been to in 1990. similar to your experience, i realised that huge areas we were walking around would have been in the harbour back in 1990 rather than dry land!
pretty much anytime jt is on that show its fantastic.
guys please we all know javascript is better; if (shutterspeed == rotorspeed) { gravity = false; } else { gravity = true; } *puts on helmet and braces for down votes*
wouldn't it be: gravity = (shutterspeed == rotorspeed) ? false : true; also i cleaned up your spacing. we're programmers not animals here :p
i am not sure. this is the one i thought it was but it could just as well be 4chan. the origin is kinda nebulous.
the one-liner version: gravity = (shutterspeed !== rotorspeed);
i have no idea what you're talking about. thanks :)
you're the only animal! if gravity is boolean then just do gravity = (shutterspeed != rotorspeed);
i defy your expectations and respect your opinion. have an upvote.
or if you want to go full blown shit code mode, gravity = shutterspeed - rotorspeed if shutterspeed = rotorspeed gravity will equal 0 which is a false-y value, otherwise it will be truth-y (so if gravity { //stuff } will work)
not quite. pep8 uses a variety of styles, for different situations. variables are snake_case, classes are capwords, constants are all_caps_with_underscore, package names are alllowercase, etc. it helps make it a easier to tell what you're looking at with just a glance.
that instance variable should be private. always use getters and setters in java because reasons if(shutter.getspeed() == rotor.getspeed()) { gravity.seton(false); }
i let you down by replying with a useless comment that says only, *same.*
same. i've never really been interested in any of her albums, but if she made a jazz album i would totally buy it.
just set gravity to be boolean and you're good to go!
`gravity &= (shutterspeed != rotorspeed);` we don't want to accidentally turn on gravity if it was already disabled.
or use both to separate different types of variables.
a lot of movies are going to be hard to watch now.
once ran into him in san anselmo after school with my mom and he bough us milkshakes at bubba's and stayed to talk with us for almost a half hour. such a great person, really brightened my life
same here. my whole body dropped when i read the headline.
that scene at the end of good will hunting always gets me. i can't believe he's gone, really loved his acting and comedy. rip.
it hurts to think of such a hilarious guy being depressed enough to kill himself.
listen to his marc maron interview on maron's podcast. was from 2010, but maron just rebroadcasted it today. robin talks about drugs, depression, suicide, joke stealing allegations, etc. was by far the most in depth he's gotten about his depression publicly. just google maron podcast...should come up top.
me too. he was a huge part of mine and many peoples childhoods. it's almost like losing a grandfather.
nah man... if he was hurting that bad... we just let him rest now.
dead poets society. oh man, that one just hit me pretty hard.
my heart sank when i first heard this. i've never felt so heartbroken over a celebrity passing.
the tragedy (imo) is that someone so beloved that brought so much joy and laughter to the world was so tormented by his demons and suffered so much for so long. his personal life was rife with mental illness, addiction, and tragedy. while his professional life made such a huge impact on so many of us, it's heartbreaking to know that he never found the same joy he so freely gave to others.
uk: 08457 90 90 90 no matter how hard it ever gets, there will always be someone willing to listen, to advise and to help you. we are human beings, it's what we do. 'all for one, and one for all'
suicide. i feel horrible. i don't think a celebrity death has ever bothered me like this.
that's exactly what i was going to say. mrs doubtfire was such a comforting film to me through the years. i'm going to show it to my daughter when she is bigger.
seriously, me and my gf have been planning to watch aladdin for weeks now. now i don't think i could watch it without getting depressed and sad.
aww i forgot about hook :( he was so awesome in everything.
cause it was a real bright and cheery movie in the first place
i've worked in almost every bike shop in marin, so i have had several encounters with him. sometimes he came in and he was on. his voice was booming, filling up the room with bass. other times he was extremely quiet, slipping back to the mechanics area to get something discretely fixed on his bike. the best encounter i had with him was when he made fun of me. i was pulling some brake pads off the wall for a repair, and i heard this huge voice exclaim, "it's jack black with a beard!" i turned around to find out what i already knew, there was robin closing in on me! i responded with, "ha! yeah, a girl once said i look like jack black, and she thinks jack black is hot." robin said, "oh, you gotta watch out for that! one time i was in bed with a girl, and she screamed "fuck me mork!" i have another bike shop robin story, but it's almost all about woody harrelson.
to sleep, perchance to dream; aye, there's the rub, for in that sleep of death, what dreams may come, when we have shuffled off this mortal coil
yea, i refreshed facebook and saw 10 posts in a row about it. i came to reddit hoping to find it was a hoax. now i'm reading all the linked stories and confirmations. this sucks.
this is something that a lot of celebrities probably don't get to experience too often. people going batshit crazy every time they see you must mess with a person.
dead poets society was a great movie. i always thought of him as a comedian, but his performances in dramas were outstanding and heartfelt.
it seems that the funniest people tend to be the most unhappy. comedy seems to be how they hide their depression.
a lot of comedians have depression and their comedy is how they attempt to deal with it. obviously still a surprising, tragic thing to hear whenever something like this happens though.
i think you nailed it. maybe not quite grandfather, but definitely the nice guy who lived next door and told you jokes while you were on your way to catch the schoolbus, or gave you a big smile and wave when you were coming back home.
my wife and i decided to cancel our plans tonight to stay in and watch a bunch of his movies it just feels like the best way to honor him
he gave all his happiness away to others and left none for himself.
i felt jolted. he's an icon. doesn't feel like the world was done with him.
this is what growing old feels like. your heroes die.
very true. only robin would have the humility to want to be received in such a way. what a terrible day for the acting and theater guilds across the world. he was a superb actor.
he probably would have thought that joke was funny
robin rolls a 3 at the end jumanji. games over. not sure if there is more too it than that.
yeah, don't link directly. no ad money for those assholes.
really does. i've never cared too much when a celebrity has died, the normal sympathy. but this. it's like a family member has passed. ever since aladdin robin's been a favorite of mine more so than anyone else.
my father committed suicide earlier this year, this way my first thought as well. i feel so bad for them, especially after all the joy he's brought not only them, but everyone else in the world.
somebody check on jim carrey please =( don't let nothing happen to him.
if there's a smile on my face, it's only there trying to fool the public.
i could be wrong, but i think rorshach relates this story during the flashback to uh .. the death of the comedian? :(
i once heard conan o'brien say that the funnier a person was, the more they hated themselves. rip and thank you for all the happiness you gave.
seriously, depression is something **very** serious that often gets put as a joke. it eats you alive to have all these people. friends. parents. colleagues all so full of life, yet all you can muster up the courage to do is fake a smile. pretend to be happy and full of life, but inside there's something missin that even you can't see. sometimes i hate the thought of gettingout of bed, other times, i just don't want to leave me house. i wish i never had this depression. i've always been envious of others who were truly happy, and full of life..
the worlds funniest man kills himself. sometimes you're reminded just how shit the world can be.
i think you hit it right on the head, i was really young when candy passed away but to me his passing really hit me, robin being gone has me in that state where at any moment i might tear up.
i've been expecting that but they're all dying too fucking young, drug overdoses and suicides, i can't believe robin williams is dead it just hasn't sunk in, fuck
i think that meme died today along with robin williams. i guess he had to go back to ork without richie cunningham. sad.
no. rolling a 3 sent young alan to the jungle. rolling a 5 or 8 gets you out, so start rolling.
the double negative makes it sound like you're wishing jim dies too. and that made me chuckle during a moment of great sadness over robin - so thank you, internet stranger with poor grammar.
my brother is the same. he's a comedian and a musician, but i've never met someone so troubled. he doesn't want to get any help either. i've personally battled depression since i was eight years old, and it wasn't until last year i finally realized what being happy truly meant. it sucks to see him destroy himself when there's help to get. all it took for me was a bit of courage, honesty and an actual will to be myself, but that's hard to muster when you're down.
**jumanji** was the first film i saw him in. hell, i didn't even speak english at the time but i sure as hell knew how to scream it's a stampeeeeede!!!!
90's, 80's, and 70's. i grew up with mork & mindy; robin williams was the *funniest* guy of that time (and others). when he took on good morning vietnam, everyone was wondering what the hell he was doing; after all, "the world according to garp" hadn't done all that well. (one of my favorites, though.) but he absolutely nailed it. it wasn't all drama, but he was better than anyone had expected. and then came "dead poets society." and then a very serious turn on "homicide." and then good will hunting came along, and he cemented himself as one of the most diverse and talented actors ever on film. comedy, improv, drama, light, heavy, weird, straight. yeah, he did some stinkers, but bad robin williams was still always better than most stuff. this is a very big loss loss. but the size of it shows just how big a gift he was to so many people.
i remember jimmy fallon saying that he refused to go to therapy, because he was pretty happy and knew that as a comedian there must be something fucked up about him that he didn't want to uncover.
robin williams was once in the running to play rorschach, so i guess we've come full circle.
he was very open about his struggle with bipolar.
to me the worst part is the feeling that you don't have a 'real' problem. it is like you know you should be greateful, and that makes you feel guilty.
people usually forget how depressed a lot of comedians are.
that's a man who should have died in his late 80's or older surrounded by friends and loved ones. this stinks :(
i don't know why. i think it's because he was a good one. not just skilled at his craft, though he was; immensely so. but a good man. reminded you to be better, kept you laughing at the darkest of times. yet he knew seriousness, and quite obviously knew pain. he uplifted the world around him, which even some of the most famous of celebrities don't always do. cheesy though he was, he was a reminder of something better. and again, he was only 63. if he had lived his full life, if he had long since retired it wouldn't hit so hard. but he hadn't. as someone else said, he was kind of a hero. certainly inspired many others. and it's hard to lose a hero.
why "hopefully not"? i'd prefer to see this man die doing something that brought him pleasure than dying in total misery.
a random episode of mork and mindy was the first thing i've ever videotaped on a vhs when my dad first brought home a shiny new vcr in the 80's. i loved that show and anyhting that man has done. rip.
i wrote a poem too... i guess it's how i'm coping. i wanted to share it, i hope you don't mind. goodbye genie goodbye peter pan goodbye bicentennial man goodbye batty koda goodbye armand join the real teddy roosevelt in the great beyond goodbye professors brainard and keating and maguire goodbye mrs. euphegenia doubtfire goodbye alan parrish and patch adams too to mork from ork we say "nanu nanu." goodbye to the impressions done so brilliantly but not to the impression you left on me although you never knew many lives you did touch, we all say: goodbye mr. williams we'll miss you so much.
it's just not fair that someone who brought so much joy to so many people to suffer from depression. it just isn't right.
what's wrong with death sir? what are we so mortally afraid of? why can't we treat death with a certain amount of humanity and dignity, and decency, and god forbid, maybe even humor. death is not the enemy gentlemen. if we're going to fight a disease, let's fight one of the most terrible diseases of all, indifference. - robin williams (patch adams)
that's one of my favorite movies. so beautiful and powerful
because then it would be accidental. he wouldn't have wanted to die. he was just trying to bust a nut. that would be so much crueler. if it was intentional we can at least bow our heads and wish silently he hadn't been in so much pain that this was what he felt he had to do. that's terrible too, but that was his choice to make. auto-erotic asphyxiation would be much sadder, to me.
gives his wide range for acting a very beautiful mental image. thank you kind sir for the appropriate poem. but damn the person who put this bowl of onions here.
what a perfect quote. i can't recall a speck of indifference in anything that he did
would you kill millions if you thought it would save billions?
acknowledging people's different colors, shapes, and sizes isn't a bad thing. we're all wonderfully and terrifically different from each other. that can be something to celebrate! the problem is when we begin to harbor prejudices about certain differences.
reminds me of when a friend and i switched names for a substitute teacher in high school. i said "why?" he said "shenanigans will ensue". i figure i'll roll with it, when she calls my name he answers and vice versa. then i hear "ok glennis, you were late so i'm gonna have to write it in for the teacher to hear" my god i've never been played so badly in my life.
my parents were trying to figure out which kid my brother was talking about in his kindergarden class. when they finally narrowed it down to the only black kid in class, they asked him, "is she black?" my brother said, "no, she's kinda brown."
seriously. kid on the left has slightly bigger ears but other features are very close.
i'm sure there's some hidden message about racial acceptance in there
oh they care about race. put them in a 40 yard dash and they will try like heck to win!
fuck you got me i didn't expect it because you're not /u/shittymorph
it's actually a form of forced relocation. since most steelers fans are uncivilized savages , we mandate that their youth attend special schools to be properly civilized. after a few years of education, the newly assimilated youths will be returned to their ancestral hovels - although most of their nation's territory is in pennsylvania, there are some outskirt reservations in various other states.
one of the shirts is black and gold, and the other is blue and white. i'll let you decide which is which
i bet you have cone nipples. sounds like something only cone-nipple scum would say.
yeah, i have a feeling this was mostly the parents' doing. probably the white kid's parents. they're friends, they both had their heads shaved, parents add progressive caption for internet points.
the tipping in the direction of white has more to do with societal influences, iirc. media paints being white as beautiful and "better" in a way even young girls pick up on.
me and my best friend in preschool got into a heated argument because he said he was black, while i insisted he was brown.... we referred to the all-knowing box of crayolas to settle our argument.
i'm latino and when i was in middle school my cousin and i went to the park and there was this little boy who kept following her and i around asking if we were black. we about died laughing. he must have been like 4. his father was really embarrassed.
that's something i've learnt in the us. in spain, if you're born here, you're spanish. people don't say: i'm asian, i'm black or stuff like that. when you ask where they are from, they say the neighbourhood they are living. actually, in the school they teach you races don't exist and you probably are the combination of a lot of different ancestors who might have different skin colors. when i went to us, they asked me my race in the interview, and i didn't have any fucking clue which one i was. i said white, because of my skin color, but i was doubting about saying latino. then, when i came i met a girl and i was chitchatting with her she said she was italian so i started to speak italian and she said: - oh no, i don't speak italian - but, you're italian. - oh yeah, but my grandparents lived in italy, i was born in the us. - so, you're american - no, no, i'm italian!!! - ok...
thought the same thing on 1st glance. but upon further review, realized that the kid on the right got the face of a grown-ass man
every once in a while i cross paths with a redditer that i want to have a beer with. today, you're that redditer.
not true. kids make fun of differences all the time. i mean for instance i used to make fun of red heads all the time when i was little... it wasn't until i was a bit older that i realized i was one of them.
but based on where people live, race affects culture to some degree (example: black basketball players hanging out with other black basketball players. since a young age, they've gone hard playing the game), and therefore within the class divides, race really does determine cliques.
i remember in kindergarten a kid didn't want to me to stand next to him in red rover because he thought my skin was gross and didn't want to hold my hand.
yep, i don't think kids really see skin color. or rather they see it, but it doesn't mean anything to them. my first boyfriend was in fifth grade. when my mom asked about him, i listed off a bunch of stuff. "he's in my class. he's really smart, and he has glasses like me! his hair is short. we hang out at recess." it didn't even occur to me (a little white girl) to mention that he was black.
the moment the internet shows you that you aren't the only one missing psych
out of curiosity i looked it up and the dress was in fact blue and black. however, 2/3 of people polled said it was white and gold in appearance. i was definitely in said camp, though my argument was that the photo of the dress was in fact white/gold in appearance, just as it would be black/red if you altered the color levels of the photo.
you guys are disgusting. dont you guys see the problem? colors and white shouldnt mix! how are you supposed to wash the black sweatshirt when its part black part white, it totally throws off the laundry system
it was about this time they realised she was 500 feet tall, and from the paleolithic era.
just like the adults in charlie brown cartoons only creepier
at the same age, i (mediterranean "white") got a deep tan over the summer, and i thought i was just going to look like my "brown" friends from then on. i was sort of disillusioned by november. and confused. because i thought the "brown" was contagious, and i wondered if i wasn't touching everyone else enough.
my daughter and i had a confusing year where she'd be trying to point out a particular person in a group by saying "the black person" then get mad because i was looking at the wrong person (one example was when we traveled to a college gymnastics meet to watch her teacher compete and i couldn't figure out who we were watching for). it turns out she had decided "black" meant a person with black hair, so she was using that term to identify primarily middle eastern people (she already had come up with the phrase "china man" for those of asian descent, which led to an interesting call with her school principal, who accused us of being racist and couldn't believe a 6 year old would invent logical sounding labels). we finally sat down at the computer and looked up images of people from different parts of the world and discussed the short-hand labels we use for people of different physical appearances. she is still unhappy about the inaccurate term "black person".
damn that sounds awful. those kids must have had some terrible parenting. where'd you grow up? i went through elementary school in an almost entirely white area, but none of us little shits were nearly as awful as those little shits. hell, in elementary school, i was already best friends with one of the two black kids in my grade before i made the connection that he was black.
i'll be damned if i'm just going to sit here and take that from some ripple-nipple bastard.
i'm assuming you're talking about america, because we have a relatively unique situation where we have a ton of different heritages, and we frequently see that as having a whole bunch of different cultures. my family comes from poland, my best friend's comes from taiwan. both of us were born here, but obviously we were from different cultures. then i move to japan for a year, and see that we, culturally, had a hell of a lot more in common with each other than i did with other japanese, and i noticed the same similarity with every american i met there, no matter what their heritage or race. that's when i realized that anyone born in america is culturally american. respecting and honoring our individual heritages is actually a subset of that culture.
burnt umber? i'd love to claim that as a race/ethnicity.
when i was growing up i was the only white kid at my school and everyone i knew that was white was my family. so when another girl joined our school in 2nd grade that was also a white blonde girl i thought we were related.
i've seen it in kids. i grew up in a multicultural environment and white kids were always ignorant of race and would ask questions and touch people's hair or skin without asking all the time. they have the privilege of ignorance and entitlement. they assume everyone else has this same privilege, but they're wrong.
this reminds me of the first time i met a black kid. i was six years old. we were in a public swimming pool but there weren't many people there. this was in the 70s, so the boy had a nice afro. i was a little blond girl from a very white family. his hair was a marvel to me. it didn't seem to get wet like mine. instead, droplets of water clung to strands and glistened in the light. i was fascinated and wanted to touch his hair to see if it was as bouncy as it looked. but being a bit shy, i didn't have to courage to do it or even ask.
oh, good. i was expecting it to be an intolerance story.
every day i cross paths with a redditer that i want to buy me a beer.
coming from a diverse up-bringing, by high school many people went off to hang with their own race but there was still a lot of other's that hung out with whoever. makes sense cause the first time i even learned about race was when my friend told me about martin luther king jr in elementary school. it would be a few more years before i found out i wasn't even white but asian...
yeah. kids are pretty genuinely stupid. i remember there was a goth girl who lived on my street and we all called her "meduso" and had to hold our breath when she walked by so we didn't get infected with the goth, and the story was that she peed in the middle urinal once so now if anyone pees in it they become gay. i think we're giving 5-9 year olds way too much intellectual credit.
yeah, i agree. there was an article where the writer has an adopted daughter and she, one day, randomly asked "mom your butt is white and mine is brown." the mom was calculating everything in her head but i think she ended up saying "yes." and the kid went "what time is dad coming home?" i love kids. very simple but still love butts.
i read the whole comment but i don't get it... what's the joke? is this some novelty account that i'm unaware of?
there are dozens of us!!! jk, psych was a really good show and almost all of my friends that i recommended it too loved it. i'm sure there are a countless number of fans that miss it. too bad i didn't get enough attention when it was on air :'(
because the white part's not cloth so it's all gravy, baby.
we say that every year. yeah buddy! you bet!
if they get caught, bribing with 'bout tree fiddy is enough to let them off the hook.
my biological family is white, but i have four adopted cousins who are korean. my little brother was eight years old when he heard me refer to the anniversary of a cousin's adoption day at which point he angrily screamed at me "what do you mean rob is adopted??" he was very upset we "hid it" from him.
my 4yo nephew plays with a boy from germany when he comes to visit occasionally (his dad is a friend of my dad's). they don't understand a word of what the other is saying except for words like 'batman". their conversations are a mix of english, german and constantly repeating names of superheroes. it's so amazing and hilarious to see.
oh jesus, this is kind of a relief... raising a kid in a town that's like 98-99% white, i'm terrified of the moment this inevitably happens to me. i just hope that whoever is on the other end is understanding and has a sense of humor like i would about it. i grew up in this town, and we had 3 black kids and a handful of hispanics in my graduating class of 400. really friendly community, we're just not exactly the most ethnically diverse...
i was 5yrs when i realised my asian face was different from my caucasian friends. i always knew my skin was a browny colour and they were a different colour and i could tell you by rote where i came from so i could answer all the curious people, but i almost fell off the stool when i realised that my face was different to theirs and would never be like theirs. it was like when all the 00011101010's drop away in the matrix.
haha! that reminds me of when i was in the army, my good friend and gunner was a light skinned black dude. our sergeant major used to say that he was "2 scoops of nestle quik instead of 4".
"they *taste* like chocolate too, but you'll find that out when you're older."
it was so awful, especially because it went on for so long (basically, the entire time it takes to ring through a cart full of groceries). and the dad was clearly trying to ignore it, but the son kept looking for some sort of acknowledgment.
also as a person that works in a preschool classroom, it's a developmental marker to know if things are the same or different.
i just realized i've always seen it as redditor, so redditer seems so wrong even though both aren't words so the spelling doesn't matter.
man the final episode teased us with a fucking monk meeting too
nope. it's just that they don't have hair to hold on to!
on the other hand i think it's one of the worst, most tired jokes on this website and see people trying to shoehorn it in all the time. also, that third sentence is the most reddit thing i've read in a while.
tree fiddy?!?! i ain't giving no one no damn tree fiddy... only thing that wants tree fiddy is that damn lochness monstah!
you tell me this now!!! what else are you hiding the dog can't actually talk to me
i'm white and my cousin's chinese. not always a good indicator.
that's how new languages get made. apparently this one would have been superhero based.
that's what books and tv are for! watch doc mcstuffins, read the snowy day, look for diverse book lists online. watch moana and then find some books about hawaii. your local librarian would most likely like nothing better than to help you with that kind of thing. there are ways to expose kids to other people and cultures being experiencing them directly, if that's the situation you're in.
same boat but i'm the only asian in a very mixed family. i didn't realize just how different i looked until 6th grade. i was looking at the class photo,mwhich was just a collage of all of our individual pics and had a hard time finding myself. i was completely stunned.
my cousin is asian, and i didn't realize he was adopted until i was like 8 or 9. i just never thought about it.
your sexual partner might have a serious case of diabetes.
ok, the dad is a total dumbass for not stopping the kid, i don't feel bad for him anymore. the bagger must've been pissed.
also i think as a parent i'd always be curious about when my children start to notice race.
well obviously, seeing as i, a white colombian/italian girl from london, am a direct cousin of egot winner whoopi goldberg. you've never seen her in my photos cause she's just really busy! she communicates with the dead and has to save a community's spirit through choir singing retreads of motown classics while dressed as a nun and running away from the mafia! that takes up a bit of her time! i will ask her for an autograph next time she's around though!
it is crazy isn't it? what's for dinner? i don't know but my face is a whole thing happening over here
black guy in. we're all made with cocoa butter, chocolate and a sprinkle of love.
pittsburgh native transplanted elsewhere. this made me shed a happy tear.
i can't imagine; i guess it's a suburban white people thing. as a rural white southerner, i've basically always been conscious of racial tension. it's not something you can ignore, unless you're willfully doing so. even in the nineties, there was a social distance between black and white. we lived on the same country road, but went to different churches, different parties, etc. we might be friendly at school or in a restaurant or a store, but we didn't socialize. it's a fucked up situation that i feel guilty as hell over, but growing up, we didn't really know any better.
am i allowed to say that would be fabulous? no? go to my room? fine...
of all shows, white collar did an excellent job of showing this. one f the side characters was lesbian, and she had a life partner. they had the "if it was legal" discussion. then it became legal in the show. then they broke up. it was a fascinating dynamic, actually. and that season was a several years ago.
you played the long con and lost. safe travels comrade, and may your password be for ever secure.
man, i live in san francisco so i get no drama at all. just happiness and celebration. what a bummer.
this would be me. lol i'd go down to the courthouse tomorrow, but he has dreams of a huge wedding on the beach with like 1000 guests and a weekend-long extravaganza and like, i don't want to pay for that shit. it's an absurd expense.
i would love to see this awkward press conference now
free happiness? good, now i can settle more cities! shout out to /r/civ
and on the third day, god created the remington bolt-action rifle, so that man could fight the dinosaurs. and the homosexuals.
i've never been more grateful about living 600 miles away from my nearest relatives.
don't forget any benefits you get from work may apply to your spouse now! go talk to hr, you have the supreme court backing you .
i'm not sure why you have fallout 4 as second place. time to bring out my pitchfork. ------e
we are not done. in many states it is legal to fire someone based on their sexuality. the fight for gay rights did not begin with the debate over same sex marriage and it will not end with same sex marriage either.
fellow straight man here. it's just nice to have more options ya know?
as a heterosexual male, it does affect me. that the homosexual people my life are able to find such happiness means a lot.
it's pride week pretty much everywhere, right? because of the stonewall riots june 28 1969.
technically, but functionally it's the same thing, right? in fact, you could say they legalized it by banning the banning of it.
this is actually good for the gop, in a sense, because they no longer have the gay marriage issue hanging over their heads. the scotus took care of that. so one of their contentious issues is no longer a problem.
jeez fine. picky picky. i'll go hop in my same-sex jeep, head over to lesbian breakfast and celebrate my "marriage".
tough week for conservatives, great week for the gop political establishment.
op was the first to post the aca decision, too. big karma week for him/her.
didn't someone say they'd set themselves on fire if this happened? i'm waiting.
and scalia can't get any saltier. seeing him squirm is satisfying.
utah has had legalized gay marriage for some time(their circuit court ruled in favor of gay marriage and the supreme court denied appeal)
i think it was specifically marriage and *contraception*, not sure about *infertility*. same reasoning applies, regardless.
i loved white collar, really sad to see it end. it never gained the popularity or ratings i thought it deserved. it may have been a little ridiculous at times, but i loved it. i just wish they did a better job of changing up the dynamic of the show.
i'll invite you to get high and then my gay wedding of this happens.
there's the drought and sky high housing market. otherwise, it is a great time to be a fan of the giants, warriors, and gay marriage.
living in louisville is interesting, it's a northern-ish city in a mostly southern state. so i get a get a pretty good mix of people freaking out on both ends of the spectrum whenever something like this happens.
i don't know you, but can i get invited to this extravaganza?
cook? with the combined incomes of 2 gay males, you'll be eating caviar off the washboard abs of chippendale dancers.
will you be forcibly penetrating me and turning me gay any day now?
explain this joke for an englishman whose only has the vaguest concept of who or what a bristol palin is?
i think "so" should have been in italics, to stand with the gay community.
it has all the power and finality of a voice of authority and reason.
it's our nation's rallying cry. we whisper "dream of being better than australia" to our children every night as we tuck them in.
and all of my conservative future in-laws are probably regretting adding me to creep on my life. deal with the rainbows, bitches!!!!!
the funny thing is that every single supreme court decision--and most lower court decisions--always have phrases like that that make you scratch your head and that you have to think about to really understand. anyone can just sit there and say "huh? you make-a no sense" but that doesn't mean there isn't a meaning there.
whenever a big decision doesn't go scalia's way, he has the same argument every time: judicial overreach motherfuckers you will pay for this
i don't know any of you people but i'm so happy for you!!
it's legal now. you don't have to keep calling him your "roommate."
wow...that's insane. my mother taught me to live and let live. it's been a wonderful life guiding philosophy for me.
i tried explaining it to my 7 year old daughter and the response i got was, "does that mean i can marry my friend mary?" i said sure, but you might want to graduate first and get a job.
and the stonewall inn was made a historic landmark this week. everything's comin up rainbows.
the same argument was used here in iowa - the judges were "legislating from the bench" problem being they didn't make any new laws, and if they *can't* do it we may as well not have judges period since they'd become entirely useless as this is effectively their entire job. the only difference is some people don't like it this time.
or if have grandparents like mine, a good step towards modern thinking
yes, but it's even stronger than that. if congress had simply passed a law legalizing same-sex marriage, a later session could repeal it. instead, the supreme court has decided that no law can ban same-sex marriage, this making it safe from future legislation. same-sex couples should now be able to breathe a sigh of relief, as it is just a matter of time until individual state bans are challenged and wiped from the books.
the supreme court doesn't make laws. they can rule laws unconstitutional. that's what they did here.
yep, been saying the gop needed to drop social issues for a long time.
so would you say you're eating out for this breakfast?
anyone who paid attention to the obamacare case knows that it was not long for the court anyways. it was a semantics argument on word usage in a very esoteric part of the bill. it was not the fundamental healthcare knock-down drag-out fight the media made it out to be.
i want him to ragequit at some point. "fuck this jiggery-pokery, i'm retiring!"
i honestly don't know but it just really makes me uncomfortable and the idea of gay sex freaks me out. i have a strange sense of self perception and am aware of most of my character flaws.
regardless, what this sentence gets at fundamentally is the quite silly 'biological objection,' which gets bandied about surprisingly often. as a biologist, i'm quite happy to see the scotus coming down like a ton of bricks on crap pseudoscience.
in lexington now, so far no riots or brimstone. let's see how the pride festival goes tomorrow!
yeah! no more wage gap dragging your combined income down!
we already do that psychologically by infusing your textbooks with hidden gay messages and cryptic, homoerotic symbolism. every statistics equation you solve in college is actually a secret gay algorithm that will make you lust for dick. you already are gay. you just don't know it yet!
bristol palin (daughter of a conservative former governor turned talking head) has been pregnant twice (while preaching abstinence only) while never being married. she was supposed to get married a few months ago but they broke it off days before the wedding and then she announced she's pregnant again (though she did not say if the ex-fiance is the baby daddy).
kennedy has written each of the court's gay rights decisions (*romer*, *lawrence*, *windsor*, and now *obergefell*).
"it is *so* ordered." *finger snap and head wobble*
actually, yes, you do. every single court order ends with those words.
when the uk tucks us in at night, she wants one of her children to dream big.
it's not that it's funny, it actually makes a lot of sense when you think about it. these people who are very vocally anti-gay talk like it's just one slip up and everyone will be forced to be gay. they talk like this because they have deep feelings of attraction to the same sex, but have been told it is wrong for their whole life. so they need to be on guard to protect themselves from this gay feeling which is what they think the gays want to exploit. since they are themselves gay or bisexual they don't understand that straight people don't actually feel sexual attraction to the same sex. so all this guilt and confusing feelings that they don't understand are not present in most people leads to this.
i was referring to the (apparent) lack of formality of language, rather than the substance. i was just a bit surprised at the tone!
he also (page 6) holds that a californian is not a westerner (as in the west of the usa, not 'the west'). he further says the opinion of the majority "is couched in a style that is as pretentious as its content is egotistic" (page 7) and that it is full of "mummeries and straining-to-be-memorable passages" (page 4). not especially classy.
does that also mean i have to change our wi-fi password from "justfriends"?
when i had this same discussion with my 7 year old step son, he said he was probably going to marry a boy because "they're more fun." i said, "whatever floats your boat, son. just remember to marry someone you like."
or if you have in-laws like mine, this is an abomination.
the majority opinion actually said that they *don't* have to wait for legislation and lower courts to align that it should be immediately made legal everywhere because fundamental rights don't have to wait for judicial alignment.
the gop's biggest issue is that they have to win a primary full of people who are against these types of things. case and point: mitt romney, the governor, and mitt romney, the presidential candidate.
i think so, brain, but how are we going to afford a bigger military and promise to reduce taxes without negatively effecting the citizenry?
and in fact that court's decision addresses the fact that intent trumps some awkward wording, which is as close to a "get out of here with your weak ass shit" as you can expect from the supreme court.
i mean, gay sex freaks me out too in the sense that i personally would not want to participate in it, but then again i don't ever want to go bungie jumping, either. i don't really see that as homophobia?
this whole post is fucking ***drenched*** in satire. i love it...
lawrence, windsor, and obergefell have all been announced on june 26th (2003, 2013, 2015).
i never thought of it like this! i always wondered just how some people could be so scared. this sums it up entirely. wow.
he might has well have gone full peter griffin, "yes, i found the opinion of justice kennedy to be shallow and pedantic."
i recently went to a stag weekend (us translation - bachelor party i guess? i'm british..) for a gay friend of mine who is getting married this summer. the amount of adult colleagues i have who joked about this and found this notion hard to comprehend really surprised me. they were all like, "oh, so which one is being the bride?" and "so does the other one have a hen do? (bachelorette party?)". however, when my ten year old son wanted an explanation of what a stag weekend was, he then asked if my friend's wife-to-be was going to have a party too. i said well, my friend is marrying another man and he is having his own party too. the boy didn't bat an eyelid and was just like "cool". yay for the next generation!
or if you are like me, young straight dude, then it is kind of a "oh, cool... glad we are doing that. alright where are the production reports?"
it's de jure not illegal, but it is de jure illegal to make it de jure illegal, which makes it de facto legal. can we agree on this?
always felt gop really effed over romney, in reality he's much more moderate but they made him toe the party line.
when was negatively affecting the citizenry ever a concern?
precisely. basically, the analysis went like this: 1. did the government infringe... (yes.) 2. ...a fundamental right of a class? (marriage: yes.) 3. does the classification further a compelling government interest? (no.) 4. is the use of the classification necessary? (no.) that was basically the path to this decision. the reason that gay marriage passes this hurdle but child marriage or plural (bigamous/polygamous/polyandrous) marriage does not is that the governmental interest in protecting people from abuse and coercion in those situations is far more significant.
dude is june 26th gonna be a holiday in the future?
i once had a fortune cookie tell me an ambition is in reach. few weeks later i received a promotion. point is, don't take fortune cookies lightly.
for some reason "hobophobe" sounds like a scientific word. like something an astronomer would say. can a linguist explain why i feel this way? thanks.
and who has the right, as master of the house, to have the final word at home?
or, even if you're still a young straight dude, it's still exciting that this has finally happened. this is historic.
if i send you 34.0 gold as a gift, i think your opinion of me will be high enough to agree on this.
he was basically a democrat while governor of massachusetts
i think it's because it sounds latiny. source: i ain't a linguist.
or, if you're a young straight dude, but you've always been a little curious, then pm me maybe?
i have a meeting with the bobs in a few minutes. they just got married.
name me keeper of the swans and invite me to your party, then we'll see.
i would say to leave the password as trolling just to see how a public account would turn out... but you already answered the question. someone would steal it.
i don't have parties, i have blots. you're welcome to come as long as you don't get sick all over the place or have sex on the dinner table.
maybe going on a homocidal rampage is a great day for him.
that's fine, as long as his liver, kidneys and heart are all still in good condition.
i was driving my grandma's caddy trying to figure out what the hell kept popping up on the mirror an why. eventually i figured it out. grandma said she never even saw it before.
this... actually made me happy. thank you imnotmarvin
that looks like hawaii and lane splitting is illegal there
about that word, "personification", i don't think it means what you think it means... yeah that's what traffic jams scream to me... "happy"
my thing is i try to stay up without putting my feet down as long as possible. i want to build the balance so i can just come to a red light and sit there without putting one foot down. or sometimes i lean the bike to each side and push up with my leg. can be a decent leg workout since the bike is over 600 lbs, just don't lean too far...
i was bracing myself for a sad truth. thankfully it was just a truth.
another motorcyclist here chiming in. being stuck in traffic on a bike is the worst. you have to be holding the clutch in most of the entire time. often stalling and restarting if traffics not going fast enough. the engine can get very hot between your legs too. i don't think this guy was having as much fun as everyone thinks, he more than likely was super annoyed.
one time when i was stuck in bad traffic i pulled off to the side of the road and pushed my bike along the sidewalk faster than the cars were moving. very satisfying.
i have a big air-cooled v twin....it melts my legs in traffic. i went to france and saw how some people handle their bikes their, even big american bikes.opened my eyes to how freeing riding could be with just a few slight tweaks of the law
was really nervous about getting my bike... do i really want a dangerous hobby? will i keep it up? am i going to keep riding this big ass 1300cc cruiser? after a little riding i realized yes to all 3. so much fucking fun. ever since i've been riding 6 days out of the week on average. this is literally the most fun hobby i've ever had.
i read that as "homosexual rampage" i tried to picture him angrily running about doing bummings.
had to scroll down too far to find this fact lost amongst all the cager posts
while living in hawai'i isn't a guarantee of a great day, we do tend to have very few mass shootings/homicidal rampages.
i've wondered this for a while so it doesn't do much good for people who don't signal
biker in paris (france) here. as long as there's [width of motorcycle + 1 inch] between cars, we definitely squeeze through. and if the oncoming lane is temporarily empty because of how the lights are set up, you better believe we use it.
and it is so common, drivers are more aware of their presence, get over in their lanes to give them space, and are less likely to run them over. but yeah, its dangerous. half the accidents in sd during rush hour are motorcycle involved because the out-of-state transplants haven't quite got it figured out yet.
this is one of the things that as a state we have done very well with.
their civil forfeiture laws are the best in the business.
it must be so frustrating in big city traffic. i can't imagine not 'lane splitting' (we call it filtering) in london. if there's a big queue in america, can you over take the standing traffic and go to the front?
in *most places* in the world, it is. in the usa, it is now explicitly legal in one state (california, previously it was simply not illegal to share lanes) and not illegal in one other state (possibly new jersey, but i don't remember), but the police there will ticket you for failure to maintain control, illegal land change, or whatever else they feel like.
the only time commuting on a motorcycle sucks is the rain or 110+ temps. actually had a gas fountain once from my tank because it was so hot.
bam, badam, bam bam bam, badambambam, bam bam bam bambambam, badam, braap braap wrooooooom
i sometimes do the same thing. however, instead of doing motorcycle leg press, i see how few foot taps i can use to stay upright.
this is where i feel much joy in having a scooter
and im sure the commuters were getting pissed, thinking you were 'breaking the rules'
and roundabouts are fantastic! it just keeps people moving which is great. the feeling of ridding through an entire town and maybe hitting one traffic light or stop sign is surprisingly satisfying.
out of curiosity, how did you start? i've thought about getting one, but it seems like anyone i know that rides a motorcycle learned how to ride it from using dirt bikes as a kid; i don't know how to learn as an adult.
"sorry officer, i didn't know i couldn't do that!"
omg you ride a motorcycle. do you know that you're going to die? /s welcome to reddit.
you know what that means, a whole afternoon at blitz and chiiiiiiiipz!
i moved to town 3 years ago and it was the best decision of my life. those h1 westbound delays going home nearly drove me insane!
are you a man or a woman? i pictured a dude the whole time until "cute little wave". now i am uncertain.
mine will also beep if i'm moving toward whatever is in my blind spot (as in, changing lanes) regardless of whether i have the turn signal on.
wait...did you just say that it's not allowed because people don't know if it's allowed?
exactly. without lanesplitting you might as well just use a car and sit in a comfy seat listening to the radio. lane splitting **is** the reason for commuting by bike!
that's almost exactly how it is written into law in california now.
it's mostly the dumb asses that go too fast. you have to go slow enough that you have enough reaction time to stop for a guy switching lanes. of course then you get those guys driving sport's cars in rush hour traffic thinking that split second lane change will save them 3 seconds on their commute.
in france it only became legal recently. it was tolerated and never enforced, as i drive in paris i'm afraid i will kill one some day. they are so many bikers and scooters it can be very stressing
you only gotta burn your leg once on the engine to never wear shorts on a bike again, especially if your sitting in traffic like this guy.
shit i use a cheap pair of earbuds. tried buying a bluetooth helmet radio but the prices were too hi for me.
i'd like to add exhibit 3: under 20 degrees is pretty miserable if you don't have the right gear and damn that shit is expensive
this is reddit, i'm pretty sure most people here are afraid to go outside.
it's more than just boring, stop and go traffic is a pain with a manual transmission, especially on a motorcycle. maybe that guy is happy, but i've been in that situation, showing off similar moves, going completely insane while i try to convince myself breaking the law and lane splitting isn't worth the ticket.
there are courses you can do where i live (then you do your license test with them). all adults when i did mine. never rode anything until i was 29.
if it isn't benefiting you in some way whats the point?
i actually have always wanted to learn to ride a motorcycle but always been a little scared of being hit by someone not paying attention and thrown 20 feet. but i guess that's not very likely to happen. yes i am a naturally paranoid person.
this comment just made me realize the dude from rugrats was named dr. lipschitz. like, lip shits. i was running around saying lip shits for hours. for those wondering how the hell it made me think of that, i think it's the z at the end of chipz that sounded similar in my head.
so those were two separate instances? yeah i want to ride but living in florida, it's just not a good idea.
we're talkin' a full grown ass man doing something reminiscent of the little rascals' signature wave here.
scrolled back up to see a hawaii license plate....i've never seen one, and for a brief moment wondered why. then i remembered.
the real issue for me is that it's been illegal for so long, it'd require a huge public education campaign just to keep drivers from intentionally ramming bikers. people are assholes.
tbh, a few bad motorcyclist give the rest of us casuals a bad reputation.
that bill did not pass, and it was for riding on the shoulder of the leftmost lane of multi lane, divided highways. did not pass, still illegal. however there is another bill being submitted for this year!
i actually got a bluetooth set up separately and installed it in the helmet. they are spendy though, my ear buds kept coming loose in my helmet and it was soooo frustrating.
to me it is worth the risk. imo *most* accidents can be avoided with good riding technique, the key factor being awareness. assess the conditions and ride accordingly. a safe rider takes every possible precaution to be visible, yet must assume that they are invisible. at the end of the day, speed is always a factor. just because you have right of way doesn't necessarily mean you should maintain your 55 in a 45 as you approach an intersection with cars waiting to turn. anyways, if you decide it's your cup of tea go ahead and look up the smidsy weave. can't tell you how many times it's helped me. and in case anyone is feeling argumentative, loud pipes save lives.
"i'm so depressed, lonely and anxious. i'm a super big introvert lol. i hate that i've never had a girlfriend. i hate this so much!" "have you tried going out more and putting yourself out of your comfort zone until you're eventually desensitized?" "that sounds dangerous. i better ask my mom if this is safe. she said it sounds too risky." that and there's the parents who raise these kids to be frightened all the time and to reject anything that makes them slightly uncomfortable.
i don't imagine pushing a vehicle is illegal. some roads have a minimum speed, but that's out the window in a jam. i'm wondering about pushing it on a sidewalk.
takes my mind off real life, as pathetic as it sounds, it's like an ego boost every time somebody upvotes my submission, even if it isn't content i created.
he's on a honey pot but he may not find the target... appealing
as somebody who has been hit and flung 20 ft from a motorcycle, it is worth it. i had to sell my bike that was getting old anyways, but as soon as i have the money i'm getting another one.
well that just sounds like a really nice group of cyclists who do good deeds.
you think that's cheaper? you're on an island. everything is shipped in. almost nothing is made locally.
plenty of awesome local fast food/mom & pop kitchens that are a much better value in the area.
i saw one in massachusetts, i have no idea how the fuck that happened. did they move and ship their car? did i catch it in the tiny window before they need to change plates? were they just fucking with everyone? so many questions.
ohhhh shit i do the same thing. luckily i have the "tetris" dubstep remix on my phone for aggressive drum soloing at traffic lights/parking lots/traffic stops. that and when the lsd really kicks in and you find yourself stopped, naked on your motorcycle that just turned into a scooter, waiting for the cop to write the damn ticket. lpt: when you are naked you can use your penis as a convenient third drumstick.
had a vespa in the past, and sometimes had to push it because *italians invented electricity* and it would simply stop working properly. the police were only ever curious if they could help me; never were upset.
i think the surprising part is not only does that gif exist, but there happened to be someone in comments section that saw that comment, that knew about that gif, and was able to post it in less than an hour.
i think you watched neon genesis evangelion by accident.
i have no idea why you got down voted. you're right. it's exactly why comparing traffic deaths to airplane crashes is kind of stupid.
there's no way hawaii doesn't have local coconut milk
i've known several people who moved to and from hawaii in the early 90's. each did it by renting a shipping container and filling it up with everything they owned/wanted to bother taking; each of them also put their cars in the containers. no idea what the real logistics of this are or if people still do it.
i just picked up an fz09... i'm not expecting to make it to the end of the year before i kill myself but it sure will be fun.
the spooky forest so when i was a kid, maybe 13 or so, i used to go camping a lot with my folks. one time, there was this really spooky thing that made me never want to go camping again. i've already spent a lot of time writing tonight, so i'll get to it later. sorry guys!
all of the coconut milk i've seen in hawaii is a product of thailand or elsewhere. :( you can get fresh coconuts on the side of the road and drink the coconut water, but i have not seen any local coconut milk for sale aside from some restaurants having "house made coconut milk" as an ingredient. even the hawaiian sun brand, which is packaged in honolulu, is made from imported thai coconut.
they still do it. source: helped my brother-in-law unload a massive shipping container from hawaii.
i had no idea it was so cheap. thanks for the info!
might as well sell your front wheel for some extra cash, as you won't be needing it
and at least she's wearing suitable clothes. the amount of people i've seen riding around in shorts and singlets recently is ridiculous.
i love drinking coconut milk fresh out of a coconut and then eating the coconut meat from the inside. a+ snack.
jeans and a hoodie aren't really suitable riding gear. but i assume he stretched, slammed and put that fat ass tire on for looks and isn't doing top speed with a passenger on the back...
maybe there relationship was going to fast and she wanted to slow the things down a little bit
well that tire is definitely flat spotted. those tires are not cheap.
yeah, that looks painful as all fuck. chripes almighty.
what you drank straight out of the coconut was coconut water, coconut milk is made using the desecrated flesh from the coconut.
absolutely. all jokes aside, this technological capability may be huge for animal conservation. let's hope it takes hold, and serves to undercut the illegal market. maybe in 10 or 20 years from now, we will see this market completely destroyed. we can hope.
if that works people will do it though. store owners will buy the fake stuff at 1/8 price and then sell it to people at full price. rhino poachers still won't be able to sell to store owners unless they really undercut the price. people are wondering "what if store owners buy the real thing and really advertise that they have the real stuff?" but the beauty of it is that if you can't tell the difference, store owners with the fake stuff will just lie
because nobody is going through all that trouble just for the sake of altruism. they want the publicity.
can you print a dinosaur horn? the magical benefits should be even greater and eventually the chinese would try to poach jurassic world.
it's ok, one day we'll just 3d print the rhino back from extinction.
ivory comes from tusks/teeth, which are formed by dentine, a bone like tissue. rhino horns are solid keratin (unusual among horned animals), which is what forms your hair and fingernails.
oh yes because a western nation getting the chinese people hooked on opium worked out so well the last time we did it
i agree that this is really the key point, the plan only works well if their horn is indistinguishable from a real horn.
you pay me enough money and i'll walk around with a pack of rhinos and snipe any mother fucker that comes close to them, sell their bodies to science and make a poaching science museum to where people and come and see all the failed attempts at being a complete asshole
pretty easily actually. two things to consider: 1. 3d printing techniques are not flawless, a look under a microscope can reveal the the layers of the printing process. 2. as the lab claims, these synthetic horns are more 'pure' than real rhino horns. there are many reagent tests that can determine if a contaminate is present. if the test comes back negative for contaminates, it's likely a lab made. tl;dr authenticity can easily and cheaply be proven.
are synthetic (not cz but actual man made diamonds) 1/8 the price of normal ones? i can't seem to get a good read on prices from a quick google search
they could be right. i know it's a bit of a stretch, but look at the watch business. before the 70s, mechanical watches were tools. necessary. there was a whole market of those tools. then the quartz crisis happened, where it became possible to make cheap watches that were even more accurate. of course that undercut completely the companies making mechanical watches. those companies repositioned onto the high-end, the luxury market. now, mechanical watches have never been so expensive. those companies make great results. now back on the rhino. you might change the poacher's market from a basic merchandise one, to a luxury one. and their profits would soar.
i don't think that will be the case. the horns have no actual medicinal properties, what the customer wants is a horn that came from a rhino.
sell horns to poachers. they'll provide as much proof of authenticity as ever at far less personal risk
the art market will love it as well. i love doing scrimshaw but it is pretty much illegal to get any horn or tooth which makes it incredibly hard to keep the art up. a legal set of teeth (small whale) can cost upwards of 500 to a grand. so if they did this with tusk or teeth and the price dropped 1/8 it would be amazing. instead of a $800 paying $100 would definitely shift a market. there will always be people who prefer 100% real, but meh.
right, if you are selling parts of an endangered and illegal to hunt animal you likely have no issue lying and saying your cheap ass fake stuff is totally legit.
also i'm pretty sure there are laws that were lobbied into place by the diamond cartels that ensure artificial diamonds must have identifying marks. i don't think the poachers will have that sort of influence, but who knows? power structures are often much crazier than they appear to be at face value.
a lot of prohibited substances are already synthetically manufactured, though, and the reason they're not always pure is because there aren't legit operations doing the manufacturing, i.e. because they're banned. even in the absence of actual safety regulations, simply ending the ban would probably result in somewhat better products due to market forces alone, as it would be easier for information to spread about which producers are reliable - though of course this is still vastly inferior to government certification. at any rate, better manufacturing might reduce a few minor safety problems but would still leave the big glaring problem of addiction or whatever other harm those drugs do in uncontrolled doses, which is why they're prohibited.
yes, it's different, but the difference works the opposite of how you're claiming it would. the fact that cocaine actually does something means that pure synthetic cocaine will have a more meaningful competitive advantage, because it'd work better too.
exactly. if i ever invent something awesome i'm sure as hell not going to just not take any credit for it.
i would highly doubt it. while it might not explode, they will have more than 90% of the supply of these horns if they stock pile a bunch before they start selling. not only would it sell well to the medicinal market, because it will be ivory. but to collectors of art and artists/instrument makers this stuff will be bought like candy.
not rats. i mean, they are occasionally pets, but they're mostly pests and test dummies.
fingernail palace just doesn't have the same appeal
well, it actually did work well for britain before. they got hongkong for 100 years. not sure if they could pull it off again though.
"you pay me enough" your plan was doomed in the first 4 words.
yeah, the "as pure as that of a rhino of 2,000 years ago" part is marketing's way of spinning the fact that these are very basic imitations of a rhino horn lacking many of the features that lend to true authenticity. regardless, i hope it works.
in my brief google searches they seemed on par in cost with real diamonds. go figure.
they already are a luxury market item. they are priced very high, otherwise poachers wouldn't risk it.
the customer is looking for a horn that came from a rhino because they believe it has medicinal/aphrodisiac properties. sure, all of us in the first world know it has no real value, but in less educated places, they truly do believe it helps them.
best idea in this thread. sell them at or near cost to as many poachers as you can find.
just because china is happy to sell knockoffs doesn't mean they're happy to buy knockoffs.
you need to do both, though. poachers will poach for as long as they can sell the horns, meat, whatever, if they can do it with impunity. it's a way to make a living in a particularly desperate region of the world.
the point is they can't tell. they are not flooding the market with horns labeled fake, they are gonna sell all fake horns as poachers and claim they are real.
if we are able to print ivory, it allows for things not possible with natural ivory such as eventually printing a 3'x3'x3' solid ivory block. imagine what you could make with that.
what i would do for a new spine. if the fake disk tech is up to ar and they can undo my scoliosis spinal fusion.... i would take all that pain over again and weeks(even months if need be) in the hospital to have a new spine.
unless the cops come in case it's absolutely fake and you're just trying to help
unless i have a lot to gain for myself by doing so
what's the deal with the fukushima fall out stuff? are they getting rhinos from japan?
arm them with them with the capacity to inject poachers with potent laxatives while you're at it. give poachers the payload they deserve.
they are bragging about their ability, they didn't say the ones that would flood the market would be made pure. anyways, rhino horn isn't sold to the consumer as a giant horn, it's in a "medicine". i doubt they are flooding the market with artificial cubes of rhino horn. i'd guess they'd process it as medicine and flood with that.
rhino horns are made of the exact same material has human fingernails and hairs. how someone can still believe that stuff to cure anything or have magic power in this day and age is beyond all logic.
so then the production will explode too. the biotech company will make lots of money as well. win win.
the microscopic ones used for powertools are cheap as fuck. large diamonds used for jewellery are prohibitively expensive.
when i looked for my wife's ring it was about 2/3 the cost. so i could have gotten a better cut but when you're already spending that much i might as well get the real thing. now if it were half the price then i'd look more seriously at the man made ones. (i mostly looked at the gemesis diamonds)
my wife's fantasy world in her head has been built up by every woman in her family, friends, fairy tales, disney, movies, books, the media... etc. i tried to convince her that it's just a rock to no avail. to some women there's an implied meaning behind real diamonds.
it is there and a lot of industrial applications use the cheaper man made option.
they don't want the meat. they want ivory and horn, it's been like that since the 1800's. kill the elephants and rhinos, saw off their ivory and horns, and sell them to wealthy people. meat rots and needs storage and can only be sold locally. why eat rhino when you can eat cow? this is an utterly brilliant plan. remember, plastic killed demand for ivory (piano keys and billiard balls).
they also kill the rhino so they don't waste time tracking a rhino with no horn. i read something about dyeing the rhino's horns so poachers wouldn't be able to use them but they'd kill them anyhow so they wouldn't have to be fooled by it again.
who is "they"? there is nothing in this article to suggest that this lab is going to get involved in the business of laundering their fake horns. in order to do so they would have to deal with the criminal underworld elements that run the trade. the article even mentioned a beer with rhino horn. sounds like they are trying to market this product as a rhino-friendly alternative. and that probably won't work.
this. let's say i can but a real horn for $800 and sell it for $1,600 or i can buy a gmo horn for $100 and sell it for $1,600. 10/10 i'll sell the
they will find a way. diamond dealers have found a way to distinguish synthetic from mined diamonds with at least some degree of probability even though they are chemically identical and produced by the same physical process.
for the entire part. diamonds are common in nature; de beers only sells a tiny fraction of their stockpile to keep prices stable.

well you can always show the receipt to the cop to prove you bought your fakes from a lab.
i've read that all organic things which lived and died before the first nuke tests can be identified by lack of fallout. stuff spreads, not just dangerous stuff but different alletropes of carbon and nitrogen and living things absorb them and now the ratios are out of whack. fukisima is just the most recent addition of this fallout.
thank you for that, i can just picture some poacher dropping his 50 cal and bolting for the bushes.
what they really want is the "magic" of a rhino horn. if they really wanted the keratin they could chew their fingernails.
also makes up reptile scales and claws and bird feathers, claws, and beaks. porcipine quills too. stuff is everywhere.
and one can only hope that they spend part of their earnings into protecting rhinos, given the higher demand side effect they will create.
only because debeers wants to guilt you into handing over your pay for two months straight.
the real thing is, in most cases, unethical and disgusting.
honestly, a flawless synthetic diamond, to me, is *more* impressive than one dug out of the ground. anyone can do the latter; the former is a declaration of human scientific and engineering achievement.
the demand for ivory continues to be strong, thanks to the chinese. as for this plan with rhino horn, i am highly skeptical. one of the reasons rhino horn fetches such a high price is because of something known as the "anthropogenic allee effect" in which the more rare something becomes the greater the demand because possession of it becomes a status symbol. it's not the masses who consume the horn, it's the wealthy. they are likely to be discerning and reject something that is fake. if consumers don't believe that the medicinal value of horn itself is fake, why would they accept the scientific basis for the equivalence of synthetic horn? the only way this would work is if the synthetic horn was laundered into the market, but i doubt this lab is going to get involved in such activities.
yes, but the poachers live until we find a cock merchant.
or just something else that *is* worth getting shot at. we have to think about the reasons they're poaching in the first place, if you wanna go down this road.
i read that the dyeing doesn't penetrate the horn completely so the poachers still use the undyed portions
it's only partly a "status symbol". lots of animals go down because of stupid superstitious beliefs and "ancient medicine" nonsense.
but rhinos are currently farmed in south africa. they don't need much of a range at all if they are provided with feed. some south african ranchers have over a hundred rhinos on their property.

rip /u/tang81 killed by rhino horn dealer mid sentence
you're not thinking like a criminal. you're a rhino horn dealer. you get the same knock off stuff as everyone else, but you take a small percentage of it, and claim it's the real thing and sell it for higher prices. "sure, i've got the imitation stuff, right here." looks around, "but if you're interested, i can hook you up with a little of the real stuff." end customers never buy a whole horn, they buy a tiny amount of powdered horn, so they'd have no way to tell. the market being flooded with counterfeits that are indistinguishable from the real thing drastically cuts the price of the real thing. either way, poachers can't afford to sell at the new lower market rates.
de beers, a multi billion dollar group, has exactly two machines in the entire world that can tell a real from a manufactured diamond. and it's not even correct 100% of the time. you really think there's anyone in the horn smuggling network that can do better?
the resale value of an ordinary diamond can be as low as 20% of what you paid for it. sucker's market.

i suspect the poachers will buy these and claim they're real.
i don't think a poacher will risk his life anymore if he is going to be undercut by the dude selling the fake one.
nah, extracted jewellery diamonds aren't really expensive to find, they aren't even rare, but they're sold at exorbitant prices. synthesizing diamonds of that size is legitimately expensive as fuck tho.
not that i heard of when i researched the ring. although i suppose you could buy the man made diamonds separately and have a jeweler mount it. i'd be careful with that since most hate doing that. most make a lot of their money on the stone itself. we got our wedding bands (just gold rings) from ebay and it was only around $100 each. getting my wife's engagement ring sized was $80 by itself. so yeah jewelers charge a lot...
i went through agape diamonds, got a 1 karat ring for around 550, have the certification as well.
100% sure. i'm looking at the certification from american international gemologists right now.
they are also higher quality, a diamond with no defects is worth less because it's synthetic. there's no limit to stupidity.
the shady types who deal in horn would be first in line to sell fakes....if they don't their competitors will so they have to join in to compete on price.....

yeah, but its so expensive now that probably most people don't get to adequately test for themselves that it works as well as eating your fingernails. if all 2 billion of them had costco sized containers of rhino horn they would find out pretty goddamn quick that its worthless.
"jolly ranchers prove to be effective yeast infection treatment"
you have a reasonable question, but it won't be a problem and here's why: governments tolerate (and even cooperate with) debeers for any number of reasons. in other words, debeers (or opec as another example) are legally and politically sanctioned cartels that nations accept. organized crime in china cannot create an equivalent because the chinese government will happily permit (and even encourage) sales outside of the crime channel. or, here's anther way to look at it: organized crime could control alcohol during prohibition, but there's simply no way for them to do so now because barriers to entry are near zero and distribution is in every grocery store. in other words, the chicago mob could *never* return to the "good old days" of running the booze racket. there's just no way they could possibly buy (and then horde/destroy) enough product to artificially make it scarce again. counterfeiting rhino horn is truly a game changer.
that's assuming poachers get even a reasonable percentage of market rate. i'm willing to bet that flooding the market wouldn't have a noticeable affect on what poachers get per horn. people seem to forget how business works. it won't be the poachers who stop because it isn't worth it, it will be the smugglers and other middlemen if anyone.
the black market also has a habit of getting poor quality goods out there under the guise of being top shelf. it's like when people try to buy ecstasy and sometimes they end up taking bath salts.
are we talking about what is legal or what actually happens?
it was hilarious when manufactured diamonds hit the market, they changed their value system from "color cut clarity" to "the same three c's except not *too* clear because we can't dig up diamonds as clear as they make 'em" i bought my wife a manufacture one, it's so clear it actually glows in the dark for a bit after you turn off the lights because the perfect crystal lattice traps light and slows it's release.
pants and underpants!? is there any barrier you won't smash down?
wait what? this is an actual job that can be actually done for actual money? requirements?
i doubt it considering the plan with these is to flood the market and drive down the cost. if they sold them to the poachers, the poachers wouldn't flood the market so that they could keep prices artificially high. look at debeers and their diamonds.
yeah would it make more sense for said poacher to just become a wholesaler of these synthetic horn, seems safer, more legal, just easier better business
hate to tell you this, but you bought a cz. read the agape website carefully: it says "simulated diamond," not "synthetic diamond." simulated diamonds with moh's hardness of ~8 are almost always some variant of cz, sometimes doped with other elements to change up the physical/optical properties a bit. sometimes it's a moissanite (moh's hardness of 9.25). a **synthetic** diamond will be made of pure carbon and have a moh's hardness of 10, just like a natural diamond.
aig only certify for a few companies such as nexus diamonds, and despite the name and clever marketing nexus diamonds don't actually sell diamonds, not even artificial ones. the stones they produce are physically optically identical (look the same) as diamonds, but they use different chemical elements to make the diamond from what a real or artificial diamond is made from, which is why they are so much cheaper. the certification paperwork will contain an "aig report number" which you can use to find lots more detailed information about your specific stone, should you wish. none of this matters anyway because real diamonds are a complete scam, i never advise people to buy them.
i was not expecting diablo 2 references in this thread.

that is *awesome*. strictly better *and* cheaper? sweet!
hey vazquez, have you ever been mistaken for a man?
or pose as poachers selling them to whoever the poachers buy from. i don't think they care if the poachers keep the price artificially high, as long as the poachers not flooding the market are doing so with fake horns. i.e., we now have poachers who sell 100 horns a year. if you get those poachers to buy 100 fake horns and sell them each year, because they're cheaper than actually poaching, then rhinos win. if you have authorities pose as poachers and sell them to the medicine men (or whoever poachers sell to) then you also win.
poacher and wholesaler do not require the same skillsets. these guys will just find some other way to live.
well, i think diamonds are worthless outside of industrial uses, and thankfully many of my generation agree. i can only hope that culture will destroy debiers or however you spell it.
good thing i have all this *water that's from the mouth of the ganges river up in the himalayas*, step right up and get some magic water folks
yea, this is a problem and i know what you mean... but. if fake horns are all over the place, then it won't be such a big deal for the rich to have a "real" horn as they are indistinguishable. the rich will just stop buying them once they realize that they don't know if they are getting the real thing. it isn't a 100% thing, but i think it has a high probability of at least fucking up the market to a point where no one cares about that horn anymore
this is your department chair. what i have i told you about being on reddit when you are supposed to be writing publications and grants. get back to work.

this is true with most leaders, but it is more so with trump since he lost the popular vote.
it was legal to travel to iran. it came with its own risks, sure, but it was legal for americans to do so. i think this story had to do with something political, as i remember the government stepping in specifically to deny visas and there being some local outcry. if it makes you feel any better, iran has since stated that it will end issuing visas to americans.... in response to trump's ban.
if we judge all the people of iran by the actions of their government, then the entire world should judge us on the actions of ours. i don't know about you, but i don't want to be associated with trump, strike drones, or warmongering. i wouldn't want to be banned from another country because trump is a buffoon and an idiot with no mental filter.

yup. the runner could come in dead-last and it would still be posted all over social media and tv.
it's also extremely easy to just paint iran as an evil theocracy and completely skipping over why it's an evil theocracy. it's obviously impossible to prove, but i honestly doubt it would have ended up as such, if it weren't for us meddling westerners. it's also fairly easy to see why iran isn't exactly trusting towards us or our ideals. sure, we *preach* that we want democracy, but when that gets in the way of our money or resources, you're going to end up with a nice, brutal military dictatorship instead. this does not, of course, alleviate the iranian theocrats from any of their responsibilities in the slightest, but to a certain degree it's like repeated kicking a dog and then only blaming the dog for biting you.

no. i think it's against the constitution to bar a u.s. citizen from entering the u.s. he now might not be able to get into iran though.
i think all the people who voted for trump just because they didn't want to vote for hillary are kicking themselves right now. the people who voted for trump because they actually wanted to, though... they're happy as clams, largely because they have absolutely no idea how things like trade agreements and international politics will affect them on a very real level.

i commented earlier today that immigrants are some of the most american people you'll meet. people want claim to want them to assimilate, and they do and excel. only then people say they're stealing american jobs. if for some reason they can't get a job, then they're accused of being lazy mooches stealing for taxpayers. it's sad. when people want to come here and build a better life, we should take it as a compliment and help them if we can, not spit in their face. it's like being born into a family you didn't choose and then making a family of choice. of all the places in the world, canada, the uk, france, germany, they're saying they want to come *here*. maybe i'm just idealistic, but to me, that's a special kind of love and patriotism.
it goes back way, way farther than any of that. this goes back to the fall of the ottoman empire and beyond. our presidents are mostly dealing with the fallout of much earlier decisions, it's unlikely there was ever going to be "good" outcomes no matter what course of action was taken.
no one is arguing against you! you are right about that! that is true, we should stop! ...but in the mean time, can we please help the children and innocent humans that need to get out of those countries?

more like ashamed of your fellow americans who voted in the current government.
my fat ass just got an idea...that i stole from you.
iran once had democratically elected, secular government in the 1950s. but when that government wanted to nationalize the oil industry, which would hurt bp's profits, the cia staged a coup. the monarchy in iran then became a lot more monarchistic. the king of iran used secret police to wipe out political opponents.
that's either ireland or ivory coast i think you're thinking of. close though it's red, white and green with a symbol in the middle.
no aliens colonel marines was terrible. nms was just sad.
oh my god, did you just say a serious musician? can i borrow that outfit for an audition? the role is for a "serious firefighter".
i live in california and its the only pronunciation i ever hear used in person. the "i ran" one, i mean.
if by "buddies" you mean they have been buying our politicians for years then yeah, the saudi royal family are our "buddies".
if he does have dual citizenship then he should use his iranian passport to get into iran and his u.s. passport to get back into the states. but really, he probably shouldn't leave/have left at all.
i am one of those people, and i readily admit it. it was my first election as well, and my parents are hardcore trump supporters- they're giddy about what is happening, and i find it difficult to hide my disgust. the events unfolding are absolutely horrendous, and if i could take back my vote and cast it again, i would. i'm sorry, america.
non-us dual citizens. i.e. iranian-canadians are banned.
the ottomans were broken down so the british could take their oil, and here we are over a hundred years from ww1 still fighting (mostly) over oil.
the only people i personally know are persians that have left the country and they hate the regime deeply. and wasn't there more and more reports that iranians youth are very critical of the religious rules and revolts against it on social media.
i blame the wicked leaders more than the manipulated people. they want us to fight with this "other side" instead of fighting the power. my focus will stay on the corrupt power rather than demonizing my brothers and sisters.
while this is true, mossadegh muhammed was consolidating power into his own hands as he absolved the parliament.
now if americans could just learn how to pronounce "wrath" . . .
yeah from california too and i can confirm i say it as "i ran" as well
that's because it is. the proper way to pronounce both countries is "ee-rock" and "ee-ron."
the problem i think is that iran doesn't recognize dual citizenship.
and the idea is that the legal ground in which they can detain you is very shaky once that lawyer starts lawyering around with his lawyer powers. "why is my client here?" "uhh, because he's a muslim" *attorney boner*
don't know about eu, but if you ask the cbp officer to stamp your passport, he'll do it. source: am a cbp officer
ianal, but as border control is part of the executive branch, trump can do this. congress can sign a bill overruling the president, but won't. the scotus can order an injunction.
but if you have us citizenship the us can't deny you entry.
the order seems as vague as fuck. i hope you and your dad are ok.
but trump literally said he would do all these things in his campaign...
for them it's like a game of football, conservatives vs liberals. it's not about what's in the best interests of everyone, it's just about winning.
trump is absolutely the antithesis of what christianity claims to be. it boggles my mind.
i really dropped the ball with first far-right in office it seems. i did not realize they were far right, i thought they are simply conservatives. apparently i need to pay more attention. also, that isis is using trump makes perfect sense. these right wing populists play their part in the plans of isis. there is no crusaders versus jihadists without crusaders.
i was there a few years before the civil war started. damascus was gorgeous and fun. there were great restaurants and lots of really friendly, welcoming people. very religiously diverse. lots of artists and students. but you could feel the crush of the government on you on every turn. posters and murals of the assads everywhere. secret police. social media and phone calls were known to be monitored.
"in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."
it can go back farther than that too. the middle east is a prosperous land, and the land where civilisation was essentially born. war has raged there for essentially all of documented human history. it can genuinely be argued that we should be blaming the mess of the middle east on the assyrians or the babylonians.
i certainly hope that's the case, but i've heard some version of the same song for about the last 30 years, and it never seems to amount to anything. iran's government is smart enough to provide the occasional safety valve for dissenters, and elections with enough pseudo-legitimacy to satisfy people who don't care about politics all that much (which is most of us). and, of course, they capitalize on iran's external enemies to build internal support.
no good reason? seriously? fiat copy/pasted the mx-5 interior into the new 124 spider. if that isn't enough of a reason to ban them, idk what is.
i met a total douchebag from iran at a bar and i pronounced it as "i-ran", he was really cool about it and understood we say it wrong a lot, it told me it was important to him to say it right because he could've easily just kept on being a jerk, ended up being a pretty cool guy
neither does the u.s. but in the u.s. it's just u.s. citizenship that matters.
yeah without congress it would have to go to the supreme court as (at least in part) a violation of due process. trump's got the next nominee who will most definitely back trump's agenda in every shape and form. it would be up to the other conservative judges to see if they are willing to sell their soul to the devil.
iran doesn't revoke citizenship so this is just insane
maybe they were so used to campaign rhetoric that they didn't take him seriously.
it would have been better if they had realized before they voted.
i saw on the news once about a woman and her husband who were on obamacare, who voted trump. she was so worried they were gonna lose their insurance. when asked why they voted for him when one of his campaign promises was to repeal obamacare, she replied "i didn't think he was really gonna do that."
i'm participating in every election i can, local, state, and nationwide.
this is what i keep wondering. how are people suddenly surprised?
trump is very unpopular with younger demographics, though.
i'm having a little difficulty forgiving the people that voted to have my health care and rights stripped away from me
literally saw an /r/conservative thread hit /r/all today where a top comment was happy about being at a southern college because the liberal:conservative ratio was about even. they literally see it as a game with *teams that are supposed to be even*
"i love the taste of liberal tears" as he blows his load in their mouth.
wonder what would happen if he was denounced by the pope. oh, wait...
thank you. i love a little douglas adams, and it really made this thread seem less depressing.
there were long period of peace and hegemony in the middle east too, just as in europe. the last period of peace was under the tight control of colonial powers though. those colonialists destroyed local administrative powers and draw non-sensical borders. when they leaved, those became major sources of conflict.
i loved that they tied in lazlo at the rock station after gta 3 had him on talk radio mentioning how he was fired from it. amen to the soundtrack as well.
seriously. wtf world? some (literally most) things go beyond government.
republican politicians have shown us in 2016 that they have no spine. in general i have far more confidence in (and respect for) the supreme court than i do in congress, but i don't even know what to think at this point. we're already seeing lawsuits crop up over this executive order. hopefully they're able to make their way up through to courts so that we can kill this thing before things get to crazy.
i mean, he hasn't done anything he didn't campaign on. if you voted for him, you pretty much said, "i can stomach this." curious why /u/rjd20 is having such a change of heart now.
i commend you for coming out and being honest about voting for trump and how you've almost immediately come to regret it. even if in 2 or 4 years he's gone, i'm just afraid that this erratic behavior will have longer lasting and damaging consequences. man, what a time to be alive that i have to say donald trump is president.....
i think it is just the echo chamber of reddit, "polls show" seems to be their justification for believing things, trump regret included.
i browse a lot of video game subreddits, and it's basically karma suicide to try and point out that x or y thing may be bigoted or isn't diverse or whatever (even if it's a completely accurate criticism, which it often is). you pretty much just get shit on for being "too sensitive" or "not getting the joke" or some other typical bigoted conservative cop-out.
no... they gop will let him hang himself. when enough of their policies on healthcare, taxation, climate change etc are moving in the general direction they want, at that point, they will swoop in to 'save' us.
unfortunately, rural protestants in america don't think catholics are christians either. i wish i were kidding.
i never actually got what the correct name was supposed to be for that one
well, he said it was his first election and his parents are heavy trump supporters. sounds like he may have felt pressured to vote likewise, or he just trusted that trump was the right choice because of what was being said in the household.
is impeaching trump something that we want though? wouldn't that put pence in his seat? i can't help but think some house of cards shit is going on
yeah, the echo chamber is pretty effective, i'll give you that. whenever you try to converse with one of his followers they link you to some article or another from a nationalist site to 'prove you wrong'. they're like anti-vaxxers. the media bashing, though, is related to his fragile ego, which he's always displayed openly. his obsession with ratings, his inability to accept criticism, his superiority complex. he's not suddenly a different man now that he's potus. this is what they voted in.
i find that to be the case on a lot of places on both sides of the social/political spectrum. if it doesn't fit with the rhetoric, even if it's and accurately represented fact, they'll respond the the generic "you're a racist/femnazi"
yeah. i don't have a lot of hope that congress will impeach him, but his arteries... i'm not saying i'm hoping he dies, but we can admit the likely results of his lifestyle as surely as we could admit that he probably wouldn't make 8 years if he was into parachuteless skydiving.
i literally downloaded the entire v rock track list with commercials and everything and burned it to cd as a teenager to keep in my first car because it was that fucking awesome. lock up your daughters. shoot your sons ("dad....!"). cuz love fist is coming to town.
that was the consensus of a few of my older friends, but most of my family believes this election means a new, greater america.
if we were to impeach trump for breaking his oath of office, we could also call for pence to resign as vp, though he's not obligated to agree to it. then the speaker of the house would get it, and paul ryan seems like a pretty level-headed guy to me, if perhaps lacking in integrity. having trump get impeached would probably scare pence enough to not act too far out of line.
might i ask where you were able to find said track list?
it really is much much harder than most people realize. i reassessed my views both religiously and politically about 5 years ago. was brought up with super christian, bush supporting parents. i had uncle's who wanted to "make the middle east a glass factory" (nuke the whole place) i was even getting this everyday at the christian school i was attending. being force fed a diet of anti-democrat rhetoric along with anti-acceptance sprinkled on top finally just stopped making any sense. i call my self a moderate now. i voted forhillary clinton . but i have to tell my family and co-workers it was johnson because i could not stand the constant everyday harassment about my choice if they knew who i actually voted for. so yeah not many people completely change their entire core set of beliefs by choice.
and therein lies the problem - we're now at the point where paul ryan looks like a level headed guy. a few years ago he was the fringe of the party...
pence is as fundemental as religious zealots in this country get in the public sector. he is a full messianic end-times nutbag. his idea of the best day we could ever see is the day the earth is engulfed in fire. no shit.
i hear this a lot and i get it, i do. but... no, i don't agree. at all. pence is a predictable opponent. we can see his move and project 10 moves into the future in opposition because he plays the same game his faux family values party has been playing for decades. trump is an utterly unpredictable and dangerous egomaniac. it's a shit sandwich either way, but with trump the shit is of unknown origin and probably contains 11 strains of bubonic plague.
haha, she definitely thinks you called the cops on her. i bet she still occasionally thinks back on your face and internally snarls with loathing.
my office studio was just talking about this, and to my surprise, a coworker said he didn't think it was a big deal cause he's never seen someone need ramp space and "there can't be more than a single person in our state" that needs it. i was aghast and didn't exactly respond politely. i've had friends be affected by that same selfish attitude. people are airheads.
psa: don't drive a vehicle if you don't know how to park between the lines.
blinded by his own self-righteous anger, he failed to see the wheel chair and the lack of legs.
i write these tickets all day long. i generally don't write tickets for permits unless the lot is full but i always cite disabled parking violations
in the us you cannot get a ticket from someone else's picture. the officer has to witness it; because you have the right to face your accuser, that means whomever took the picture would have to be in court to testify.
relevant user name. as a motorcycle rider, i hate when other riders are dicks. parking in those hashs and lane splitting thru all lanes of traffic not just between 1-2 are the ones i hate most
i can't tell you how many times i have slammed my wheelchair into a illegally parked car
shit happens. someone parked in my neighbor's yard. not in the driveway or by the road. but inside the fence right by an apartment complex. the vehicle caused my neighbor to slip, fall, and drop her knife on a tire. twice. fortunately my neighbor was in a forgiving mood and called a tow truck to help with the flat tires.
it's kinda of a normal thing for people with handicaps to have to deal with. my husband is a disabled vet, he can't walk so he uses a huge power wheelchair since his muscles don't work well and of course his vocal cords are paralyzed. we deal with so much shit trying to go anywhere if we didn't make jokes and laugh we would just be angry all the time. i've found most of us (caregivers/spouses and disabled) have just come up with finding the humor in it all just to deal with it. it's more fun to laugh than to be angry anyway!
as a person who needs that space to transfer my wheelchair in and out of my car, i appreciate your candidness. i'm just genuinely curious: what did you think those striped spaces were for? maybe you never stopped to think about it, but i'm just curious if you thought something else.
you made my day with this story. nothing asshole about it, except that guy in the bmw.
wasn't there a part of the driving test about that?
i'm sure you're aware of this, but for others reading that may be thinking about how you could know: some people have "invisible" disabilities. watching them, you may not see them limp, stumble, or appear to need assistance. but they may still have trouble walking distances, as required for the handicap placard (distances vary by location). please don't judge harshly based on assumptions. a different judging based on assumptions: one of my friends does not have use of his legs, and thus uses a wheelchair. he also has an older bmw 8-series. he has a handicap tag. he was once written a ticket for parking in a handicap spot, with his valid tag, with the justification being that a handicapped person couldn't possibly have a car like that. yeah, some people make *really* dumb assumptions about handicapped people.
could be grandfathered in based on when it was designed. if they redesigned the site they might have to then get the new required size stalls
you say "the" as if of course every parking lot has one. but in the real world there almost never is. we wheelchair van drivers have to do the best we can to use whatever is available. even when there is one, it's usually full. it bugs me when my husband is trying to avoid being run over, because we had to take a regular end-of-the-row spot, and we see someone come out whose only need for the crip spot is their big suv full of healthy kids. they may have an invisible disability, but they could use the smaller spot.
if you look even closer it looks like he's got a parking placard for nyc as nypd or some office of the court.
no, the minimum is 60 inches, you need one spot 96 inches wide for a small lot and more required based an total number of spots. some states have different requirements though sorry you are right it's not the van accessible one but if the guy had parked right it would have been ok
if he/she did call the cops on her or tow truck company then good. people should have a little decency.
what i like most about getting an entitled jack ass towed is that unlike useless things like tickets, towing is a great leveller. doesn't matter how well off you are, now you're calling a cab and going to fetch your car. good bye afternoon plans.
"lol we'll come back for you" - ambulance dudes, probably
one person in the state? how can someone be that out of touch with reality?
i remember when i was younger, this new corvette was parked fucking horribly in a handicap spot (no handicapped plates obviously). they must of threw their door open because it caused a major dent in my dad's car door and actually had paint from our vehicle on it. i've never seen a person do so many laps around a car just keying the paint off in rage.
lol, nope. they'll happily tell you they don't get involved in private lot disputes.
same goes for driving. please stay in the dashed lines too. if you need to change lanes then please don't wait to turn on your signal after you decided to cut me off.
just remember not do flatten the whole set. their insurance will cover if it's the whole set, but not if it's just a partial set.
last summer as i was stuck in gridlocked rush hour traffic, i saw a motorcyclist pull off the road, on to the sidewalk, and just fuck off down there until he snuck back in between cars. he did this three times. i've never hated anyone more in a moment than that dude. edited because people think this is totally cool. it's illegal to ride a motorcycle on a residential sidewalk. this particular sidewalk is also fairly busy, and the motorcyclist was swerving around kids waiting at a bus stop/walking down the sidewalk.
i am a right leg below knee amputee. no special set up need. i have handicapped plates on the bike. i love the looks i get when parking the bike in a handicapped spot. wife and i went to get breakfast in an affluent part of town on the bike. i proceeded to park in a handicapped spot and some jerkwad tried to yell at me about it. he couldn't see the plate from where he was sitting. told him to get off his ass and look at the plate. he started to back down and explained that he made legs for people that have lost them. i rolled up the jeans leg and asked him "you mean like this"? he started to really back track. got to talking to him and someone he was sitting with said his name and said wouldn't it be funny if you made one of his legs. raised my sunglasses and said he had made them for me when i was younger. "holy shit how's your mom and your brother."
so can walk with a quadcane. she slams that thing right into peoples cars, at least once with the guy still in the car.
not op but i also didn't know how wheelchair ramps worked until today. i assumed the painted lines were extra room to maneuver for "just in case" scenarios e.g. someone on a gurney. i've just never actually seen someone use a handicapped spot with a wheelchair, only older people (who look like they could use the extra room to get the door open and get out.)
i think most people will not do it on purpose but i've known people who have bought a new car and will intentionally do this to avoid getting a scratch or a dent. if you're that concerned, park in the back of the lot and walk the extra 2 minutes.
how dense does someone have to be to not realise the space is bigger for a reason?
i knew it was for wheelchairs, but i never thought about a ramp coming out the side of a car.
it's disheartening to see someone admit to not knowing something, especially when they seem to appreciate the new knowledge, and then get people being condescending to them about it. this is why we run into so many people trying to avoid owning up to things.
for fucking real! having been driving my cousin's van and a couple of my friends' vans for years i would say about 75% of the time we either end up parking in the very back of the lot so we have some space for the lift/ramp, drop off at the front and then have to go park the van, park in the empty business park across or down the street, or (if it's a particularly cramped lot) have to pull out of a parking stall, post up in the middle of the through path and just unload there before pulling back into the stall or driving away. and i'd say only about 10% of the time it's another van or vehicle that needs the extra space, usually it's a sedan that belongs to a still fairly mobile elderly couple.
exactly. it would be completely warranted. she not only obstructed a handicapped space, she did it while a handicapped person's vehicle was *already parked there*. good for anyone that gets the tow truck in route so that person doesn't have to wait around in order to simply carry on with their day.
depends on the area, but most tow companies won't want to miss out on money like this. some places will have a "no parking - towing enforced" sign somewhere with the towing company's name and number underneath. in that case you could probably just call the company directly. if that's not anywhere you could try calling 311 or your local non-emergency number. they'll get someone out there in a hurry when money is on the line, believe it.
it's instant gratification for me. i like it when entitled pricks get their cars towed- its like the store managers are judge jury and executioners-- i love it!
i always hack up a big loogie into my hand and wipe it under the driver side door handle when i see people park like this.
lol ~~we'll come back for you~~ ftfy source: best friend is paramedic
might be easier to just call a tow truck. requires fewer acting classes.
i imagine a funeral whistle being blown to let people know the casket is being lowered and this is the last chance.
this right here. that wheelchair looks like exactly the tool to damage the bodywork on some self-important clown's vehicle.
yeah my gf has a placard, and on a day where she doesn't need crutches (but still can't walk far) we get the occasional beginning of a lecture which usually ends up with going some distance into: "mind your own business", "at your age you should have learnt not to be a nosy old fuck", "i'm telling you to go fuck yourself because the reason she has this permit is between her and her doctor, and doesn't involve some random nosy cunt". old people especially don't like being called a cunt, especially when done calmly and with a smile.
i do the same. i could be the only car in the back row and somebody will still park right next to me though.
i know people who do that. circle the lot 5 times looking for a close spot when we could have been inside the building already.
"you see what happens larry? this is what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass!"
any normal spot, yes. a handicapped spot? that's the easiest $500 ticket they can write.
what's this signal you mention? are you trying to say i can let other drivers know when i need to change where i am on the road? incredible! why doesn't every car have this /s
there was a parking enforcement reality show called "parking wars." it only lasted a couple seasons but was oddly satisfying.
i don't think this would be a problem, my scoffing at shitty parking is always when i have already parked my car in between two mini-vans. both of them a quarter into my spot, and owned by a lady with a bob haircut named sheila.
there is a lady in my town, who lives near a school, who will take a picture of your car if you even slightly block her driveway. she submits a complaint using the photos to the local pd. pd looks up the license, and sends out court summons. it works for her. she doesn't get anything in return though, she is just a miserable asshole.
the other day i watched a guy on a scooter pull up to a red stop light, get off, push his scooter through the intersection via the cross walk, then get back on and continue on down the road.
i mean, if anything it's kind of a good thing that he had your back. he was more concerned about somebody taking up a handicapped spot. dude obviously cares about his profession.
i believe the new all electric motorcycles no longer have clutches (no gears, and electric motors can come to a full stop unlike gas engines). and electric motorcycles are fun! just a random idea. i still own an old fashion gas motorcycle but keep eyeing the electrics. :-)
"what's it gonna do, paralyse me?" *- paralysed man*
if it's not in the shape of something he'd likely get away with it. the power of the ada is stronger than some people want to admit.
someone.... on a .... gurney. really, a gurney? this is not inside of a hospital, bear.
this happens to me *all the time*! event some people who have handicapped parking permits park on these striped spaces. i think i don't want to believe that there that many morons among us. still want to have faith in humanity, i guess :)
it's not even 2 minutes, for most lots it's around 30 seconds or so. it's crazy what people will do to get a closer spot: the amount of times they'll loop around, or the time they will waste squatting in an aisle until a spot frees up. just drive towards the back & take a spot further away: use less gas, waste less time, have more space getting in and out of your vehicle, and burn six or seven extra calories walking more.
civil engineer here. this is true. it also doesnt look like these are truly legal ada stalls. from the looks of it there is a 6" exposure curb with no ramp up to the sidewalk.
if i were the handicapped person in the scenario i would hope to get there right when the truck has got the car backing out of the spot, so i could know that justice had been served for me. kind of like a "huh well isn't that nice" before i drive off.
it literally takes be 2 minutes. and you can do it while walking. source: i've had a lot of people towed/ticketed
ultra well off people can pop on their iron man suit or radio in their batmobile. afternoon plans: still awesome.
it might dry out before they touch the handle. you should use some automotive grease or something like that instead.
but won't fuck them up psychologically, which is what we're really about here
make sure a "happy birthday mom" cake fell on the pavement too.
it's so they can test their door opening skills on you.
added bonus is the screeching of the tires making you feel like you're in a car chase.
this is what happens when you ~~fuck a stranger in the ass~~ find a stranger in the alps!
no doubt. how is my half blind granny still getting that shit renewed.
one middle finger for left, two middle fingers for right.
it was beautiful.i feel sorry for the posting enforcers though, getting yelled at constantly
i'm strangely alright with this. as long as he didn't inconvenience anyone or break the law.
i agree and he did state that. he also showed ignorance by stating but you ride a harley. i had to remind him that just because i am missing part of my leg doesnt mean i can't do certain things.
"what are you gonna do, stab me?" *- stabbing victim*
first they came for the people who park like assholes in handicapped spots. and it was fine because fuck those guys.
this. i'm in a wheelchair and have a hoist that swings out. need space for it. some have ramps, hoists or can transfer. depends on the disability and if your by yourself or have a helper.
i just don't trust/like being near people, so i just drive straight to the back and pick from the plethora of spots available to me.
the lines are *painted* on the ground. there is no need for classes to learn not to park there.
commercial parking lot person here who has dealt with 50+ assorted ada projects, with many more in planning stages right now. that asphalt is flush to the concrete. they should have bumper blocks so cars don't overhang on the sidewalk or kill someone walking. looks like a northeastern state judging by the blue markings, jacket, and other markings. also they are using older paint specs so it is likely grandfathered in to not require detectable warnings. also the concrete is visibly 10+ years old so it's hard to definitively say one way or another about whether this is compliant by being grandfathered-in or not.
what codes are you using? 2010 ada section 208 always requires accessible stalls.
out of curiosity, who exactly do you call? calling 911 seems to be a bad idea (not an actual emergency), and if you're not in your hometown, you might not know the local pd's number. of course, these days i guess you can just look it up on google maps, but still, is there a more convenient way?
ultra well off people can turn to the stranger next to them and offer $1million to sleep with their wife, get turned down after much soul searching and ask the next bloke to sign the title of their prius for $100k. after realizing the interior smells like bo, the rich person will then punch the handicapped person in the balls and get off with just a slap on the wrist.
people who park like assholes can be summed up in three sentences: they don't know. they don't care. they don't care to know. i honestly don't think that psychologically fucking with these people will have any effect.
sob, "he just beat cancer! oh god, whyyyyyyyyyyy??"
*10 minutes later wife arrives at car* "why is the babies head shaved?"
always happen. i enjoyed the repo shows until they started including the family drama. i just want to watch people get their asses handed to them, not a family grieving because they stubbed their toe.
i was mainly annoyed at having to pass him repeatedly.
came to say you're a badass but actually you come from a lineage of badassedry
ignorance and stupidity overlap a lot of the time, but aren't the same thing.
not as fun. if you want something like that go vlad the impaler style. have them dig a grave and then push them in and have someone else cover it back up.
not sure if cruel but definitely unusual punishment.
i'll let one person in because that's how zipper merging works. unless there's only two guys trying to merge the second guy can get fucked as far as i'm concerned.
depending on which state you are driving in, it can also be the law. in california, both of the drivers, the one already on the highway and the one merging are obligated to slow and allow the merger to be safe.
a nice big fine or car at the impound that will help.
"that cake was for a memorial birthday! his mom just died!"
"because there is no rock bottom in a war of guilt tripping!"
some intersections have a dedicated stoplight state where all the walk signs go up. a few near me in the hospital district.
i just smear magma under there. nothing like reaching to open your door and getting a handful of hot molten magma.
with the dirt from the grave they dug for themselves.
plenty of places where the ramp simply isn't long enough to get up to speed.
but see, they asserted dominance by being ahead, so clearly you lost. /s people who think and behave that way do not think cause and effect further out than a goldfish would be capable.
when i was towing and doing private property impounds i loved the fuck out of taking cars that were parked like assholes blocking handicap parking access.
chickety china the chinese chicken. have a drumstick and your brain starts cricken
tires can explode like that. better to just let all the air out via the valve stem. and then cut the stem.
"oh, i can get charged for vandalism on private property but they can't get a ticket for parking in a handicap space?"
yup, sounds like he's failing to comply with the ada. i mean, it doesn't require that you just paint some special parking spots once and hope for the best. **somebodeh call a lawyeh**
perfect! i put a charge on a car that was parked *across* a disabled bay because he'd run in to get something. someone pulled up to park in an adjacent bay and in doing so blocked this guy in. when he came out, he complained at the driver who'd blocked him in... also, someone parked in one disabled bay and got a charge, then moved to another disabled bay thinking he was free to leave his car wherever he wanted for the rest of the day. guy got two charges that day, and another one the next day. we started putting dates and locations on the fronts of the charges so each marshal knew when the guy had moved and would get charged again. i swear, a week went by when this guy would leave his car and not pay, claiming he could only get one charge. turns out he got a swathe of charges and had to pay them all at once.
there's a highline called wizards cap in smith rock.
i was waiting to see a comment like this, it's a great friend that would drop everything and go on a trip like that. seems like a stand up guy. thank's op, for doing what i have wanted to do for the last few years, because although i'll never do it, i can enjoy your trip vicariously.
thank you! it has really allowed me to kind of 'find myself' after such a turbulent time and i'm now doing plenty of job-seeking with renewed inspiration to spend my time saving up for more experiences like this.
beautiful lyric, and so appropriate. i can't agree more.
we took our sweet time up there, so we got there in about a month. you can do it in two weeks or less.
you guys were awesome! i was so pissed at myself for not getting your photo. thanks again for the awesome hospitality and i hope you found that watch.
do as your ancestors and live the colonial explorer dream.
we've got a bunch of pretty funny video clips, maybe we'll try and edit them together.
i believe it! we heard insane stories up there. for a bike, it's just double dicey... they water whole stretches to make them less dusty, which just makes it like an ice rink to us. so many close calls.
was in vancouver two weeks ago! i'm in the deep south and we had a blast in your city. great people, great views, great fun. will be there again one day.
the cops that kicked us out of stanley park after we extracted one of our newly made drunk friends out of a tree near the seawall told us it was, but maybe that was the last stop only?
i would absolutely love to know the kind of equipment used also!
some incredibly rash and somewhat self destructive choices. we're behind you all the way.
no way! great road. we tried to stay off interstates unless we really had no other choice. it rewarded us with great rides!
i was riding fast in loose, chunky gravel downhill on the dalton highway when a caribou jumped over my fender. couldn't have been more than a foot away from my headlight. if i'd hit him, i would've died. no doubt. that was super dicey. we almost got swallowed by huge potholes a few times. i had my rear tire kick out several times hitting gravel in turns at speed.
hey thanks! i am very happy to be able to share the experience!
yeah had to scroll too far down, to find kudos for his friend.
the last time i was between jobs i just masturbated and watched macgyver reruns. props to you, man.
73 days total, so closer to 10 weeks. i spent almost two weeks fixing up my bike after the run up to the arctic as well as recouping a bit (we went back to skagway). i'm in the process of doing the math of what the exact cost breakdown was...
among some circles, yes. i was tour cycling in tajikistan when i met someone on the way walking from london to beijing. he left with two dogs, one died in turkey, buried it roadside. he still had one, didn't have a chinese visa, in fact, he planned on sneaking into the country the next day. crazy. i met another guy, sailing around the world, massive storm, loses his boat. picked up by a freighter, takes it to italy, decieded to start walking home, first to east asia, then get a boat to alaska, then south to wherever he lived in the states.
i've done the miami to dead horse journey twice. once by myself to "get away" and it took me about 8 days. the second time with my wife, it took us 6 weeks and the best time of my entire life. i cannot wait to do it again one day. i'm moving to south korea in a few weeks but when i get back in a few years it's on!!!
you know, i was pleasantly surprised by that movie. i really liked it.
the only problem with this is that for many people, by the time they can afford to do it, they can't fully enjoy it. traveling the world is probably way more fun and efficient at 25 than at 65.
$40k for a bus driver is a pretty typical salary really.
looks like he also had a 35mm f/1.4 summilux, which is another $5,000.
no worries, i can only imagine it beat sleeping in your tent that night haha. reddits pretty cool, never thought i'd talk to you ever again lol
you went out of your way to crater lake. but i love crater lake so i understand.
lol, well it was technically supposed to end at 11pm.
thanks! i mean, i'm 24 years old, and i'll probably never get a job in academia again because i'm leaving four weeks into the semester, but this girl **broke** my heart, man. so fuck her. i'm going to go enjoy my life instead of sitting around weeping and feeling sick and anxious.
i misread this and thought you said you just masturbated to macgyver reruns. hum.
however much it cost, it looks like it was worth it!
$2.5 million! did you take a taxi? sorry, can't help but be a smart ass sometimes. no need for the k on the end if you added the 0s. $2.5k or $2500.
we did 10325 exactly round trip. we got a chip in our windshield about 100 miles into the alaska highway. we lost a wheel bearing in montana but drove on it until souix falls, sd. and did an oil change in fairbanks. that was it though!
you're right, i keep forgetting since it looks more like bc and less like alberta, which is pretty flat.
it's weird how my broken afrikaans somehow allowed me to understand part of what you were saying!
yeah at that point they're like nervous egoraptor cartoon characters.
you'd have to be crazy good at surviving by your own means. i'd probably die of thirst within a week or so haha.
yeah -- me too. i have $7. and no job. maybe i'm closer than i think!
these are often the sorts of sacrifices that need to be made for life changing journeys.
that's why you save up. no kids. no marriage. no frivolous spending unless it's something you truly want long term. or idk. i'm 20 and i know nothing at this point.
haha, fun story: i left my wallet in chicken, and had to ride that whole highway back and then up to tok again. since it was so straight, i was blasting 120+ down the straight section up to tok and then blew by a state trooper in a 50 zone... he didn't move, thank god...
freelance photographer and filmmaker. i also sold most of my stuff and prepared for nearly a year.
me too! i think it was the nice captions for every pic that let you know exactly what was going on.
it's a crazy world these days! come visit sf and i'll return the favor.
we went out of our way the entire way up - we tried to avoid interstates!
you will, if you go get another degree in the mean time.
yeah, that's a hell of a kit. the job you lost, was it as a photographer of some kind?
i did a road trip after my divorce. i'm from maine, but was living in sc, so i made a road trip down to savannah, then up to maine, and back to charleston, seeing everyone i knew on the east coast. best of luck homie, it's your life, keep living it.
it does look more like bc. in bc we tend to forget that the border between alberta and bc is the watershed. in bc all the water flows into the pacific. in alberta (at least northern alberta) it flows up north.
even as a german speaker i was able to understand most of it. spoken dutch is a different beast though.
are you the ptfoholland from the vids? cool shit! i moved to the states yup!
i didn't even have a wife or a job in the first place! seems like i'm already halfway there!
how much does one of these bikes cost and what kind of gas mileage do they get? i realllyyyyyy want to do something like this at one point.
the problem isn't money, its that once you get the money to do these things you usually have too many responsibilities and obligations to just leave for weeks at a time.
about your leica and lenses - i own a 5d mark ii, which i saw your friend uses. 1) are there any comparable lenses you would recommend that would be appropriate for similar shots as yours? 2) can you go into more detail about the contax zeiss primes your friend uses? currently i'm just using the 24-105mm f/4 l that came with my camera. thanks!!
"i left my wallet in chicken...." i would have been completely satisfied if just that bit was the story.
hey thanks man! it's a bit hard to answer all the comments but i damn well try!
me three. this is the first large album i've made it through.
become a freelancer and you can just kind of come and go as you please so long as everything is done.
camera-quality aside, there's some great composition, here. i can't imagine there wasn't post-processing touch-up, too. saying the camera doesn't negate their skill. it's just i know my low-end dslr can't hit those colors... would love to know what it is.
my friend rides a klr650, i ride a used (20,000+ miles) gt1000. hardly the most expensive bikes in the world. i sold off all my photographic gear to buy an m. i saved up for a long time to go on this trip. we are by no means rich. though, the ride made us rich as far as experiences go.
makes me want to marry a motorcycle, divorce it, then marry something more practical like a compact sedan.
no, i was a designer, but i have been into photography for about ten years and sold all my old gear for one.
did you happen to take a photo of this magical place? :d
just lose your trip to alaska so you can get a job and wife then post pics riding them
congratulations you have been randomly selected to answer a few questions. please come with us /u/highsorcerer
thanks for the upvote, but i'm not even sure what this means? in jamaica, a peenie wallie is what they call a fire fly/lightning bug. it's also a drink down in jamaica. i was walking down the beach in jamaica and this bottle washed up on the beach that says "peenie wallie", and we kept asking everyone what it meant. they always laughed, and it was hard to get a straight answer from anyone they laughed so hard. eventually, what i got is this: 1) peenie wallie is what they call a firefly/ lightning bug...the insect that lights up at night. 2) the peenie wallie drink is a peanut-liqueur that has the same name, but it's also supposed to be sort of like an aphrodisiac. (the lightning bug is trying to attract a mate with the flashing light...)
my buddy's klr650 did 60 mpg with more economical gearing and shouldn't be more than $2-3k with a non-salvage title!
it's some great storytelling. when i started reading, it was at ~7000 upvotes. now it's at 8359! amazing.
it seems like they've used alienskin exposure/topaz labs along with knoll light factory for the editing.
ah, cool. i was only kinda being sarcastic/jealous of you guys :)
motorcycles are fun when you're young but when you want to settle down and have a family you're going to want to find a nice compact sedan or mini van with their priorities straight.
who knows! i hope this post gets some attention so we can see if anyone still wants a book.
i can vouch. i checked out /r/dualsport. now i have a dual sport.
well i said 2.5mil each, so we'd be covered for a little while.
no, you misunderstand. he comes into your work and shits on your boss's desk, then tells your boss that you paid him to do it.
man... fuck... this post makes me miss my bike... fuck
i want to drive my car up there and drive as fast as it will go
where did you pull that from? not challenging, just curious.
i would certainly purchase the book if you guys have extra copies that you are selling.
i went halfway in a truck and it cost about 800 for gas and food. between three people it wasn't too bad. next time i'll have to cross the second border.
'tis better to have rode and lost than to have never ridden at all.
i've always wanted to spend a month riding through europe
in the us you just need a motorcycle endorsement. just a quick little written test and a skills course.
try the areas in south dakota that have a speed limit of "necessary and proper"
awesome, i'll see if we can make more, since this post has uh, blown up! :)
shit just across texas and back in my mustang gt was over 200 in gas alone. i need to buy an ecoboost or something
you can get a bike for much less than that. you're right about the knowledge though.
he also sourced in norcal, so instead of $3.75/gal, probably closer to $4.25/gal
i want to have that on the bottom of a picture frame with a picture of my bike above it.
pressure from my parents to get rid of it combined with my car's transmission seizing. i used it as a trade in (got more than what i paid too) and bought i car that i fully regret buying. now i'm waiting for my next tax refund or something like that to get one again. i plan on ditching the car i bought so i can get a cheap truck so i can move my shit around when i need to and so i can get groceries and such... i missed out on a bike on craigslist yesterday for 700 bucks that was on perfect condition but the owners widow needed it gone.
seize the means of frosty production i mean me too thanks.
i do that at sonic, i order a cheeseburger combo and say i have a coupon for a buy one get one free burger. i mean, i actually do have one but they never ask for it so... every day is half price burger day for bart
you're *vastly* underestimating the amount of non-voters/lurkers that will see this. very few people actually vote compared to how many will look at the post.
i will send you the money to buy a frosty if your comment reaches 10,000
people will pretty much upvote anything, even absolute garbage. "oh look, huge company responded to my mildly funny tweet." "to the top, boys!!!!"
seize the memes of production /r/youseecomrade
i just want one fry dipped in the frosty and i'm good.
that movie is amazing. mos def and mc serch deserve oscars for their performance.
bart, you are winning, but you really shouldn't be eating 2 sonic cheeseburgers everyday
i got mine for free for the first few years through work. when chosing between arbys and wendys, sometimes that key tag was enough to make me pick wendys.
well we are in /r/comedycemetery huh oh this is /r/me_irl meh same thing.
name a body part and planet and i've lost it, on it!
if you're on the desktop there's a report button under every post, idk what it looks like on mobile but i guess it's there? people like to use it to be annoying
hey man im not some sort of internet mathematician who knows everything about reddit viewings
he's at 13 upfrosties one hour in, i'm crossing my fingers.
i think it's more that they wanted the guy to get his free frosty that's why i upvoted
how many drops do you think that is boyo??? i mean me too thanks
sort of, yeah. mostly, if you've been bamboozled, you've been deceived, duped, had, tricked. close but no cigar, friendo
shit man i've bought one the last two years and when i was there the other day i saw the promotion on the screen. i said i wanted one and she said "oh we're not doing that anymore"...
they are transparent with their marketting. its the "oh look xyz brand cookie is amazing" and it's just a picture that annoy me. i still wont go to wendy's because i dont eat processed foods, but the wendy's pepe was hilarious.
it's more that literally every tweet wendy's is making now is somehow finding its way to the front page of reddit. there's a new one everyday.
the answer is probably yes. i'm sure whoever is running the account, or at least one of the people running it, browse this subreddit. i wouldn't doubt it...
i do indeed. i've just fired up dogecoin-qt for the first time in a long time too. i *think* i've got enough for half a coffee bean (and apparently my last transaction was giving notch 3.14159265 doge for cliffhorse).
isn't a jr frosty $.99 regularly? pays for itself if you go at least twice during the year. pretty smart for wendy's too. subtle advertising by and for whomever carries around the keychain and they're likely to eat more wendy's than they normally would for the free frosty
come to maryland. i should go buy more and sell them for a $1.50 and make profits.
i mean they'd probably just pm his a voucher code or mail him one etc.
hey some people aren't going to show up and claim their drop. i'll take theirs. me two (drops) thanks
don't little pieces of the burger get in it though?
reminds me of last night. a guy comes in for propane and says our store is the 4th one he's been to. the other 4 stores made excuses saying "our propane guy isn't here right now". my favorite was " its illegal to pump propane in the rain". it was 40 degrees and raining but my co worker just put on a jacket and pumped propane. i have heard some lazy ass excuses before but nobody wanted to give the poor guy propane because light rain in cool weather.
yeah i don't believe the lie that the burgers are never frozen, what do they do deliver it raw on a hot truck?
were delibering these drops boyo! ain't gotta even gettup.
ehh. sometimes a piece of bacon falls in because it's crumbly, but you just fish it out with a fry or something. to be honest, i hardly ever eat the frosty, as chocolate ice cream hurts my stomach, so it's not an issue for me.
if there was any lightening he may have had merit, but i've filled propane in a downpour several times and never had a problem.
where do you store cold things that aren't frozen?
he bites directly into the flesh of live animals and never washes/harvests his vegetables. can't have any of those processing toxins!
to be fair, they're rarely seen on this sub anymore
dude. start a little herb garden. it's life changing. don't buy processed seasonings! grow your own. takes up very little space and is pretty easy. basil especially. fresh basil is soooo much better.
good for him then, admitting that he was wrong and changing his stance because of it.
i don't think people that dislike "processed foods" give a shit about eating jam or preserves from a grocery store. i hear complaints about processed foods in regards to stuff like hamburgers, chicken fingers, and "pink slime" meme
no i was being serious. i was just high as a kite and didn't know what to say haha.
like dihydrogen monoxide and glucopyranose?? i'm very confused sorry
yes, there are definitely a variety of things that are "processed foods", many of which are unsavory. i don't deny that pink slime is gross or that people may not prefer fast food chicken fingers or hamburgers for nutrition reasons. i just find it reflects an ignorance to food processing when people dislike "chemicals that they cannot pronounce" or "preservatives" as a rule, when the chemical name for "water" and "salt" respectively qualify. "sealing in an airtight container after boiling" is a method of preservation that allows foods to stay on a shelf for many months, but will somehow gross out someone who is otherwise okay with doing it in their home. i think this is because people assume that canned foods on a shelf are pumped with formaldehyde or something rather than processed in this manner, and is something i want to inform people about.
i think he's talking about the keychain is available in december. when i picked mine up, i got mine the last week of december and was told it was the very last one.
an estimated 801,000 children younger than 5 years of age perish from diarrhea each year due to dihydrogen monoxide.
odd, you can still buy them here. i bought mine earlier than december also.
the love story of a hot sauce packet dropped behind a microwave is captivating the attention of thousands of people from various countries around the globe. reddit truly *does* work in mysterious ways.
just in case you or anyone else thinks this is serious, microwave ovens have no connection whatsoever to radioactivity.
pfft just because i have a drawer full of these sauces and all my tupperware is margarine bowls doesn't meant i'm poor white trash! (i am though...)
i think so, but instead of crawling through a river of shit, if you do this, a river of shit will crawl out of you.
not only do they have to replace their microwave to see it, but they have to then post it to the interwebz. but perhaps tb researched their "victims" before breaking into their house and planting the sauce.
just remember that while this love story of a hot sauce packet dropped behind a microwave is captivating the attention of thousands of people from various countries around the globe you shouldn't let it distract you from the fact that in 1998, the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell, and plummeted 16ft through an announcer's table.
actually microwave ovens do emit radiation, but it's a very small amount and it's non-ionizing so it doesn't cause cancer. the electromagnetic radiation given off by microwaves in use is known to interfere with wifi signals, for example.
i feel bad throwing my butter tubs in the recycle bin, but mostly i'm just far too lazy to clean and reuse them. now those containers that soup comes in from my favorite chinese restaurant in town? those babies last for *years* with repeated use.
my roommates and i did this all through college, grabbed a few extra packets every time and saved them, but the thing is we never used them on home cooked food, we had real bottles of ketchup/barbeque sauce/soy sauce that were, quite frankly, better. so when we finally moved out, we had dozens of sauce packets in our drawer that had to be thrown out.
"andy crawled to freedom through five hundred yards of shit-smelling foulness i can't even imagine, or maybe i just don't want to. five hundred yards... that's the length of five football fields; just shy of half a mile".
god i spend way too much time on reddit. had to read your comment twice to realize that you were saying sauce as in sauce and not as in source.
pan...zoom...enhance...give me a sepia filter with a tilt shift...i thought as much...
this may be the most poetic comment about hot sauce ever. thank you.
the most common critique against /r/hailcorporate is based on the false image that it's users cry "shill" if they see anything that's related to a brand. can't get more obvious than nothing but a picture of a taco bell sauce packet on the front page, in a subreddit that's supposed to be funny.
first of all it's been a cliche joke long before most of us discovered reddit. second as others are pointing out if your body isn't accustomed to the unnatural levels of sodium and fat that you get with fast food your body is going to try to reject it. finally, if you live in a city with a poorly funded food sanitation department then some fast food chains have a tendency to let their locations get fucking filthy. the wendy's in my neighborhood has fruitflies surrounding the trashcan at all times and every table is sticky 24/7.
hi from brazil, every woman will take most of the bed and you will be left almost falling , its a universal law
some seriously deep shit coming from an at the time heavily drugged gucci. he was indeed lost in the sauce at one point.
at first i thought that was a play on "caliphate" and i was very confused.
there's a taco bell nuclear asshole joke in there somewhere but i'm not clever enough.
barbarian! should they shout "allahu snackbar" when they chop it's package open? #tacosaucepackagelivesmatter
you can test your microwave's shielding by putting your phone in it (don't turn the microwave on). your phone shoul not be able to get any wireless signal while in the microwave.
you can buy the large one that goes in the middle of a nugget tray, just ask for it. it's like $7.
i used to make fun of my parents and grandparents for doing that. now that i'm a parent myself, i feel so bad about it. i started using paper shopping bags that we get from random expensive outlet stores (that we never even shopped at to begin with. how we have those bags i'll never know) as tote bags. at the korean market they have these really neat looking disposable bowls that i've been reusing for a year now. i keep present bags and used wrapping paper so that we can use it for someone else. i'm slowly but surely getting there.
but wait... you placed on that tinfoil hat after your statement... now *they* know...
i'm the taco bell ceo and can confirm that this person prints these packages at work.
that doesn't mean much. i have a stash of condiment packets in my desk at work and some of the ketchup had separated. i decided to check the copyright date and they were from 2012. i then looked at the date on the packets i'd just recieved from burger king and yup...2012.
it's true i know. i spend my days striving to print perfect packaging for the masses, in fact, my entire 23 year career, all for something most people just glance at (or not) and then throw into the trash. it pays well, but i'm cursed with inspecting every package that i come across from everything i buy and silently judging some other printer for minor defects. ama.
"body isn't accustomed to the unnatural levels of sodium and fat" um, lol, uh, you know this is america, right???? and i also eat tb quite regularly, and not only have i never gotten sick, i have never heard anyone ever joking that it does. as far as i'm concerned, tb is one of the cleaner and more nutrient based ff places of them all. look at others like kfc and mcdonalds. unless you actually order a salad, nothing comes with anything but greasy meat and white bread.
i eat pretty healthy most of the time (down 60 pounds) and hadn't had taco bell, or any particularly greasy anything, in at least two months. i had it this past tuesday. a lot of it. i felt absolutely fine. nothing different than if i had eaten a regular meal.
not stuck in the sink? these porn plots are getting out of hand.
it's somehow hilarious and awesome to me how some things never change no matter where on the planet you were born. we hairless apes are all just the same! smiles from the u.s. :)
it's almost fascinating, i guess it's the same with a 3ft dog taking up 2 thirds of the bed even though he's only half the persons size, you sort of feel bad so you don't move.
tacobellnuclearasshole is my favorite username apart from carlos_danger.
holy shit same bro. gotta be more than coincidence.
or do turn it on, it's the fastest way to charge your phone!
they did say non-ionizing so they must know their rads.
the reason is because wifi actually use the same microwaves as your microwave. the difference is, the microwave is putting out about 1kilowatts of power, while your wifi is well under a watt of power.
am i the only one who thinks $7 is way too much for sauce? i mean i can supply it for free with the right amount of pumps.
i literally use them all depending on mood. when they changed their bbq to smokehouse bbq i sent them an email and they responded telling me that they would change it back.
same i just finished up with my 36,000 sq ft house and devoted an entire kitchen for the sauce packets.
next time you go to mcd's ask to speak with the manager and ask him/her if you can buy a box of the sweet n sour sauce tubs. depending on what kinda manager he or she is they may say yes or no. officially you're not supposed to sell the boxes but some managers sell all sorts of mcd's shit out the back door. they simply write it off as a loss for one reason or another and keep the money for themselves.
i started using reusable shopping bags like 10-12 years ago, and haven't bought a bag in many years. they seem to just keep multiplying in my giant bag of bags in the laundry room. i kept the plastic shopping bags to use as trash can bags around the house, and have yet to get to the bottom of those plastic bags. present bags are a score, but wrapping paper isn't worth keeping. i just buy it at 90% off the week after xmas if i'm running low, and prefer the recycled paper ones. but that's nothing compared to the giant tupperware bin of school supplies in the garage that i stock up on after they all go on sale at the end of the year. folders, ticonderoga pencils, dry erase markers, crayons, markers, pink erasers, all in gallon or 2 gallon ziploc bags. i spend less than $20 a year on school supplies at 75% or more off and rarely have to actually go out and buy a lot of new stuff at the beginning of the school year.
i totally didn't remember my post and your reply confused me greatly. skol!
yes! i've been saying this for years! shit... are you reading my mind right now?!?
yeah, everyone believes the guy who claims to print taco bell sauce packets, but nobody believes the guy who had a taco bell sauce packet fall behind his microwave.
dude don't doubt reddit. there will be a video of your midget by morning.
the point is that it's not pre-2012 like slivbodiv said. it's 2012 or later.
so how does it work? are you printing flat or onto a tube or what? how do you maintain food safety?
give it some more time, i was on a strict diet for around 4-5 years while playing football and rugby. your body is still pretty used to digesting that kind of food, even if you don't feel like it is. it's good to hear you've lost that much weight and switched to a healthier diet! mad props
if hand is a pun, i laughed a bit too loud in the bus
hi from central us! my dad was just talking earlier about how bad you guys are having it right now. yipes.. drink lots of water, friend!
hey we were doing the exact same thing yesterday night.
tokyo checking in; this is less of a problem when you sleep on floor level
and it's the best way to dry it off if it gets wet.
the best kind of sorcery... the deliciously edible kind!
ahh so you are the one responsible for the change back. thanks tyled you rock.
same i just finished up with my oceanside neighborhood community and devoted an entire block for the sauce packets.
i may take this under advisement. there's a mcdonalds 500 yards from my house. i should befriend the manager haha
oh yeah and i just recently started getting reusable grocery bags because of that bag of bags reason. hahaha.
so start your own collection! i went around to various stores around new year's when we first got married and bought a bunch of bows, bags, and wrapping paper on sale. been using them for years! big lots even had some pretty boxes with handles a few years back that get passed around every year now. (no wrapping required; just tie a bow around it to keep the lid on!)
you just made me audibly laugh out loud. hard. the absurdity of this simple and completely true observation is comedy gold.
you show me this highly interesting redditor, that can backup his life's story, and i'll eat my last carolina reaper pepper pod and share the youtube video, here.
but it doesn't mean it's legit like the person they were replying to said. the person believes it's stages and the copyright date doesn't prove it either way.
we print on very thin clear film. that film is then sent to another part of our building where the foil and some more film are added to it. it is then slit into smaller rolls and shipped to the people who fill the packages with the sauce. as far as food safety on our end, we just make sure our raw materials are clean and stored properly and we keep contaminates out of our finished product. we never deal with the actual food product.
hey! currently 46 degrees celsius...114 farenheit. really dry and hot...had some water but rehydrating with lots of beer:d
currently in a roomy queen, with the opposite problem. missing my so (who would be trying to excape my power swaddle cuddling). looks like marsh pillow is coming out tonight.
you've got the right idea! i used to sleep on a futon on the floor, i actually miss that.
same here, bought manhattan and dedicated all of the buildings to sauce packets.
get your pepper and camera ready. if people see this post you're gonna be shitting fire on a video.
to be clear, i don't believe it is staged and don't really care either way. my point was copyright date does not equal sell by/use by date. i too worked in a print shop for years with dated documents.
fuckin snow everywhere. save me from his frozen hellscape
urgh that sounds wretched! beer's the way to go though. weather might be shitty right now but you're lucky. i've always felt like i should've been born aussie. :)
fuckun oath. i work in a warehouse and yesterday was almost unbearable. luckily no work today.
did you cite it? my cousin has a doctorate in english and sent a complaint letter to hardee's that contained a works cited page.
same here, just bought taco bell and devoted the entire sauce factory for my consumption.
that's why you should always come inside, it's totally safe
you ever eat a carolina reaper pepper? i cut off about 10 millimeters of one and was sweating for the next 6 hours of work. my lips burned up until i went to bed.
it's freaking 60 degrees (farenheit, sorry) in the middle of the u.s., in the middle of february. one good snow for the kids would have been nice this year.. send some my way! also yeah, england, bigger bed man.
thanks, off to buy as many cold bottles of water i can find
yea but at least 1 sauce packet got away from you, so
i'm so glad i came to the comments. so much good stuff in here. or i'm just really tired and everything is hilarious.
right away jt went in for the arm/shoulder grab which is a sign of dominance. trump did too but a split second late which threw him off. i would not be surprised if jt practiced for this to prevent being pulled. if i had to shake trumps hand i'd give him the pull before he had a chance. but then his trumpions would flip out and claim i was being aggressive.
remove the 35 age restriction on running for president and change it to a 350 benchlift restriction
look at that subtle step forward. the tasteful thickness of his bicep. oh my god! he even makes trump lean!
the other option is to go completely limp and when trump jerks you off balance, you just fall down into his arms making the entire thing even more awkward.
times have been this way. the whole handshake = mindgame thing is not anything new
i think what a lot of folks are missing is not only did he brace with his other arm, but he strode purposefully up to trump, well within trump's personal space boundary, pinning their hands between them, so even if he wasn't braced on the shoulder it would've been really hard for trump to try and pull him closer (he was already about as close as he could be.) after the shoulder lock drops you can tell trump tries it anyway, but trudeau was waiting for it and tugged back just as hard. fucking great.
coach: you know this prick is going to go for the early power pull, so let your left arm linger on his shoulder and use it for leverage.
have you seen his business cards? *just look at the quality of the paper! *
"so thats how a man i genuinely find sexually desirable looks and acts" - melania while watching the news of trudeau's visit
seriously, it's like when he couldn't pull him in he just went for the full-on bone crushing.
see that hand go straight to donalds upper arm, squeezing the muscle to prevent donald from getting a good yank back right from the start? then asserting his dominance by holding firm till the end and that smile afterwords, that's a man who knew what he was doing i've never felt such national pride
i'm sure bannon was just off screen in a cobra kai jacket yelling "sweep the leg"
get someone really talented and convincing at pratfalls. completely get laid out by it. then, be sure catch the aftermath on video. what does trump do? help them up? call for secret service to help them up? laugh?
it's like an amputee waking up every morning, trying to get out of bed, and going, "oh. right. my leg."
as a canadian, you guys suck for making our prime minister do something so childish.
great, you will love our health care system and clean drinking water, timmies (coffee) and our hockey. just be sure to wipe your feet before you enter some ones home. welcome to canada.
might as well let them annex us and get it over with.
giving me the overly firm handshake is the fastest way for me to know that i won't like someone. but i just realized that i'm not sure if it is because they have instinctively established dominance over me or because i genuinely can't stand their bullshit. there's no way to be sure.
he'll see that he's bending over, take it as sign of submission, and proceed to mount him.
apparently this is how our president shakes people's hands. it's like a business thing, the way tries to intimidate whoever he is speaking with. squeeze their hand as hard as you can, dont let go and pull them into you, very strange.
i'm thinking he did it as a counter to trump's aggressive pull-in handshake. wouldn't be surprised if he was coached on how to counter it.
i for one am excited for president ronnie coleman.
you had me at "go completely limp and when trump jerks you off"
justin trudeau's father. interesting figure, that man.
there's a difference between a strong handshake, even those assholes who try to crush your hand, and literally pulling people toward you. aggressive handshaking is supposed to be subtle (to onlookers, not the other person). it's supposed to say "look, i'll play along like we're meeting as equals, but i want you to know that we are not really equals.". onlookers are supposed to see a normal handshake so you don't seem petty. even the stupid crushing handshake thing is basically a private dare betting you will feel pressured not to acknowledge it (and that you will look/feel weak if you do). trump may as well just be shoving people to the ground instead. he has the handshake of someone who read a self-help book last week that brought up forceful handshakes as a way to get the upper hand and is clumsily trying to follow the advice. instead of looking strong, he looks embarrassingly petty.
he looks like he braced for the pull, too. posted with his left arm, engaged the core, i imagine he slightly bent the knees. probably spent all week with his trainer on those cable+bar things. "nope! shift those important meetings about our commitments to world conflict! i don't want to look like a bitch on tv!"
tbh, that probably boosted his respect for trudeau. he relies on an image of masculinity, and a powerful handshake shows it. every other person got yanked, but not him. trudeau doesn't meet his base definition of weakness.
listen, i'll make you a deal buddy, if you can't keep up with my secret handshake, you owe me a quick kiss.
he was probably furious that he couldn't do the hand-pull thing.
i've never felt such national pride for canada and i'm from new orleans.
trudeau is one the sexiest heads of state i've ever seen.
it's a great day for canada, and therefore the world.
as an american, i would gladly not have any of this take place. however, since trump is a shit stain in the american presidency i'm more than happy to see anyone do anything to put him in his place.
your hockey teams will almost certainly get better.
yeah it's straight out of those crappy "how to be alpha" kind of self-help books. everyone knows what he's doing and it doesn't work. those things sometimes work but you gotta be subtle about it, he just looks like he's trying to saw wood or something.
please sign here mr. president. "ain't nothin but a peanut!"
didn't he do a pirouette when the queen turned her back?
well nieto (mexico (left)) isn't exactly paying attention to the handshake at first and comes in for a normal handshake with his right hand (as handshakes work) but then fucks up trying to save it with swapping his hand, even though trudeau fixed it with a quick wrist turn. he started off pretty strong but it fell apart :( the 2-way was a real risky move for trudeau in the first place anyway.
hahahaha that's the one thing i got from the gif too.
he looks so prepared. the arm on shoulder to hold distance, the wide stance for stability meaning the only thing trump could do was pull himself closer
went in for a hug... got an arm squeeze. poor guy probably just wanted a valentine. question his governance decisions all you want but you can't knock the trudeau charm. i maintain that he only won because he was up against canadian ted cruz and a guy who looks like his nickname would be fuzzy.
dude saw it coming and prepared a defense. solid gamesmanship.
blank! blank! your not thinking about the big picture!!!
well, tbf, he pretty much does *everything* high af. he's one of the highest functioning genuine potheads out there.
you gotta watch out. old man strength is like monkey strength.
we are all canadians on this blessed day. greetings from mars.
bill clinton, whatever your opinion of his politics may be, was an absolute god-king when it came to all of that subtle bullshit.
small passive aggresive gestures are canadian specialities
i hadn't even noticed, but by god, those are some dainty feet.
i try to match my handshake to the other person's if it is very soft or hard. woman will generally give a soft one but i've met a few men who take the firm handshake thing to the point where i think they are trying to injure me so i crush their hand in return. a little silly if you ask me.
"and some say, the donalds penis shrunk 4 inches that day".
head of government. technically speaking canada does not have a head of state, as the queen is the state, but for simplicity's sake we say the monarch is the head of state, with the governor general serving as their viceregal representative. but yes, he is rather attractive for a head of government.
please everyone take out your ornamental cheerios and throw them - on this, our blessed day.
wait, in other countries you are considered admitting to a crime if you say sorry? well that's not very nice.
do they viscerally dislike each other or is it just something about image for the campaign?
"everybody wanna be the president! don't nobody wanna lift this heavy ass country! gohhh! i'll do it though!"
it's for people who can't afford barbells so they benchpress the bench itself. look it up.
lifts a lot of weights. listens to ratm. big fan of ayn rand. he's like the oldest 20-year-old out there.
yes. when nixon was recorded calling him an asshole, his comeback was "i've been called worse things by better people." i'd like to be able to use that line some day.
snoop has been stoned for so long that it's given him catlike reflexes.
then there's obama smile during when he realizes what a mess it is. good times.
last week tonight did a great bit called "donald trump doesn't know how to shake hands" had a bunch of clips showing him doing this shit going way back, before and during the apprentice too iirc.
makes you wonder if there was a meeting where they decided on strategy. now i'm picturing a team of trudeau staffers huddled around a conference table, watching replays of trump handshakes to understand his technique. this is followed by some practice runs, one of the staff takes the place of trump trying to pull jt over while he experiments with different postures to see which provides the most stability. personally i think a much simpler response is to crush his hand as soon as he yanks. it's not like he's going to come out and say another world leader's handshake was too strong for him. they should spread the word before trump attends a major conference of world leaders. that should help him break the habit. and it's not like they are lacking in grip strength. everybody knows politicians are the biggest bunch of wankers there are.
as someone with small hands and feet, i should be defensive of people with small feet and hands. not trump. let him have it.
i'd collapse into him and drag both of us to the ground, then blame trump for pulling on my arm.
dress like her dad, it releases a hormone called moanatonin.
i believe there is another, less pc term that fits trumps other characteristics more appropriately.
what a wonderful day for canada, and therefor, the world.
the prime addendum to the national pastime of door-holding is the passive-aggressive "you're welcome" if you aren't thanked after holding said door.
hah, i didn't even notice that. still doesn't surprise me though, he *looks* like a strip club manager.
he was never a professional boxer, but has trained and sparred as an amateur boxer for many years before that bout. so yes and no.
you know what they say about people with small hands? that they have a hard time grasping things.
they definitely spent a good hour practicing this. i can hear the rocky montage music playing.
which means... elizabeth is the sexiest head of state?
a lot of cultures don't seem to see "sorry" the way we do. to many people, it is an apology for something you did, whereas we mean it mostly as a show of empathy.
i mean they didn't love each other. but latham was just an idiot.
that is the fucking dopest thing i have ever heard and am going to use it all the time.
because it shows that bernie has interacted with enough people similar in culture to the guy that he knows the proper greeting.
it's pretty adorable that the most powerful men in north america fumble and spill their spaghetti like that.
seems like he did what everyone else on reddit has done and watched handshake gifs before meeting lol
nobody actually thinks the size of feet and hands is in any way interesting, but he made a decade long vendetta from one off hand comment about his size and the public loves to hit where it hurts.
maybe they're just not on camera as often? i had no idea until just now, and i'm blown away by how ridiculous they are. we need to make sure this image goes viral.
i'd sure like to look at the before nafta pics of that.
they're picturing the wrong australian prime minister anyway.
trap your princess! physically corner your princess in a room
you're speaking of the kind of strength drawn from a type of mental deficiency?
trudeau holding the handshake to the very end, as is tradition
or holding a door for someone at least 20 feet away. never breaking eye contact as they give that half hearted wave as if to say "please, don't wait, its fine". then they realize you are waiting regardless, and have to stutter into this awkward semi run to try to not inconvenience you further. they apologize for making you wait so long, confused why you did it. "no you're right, i shouldn't have held the door. sorry." you've just ruined their entire day.
i think it's less about trudeau and those like him caring about the power stance than them knowing how much assistant president chump cares about it. trudeau struck a psychological blow to mango mussolini today and the more people that do it the sooner he'll die of a kfc induced heart attack.
trump handshake but every time trudeau resists he lets go quicker.
american politics in general is further right than australia (having lived under both). john howard at his most penny pinching was still further left than the us democrats on a bunch of issues (such as healthcare, social programs etc). that should give people an idea of what a twat latham is.
his whole patterns of behavior and speech look and sound *exactly* like that to me. it's really weird.
new band name idea: *rage while leaning against the machine*
which would make him a size 12.... in *women's* shoes.
who said it had to be buttsex? there are definitely women on reddit, and most all of the straight ones think trudeau is bangin'
apostrophes are used to denote contractions and possession, not to indicate the plural. to say "ceo's" implies that one is referring to something which is owned by a ceo, not that there ~~a~~ *are* multiple ceos. **edit**: some of the replies below provide examples for when using an apostrophe would be appropriate. i would argue that in the circumstance of this tweet, "ceos", would clearly be the plural form of the well-recognized initialism "ceo". by contrast, "ceo's" is ambiguous because it could either be the plural form or the genitive (possessive) case, and cannot be discerned until reading the entire context. and i would think one would want to use as few characters as possible in a twitter message anyway. it's not indefensibly wrong grammatically, but i think it's dumb stylistically because it introduces ambiguity. **edit 2**: not gonna lie, feels good to get gold for correcting the grammar of the leader of the free world.
as my father likes to say, "strong like bull, smart like stump."
the key is to move past it after that. make sure they don't get a chance to respond. brush it off like its just a fact of life, not a debate on handshake ethics. give them a pat on the shaking arm and release your grip, and launch into whatever it was that brought you there to have them waste your time.
that's gonna be a hell of a handshake but a losing one for don. i wouldn't bet against a former kgb agent on anything.
i used to hear "strong like tractor, smart like tractor"
i dunno, i think vladimir is going to underplay it, not show his true power, but at the same time not let trump defeat him. if it's a win, it'll be subtle.
i used to hear "as strong as an ox and twice as smart"
like let donald pull him in but stab him in the chest when he is close enough.
i hear "he can lift a ton, he just can't spell it."
my wife has this life. but my name is leo and i sneak up behind her a lot.
if i was a celebrity, id use reverse phycology on the paparazzi and stalk them and take photos of them
photos in los angeles confuse me. half of the people can be wearing shorts and flip flops, and the other half jeans and a (light) jacket. all while the sun is blazing. as someone from a place with less ideal weather it's weird
he lost a ton of weight and from what i know, lost a lot of fame. quoting him in funny people, "there's nothing funny about a physically fit man" so strange that it actually played out exactly that way.
aside from the fact that he's not a dad, that statement is probably true.
if i ever see my friends when i'm out and about i'll sneak up on them and try to mess with them in some way -- like i'll walk way too close to them, or pretend to dig into their wallets. doesn't happen super often but it's always a laugh. even normal people can pretend to be crazies!
i think he actually said: *no one has gotten a handjob in cargo shorts since 'nam*
not going to lie. that sounds like a fun hobby. collecting celebrity restraining orders.
yeah leo hugged jonah a lot more and longer than jonah hugged leo.
i also have this life. but my cat is named leo and he sneaks up behind me a lot.
actually it was probably "oh thank god, it's my friend that i filmed a movie with and haven't seen in a while". being famous doesn't mean you're instantly cool with everyone else who is famous.
start your own magazine! headline could be: taking photos wasn't the only thing he was doing behind the bushes!
dude, you always bring a jacket with you here. businesses *blast* their a/c. like, all of them.
30ish and 10ish degrees respectively. fucking yanks and their fahrenheit.
jonah was his slave name, from this moment on his new name will be paddington!
and then your friend reflex elbows you to the face while you try to grab his wallet.
i never understood this. flinching when someone fakes a punch is an evolutionary trait and means that your nervous system is working correctly.
as somebody with many younger siblings (and also as somebody who loved jumping out and scaring people when i was a little kid) i can assure you this is perfectly normal.
aside from being one of the many actors to play superman in the past decade, what notable roles has he played? honest question because i have no idea who he is. i haven't watched man of steel or batman v superman yet, never been much of a superman fan.
i mean the ones filming are barely human so it's fitting.
i'd be jerking off too if i knew i was about to cash in a ticket for ~$5k. i still hate the paparazzi but still, i can understand their excitement.
these sociopaths are barely human. they make nightcrawler look positively empathetic.
if you just watch the gif, the paparazzi aren't getting any money. if you go to tmz.com or buy gossip magazine you are supporting the creepy paparrazi . but watching this gif or not doesn't really change anything. edit : i am not supporting paparazzi . if you don't click on the source video and don't go on gossip site , you are not supporting the paparazzi.
it would be great! get a bunch of restraining orders against me from paparazzi then they wouldn't be able to photograph me as well!
actually, something that annoys me about southern california is that because of the climate some places don't use it enough. now, austin, tx? *they* blast their a/c. every damn bar leaves their front door open and yet they're all still about -12 inside.
hah yeah i usually elbow him first, also i don't have any friends, plenty of money though, wanna meet up?
because cash rules everything around him obviously.
if someone does that and makes fun of you for flinching you just gotta go to pretend to hit them. then actually hit them when they don't flinch.
i mean like the context for why hugh jackman was there haha. was he filiming for a movie?
i get the impression they're not awful, really, just ridiculously sheltered.
he did a really good job in the tudors on showtime. then he was in the immortals which i guess it wasn't exactly a great movie haha but i noticed since i think he's attractive :p
probably dating one and the rest are her/his friends
legendary fight with shia labouf. normal tuesday night for shia labouf.
well i was mostly just making an off-handed comment rather than trying to preach a point against supporting paparazzi. but to continue the discussion, viewing the gif and upvoting the post indirectly supports the entire paparazzi industry because now people will search where this gif comes from. i mean it has already happened, the first comment i replied to already posted the source video. it all helps support what they do. but again, just making a comment, not trying to protest the industry or this post or anything.
that's really cool. also david bowie taking a greek newspaper around so people thought it was just a lookalike.
there's one of dave chapelle walking out of a restaraunt and getting surprised he's just like 'what the hell.. why are you following me for? i'm no body..' then he stops for a smoke and talks while they all get their pictures and shit.
you could be a giant douche crowd source off twitter. "now out front of xx address taking photos and signing autographs"
video stability has progressed leaps and bounds on the hero 4. now i can video tape myself and family dinners with an entire back massager in my anus and you can't even tell
true. i got 36 chambers when i was barely a teen off my fucking columbia house "10 cds for only a penny!" membership, and now i'm a 32 year old systems engineer. to be honest i feel a lot more awkward about driving around bumping the new schoolboy q album; chambers feels too classic to be specific to a cultural subgroup. to this day i think i may have been the only person in history to follow up on cancelling that subscription before it cost any more.
well in his defence, sometimes, parents just don't understand.
sheltered, wealthy, and with bloated egos. will smith has a giant ego, but he carries it well with his charisma. his kids did not inherit the charisma.
what board games does leonardo dicaprio play? monopoly? or is he more of a catan man?
that's what the back of the poor indigenous people are for, silly peasants.
thank you, i genuinely couldn't make sense out of that comment.
thats true, reddit does get mentioned in higher profile article around the web, oh and twitter apparently.
to be fair, kim jong un does have a pretty sweet haircut
that's different, that's actually super fucked up and invasive. they're talking about the celebrity's own publicist tipping off paparazzi for promotion, a hotel front desk attendant tipping off paparazzi about hotel guests is morally an awful thing to do, super firable offense.
hero 4 does not have any hardware stabilization. i don't know why i'm even debating this.
he seems to be holding it together though, jonah looks fucked up.
i'm guessing basketball players get that taunt several times a week growing up. i've had it done to me many times playing street ball. after a while you just ignore it out of reflex. and for the curious, i flinched 90% of the time.
his kids weren't born with the ability to handle being famous. will has 30 years experience dealing with fans and publicity and whatnot. maturation and time make all teenagers into real people, and jaden is no exception.
i think that comment was either you get it straight away, or never at all. thank fuck someone explained it.
...and no doubt, interest here and in other social media, assures potential buyers that there is interest in buying stuff like it.
yeah definitely but money talks and i doubt the fontainebleau minds getting their hotel mentioned constantly in tabloids as being a "hot spot for celebs"
weren't those the $20 million days as well? i know he had a great run of like 6 movies where he was paid $20million each
hero 5 is likely to come out within the next few months, if they manage to get hardware is in as well as (according to rumor) increasing the battery life and reducing the form factor, then it's a day 1 buy for me the only thing really stopping me from getting a hero 4 is that the battery life is appalling at just over an hour, and that's not nearly long enough for me to bring it with me on bike rides
he's just not talking right now. classic chillin stoned look vs shit i'm in over my head look. its a lot easier to stand there than it is to talk.
met him at a gas station once... he was a fantastic guy for our 2 minute interaction
i met him once, granted it was a long time ago (he was promoting super bad at the time) but he was lovely. as was michael cera and christopher mintz-plasse
you make it sounds like he's an anime character damn it.
also don't forget that will didn't grow up famous. though it's been a long time, he can remember when he was just 'regular'. his kids can't relate to that. they've always been in the spotlight.
iirc, the cable guy was his first $20 million film. ace ventura is actually a fairly small film - the entire budget is $15 million. dumb and dumber is $17 milliom. even the mask is $23 million.
i'm of the belief that michael cera physically cannot be mean.
are you saying kobe bryant isn't an anime character?
yup. he was already 21 when fresh prince first aired. he was already past the super awkward teenage phase.
i don't know about you, but i keep my balls in leonardo dicaprio's cargo shorts.
i'm also out of the loop, but i assume someone's been mishearing bon appetit
yeah, it was the combination of those films in short succession that made him a 20 million dollar actor.
and now every april i sit on my porch and i watch the parade pass before me and i watch my old comrades, how proudly they march reliving old dreams of past glory and the old men march slowly, all bent, stiff and sore the forgotten heroes from a forgotten war and the young people ask, "what are they marching for?" and i ask myself the same question
now this picture is even more depressing. i should never have looked in the comments.
my grandfather was a gunner in a liberator. he almost never talked about his time in the war.
i really just want to give him a hug, and walk with him
were you asking for the word for the group of guys? possibly thinking squad?
tears immediately came to my eyes when i saw him and read the title. i have a soft spot for elderly men especially if they seem sad. then i read that it was fake and stopped crying. then read it was because he was left behind. crying all over again. what a roller coaster! my heart goes out to him.
some top posters just repost things for karma in order to leverage their accounts into actual paying jobs. sad but true.
i read this in the tune of the wreck of the edmond fitzgerald
only 19 fucks me up every time, even just thinking about it. my dad is a vietnam vet and he was never the same again, according to my late grandmother. he was just a kid forced to go to war. my grandmother told me before he left he came to her crying, "i don't want to shoot anybody, mum" he returned a different person with ptsd and lifelong depression.
i read it while singing..actually started singing " i used to busk and i sang lots of these sad songs, i had..." when i realized something was horribly wrong.
you'll get used to it. pictures get re-uploaded and debunked all the time here.
my father has just started opening up about vietnam. i'm 35 and i've been asking about it since i was a kid. he earned a bronze star and never talked about it until a few months ago. it was one of my favorite moments of my father. at that moment he became my friend. not less of my father, but just an added friend. he never showed any emotions until then, and now when we talk we joke and laugh a lot. it really opened up our relationship to have me just sit and listen. he's been keeping it buried for so long.
my great grandfather served in the same battle, on the american side. it was hard for him, because he was german by his family, but lived in america his whole life. i don't have too many stories about him, just that he was once shot at by a german soldier only to have his gun jam. my grandmother and her siblings wrote down everything he had to say about the war, plus some letters from him and his friends, and they're putting it into a book. it's great that you're keeping up with him as much as you can. i really respect that. i didn't see him and my great grandmother (his wife) their last month or so, because i wanted to remember them as alive as they always were. still dunno if i regret that or not.
their service is a blessing, not least because they know the horror and the cost of war. my father often says how strange it is that all the ww1 vets are now gone. i know it sounds obvious but for him growing up the memories of the great war were still very vivid amongst the older generation. it won't be long until all living memory of ww2 is lost to time as well and that is a scary thought - it seems evident that the relative long peace we have enjoyed since is a result of politicians and public alike recognising the risk, the cost and the evil of total war and wanting more than anything else to prevent it.
for a good time, volunteering at the va is a great way to meet veterans and tag along with their wife or caretaker while they go to their appointments. great stories, honestly. [pushing veteran in a wheelchair as we go to physical therapy] "and i fought in britanny and jumped off a tank, so that's why my knees and back are so bad. i didn't go to college, but i could have i wanted to--" [gasp] "is everything ok?" "turn around! we just went past a vending machine with a snickers bar in it."
my dad (wwii + 30yrs active duty) was delighted whenever anyone thanked him for his service! he would sometimes get teary-eyed, but it was a sort of gratitude for being remembered. they wear their hats because they want to be identified, among other reasons.
some might. but most wont, i imagine. it never hurts to ask, but some salty sea dogs are still salty after all these years.
this pic is from 2000 so he might not be too... lively. and then the wondering hits me. "is he still alive???" everyone wants some superpower. some want flying, others want to read people's mind. and i'm here with the burning desire to be able to live through the life of every living thing in the universe. whenever i see pictures like that i wonder if these people are still alive, where do they come from. it's killing me.
yeah, really though. did they all leave him behind?
i'm sure it was something along those lines, yeah. it just was funny phrasing because it makes it sound like he was throwing a tantrum.
unrelated, but i love people who bring up that song. we're friends now.
sure thing! the pogues are definitely one of my favorite bands. also check out their version of danny boy.
i'm glad you liked it! they're definitely one of my favorite bands. also check out their cover of danny boy.
that sucks mate, sorry to hear it. chronic depression is bad enough, but ptsd from what vets have seen... fuck that for a joke. hope you can have a good aussie day anyway.
thats not why its even more depressing. it's somehow worse (atleast to drill2kill) thinking that this man is so saddened by not being able to participate fully in something that he identifies with and something that surely has taken up a huge part of his life
wow that's amazing. my grandfather was a radar tech on navy planes patrolling the south atlantic for u-boats for most of the war. it's true, they definitely left their mark on this world.
if you don't mind sharing, how did he earn his bronze star?
mine was a gunner too, on a lancaster for the canadian air force. never talked about anything he did except that he dropped food over holland at one point.
i can't even imagine the experience, the level of suffering that would just sink in and never leave you.
my grandfather, too! yours and mine were some of the few to survive that long in that unit. he also doesn't talk much about it, just funny stories of drinking on leave.
i've posted this before but it is worth repeating. my dad's dad served us army in the philippines in wwii. i don't know what he went through, but he had nightmares for the rest of his life that were so terrifying that he would wake screaming, "snakes!" eventually my grandmother couldn't take his violent kicking during his night terrors and demanded separate bedrooms.
if the stories out there are even half true, being a german prisoner of the soviets was a horrible thing, and i don't blame him for not talking about it.
same here. i asked him once, stupidly as a young kid, if he had killed anyone in the war. he told me in a quiet and serious tone that he did what he had to to come home, and that's all he had to say. i also later learned he threw away everything he had related to his service, including his uniform, when he came home. his mom dug everything out of the trash and tucked it away. my cousin, the first born grandchild owns it all now.
try to find out if he is in any declassified documents.
"i spent four years away from my wife in dogfights with zeroes over the pacific. those four years in my f6 hellcat were the only peace and quiet i ever got!"
fun fact (or depressing fact) on dachau. when the american soldiers liberated it and found out what was going on they lined up german soldiers and killed them.
there are those. i know an old woman who sells junk in a kiosk in the px marketplace. the marketplace hours were from 0900 to 1900. she'd show up 2 hours early and leave 1 hour late, 7 days per week. her husband was a survivor of the bataan march. he came home a very upset man. he made evrryone around him miserable. his wife never strayed. she raised the kids... yet avoided him. he finally passed last summer. she's still pretty miserable. war is hell.
there's absolutely no way to do it aggressively tho lol. /u/ctatey23 is brilliant
its been circulating on facebook for years. iirc he really is the last one left at this point.
i agree. i ctrl-f'ed "balloon" to join the discussion about the balloon.
based on how his arms reach past his base and how wide his sleeves are, i'd wager he mostly moves around on his hand and the rolly board is just for long distances. a big, bulky wheel chair would just slow him down.
he's probably crying because some dickhead ran up to his face with a camera
probably because it was a parade and they don't typically wait for one person. i think it's kind of cute though in its own way. men should cry more. it feels good.
iirc a lot of 16 year olds lied about their age and signed up anyway, so, assuming 20 as a fighting age may be a little high. insane what 16-17 year olds had to handle
does anyone know where the love of god goes, when gerrys turn the minutes to hours?
yeah it is really messed up. you have a good aussie day too!
yeah, you're right on the money. the title made it seem deep, and very emotional, but the reality seems so much more tragic. once a liberator of eastern europe, and now he can't even march alongside his comrad- *tears up*
you may know this already but radar used for looking for u-boats was a major turning point in the war. it kept britain from starving. if you ever want to learn more about it, there is a book called black may which is particularly about the height of the battle for the atlantic.
well, my grandfather was 17 when the war started. he was a medical student at the time, he was studying in moscow while being from a small village on the border between russia and ukraine when the german soldiers got to that place, it was horrific. he enlisted as soon as he could, he ended up in a northern regiment, the news that he got from his village was this: "45people people found dead in a barn, burned alive". he said that from that point onwards he didn't see his enemies as human. i think anyone who did that kind of atrocity deserves the worst hell on earth you can provide.
at the entire opposite ends of the war, my grandfather had stories of being trained to sweep beaches for mines as one of the first on the beach for the invasion of japan that never happened, then being relieved after being told that the war was over following the atomic bombings. he said that no matter how many times they trained, he knew he was gonna die as soon as he hit that beach.
grandpa served under the us army as a guerilla fighter in the philippines. unfortunately i was still a kid when he passed. would've loved to hear stories, but then again the pacific theater was probably not something a lot of fighters would want to remember. what i do remember was my mom's retelling of her mom's stories. more specifically the last day of my grandma's class before the japanese invasion. the principal called everyone into the open field, just teachers and little kids huddled up by the flagpole. *this will be the last time we will meet, class. take care of your families. run up into the mountains and go into hiding.* i just can't ever imagine that scene ever in my lifetime.
there are ways to find service records if you're so inclined, but you need to know where to look and you need a bit of luck as a lot of us wwii service records got lost in a fire
american prisoners of the japs... honestly a toss up as to which was worse.
oh i never thought about that, i will have to look into that, thank you!
i got told a funny story from a pilot, "i used to drink, drink a lot.. well one night before we are due to fly out on a mission over to germany me and the squad play a few games harmless fun really. so i wake up the next day with one hell of a hang over you see, then as we are flying we end up in a dog fight with the germans, i of course got shot down almost right away, still have a bullet in my hip. so i don't drink anymore" customer at a pub i had once.
vietnam was also very different. ww2 soldiers came home as heroes. the public opinion is that they were heroes. vietnam? they came home to chants of "baby killer". they live with the knowledge that, at best, they took part in a war that they ultimately lost and their buddies died for a reason they struggle to really understand. from what i recall of my dad and his stories of serving, he never came off as proud of his time served, only that it hardened him and made him a man. even as a kid, i remember thinking that was a small reward for being shot at.
i see. thanks so much. i love listening to war stories.
so much this. my grandpa never spoke about the war until his very final years. even then it was only to the younger vets who came around to visit. there was a group of them who would go around to the older vets in the area to visit and spend time with them. he opened up with a few stories and they're the only ones my mother had ever heard because he never wanted them to know the burden he had to bear.
i agree with you 100%. it takes a lot to break these men down, they've been to hell and back. at least the soviet men had, that's to my knowledge. yet to meet a usa vet.
like every govt, the canadian govt fucked up a few times too. we're friendly, but not perfect. should it be of interest, a group is going back to court this year to get us our land back once and for all. my grandparents are excited by the idea, i told them to forget the land and go for the cash. you don't want blow-up, contaminated land and water tables. i remember finding an old bomb when i was a kid on "our" land. i was about 10 and really excited to check out this old green rusty thing... understandably my parents dropped a deuce and i never got to touch it (thankfully. also the military dealt with it). the land is a liability. i would like to see them pay my family for the land properly... with interest. maybe then my great-grandfather could rest in peace. edit. yeah, it's a sore spot for sure!
27 million soviet citizens died in the war against the germans. never forget that.
no way you say...? op you scumbag how dare you repost this photo for the 19th time!??
and honestly, this guy deserves to reposted more. not everyone sees these posts, there's new users each day that find this interesting.
right? fuck that's sad, i want to just carry him over there, be it on my back or a chair with wheels
i don't think so. ever needed a wheelchair before? your thighs are enormous muscles - it's pretty damn exhausting to make your arms do their work.
but it hurt his feelings real bad and now it's hurting my feelings real bad
the article on snopes said the russian soldiers could be as young as 13, so take now instead of high school age kids fighting in the war they could be as young as 8th grade age .
garlic prawns are some good shit. swing by a fish and chippie.
*allied* prisoners of the japs - what they did to the aussies and kiwis (and others) was beyond barbaric.
my grandpa was an irish immigrant who enlisted in the marine corps to gain his citizenship, as did his brother john. while my grandpa was on a ship, waiting to go to okinawa, he received word that his brother was wounded by a japanese grenade on iwo jima. he said that it was the happiest moment of his life, because he knew that his brother was going home and that he would be okay.
it was still possible to lie about your age and get in back then. there were men who served as young as 14 or 15.
also if a person has emotions rush over them and cries, that's awesome. sit in that with them and you are really living.
i read "life and fate" by vasily grossman, i am not from russia, and i can totally understand what soviet men went through.
absolutely. war is utterly savage, and if this opens up someone's eyes when it gets posted, totally worth it. if it was being posted every other day or week, or maybe even every month for a long period however. then i could understand it to a degree.
that's understandable and fair, and i agree. no one should take credit for another's work. or spread false information.
i actually have a really close friend born without legs and she moves around on her arms and a skateboard, she does have a chair but doesn't like it
definitely less bulky and easier to pick up and get back onto.
get a battered save and a chiko roll while your at it.
the higgins boats. why didn't they design them to open on both sides instead? or the rear? the shore defense would then have to choose one side or the other.
it's also, arguably, the only war that america has entered that could really be considered justified. not to put any other servicemen down, but really, when the enemy is literally hitler, that fight just kind of sells itself.
this is true. my grandmother had her uncle forge her papers so she could join the marine corps before she was of proper age. she is 92 years old right now but the goverment thinks she is 94.
yeah, my dad served in vietnam as well. he was a doctor in the navy and served in 1971. he passed away some years ago, but if he had lived he'd be 87 today.
this, right here, is the best piece of advice you can get. write it down.
because that dude thinks he is the f'ing reddit police, it looks like all he does is report reposts and other such chaos that is destroying the fabric of our very existence. i have never seen this post before, but i guess if i wasn't on r/pics that one afternoon that it was posted, i should never have an opportunity to see this picture
i think it was so they could fit jeeps on them and drive them off
my great-grandfather lied to join up for wwi. they found out once he got wounded. but he went and served in wwii as well haha.
imagine the context of signing up for world war 2 to escape for domestic racism.. damn that must have been even more brutal than i am picturing.
i also want to write the stories down. just compile them all up.
i got to see one of the twelve(?) that's left about five years ago on memorial day. there was a ww2 vet kind of nearby and he just stood there and looked at the higgins boat for a looooooong time. he had a mixture of pain and happiness on his face. he seemed happy to hear there were only 12 of the boats left.
what did change, in the years after, however, was that amphibious assaults in open landing craft largely went away. look at the marine corps' amphibious assault vehicle. and if you want to get to a beach of your choice, fast, the lcac. or even better, the helicopter
i had a friend who was born in england and lied about his age, too. he said he was 18. he was barely 16. when i met him, he was in his 60's. he emigrated to canada and became friends with a "gerry" a man who'd been on the opposite side of that war. they were adamantly anti-war, shared bits and pieces of their experiences, but always hesitated to share in front of us any real details. i'm sure they talked more specifically
my fraternal grandfather didn't want me to join any service, him and his 4 brothers were in ww2, he lost 2 brothers a month apart the 3rd was permanently disabled. my maternal grandfather was a navy lifer in korea and wanted me to join. my grandfather said "we fought so you don't have to" i am the only male left in our family line so i think that was also a factor.
thought you meant one of the twelve ww2 vets left and got a little depressed for a moment.
true, but never since d-day has an invasion force come ashore to invade an entire ***continent***. mind boggling.
thats all i can think of when i see the name grindelwald
okay so who else is a bit miffed that we're getting depp rather than farrell for the big bad? honestly, i've rarely seen any actor who can do a villain quite as good as colin farrell.
yeah, have you seen those kids running around with his mark tattooed on their arms or as bumper stickers!? tasteless.
is your emoji a mischievous smile with a unibrow or a frown face with a block head?
an adorable kitten making shallow claw marks along the shaft of his throbbing erection, while ivanka trump reads mein kampf while wearing only a thin layer of axle grease. you know...a traditional christmas.
i wish i could do exactly this everyday of my life
that was my first thought. imagine living in a place like that.
actually, you're not far off! the village has two mountain railways terminate there (wengernalpbahn and berner oberland-bahn), and there are three more (plus two funiculars) very nearby.
having read the book first in german i definitely agree, i was like "wait, that's not a name, that's a place..."
won't lie, hard to find places in europe more expensive than switzerland. food, hotels, drinks add on 30-40% over a normal european trip prices. transport maybe add on 40-45%. to be honest even these are optimistic. in saying that, it is as beautiful as you would imagine. the whole country is splendid. but a pro-tip for someone wanting these views while on a budget would be austria. the alps run through both countries, and the views on the austrian side are just as good. meanwhile the cost would be about the western european average or below. just run a google image search of swiss alps and another of austrian alps and try tell which one is nicer.
my two year old won't watch it. it kinda bummed me out, but now i'm happy i didn't have to watch it 42 times in a month.
i wonder what kind of shoes could make someone hate a whole town
this place like most of western europe struggles for snow over christmas. it is not normally this covered until mid january. christmas in canada is something i would like to try.
i can see why dumbledore was in love with grindelwald. it's beautiful there!.
isn't that the dark wizard that dumbledore had the hots for?
well it was polyjuice so the possibility is there that we will get colin farrell back as a good guy in the next movie
no one has answered you for all this time. i'm pretty sure this is a cow.
many monarchs children go to switzerland to study. it's quite phenomenal.
it's expensive, but not ridiculous - two-bedroom flats can go for below 400k francs and small houses for less than 800k. there is a law against more than 20% of swiss towns being holiday homes, so that's driving prices up for foreigners. the real difficulty is finding a steady job within a decent travel time, especially in the deep winter when the roads can be dangerous.
and here i am in houston just wishing it wasn't 80 degrees on christmas
whoops. thought i cropped that part out. but it was truly a beautiful place.
seriously, the worst part of that movie. johnny depp can be great (see: black mass, the first pirates). but as soon as they revealed him, instead of uber-voldemort blondie popular and charismatic wizard hitler, it was weird for the sake of weird wizard mortdecai. and before the reveal, he was everything i could want for the character. ugh such a let down.
after seeing fbawtft, who wouldn't have the hots for him
was actually self-transfiguration, not polyjuice, but your point still stands.
well the movies have never actually done justice to a wizard's duel from the books so far, so i'm not optimistic to begin with. i'm just gonna take these with a grain of salt and then wait a decade or a half for the inevitable reboot.
i agree, doesn't really feel like christmas here, maybe i'm wrong but it just felt like it was always colder here around this time when i was younger, hell most of the trees haven't even lost their leaves and i'm still periodically cutting grass, so it's almost as though summer never left....
that felt nice, it brought a smile to my face on a day i was sure was going to be bad. thank you.
canada is very large, so there are bound to be green places, but there are areas that are perennially well snowed.
in winnipeg, getting ready for some xmas shovelling.
i'm in denver and we don't have much snow either. we got some about a week ago and we were supposed to get some tonight but the forecast changed
a lot of us see it, but the hot fuzz reference is funnier.
yea collin ferrel kicked so much ass and looked great while doing it. i like johnny depp a lot but i wasn't impressed with his little snippet in the movie.
i have recently developed such a huge appreciation for him. we need him in more movies.
not really, the movie was written by j.k. rowling herself... but i do agree that the books tend to be much better.
pretty sure that's going to happen in fantastic beasts 5
in pottermore, an official website with lore written by jk rowling that's not in the books, she stated something along the likes of dumbledore having a crush on grindelwald before their epic duel.
it's unreal. the most beautiful place i've been to on my travels, no doubt.
after, that's actually what i meant... lights from the traffic.
i feel like it was colder when i was younger as well. i remember at least needing a jacket on christmas.
former miami resident, can confirm the seasons are hot as fuck, and not quite hot as fuck but still pretty hot.
yes, i know. the point of my comment was to point out that lots of canada is just like grindelwald in terms of snow, and won't look like pic related until mid to late january. "christmas in canada" isn't necessarily an idyllic postcard experience.
me too! my fiance is flying out tomorrow morning to visit her parents for christmas. thank goodness the snow isn't coming until the afternoon.
agreed, but depp is a good actor. if we're lucky, he may turn out to be excellent at the role when he actually gets to act grindelwaldy
definitely not just you. when he's given good material, colin farrell is excellent
oh boy option 1 could've been so cool! a little too close to what happens in the core series, but war against voldemort always seemed to parallel the war against grindelwald.
fright night is a great movie, due to two brilliant starring performances. both colin and anton (rip you beautiful man)
i found the book duel to be ... kinda boring. also the film duel was too long. in the book they just circle each other and talk and then they cast one spell and then it's over ... no battle really. but it was fitting. i liked it as it didnt feel out of place or anything but i must say it was rather anticlimactic.
totally. maybe with a little wand foreplay in movie 4.
but being gay and having romantic relations with another character are two different things. the former has been confirmed, but i've yet to see confirmation of the latter point.
corpus here. i love the warm weather but then again i'm originally from michigan
another minnesotan! it seems like there are tons of us on reddit!
calgary got about 10cm of snow in the last day, looking pretty awesome!
is it true that there is a place in a man's head that, if you shoot it, it will blow up?
yea i hope so i haven't not liked depp in anything i have seen him in he is great at becoming a character.
it was newt who cast revelio thought i'd just answer a few questions from below. he would have been "screened", however he was the voldemort of his time. he has the ability to defend himself against the spells and queenie reading his mind. the reason he was "revealed" at the end, wasn't because he they failed to screen him before, but rather that he wanted do be revealed. he wasn't worried, he was proud. he had already done what he wanted, which was to infiltrate the ministry and to find the obscurus and control it. with the obscurus "killed" (we do see part of it float away as newt smirks at it), his current task is over. his new challenge is ahead of him, and the papers will throw his name around once more.
thing is, the book final battle was symbolic in multiple ways. it was a good buildup with a good payoff. while in the movie we get another generic lights fest. colliding spell beams (which is supposed to be extremely rare), and voldemort disintegrating at the end, thus preserving his mystique as a supernatural being. instead of harry finally taking him down at the burst of dawn, surrounded by his family, friends and supporters, voldemort is taken down in some far off castle courtyard with just the two of them. heck, harry's word is the only thing people have to even support the fact that voldy is dead, especially since he *disappeared the same way 18 years ago and subsequently came back*. so yeah, these are the problems i have with the movie ending compared to the book one. a few of them at least.
yeah that's a good point. i mean i was into it at first, but when they brought out the ball gag and the riding crop i thought thought it was to much.
he was in love with grindelwald but the feeling was not mutual and i doubt dumbledore ever told him. pretty sure jk has directly stated this somehere.
in san antonio. we're going to wear our christmas sweaters, grin and bear it.
the worst part is i forgot my workshirt at home and i'm stuck with my hoodie cashiering and pushing carts
you've had to keep yourselves occupied since the events that occurred in 2006.
some of us are driving to edmonton in the morning. looks great. scary as fuck.
and seriously? i mean the guy's high up in the magical police, and they didn't screen him with a basic spell even once?
he may have existed at one point, but do you really think grindelwald let him live?
awwww man! well hopefully people are kind and your day doesn't suck too much! good luck and merry christmas!!!
yeah that's not a drive i would want to be making. safe travels!
that's kinda my thinking, but he could have imperio'd people. he is supposedly the most powerful dark wizard of all time
i've heard the actor is coming back, so either the answer to your question is yes, or grindlewald is reusing his disguise, which doesn't seem fitting
my mind can't actually comprehend what -40 would feel like. i pray i never find out.
this is the mcmarketing manager's equivalent of a presidential 3am phone call
it's the most accurate advertising for mcdonald's i've ever seen.
it's the little things, like the cup slightly pushing outwards as the coffee pours, just like someone flexing his ass muscles to evacuate...
looks like he cut out the motion in the gif to just a square around the hole to decrease file size, and left the background as the first frame in gif...?
so, without people drawing in the little hands, it wouldn't look like anything remarkable at all. what...why...?
this is just commercial diarrhea. warm ads just pouring out all over our faces.
you can cut the wait time in half by going with a mcgriddle. better than getting your colon irrigated.
this is why he chain smokes cigarettes, became emotionally distant from his wife and is always angry at the dog.
it's free viral marketing for them and besides, it's a joke, everyone knows mcd's makes you constipated.
until they see this. two cheeks one cup. i recall the last video doing quite well.
fuckin reddit. post has a brand in it, even though it's negative, it's probably advertising.
it makes you get diarrhea? seems like most redditors have digestion issues.
what is a lucky 10k? i'm not good at reddit, all i do is make unpopular opinion posts on controversial political threads and farm down votes. so this leads me to my question, is this a thing or a woosh?
somebody's blowing into the cup for effect. if they didn't add positive pressure, the coffee would have just dribbled out of the hole. they masked out the rest but were too lazy to do more than crop out the money shot with a rectangular mask. source: video editor
it's mittens, right? because all i can see is goatse. trying to find something else but i don't know if its some kind of rorschach blob.
keep in mind this was all a blur to me because of how long ago it was. some of the details could be wrong. when i was around 10 years old (i'm 28 now) i wanted to download either some kind of a dbz emulator or some kind of dbz game you played in a chatroom or irc or something. i don't really remember. what i do remember was in order to either play/download the game, a message popped up saying i had to have my parents permission and for them to accept the terms. so i called my dad over to help me download the game. long story short, we clicked on a link and a 1024 x 768 picture of goatse popped up. my dad hysterically closed the window and we both walked away from the computer without saying a word. that was some 4chan level unethical pranking right there. who thinks to create shit like that?
somebody thought the mittens looked like butt cheeks to begin with, otherwise they wouldn't have added the hands ;)
i'd say this gif is an accurate allegory of 2016.
mcgriddles leave that weird filmy feeling on my mouth like the fries at burger king. i can't stand it.
i don't know why people seem to have such sensitive digestive systems that are affected so wildly by different fast food places
honestly, nothing will probably happen. it's costly to change all the graphics and marketing material during a campaign in rush order, especially in the volume they would need. the reason they probably won't though is that this will create a buzz that really isn't that bad pr wise, especially since people will go buy these cups, which includes buying the hot chocolate, and there isn't enough people out there that would waste that money creating diarrhea spewing butt cups lol
that's honestly how you advertise to cynical teenagers though.
the aim of marketing is to get the public talking about your product. they just adapted to the new era of social media and memes instead of just print advertising and tv spots.
yeah, i know. strangely, i feel more inclined to go to mickey ds now - maybe just to be part of the macro crude humor of it all.
either a lot of redditors have issues with their digestion, or their local mcd/taco bell/indian place/any place have poor hygiene standards.
this makes sense. as stated above, the animated part of the coffee coming out was isolated and placed over a still image of the cup to reduce the image size, and/or to hide somebody's face blowing on the cup to force the coffee to flow out instead of just dribble down the side of the cup, as you stated. when they blow on the cup, the cup expands making it not match up exactly with the still frame of the cup we did it reddit
either two boxing gloves or two casper the friendly ghosts.
quick, buy all the cups now and take em to pawn stars in a few years!
and if corporate brings it up afterwards, "wh...well my goodness! i never!" (casually draws dick landscapes while on the phone)
i don't know, showing shit coming out of a mcdonalds coffee cup is a pretty powerful message.
i mean, it's not called mcdonald's because they like ducks...
that's the mentality of the two-dimensional jenga player.
30 minutes after my morning coffee (real coffee not maccas coffee) and i'm poopin toilet or no toilet. only really happens in the morning though...
well if you think arse mittens excreting a constant stream of steaming kaka is not negative then fair play my friend.
has been like this for years. taco bell has been doing this self-deprecating style marketing on reddit for quite a while now (actually they seem to have let up lately)
there was a couple of milliseconds back in 1976 when no one on earth was telling a lie. things were shit before then and have gone to shit since then.
when a company stays relevant like this, people who are thinking about mcdonald's now think to themselves, "do i want mcdonald's today, or no?" even if only 20% say yes, that's a huge bump in sales. whereas, if most of those people weren't even thinking about mcdonald's, most wouldn't even think to go. that's why they say there's no bad publicity. i was comparing it to donald trump elsewhere on this thread. during the election, he constantly said insane things, like calling for a registry of muslims. you know what the result of that was? he stayed on the front page of news sites throughout the election. he made the election all about him. near the end, everyone was talking about how people should vote against trump. no one was saying people should vote *for* hillary. trump controlled what people were talking about and made sure they were talking about him.
is it though? horse shit is basically grass and usually dry and crumbly, allowing you to easily knock it off. dog shit is gonna smear all up in your treads and the only way to ever get it off is with a hose.
"this here is actually a wonderful piece of americana. it's a mcdonald's cup, circa 2016. and these actually had a limited release, because, if you look right here at the mittens, people punched holes in it. when the cup was filled with coffee, the graphics appeared to be a human hind end defecating all over the place." "oh, wow. that is interesting. was that intentional?" "no. it wasn't intentional. so, they actually pulled these from stores relatively quickly. there were, however, a few people who got together on one of the old-time internet websites and decided to collect as many as they could. still, there aren't many of these around any more. i'd say, at auction, you could probably get 100, 200 dollars for this cup alone." -antiques roadshow ca.2087
oh lord, german surnames ... i used to work with a koch, first name, rhoda. you would murder your parents in cold blood, you really would.
you'll live. we all did. it's like a whole party of lemons. a lemon party.
i mean that's understandable. caffeine stimulates your bowels. can't for the life of me figure out why mcdonalds would make you constipated though
this post is such a blatent plant/advertisment its unreal. i mean just look at the image lol. that wasn't taken on someones phone as they went to their local mcdonalds.
treads? naw. you gotta go barefoot so you can feel it all warm and squishy between your toes.
idk, cleaning my shoes 1000 times seems a bit more tedious.
yeah i'm not a fan but the "it's either good or it's total complete shit" mentality that everyone has is mildly annoying
amend that to roughly $3 and you're probably a bit closer. i learned a long time ago that people care less about this stuff in the future than you'd think
oh there's some good names out there. in my brother's year of secondary school there was a byron wankling. he got so, so much shit that he changed his name the day he reached 18, the poor stain.
someday there will be some kind of law against reckless "googling without consent", its "digital discrimination!" we'll say.
i don't know what store you go to, but my mcdonalds locations that i go to (canada) are really good :]
they probably don't digest/eliminate well to begin with.
looking a second time at this gif, i have to agree with you. focused cup and blurred out background. carefully placed plant to give you a good contrast (red cup on green-white background). cup rightly turned so you can clearly see the logo and the message in all caps "get free".
we say maccas in england as well, or maccy's (sp?)
you must mean it's totally and completely annoying.
its just a technique to make it loop better. they do more complicated stuff in /r/cinemagraphs
best i can do is $1.50. let me call my guy that specializes in stuff like this...
i don't know. when your camera focuses on something in the foreground, doesn't the background naturally go blurry? i agree about the plant, unless someone brought it into an office bathroom or something.
that's normally how cameras work. the lower your aperture (larger opening) the shorter your field of focus will be. anything outside of that field will blur, or is technically known as 'bokeh'. some phones are capable of this on some level now. i'm not familiar enough to know if they're managing to do it with hardware or software, but knowing how it works for my dslr it's likely a software thing. by comparison my dslr can get an even narrower field of focus using the right lenses... and i'm not even using something professional to do it. on plants, could just be near a sink... since you know, this would make a huge disgusting mess if you didn't use a sink. i'm all for pointing out factual evidence that someone is pretending to be your average redditor when they are in fact a massive corporation, but saying bokeh means they're a shill is a bit of a farce for me.
my 4 year old samsung s4 can get some reasonable bokeh with it's fixed f2 lens but not nearly as much as in the video. i do however know that the new iphones can do it with software because dual camera. also why is the butt sliding down as the gif progresses?

i knew there was no such thing as santa clause when i noticed he had the same birthmark on his cock as my uncle.
regular speed and *then* slo-mo shoukd be the standard.
a set of toddlers, a labrador, and a big-assed ball like that in the yard has kids spilling everywhere. it's glorious. there is something about toddlers ducking and rolling that hits the funny button.
also it looked to me that is expression didn't change at all not even a little. kid is an assassin. polite, professional and has a plan to kill everyone he meets.
i think that was recoil, not melodrama. remember, those children weigh about 30 pounds each and their brains haven't totally mastered coordination yet. a fitness ball to the head would probably have some impact.
*"mommy says people my age shouldn't suck their thumbs."*
that guy has the worst reactions imaginable. it's like his subconscious reflexes are trying to harm him.
a compilation video with a wicked backing track and the right parts put into slow-mo.
you say that, but there's a lot of old farts like me that play overwatch because there's plenty of characters that don't rely on precise twitchy hitscanning.
i feel like until the last year or two this was always standard procedure in video clips...then all of a sudden everything changed. i'm thinking slow mo just became more accessible to the average idiot uploader.
it's like he was evolutionarily programmed to die.
nothing says "children falling over" like papyrus!
i think it's impressive that he keeps getting up and doing his best to defend the goal. he shrugs off that first kick like nothing and is ready to take a second and possibly a third if need be. that's dedication. i also think it's hilarious that he got hit twice in the face. it in no way means he's a bad player, but come on... that's just funny.
the next video meme. my life flashes before my eyes but the cool parts are slow motion and every birthday speeds it up by 5%
i am too an old fart now who plays overwatch for the same reasons :p
we had quake iii installed on all of the school computers in 2006. we didn't learn squat during computer lessons.
when shooting slo mo, a lot of phones *only* shoot in slow motion. so there's never a regular speed version to upload. the rise of slow motion mobile cameras is why more and more times now, you only see the slow motion version. before, if someone wanted slo mo, they'd slow the video down manually. it's just that no one ever thinks to *speed* their slow motion videos *up* manually
my mom had a slightly more lax litmus. if my limbs were still attached and pointing in the appropriate directions and enough blood was still inside my body to keep my major organs functioning then i was fine and get back outside.
www.taima.tv/r/mxc plays all episodes on constant loop. some are missing currently (videos are pulled from dailymotion) but 90% is there. surprisingly good to put on and have in the background.
thank goodness he lives in a society that allows the unfit to continue thriving!... with the occasional ball shot.
funny is an opinion so you're right in that sense. i wasn't debating if it was funny i guess i was just voicing about the nuance there is between 1)"haha, that coincidence is funny" and 2) "haha, that guy's an idiot."
dagobah, jolly rancher, cum box, and so many more of the greats.
okay so someone needs to write an un-slowmo app. who's got this one?
same for you, lol i see you x-posted this to /r/wastedgifs :)
tank veigar is fun if you're actually decent at csing. your passive scales well and you're an unkillable stunbot with an execute.
i just like get the giggles worse and worse every line knowing what's coming.
what were dagobah and jolly rancher? i know cum box but not the others
good eye! i checked if he had posted it there, thinking someone like that had to have done that. and yeah, i took my chance when i noticed he hadn't :p .
if you would, you'd be my favorite person ever and i'll give you my first born child! :d
don't ask questions you don't really wanna know the answer to.
what's the difference between a crow and a jackdaw?
and renting out prisons to norway. norwegian prisoners are sent to the netherlands, because there are no vacancies in our prisons.
burlington police are pretty damn legit. gave me plenty of noise violations but they were always warranted. vt also came so close to being the only state where police didn't kill anyone last year, then they shot a drug dealer in december.
long ago i made a subreddit just for this type of content but it never caught on: /r/peopleholdingsigns
but don't you dare say a word against it, or you're "soft on crime".
i forget where i read it but apparently steve buscemi volunteered with the new york fire department after 9/11!
i'm going to be in burlington next month! i'm so excited! my best friend has lived there since 2004 and i lived there for the summer of 2007. haven't been since 2012. i can't wait!
well, the people, food, scenery, and booze are amazing. absolutely unparalleled. there aren't many jobs though, and the ones there are barely pay for the overpriced housing. its a tough place to live, but if you can make it work, its heaven.
this. for-profit prisons must be the stupidest idea ever.
yeah good luck with that trend continuing with your lovely new president elect.
which is funny because when he was hired people here did nothing but bitch and moan because they didn't want a former nypd cop in charge.
fortunately, that stuff happens way more than you would think. unfortunately, that stuff never makes the news. only the 1 in 10,000 officers that abuses their power makes the headlines and people assume that is the norm.
don't say it won't or can't happen just because shit's fucked now. there are always people looking to make things better. have a little faith.
fox would put him on o'reilly's show and just beat the piss out of him. "there's going to be criminals and you don't want to jail them! this. is. a. police. chief. in. america. people. "
yeah, that'd be nice, remember the backlash when obama tries to allow felons to disclose their status during the interview instead of before it, or when we made it so felons could never vote ever again for the rest of their lives?
so the dutch should build a wall to keep out norwegians because they're only sending their worst, their murderers and rapists... i mean, i'm sure their are some nice norwegians, but not those that are coming over. and i bet norway is paying to send them over as well. til netherlands/norway is really the european us/mexico
something... wouldn't work in america because... something... homogenious population... taxes... socialism... rabble rabble rabble
i was up there in high school for a hockey tournament. we were 16-18 on the team staying in a hotel without our parents. i had a truck at the time and me and a couple other kids on the team pulled a "hey mister" to get us beer. we pull behind the store, he comes out, hands us the beer, we drive off and a cop immediate pulls behind us. i'm freaking out as i've had my license for maybe a year. he eventually pulls us over. -"do you know why we pulled you over?" "no" -"what are you guys doing?" "we're up here for a hockey tournament....we're cruising for girls..." -"oh, well you pulled out the wrong way on a one-way street back there. you guys must be lost. drive down two blocks and hang a left, you'll find girls down there." "thanks officer!" burlington police are the only police i love
well, i have a good feeling about this guy who works at the gas station i go to...
you're challenging redditors, never challenge redditors
so then agree and calmly explain that you should be soft on non violent criminals because throwing them in prison does absolutely nothing for them just make sure you express both non violent, and that they still severely need help
basically we didn't have enough prisoners to put in the cells so we started renting them out to other countries (e.g. the danish and belgians sent their prisoners to stay in our prisons) but that wasn't enough either, so instead the government decided to just close a bunch of prisons instead.
he was a career firefighter prior to 9/11 and prior to his acting career, he left career firefighting for acting but returned to his former station/firehouse and helped out with his old mates.
good luck trying to get heady topper if that's on your list of things to do.
oh, i agree. the system of punishment we have is ineffective and draconian, an embarrassment.
1 in 10,000 huh? i'd love to read that source, but let's not pretend that every act of abuse is plastered in the media. additionally, i'm sure the other 9,999 were busy hiding behind a billboard with a radar gun, as oppossed to making a visible presence to deter speeding.
and they're going to come to your house in white bread suburbia in the middle of the night and rape your children!!
in some cities i imagine quotas began to ensure that the cops actually did stuff (whether that's just to generate revenue or not is another discussion). in places like nyc then the number of arrests and summonses given out by cops in a given precinct or unit was used to a: evaluate the effectiveness of their boss and b: evaluate how their activity influenced the crime trends. this data is what the department in nyc lives on. (it's called comstat) it often created a false picture that more activity must equal lower crime and that was the standard metric for a long time. at first it was probably valuable but it definitely seemed to generate diminishing returns over the long haul.
its not about individuals being good or bad. its about a system which rewards loyalty over what is right and shields its members from the "justice" it imposes on the public. a good person can and often will behave "badly" in this type of system and a bad person will behave worse.
agreed. people wonder why recidivism rates are so high when no matter what penance someone pays, we will always view them as criminals. unless you're rich.
kind of. pascal sauvage was planning to take the throne of england so he could convert the entire country into one big mega prison. australia mk ii if you will.

of course they pay. anything to achieve the right to use medical marijuana while imprisoned for using marijuana.
"fundamentally, states have totally different types of barbeque and pizza, so they're like way more different than any two european countries like france or australia. it just wouldn't work because we guarantee free speech which no other country in the whole milky way does, and plus we don't have the money to spend on things like rehabilitation because we're the world police and ensure every other country on earth is safe from terror, so basically we're like the country equivalent of jesus, except our sacrifice is greater"
well i bet redditors can't build a fusion reactor... /hope
crumpled paper only works for expert analysts over at /r/gonewild
this is basically what cost democrats the white house over and over until they wised up and bill clinton ran as "tough on crime" (and was, vastly expanding the programs responsible for police militarization in the name of the war on drugs). however good rational approaches to crime are, they are absolutely toxic for politicians. it's just too easy to trot out murderers and rapists and be like "tommy democrat wants these guys walking around freeeee! eooooooooooooo!"
yes, that's what i was trying to say. the fact that it's his goal makes it admirable, regardless of the reality of his goal.
oh wow. that's a good thing right? unless the reason behind it is that crimes go un(der)punished
i've heard! one year for sure, and philadelphia is close enough to make an overnight trip out of it.
it's always on my list. it's usually not hard to find in burlington though. did something happen?
actually catching and people over is the real deterrence to speeding.
exactly this. human beings act in their own interests most of the time. "good" people will act to preserve a bad system if they have a vested interest in doing so, rationalising their behaviour by convincing themselves it's for the common good, when it's anything but.
the majority of bad cops are handled. the minority that aren't would be the result of bad police chiefs, like you said.
these sound amazing. not go go all americocentric, but is there some way to procure those in a typical american city (e.g. big, but not nyc or anything)? source: am american. cronut? i don't know...
isn't it the other way around? in selecting who's sent to the netherlands, they choose the ones that has no family or other close contacts in norway that would help their stay in prison. so norwegian prisoners with family and friends in norway will no be sent. it is rather the lithuanian burglars without any family that get sent to the netherlands.
dude you joke, but i moved from boston to kansas any holy shit the pizza out here is inedible.
seriously though, maple syrup makes you eat pancakes, and who's going to go risk their life in for power and glory after eating pancakes?
oh shit! i know that guy from the thumbnail picture on the front page one click ago. small world.
i bet redditors can't get a girlfriend. who isn't my mom.
i guess get a real job where you actually make something that benefits society? sounds like hard work... lets just keep locking up people who do drugs.
those type of people need some real help/rehabilitation. throwing them in a jail cell for a while and kicking them back out on the streets with nothing gained or learned isn't going to improve anyone.
a politician is only as good as the electorate. you need a rigourous, thorough and varied education system to run the ticket of "i'm doing these emotionally unsatisfying policies because they get objective results that are good for everyone." and actually win. voting is a skill.
oh yeah, it's a good thing. few weeks ago it was in the news that our crime rate had fallen for the 10th year in a row or something.
do the lights out remix. it's totally dark, and all you get is a glowstick. don't do it if you have a tendency to swing at people without thinking about it when you're threatened.
hurricane irene flooded out the alchemist (the brewery that makes heady topper). they didn't have much space for a few years. good news though! this summer they opened their new brewery and it's wicked easy to get here
"handled" meaning quietly fired or shuffled around without consequences.
had a look, and, apparently, yes. mostly. according to the prison service, as of a little over one year ago, 193 prisoners were transferred or in the process. 26 of these were norwegian. 20 of the norwegian prisoners objected to the transfer. so, fortunately, it's mostly foreigners, who should presumably not be any less at home in the netherlands than in norway. but it's gotta suck to be a norwegian prisoner and get shipped off against your will when prison capacity has unquestionably been busted due to "tourists".
not to mention, you can barely move after a full stack.

well you see son, i don't think that fly with your mother.
most of the bicycle police officers i've known of are really nice! i get the feeling that they really care about the community when i've talked to them, and i think that's important in a time where people are trying to figure out how the police can best protect the public.
sadly, i fear we are in aforementioned "dire situation". we have been slowly conditioned to accept this but if you take a step back and look: we are truly in a bad place as a nation.
exactly. and some people even make more gang connections in prison than they would have if they were placed in some sort of rehab program.
so certain political organisations would benefit from communities receiving poor education is the flip side of that right?
i remember when that happened. i heard they were about to start distributing it outside of the state. mega bummer. i live in los angeles now, but whenever i'm home(ct) my friend meets me with a couple 4 packs. it's a staple of a visit home. it's rare to find outside of vt, but in burlington relatively easy.
or you can go to the brewery and have it on draft! i need to move...
you got a source that states that's how most cases are handled?
soooo, there isn't a subreddit for anything? it had to happen at some point i guess
it's probably best if you make it so they can't get a job. also, be sure to employ some sadistic people as parole officers so they can quickly be violated and put back where they belong. try to get as many of them as possible on the sex offenders' registry so there's almost nowhere they can live or work. they did bad things, so they deserve it. /s (in case i need it)
if that'd has been us prison numbers 19,300 were transferred 2600 of these were traffic violations 2000 of the prisoners objected to the transfer who am i kidding even my numbers are low
we are both our own continent, in europe via eurovision, in asia via the asian cup and antartica via our territory there. 4 continents in one.
to be fair, it's montreal that doesn't know how to drive, not quebec as a whole. i'd also say that they do *know* how to drive, they just don't give a fuck and only think about their own little selves. basically, they are like every big cities i've been to. self-centered assholes. great town to party, though. only new orleans was crazier, in my experience.
to be extra fair- i am minnesotan and french canadian (durand, cardinal, lemere) and german. i am not a bit scandanavian! we're the state of hockey, have similar accent, and we make fine beers- let. us. in. canada!
we have 5% of the world's population, 25% of the worlds imprisoned population.
hey vote for me, i'm the right person, plus i'm endorsed by your party, and in addition i'm **tough on crime**. people get elected based off of those last 3 words, it's fucking ridiculous.
this is so true. then you get out and you're known :/
well, put it this way, there were a good few kings and sultans that banned the printing press when it was first invented.
most can't actually. there are employee privacy laws that restrict what an employer can say about you in most states unless there is a public proceeding associated with it or the individual consents.
and you're the most important/infuriating territory in risk. you have it all.
i feel so sorry for the kid. god damnit lady, you overfed me again.
that seems the very definition of the word "dire" to me.
no one has ever been elected for saying they'll "be easy on crime!" for the simple reason that people don't understand the way the system works. they think, "oh, great, this person will *stop crime from happening.*" thinking that being "tough" on something is equivalent to putting an end to it. in the words of trump: sad!
right, but when a legitimate case gets brought before the public out of reach of any privacy laws, then it's known.
you forgot them not being able to find meaningful employment ever again as well.
they're only infuriating if you have no patience. hardly any region bounus, so if you're in the situation where someone is turtling there, just build up and transfer for a bit before attacking. north and south america are the smart play. same region bounus as asia with both, but if you have both there are only three points of entry.
agreed. this is 100% justified. when he got out of the car and pointed at the cop my heart skipped a beat because i thought he had a gun.
i... i... i can't dammit! you caught me! i hope you're happy!
went to prison for 4 years in arizona for drug and trafficking stolen property. first felony conviction. luckily ended up on a minimum custody yard that had decent jobs. made 25 cents an hour in he auto garage. we had a fleet of 176 state vehicles we worked on. started with no knowledge. i rebuilt motors rebuilt transmissions learned to diagnose problems i did all the front end work in the garage and ran the alignment rack... came out and had several job offers for 16 plus an hour. decided not to work on cars now i remodel houses. doing magazine quality work: been out for just over a year. been clean off of heroin for 4 years.:: 96 percent of the arizona prison population that gets out will go back... i am lucky hat i decided to be a better human when i got out.
i once dated an african lady who didn't speak english. we just clicked.
man your kid must be real smart. i've never seen a baby in my class.
another trick is to text "pizza" and if your teen immediately appears downstairs, he or she is alive. prepare for fallout if you don't actually have pizza.
that reminds me of when a baby eats a lemon for the first time and they don't expect the sensation.
i love how the thumbs is seen before the rest of the hand...
well it's only been thirteen days so that might not be such a wild claim...
run. run. run. jump. i can be a backpack while you run.
omg the image that just gave me was so horrifyingly hilarious, why is this comment so under appreciated??
aww doesn't seem to like babies. this might make it as it's only part of a baby.
i have never seen one with this many as well, i am astounded! i appreciate every one!
wonder how many people didn't get the joke and just up voted because they thought it was a cute story about people getting past barriers
i actually had a baby in my numerical analysis class. he used to bring his mom everywhere, such a nerd.
oh no! you brought tears to my eyes as i empathised with you. my kids are 4 and 1, and i'm already dreading the day i'll have to let them go.
can confirm. when i went to college my mom immediately became my best friend whereas we had basically fought my entire teenaged girl phase.
pretty sure there's some kind of un resolution about falsely claiming there's pizza. if not, there _ought_ to be.
i hear babies' tastebuds are extremely sensitive. it's why baby food is so bland and tasteless. so a lemon is like, holy shit fuck my face is going to shrivel up into itself and implode level bad.
you should write it down and save it for the marriage party.

you're probably deformed & need to go back in for some debugging because biggie straws are delicious.
on the posts that are substantive than a 3 second gif or an otherwise boring close up picture or a woman in bikini, then the comments usually are not about the appearance of the people in the post. when the posts are low-brow or quick one offs, the comments tend to follow in kind. this one doesn't really have any negative comment's or overly lewd ones that were passed off as compliments tho, that i've seen.

the crappy frame rate of the 40 year old film makes it blurry making them appear even faster, but he was still legendary in that regard.
iirc the baby belongs to one of the students but was being fussy so the professor/instructor(?) held it and continued with the class.
i think that name shows the user deals with babies on a regular basis.
in that case, porter, is what i'd have gone with. understandable, if you're not a native english speaker. sky cap man is a kind of an amusing alternative if you had meant pilot.
true that. whenever i have to visit them i remember why i was so eager to move out. i can actually see how my younger brother copies my parents bad behaviors
*if you are such an attractive woman that i can find no fault with your appearance, you surely are employed in the sex industry and frequently perform fellatio.*
i have twins and we always feed them dinner before us, but we know they'll end up wanting to eat our food as well. i thought i was slick by putting hot sauce on my food so they didn't want it. turns out my son is just a vacuum and loves hot sauce. his sister tolerates it but doesn't love it like him. if i'm eating hot wings he'll usually eat a few wings worth of meat covered in frank's by himself. he's only 20 months and is in the top percentile for height and head size. he's literally going to eat me out of house and home when he's a teenager in puberty.
upvotes are used as "i already knew that" buttons.
me too. maybe it's just because i have a baby myself, but this is my favorite thing i've seen on reddit in quite some time.
when you make a really witty comment and feel proud about it, then 3 minutes later see it gets downvoted.
man, they really give the inmates a lot of amenities these days.

you should make sure that he learns how to cook. he might eat you out of house, might as well make it a delicious ride!

damn. i think you're right. and i think i might've already known that but never thought about it til you said it.
a surprising number of halfway intelligent people i've met pronounce and or write "voila" as "wah-lah." i think "viola" is more acceptable than that. but, to your point, i agree, cello is better.
you're the reason their marriage was on the line. you crossed the line, and your parents were in the line of fire. and you're speaking online. so, that must mean you're ... lyin.
that's what my parents did with me. i was abnormally large and by the time i hit 9th grade i was cooking for the family on some nights. really helped me in college and when i eventually got out of school. now i give pointers to my friends who still use the microwave for everything
i can just imagine you hearing morse code and saying "they're speaking line!" only to have another person say "idiot, everyone knows its called 'doot'"
ya know who used morse code? that's right the god damn military...but probably it was the nerds using the radios...shit...here's my lunch money
what's the son have to with with the professor being a body builder?
want to back that up with something? this guy is a professional who made this video to show people how to quiet a baby. the airway doesn't look restricted, they can still move their heads and don't look distressed in the least. one baby lifts its head freely and doesn't take gasps of air. and i don't really think suffocating a baby would stop the crying
i'm going to donate your lunch money to morsecode.io, because looks like their hosting bill has got the better of them. what if you're the last person that ever got the chance to nerdbeeps?
iirc he said that because some people were like "duh, ppl looking like dis cannot be smaht".
oh my god that's terrible news. my roommate was supposed to learn it...we figured out we could use bic lighters to have spark be . and flame be - god damn dingus with his procrastination
my sisters each have a dog. they are about the same age, but one is 40lbs and the other is 11lbs. the little one thinks he's the big boss. he will attack the larger one and she will dramatically fall over as if he knocked her down.
does she by any chance give the crewmembers spankings?
yup. my ex had 2 cats (bro and sis) and a german. the german and the male cat got along great, but not the female cat. however the male cat would switch sides multiple times a day. hilarious to watch.
sounds about right. my cat licks the top of my head all the time.
*inch closer, swat!* dog - not the face!! this was the best part for me
yup. that was no sign of affection, that was "there's something delicious on your snout, sit still or i'll cut you."
it means "we're only playing, right" or that's as well as i can translate it without visuals
my parents' pug beats up their bernese mountain dog. the pug is the size of a large cat, weighs about 7kg. the bernese mountain dog is 6ft tall when he stands on his hind legs, and weighs 55kg. the pug goes full on bezerk mode and has declared himself biggest dog. when the berner gets tired of his shit, he just sits on the pug.
it must be really awkward when your best friend doesn't get along with your family.
so, i should lick my cat's head to assert dominance?
no, they're both exhibiting play behavior. cats flip their tails like that when they're entertained. the licking is the end game, it's how the cat has won. you can see how the cat's objective the whole time is to get closer to the dog. think of the game where you put your hands in someone else's and then try to pull your hands away at the same time that they're trying to slap your hands. every time the cat gets closer without triggering the dog to respond he's won a round of it. but the dog doesn't realize that the lick at the end is the point of the game to the cat, she's trying to entice the cat into a more robust wrestly chasey game like dogs play.
no i'm in charge. no i'm in charge. no i'm in charge. no i'm in charge.
but don't mistake this, all dogs are good boys brent.
i love the thought of both of them strutting around the home thinking they're in charge.
you're a brave soul for considering that. i have a feeling that you'll end up with a cat wrapped around your face and claws in the back of your head.
it can be both at the same time, it basically mirrors what momma cats do to their kittens. a human equivalent would be a pat on the head.
i wish my car was this cute; although i'm not sure i want it licking my face....
"you shall be fed by my royal servant, bob. he's of low intelligence, but he gets the job done."
cats play to win. dogs play to have fun. dogs are "fuckin casuals".
the way cats and dogs show excitement and playfulness is diffrent. we know dogs wag their tails, bow and bark and breath rapidly. cats on the otherhand gets a stiffer posture. the tail will be straight up. the ears as well. cats like making contact by rubbing their body against you or the playmate.
let's really piss err off. i always get the south park version of him in my minds eye.

1/10 don't recommend tongue feels funny now. but really i kiss my cats head all the time. i wonder if that's why he's scared of me when i'm standing up.
this is wonderful. would it be possible for me as a person to enter into a round of get-as-close-as-possible with a cat? what would i do to initiate and what signs should i look for to confirm that the cat wants to play?
it's called the "play stance". i can emulate it with my dog and she immediately knows that it's on.
cats also have physical traits associated with playing or being ok. ears up, relaxed body, absence of hissing, etc..
cats also expose stomach to express trust though.
they're the console gamers, whilst the cats are members of the pcmr
or: "cats like charging at you like an angry hippo who is also a stunt pilot"
and the other way around: some cats will attack small dogs, while avoiding the large ones. and cats try to appear bigger by rubbing their scent on higher branches by standing up, and visually by doing that silly sideways crab-walk with the hair on their tails and back standing up. most catfights are just posturing, unless they are very close to the center of the defensive cat's territory. it's like those western movies where the shooters face each other, but often with one giving up the staring competition instead of shooting/getting shot. i've seen a mexican standoff in my garden, a standoff between two stray cats and our cat. it was like the final scene of the good, the bad and the ugly. and a cat rolling on its belly is not a sign of war, it's a sign of peace or surrender.
the sound effects were ok but then it got zany and that i didn't care for.
i don't have any pets, but i'm sure if i did i would have stories about what they do.
the real answer is that all dogs should behave like that, not just big dogs. my parents 95lb lab mix dog was used for training fighting dogs when she was a puppy and the only dogs she gets along with are well behaved dogs. she gets along with 90% of big dogs and probably only 20% of little dogs. the problem is training. the little dogs shouldn't just be looked at as if they're cute and don't need to behave.
really? i am the mum of my cats, i can scold them, i can hold them down and groom them. and they are very loving and content, it's just that they don't resist (very much) when i have to clip their nails or whatever (to be fair: pills, they *massively* resist - but even so they don't harm me. they just wiggle a lot, clamp jaws shut, fake-swallow and spit the pill out...) my cats have only ever hurt me when playing went too far (and then i corrected them) or when extremely upset and afraid, which happens very very rarely. they don't deliberately hurt me, they would never dare. but they're not timid abused flowers or something, they climb all over me, steal my stuff - they just know the line
fun fact: when you see a video/gif of a dog going bonkers around a crawling baby, it's probably because the dog is interpreting the baby's stance as a play bow.
it's sad when you meet a dog that you know wasn't socialized with other pups. good on you to get him up to speed.
... lack of screeching, lack of fur flying in the air
that would explain my old cat. he never shut the fuck up and shat in a box in the basement.
definitely agree, i watched it without sound the first time until i saw these comments & found it more enjoyable without the cartoony sound effects & music
too many people let their little fuck chihuahua mixes just yap up a storm and then get pissy when my rescue dog gets overwhelmed and snarls/barks back. he's only 45 pounds but built like a tank and has a deep booming bark like he's twice his size, so the owners of the little yappers freak out when he barks back. his best friends are a german shepherd and a weimaraner-lab mix. gets along with them great because they have manners. it's the little yappers antagonizing big dogs that are the problem.
does it hurt more to know they went on shark tank with this product? also that they lived their cat on national television?
my cat is similar. pills are the only real issue. see if your vet can recommend a compounding pharmacy - now i rub the steroid in her ears instead of trying to feed her the pills....i swear she could sense a microgram in anything. it doesnt work on every drug, but it's seriously life-changing for the ones it does work on - and was actually cheaper in my case.
take an upvote. same went for my moms kitty. the cat would have bitch mode days. so my mom carried a squirt bottle and had a small dog cage for the really bad days. the cat fucked with everybody except my mom.
youtube is not typically considered "social media", especially since rule #5 specifically allows youtube posts (unlike facebook, twitter, pinterest, and instagram, etc.).
does she wear a bow tie all the time? that's the only way i can picture a formal wiener dog
my understanding is that, to cats, the one doing the grooming is the dominant one.
my doggo does "the sneeze" to indicate it's playtime as well. it cracks me up!
i licked my cat once and she was offended and appalled. pretty sure i got licked back also - it's disgusting!!! cat hair in your mouth... argh! horrible
blame bran for that one. three eyes raven told him to keep off the tree!
i have two males, and they will both start taking turns grooming each other, but they both get more aggressive as they go, fighting over who grooms who, and it always ends in a wrestling match.
game of thrones season 6 spoiler.....the best part about that whole thing is that raven can see the future, so presumably he knew that bran would go off on his own and attract the attention of the night king. by letting bran into the cave, raven was signing the death warrant of himself and all the children of the forest, but he was forced to let events unfold that way because it led to the creation of hodor, without whom bran surely would have died in the seige of winterfell.
ahh, could never get into game of thrones, unfortunately. i tried, but just couldn't. thanks, though!
i have a big one year old ragdoll who loves to groom my nine week old kitten until he squeaks at her. if he tries to wrestle her she just sits on him.
how much did you try (in terms of episodes)? after the final scene of episode 1 i had to continue watching but wasn't quite convinced yet, then it took me 4 or 5 additional episodes before i was hooked. but i know someone else who never got into it because "the actors hair and faces are too pretty". which is a shame, really.
my dad was like a textbook narcissist. he gave my brother, who he abandoned at birth, an autographed picture of him for his birthday. it was so fucked up. i still laugh about it to this day.
i didn't think you could snail mail karma, but i'll be damned, here it is.
or even better, send it to whoever gets you as their secret santa next year and tell them to continue the trend. in 30 years it'll be one hell of a shirt!
i honestly thought i was going to get dog shit because of all the horror stories, but after the excitement of getting this, i'm doing it next year for sure!
/u/vernetroyer please come and be recognized with upvotes. you're overdue in centuryclub.
honestly i love the tshirt and picture, the karma was unexpected but amazing to say the least
people also claim to get shorted so they get extra gifts in the "re-matching" part. it's how i got banned from secret santa / arbitrary day / etc.
it's all about his body mass to liquor ratio. i'm not a scientist, but i'm sure a single shot of some fine spirits would get that little guy shitfaced within minutes.
the person who got bill gates had their cousin post in /r/secretsanta!
you're kinda like super right about this. it's weird how obliviously reluctant redditors are to cheap publicity stunts on the site... even when they step out of context.
signups are over, but look on /r/secretsanta for next year
it's been up to 12k twice but reddit takes away upvotes to balance posts out
if this is true, i'm really sorry. unless he's famous, in which case you could sell that shit on ebay.
grandparents, mothers, etc love that kind of thing.
the upside is that next year, they will match you with someone who didn't flake out on their last match. i really like getting matched with someone who got shafted the year before because i feel like i'm putting an extra big smile on their face. hope next year is better for you.
it doesn't really work this one. it's split a bit strangely. still, good bot.
in 30 years you wouldn't even be able to see verne.
but, after this, you will be disappointed next year! better stop when you're at the top!
hopefully, you'll get rematched with someone awesome. if not, let me know, and i'll send ya a gift.
hey... not so fast. i'm a strict no-presents until christmas-eve guy (my family tradition). so, yeah, i got a gift from my guy (and he checked to make sure i got it), but i haven't posted anything yet (other than to respond to his request so he knows i did). why? because i haven't opened it yet! i'll post something on christmas when i do. and, yeah, i sent out mine. that is the best part.
i don't think he qualifies. isn't it 100,000 link karma *or* 100,000 comment karma?
i'm actually kind of glad when i see the "victoria's helping me out"... i know that a decent amount of questions will get answered, and /u/chooter has said she views comments from multiple sorting options... and a random celeb on their computer might not know to do that. it's not as *personal,* but the questions are being answered by the celeb in question and there's less chance of ending up with an ama like woody harrelson's or andrew scott's.
arnold schwarzenegger commented a lot in fitness for a while. i don't know if he still does.
you got possibly one of the coolest redditors as your secret santa, you knew damn well what you were getting into when you posted this
i wonder if celebrities could get away with that. "dear gramma, i love you very much. thanks for everything. love, george clooney"
iitemp3stii is my idol too, truly an inspiration. favorite quote from him has to be the time he said "he sure did get them" in that thread a few minutes ago.
really? i got flaked on last year, signed up for re gifting and got flaked on again. didn't sign up this year cuz of that bad experience. would have if i had known this. d:
what do you mean by split weird. only quantum at- oms split weird, period
honestly any gift is great, plus giving a gift is by far the best part
exchanges over reddit as a whole,or just from secret santa? i didn't get to apply this year,so now i'm pretty interested in doing gift exchanges!
for being lostanddelirious you got a good soul on ya. that's really kind of you. but i couldn't ask something like that it's too generous. edit autocorrect
i preferred his performance as an ewok in star trek
it took about five minutes for someone to make that account.
he just needs to submit 2-3 more pictures and he is there.
i like when he said "bane, sidious, caedus. three very different sith from three very different time periods."
i don't know if they always do this but i was informed this year that i was specifically chosen this year because my match was shafted last year and i've never shafted my matches. i assume they have some kind of reputation system but i don't claim to be an expert or have any actual knowledge into the matching system.
if it makes you feel better, my gift just shipped today so we'll see what happens!
you should definitely give it a try. there is always the risk of getting shafted by your match but i find that picking out something for a total stranger is a lot of fun.
yeah, they do various themed exchanges throughout the year, you just have to keep checking in
haha. it's the name of a movie i like. :) pm me and i'll send you something!
i liked him as yoda in harry potter. "levio*sa* it is not, levi*o*sa it is"
they'll never use it again i bet, this is why all the good usernames are gone
wait till you see how much karma i get from reposting it.
yeah, what's that about? eleven thousand turns to eight thousand in half an hour. is redditor disguising vote totals so it won't seem as popular or something? weird tactic, if so. looks like verne troyer's up votes are down by like five hundred too.
i can't tell if you are being serious. ambiguous sarcasm is the best kind of sarcasm.
same here. i ordered my matches gift nearly a week ago and it still hasn't shipped. i'm almost to the point of sending them a christmas card and telling them it's coming but will be a little late.
let me know if you send him one and i will get you one!
he was also pretty good as dobby the house elf in the hunger games
remember when he played kramer's buddy mickey on seinfeld?
especially because it was given to your sibling with leukemia who is a huge fan.
now i can't tell if you're being sarcastic...you're right, ambiguous sarcasm is the best
i'm signing up for next year now, that sounds awesome
we should start a website for this! everyone signs up and gets matched with someone. like one giant secret santa! we could even add our own store to the website to make all kinds of money off of it. who's in?
my favorite was his role as wilson in forrest gump. great chemistry between him and tom hanks.
yeah, its not they're fault they have a wide set vagina and a heavy flow!
yeah i really didn't see that ending coming. i mean i should have but damnnnnnn
the hill? the hill articles are what he always uses to back up his absurd claims on twitter...
associated press and time boycotted the meeting to stand in solidarity with their press brothers and sisters. a fox news anchor defended cnn and even called out the trump administration for what they're doing. interesting times we're living in.
yeah that's some concerning shit right there, a free press is never the enemy of the people
this, a million times. ultimately, the president answers to *the people*. not *some of the people*, not *just the people that voted for him*, all of the people.
trump also said he wants to open up libel laws so he can **sue the press for "defamation" if they report negatively on him.** this is horrifying but not surprising. please, end this now before it gets to that point. if the potus can break this precedent, he will have no trouble breaking the next one.
republicans stand up for their party not for their country.
they really can't say it was an accident, as the article claims that white house officials stopped reporters from cnn/nyt/etc at the door and basically said "you weren't invited."
kind of. in the past, certain branches have attempted to block specific news agencies. it should be pointed out that the press never had access to the white house or the west wing before (i think) harry truman gave them the current setup. that said, since the reporters have been in the west wing, there hasn't been a situation where specific organizations were targetted or barred. personally, i think this is all an intentional distraction. it's the only explanation for it. they want people to go cray over it so they can do other nefarious things on the side.
there has to be a measurable loss of productivity. i'm checking news all the time during work hours.
i gotta say, this whole thing has got me thinking about trying to go get a job at a newspaper again. i got my degree in journalism a while ago but decided to go into the army instead. since getting out i've been trying to decide what meaningful work i could pursue and be passionate about. this seems like it might be the most important fight happening in the world right now.
the people who voted for him are a lost cause. it's up to the rest of us to get our shit together now. almost half of elegible voters actually voted in the last election. we can never afford to be so lazy again.
this is huge (yuuge) part of the problem, trump keeps sowing discord and his supporters feel "backed into a wall" rather than that group thinking that this is bad path to be going down, it just becomes a worse case of "f those dirty liberals and their fake news" or the more passive, "he is our leader, give him a chance and stop blowing up all of these small issues." the bottom line is that denigrating "the deplorables" is the worst thing to do when trying to fix things. it's like trying to break up a fight by continually slapping the other person in the face and calling them names.... ps. trump is a delicate snowflake with small hands.
once he has destroyed the media, he will declare victory on isis and there will be nobody around to fact-check and point out that he is wrong...
i seriously have no idea if this is real or you made this up.
because they think they're "fake news." americans typically don't like being told that what they believe is wrong. it's acceptable because it's backed by blind idiots.
yeah, the one bright spot here is that this isn't russia, with small, limited-reach news outlets that are easy to bully. american media is a multi-billion dollar industry with reach all across the world. if the white house goes to war with the press, it'll be a fight. and not just against intrepid reporters who can be discredited (or poisoned), but against an actual *industry*. the press still has some weight behind them. it's not perfect, but its not nothing.
what can we even do? they don't care about protests and are trying to prevent and destroy the ability to protest safely anyway. other than voting what is there to do? i feel like it all relies on the intelligence community, politicians who don't support trump, and other world leaders taking a hard enough stance against him. none of them are doing enough so far, or can't.
yeah, some people in the uk hate the bbc but i don't get it. from what i have seen, they set the bar for (mostly) unbiased and fair journalism.
their reporting on trump has been accurate and fact based, and you know how he feels about that
the freaking associated press? yeah i'm calling it. as far as i'm concerned there's no way this has been blown out of proportion by the media if the ap itself refuses to show up during a briefing. it already sounded ridiculous. now it's absurd.
same in ohio. rob portman's team looked up everyone who had requested tickets and canceled the tickets for anyone who wasn't a registered republican. i wish i had known that in advance, since i switched my registration from "unaffiliated" to "republican" this past year so that i could vote for someone other than trump to win the republican nomination.
breitbart shouldn't even be called "conservative". that's an insult to every even slightly reputable conservative news outlet.
apparently the wall street journal was also there, but has stated that they did not know that some organizations were not being invited and would not attend such gaggles in the future. ap and time actually just refused to go when they found the conditions. interesting to see how this plays out... by the end we could have just breitbart at these things (although this is very unlikely).
saw one of trump's explainers, sebastian gorka, the other day saying that trump's statements about the unprecedented size of his electoral college victory weren't untrue, because he prefaced them with "i guess..." in other words, trump wasn't lying about it, he was just making it up. which apparently is ok. sadly the interviewer didn't press him on why the president can't find these things out for sure before he talks about them.
more projection. his sources are made up so theirs must be too.
the rest of the world has clearly caught on. why can't all of america admit it?
exactly. this is how he'll explain it off. alternatively (see what i did there?), they weren't *banned*, they simply weren't invited.
yes. and he's the spokesperson, so i'm not sure how else you spin it. this is straight from the horse's mouth.
man i had so much faith in the honesty and integrity of president trump until now. /s
sure he said it, but then you reported it, so that makes you wrong!
the president is the ceo and the people are the shareholders. trump seems to be living under the mistaken belief that only the shareholders who elected him matter. not a perfect analogy, but one that trump should be able to understand.
that could backfire on him. correct me if i'm wrong but to sue for defamation wouldn't the original statements have to be verifiably false?
am i the only person waking up anxious every morning?
nobody with half a brain would think it was an accident even if that hadn't happened.
that's a huge problem though. america is powerful enough to fuck it up for everyone.
not op, just another scared white guy. i'm sorry dude, my thoughts are with all of you.
me too, 40+ married white guy with kids. i just wrote to my congressman about this. that is the first time in my life i've ever written my congressman or even attempted to communicate with anyone over politics.
their angle is "but obama did it!" even if that's not true.
we couldn't afford it before this election, either. it's going to take a miracle to fix things.
not to mention that trump has revitalized the press. they're got money pouring in and they're hiring investigative reporters and stuff ... also much of the executive branch hates trump and is eager to leak information.
there's been several studies on the bbcs apparent bias, what most of them find is that in any two sided issue, both sides tend to think the bbc is biased towards the other side. for instance they get almost as many complaints for having a pro-israeli bias as they do for having a pro-palestine bias. it seems everyone wants to believe the bbc is biased against them.
the onion probably has some pretty great journalists working for them. to write comedic journalism you have to know journalism, and comedy is much harder than writing the truth. i'll bet they'll jump at this in a heartbeat and be pretty good at actual, factual reporting. which means they'll be banned within a week as well. but i can see the onion toting 'now officially banned by the white house!' as a badge of honor.
it's draining the swamp!!! can't people see how amaze balls dear leader is?
no wonder his own intelligence services are withholding classified information.
they are. just saw it on cuvuto and they had their own reporter on as well as an independent one slamming this. fox's actual reporters aren't on board with this shit.
that is not the first republican to basically say he only represents republican voters, which is flat out wrong, and is the kind of thinking that kills our democracy
just so people understand what's happening, the wall street journal is owned by rupert murdoch and caters to wall street. this is not a partisan issue any way you cut it.
i feel like they should have rebranded the serious side
he didn't press because it would have become a shit show. he said exactly what he needed to. most electoral votes since reagan. ok, obama. oh trump meant republicans. ok, bush sr. i remember seeing the report, you would agree that it's pretty impressive. "you're the president."
agreed, i am actually afraid of the coming few years as an american citizen.
really it's about 1/4 of america, and quite simply, they don't really gaf, because they don't think elections matter to them. their friends and family probably live around them, and likely have their whole lives. they are comfortable in their shell, and hate anything outside their nice little box. the liberals in the cities are where the men turn into women, where women are whores, and where the rule of law has turned to banditry and chaos. these city people are godless, and they have too much power as it is. take that power away at all costs. our man must win. rah rah rah!
everybody's talking at me, i don't hear a word they're saying, only the echoes of my mind.
it was on cspan. another beauty. its fake news. they should sit down. why arent they happy trump won? worst fake news. *if i have to tell everyone its sarcasm i feel bad*
there is no way to spin it. that's why i absolutely can't wait to see him try.
i don't think for a second that trump realizes what he's doing. there's someone else pulling the strings/manipulating him. to him all this stuff seems logical.
you mean great at his job? he gives only soundbytes which muddy the the reports of all the other stuff they are doing. now, obviously i don't know if that's the case, but as a person working in the in the ad/pr business it wouldn't surprise me one bit if it was a thought out tactic.
trump, embarrassed? i don't think he'll be embarrassed regardless of what he does.
i honest to god wake up and check the news every morning to see what kind of scary shit trump has done. the part that really bothers me the most. we just started the next 4 years. even if trump gets the boot, we have pence to worry about.
as much as i'd like to see shep on liberal media, he's needed over at fox. my folks watch fox and they trust what shep has to say....i think he's the only one that keeps the 'ol folks on the semi straight and narrow.
kinda like this story... were you expecting a full on uprising within minutes of this story or ???
god, i hate how they always deflect the blame to something else, they're so fucking slimy.
idiots think their biased opinions are objective conclusions. when you fare enough to the left or right, the center starts to look like the other side.
totally agree. i love npr, i have yet to hear some seriously slanted story. they do interviews and whatnot and op ed pieces but it's presented as exactly what it is.
there is a reason we call them rags. and it's not affectionate.
you know shit's getting spicy when fox news is getting shitlisted.
while part of me celebrates the denigration of that contemptuous shit-rag, i am still irked by them being banned
now instead of a boring standard swamp, we get a wacky cgi shrek swamp.
because they're next. remember, if trump had a choice, he'd probably love having just one source of news for everyone under his control.
well, look at the absurd temper tantrums thrown over obama the last 8 years. this whole thing isn't that surprising. it's exactly what those people hollering "bengaaaaazhi!" like a battle cry want.
as i understand it (mostly from watching the west wing, so don't trust me too far on this), the white house invites them in, which they aren't required to do, and host these press briefings, which they also aren't required to do. which means technically they can do whatever they want. it's obviously better taste to have a good relationship with the press, and obviously better for elected officials to be seen as not psychos (which the press has some control over), and obviously better for the public and all of america to know what's going on.
at this point i'm just going to register as a republican. why not? we all should. we can give our representatives hell for not standing up for our "republican" values and we can primary trump right off "our" ballot in 2020. if they seriously think having the letter d on my registration card is what's actually important to me, they're in for a surprise.
no kidding. before i just learned about the split, if someone had cited buzzfeed as an actual source i would have had trouble taking that person seriously.
people are already spinning it. they were "fake news" outlets, not real ones.
as was shown recently on last week tonight, (quoting a comedy show? stewpid librul) much of trump's base legitimately believes that all of the news outlets trump calls both "fake" and "very fake" are indeed that and refuse to even lisfen to those "lies." it is impossible to reason with them right now.
i'd say it's bannon. check the guy's speeches. he's pulling trump's strings amazingly well... he's the one who should be the target of our wrath. and if you check his speeches, where he's going next is terrifying...
bannon is scary. he is calm, he is calculated and he isnt doing this for publicity, he is doing it due to pure ideology or beleif. that is scary. even vp pence, less so, bcs he says a lot of shit for political brownie points. bannon is just... bannon.
our allies mourned. our enemies cheered. every single time i've asked a trump supporter about this, i've gotten the same reaction: "who cares!?"
to be fair, he could probably issue a poorly written executive order on the subject that would just be blocked a few days later.
i wasn't disputing you, i just felt what i had to say was a natural extension of the train of conversation that ended with you.
its incredible really, they'll deride obama as being shitty and evil in one breath, and then claim trump's not bad because 'obama did it!!' in the next
my english seems to become worse. i should more write english text. reading is ok. danke
the left-leaning accusation is severely overblown. sometimes i wonder if it's just the intelligent, curious nature of npr and its affiliates' work that gets them this reputation among conservatives. is nuance liberal?
you'd think so, but this is from an administration that believes there are "alternative facts."
trump drained the swamp only to fill it with nessy and all her unhatched egglings.
it's like the local paper dude who goes to *every* city council meeting. no one wants to do that, but god damn i'm glad somebody does
it's not just for newspapers either. pretty much every newspaper, tv station, cable news network, radio station, news website, and university with a journalism school subscribes to the ap's services. they are the news outlets' news outlet. the authority.
oh the replies to popular tweets are worse than youtube comments. i just ignore them.
bannon does not enjoy fox. bannon wants control, not servitude or a partnership. he wants to control the media, narrative and what the narrative is. fox is merely a platform he can use for now, but eventually he wants breitbart news to be the dominant mouthpiece of the right and the neo age nazi's.
shep, baier, actual reporters. hell even bill o should have an issue with this. the only person prominent on there that will drink the piss water is hannity because he isn't a newsman, he's a showman.
more like born on third base, walked in, acts like he hit a grand slam.
oh absolutely. i would love to cry 1st amendment violations right now, and maybe there's a judge out there with the guts to interpret it that way, but they haven't done anything illegal or "wrong", but they have violated long-standing tradition and american values. just because something isn't illegal doesn't make it right.
this is brilliant. really. it could work. no sarcasm
citing buzzfeed still gives me trouble taking the person seriously.
or if mcdonalds opened a michelin starred restaurant
i literally had this conversation with my dad tonight. me: doesn't it bother you that he's calling news outlets "enemies of the people?" dad: they are enemies of the people. they lie and attack him constantly. all the russia stuff-- it's lies. a smear campaign. it's fake news. me: then why did he fire flynn? dad: b/c flynn talked to russia and lies to pence about it. but he didn't do anything wrong. ***sigh***
where is he going next in your opinion? i'm at work and don't feel like delving into bannon's brain right now...
'so this is how liberty dies ... with thunderous applause'
yeah that's true. all executive orders must be consistent with the constitution, so luckily that narrows his powers substantially.
"the right to bear arms" is there not only for a person's self protection. it is to protect against tyranny. in the revolution the british confiscated people's guns. so this right was meant to protect against tyranny because the government wouldn't be the only ones with guns. therefore you could form a militia and take on the government.
"slavery is okay because the huns invaded europe."
don't drag nessie into this! she actually brings tourism dollars to scotland. cheeto benito's presidency has slowed us tourism by at least 6 percent.
it's hard too because the council members can generally be unfriendly, school board meetings are boring and you just have to grit through it and report. it matters because you pay those people with your taxes. you have a right to know everything going on, especially at the local level. these people will affect your day to day. source: i'm a reporter
every article i read from the ap is pretty much just state the facts, the people and not much else. it's like a very generic but vanilla event occurrence reporting. it doesn't have to go in depth or deep, itll let others build up and fill you in on the back story. fair and balanced just tell us what occurred today kind of news.
half the time they are probably from teenagers just trying to get a reaction.
no kidding. even fox news is too far left for bannon, that's what breitbart news is for.
trump is a master at saying a lot of words but not communicating anything of substance. he speaks vaguely, has a few favorite adjectives that he uses repetitively, and repeats previous statements with different words. very easy to mimic, and can be quite humorous, but ingesting the real deal has about the same nutritious value as eating a bag of chips.
a british biography of donald trump found one of his classmates after his bad behavior landed him in military school. according to the classmate, they were already cultivating trump's fake image back then by hiring models to act as donald's girlfriends and pushing for his nomination as "ladies man", which he took as a badge of honor.
huh, i'll have to check his stuff then. i tried watching his sitcom and it was atrocious
you never know. mcdonald corporation invests in other restaurants including chipotle at one point. it is not inconceivable that they might have ownership in some fine dining establishments.
bannon flat out said the appointments to head departments were put there to destroy them.
the rise of the empire was modeled on the rise of nazi germany and it's democratically elected leader. how bad does it get before my fellow americans stop this?
don't forget relinquishing all rights to say "usa is #1" when you also "don't care about the rest of the world".
ap and reuters are the only 2 sources i will trust. if i can't find a story on them, it likely is bullshit.
he is no master of talking and no saying anything. many politicians do and is usually hard to notice, with trump is incredibly obvious.
unfortunately the nearest body of water was the kettle. you win again england!
his sitcom is complete shit, but he is a genuinely funny guy. his comedic timing is just impeccable.
the point is that it wouldn't be called "mcdonalds fine dining"
good point. a true pro wouldn't be as painfully obvious as he is.
we should make it into a party of some sorts. call it, a rejection of british tea into the harbor party.
hey, don't group all of us poor, dumb people together. i didn't vote for the guy.
frontline is great. i find their documentaries to be informative and quite unbiased. the way they presented how the election unfolded was great. they also did a piece on the syrian war and then did one on the government held area in damascus and did a really good job of showing how the syrian people living in government held areas felt about the war.
i'm worried that trump will have an andrew jackson moment, you know something like, "[justice roberts] has made his decision, now let him enforce it."
it's because you are in the upper class of poor and dumb people.
democracy is great until you realize a majority of voters are retarded.
frontline is absolutely fantastic. they're like a good deep scrub, they really get in there and get after stuff. and like someone else said the narrator's voice is amazing.
it's like deleting text files to make space on your 500gb hard drive
there's no such thing as an "incel". only people unwilling to fuck somebody fatter (uglier/older/poorer/smellier) than themselves.
it's a given that this is going to happen at some point. we're not even two months in and look at how far they've pushed.

go to the butterfly sanctuary! trust me! my girlfriend dragged me in but it was magical!
nah man. we kill for milk sandwiches. get with it :p
atlanta native, i'm just gonna stay quiet and hang out with you.
charlotte resident here.. people dont understand that we dont get snow, we get ice. solid fucking ice.
combine that with the fact that the storm pictured began with freezing rain and there was a solid sheet of ice on the ground before snow began falling
yeah depending on the hurricane size, i usually treat it like a normal day
"hey, i'm stuck in the snow. can you help?" "sure i'll be right over." *gets stuck in the snow* "hey, i'm stuck in the snow. can you help?" "sure i'll be right over." *gets stuck in the snow* "hey, i'm stuck in the snow. can you help?" "sure i'll be right over." *gets stuck in the snow* "hey, i'm stuck in the snow. can you help?" "sure i'll be right over." *gets stuck in the snow* repeat ad infinitum
"hmm, maybe if i got this blowtorch to melt the ice around my tires..."
houston with even the hint of winter precipitation is like the apocalypse. people buy out bottled water and canned food, batteries, generators, it's insane. and then nothing happens.
well that was good fortune. better chance of getting it covered by insurance, just blowing the engine would be 100% out of pocket. i'm certainly not advocating doing that, just saying that he acted so incredibly stupid that it probably worked out ok for him
in nc, we just wait for the sun to do the work of snow removal. schools will be closed all next week.
i work in midtown atlanta with a 35 minute commute (no traffic) and holy fuck these next two days are gonna suck
yea... charlotte doesn't handle snow well. i'm anticipating a hellacious weekend once the storm rolls in
i heard about fights in the grocery store over bread. people go insane over french toast around here.
i like to imagine she's a hit women walking away saying "it's done".
agreed. no one can drive on a road of pure ice. you're lucky if you can go slowly enough and start with the correct vector so you can coast past the icy segment without completely going off the road. the smallest adjustment of the wheel or tap of the brakes can spin you out of control at 5mph. add a little inexperience on the part of 3/4 of the drivers and you end up with this mess.
east tennessee: where you actually *do* have to walk uphill to school both ways.
snowpocalypse 2014, never forget, atlanta brother!
even without the freezing rain, as a canadian i just think how we would fare without snowplows, snow tires, salted roads, snowblowers, or possibly even shovels or proper winter attire. a big reason we don't sweat the snow is that we're well equipped and have learned from experience.
nothing like a good old candy cane-chocolate cereal-orange juice breakfast to wake you up!
butterfly sanctuary is pretty cool! key west is always a good time.
what is a milk sandwich? up north we have milk steaks.
that's what people don't understand about winter weather in the south. the snow accumulation doesn't matter, there's usually freezing rain, sleet, thawing snow that freezes again over night. i've lived in nc, and in co. driving in powdery snow is not as hard as driving in ice. winter storms are also less frequent in the south, so for most municipalities it actually does make more sense to just close everything for a day once a year or so, than it does to maintain a fleet of snow plows.
snow is easy to drive in. ice is hell without studded tires.
can confirm. it started around noon, i couldn't leave till 3. it was already an icy mess by then.
this happens everytime there is a snow storm. had a friend from northern ohio making fun of our lack of winter driving ability. that man slid into a telephone pole not injured, just a bruised ego. the problem with the south is when it snows, it hovers right around freezing point so it melts them freezes over and over again with no treatment. it's a fucking death trap.
ha haha hahahaaah hahaha hahahahaaah hahhahaaa! i lived in atlanta 15 years and finally got out last august! now i'm in--- oh shit. i'm in new jersey.
also all traffic laws become nonexistent. last time it snowed in wilmington, yes wilmington, a lady decided that red lights didn't matter anymore and pulled out right in front of traffic, so we all had to slam on the brakes which of course led to everyone almost crashing.
that's probably how this scene came to be in the first place. southern hospitality and lack of snow gear is a bad combo.
unfortunately common sense isn't common. when you grow up with cold and snow you learn when you're 2 or 3 and you slip and fall on your ass that ice is slippery. when you grow up in an area with poisonous insects it becomes habit to shake out your shoes before putting them on (something i need to be reminded of when i visit friends in these places).
if the car isn't actually moving and the engine is redlining the cooling system does t work so great. it's based around air moving through the radiator which doesn't happen when the car is not moving.
well, as a russian for whom 2,5 inches of snow is a normal january in moscow, i've seen a ton of truckers with actual fire torches warming up their engines because diesel here sucks
"certainly not catastrophic failure due to lack of airflow over the radiator, that's for sure. after all, it's cold outside"
for real though. i live in oklahoma and worked at lowe's during college. anytime bad weather was supposed to happen we were packed. one year corporate had to send us a delivery truck full of generators because people kept buying them. like, were putting their name on a list. an 18 wheeler. of generators. at $500 a piece. the store made bank that week.
i thought it was the coal smokestacks and 19' confederate flagpoles.
yea a couple of years ago they canceled school in austin because there was a forecast for a 40% chance of ice. the next day, no ice but traffic was excellent.
so you're saying if i screw something up on my car, i should set it on fire and claim incompetency?!? car insurance companies don't want you know to this secret!
nc just isn't equipped to handle snow in the way northern states are. nobody has snow tires/chains, nobody has any experience driving in snow, we have a limited number of plows, etc... snow is just no bueno here.
it kind of makes me giggle a bit (northern sask.canada) but i know how you handle the adverse weather situations is all in the preparedness. we have winter tires, warm clothing, vehicles rugged enough for the climate, proper wiper blades and years of experience in winter conditions both in driving and surviving. people in nc are just not used to this sort of thing and it is bound to cause havoc. not going to shame them - it's all in the acclimatization.
nope, that would be the end of the show. frozen zombies can't walk. just pop their brains with an ice pick on a stick and when spring thaw comes around the zombie apocalypse is over. i'm surprised they went as far north as dc with the plot. it gets below freezing for days there. kind of sucks when you realize this is only a warm climate show.
i heard about fights over bathrooms. are the rumors true?
*i don't know why everyone does this* milk, eggs, and bread. gone as fuck if there's a remote chance of snow. but there's also the fact that it's already fuckin' freezing outside so i think your milk and eggs would be fine on the porch.
that was the year i had to go *backwards* down the onramp from 94to 394. there are 2 lanes there, and it was crazy slick with snow just pouring down. there was a semi in the right lane that was stuck, but the left lane was moving (albeit slowly). then, 4 cars ahead of me, a regular 4-door sedan got stuck and couldn't make it up the incline. people put their cars in park and ran up to the stuck car with cat litter and sand, tried pushing it, everything. it refused to move. after like 15 minutes of this, a state trooper showed up and tried to get the car moving, but couldn't. so he directed all the cars to back down the onramp and get back onto 94 and take 55 as a temporary detour. it was the highlight of my winter :) no harm, no one was hurt, just a funny circumstance.
my mom calls me a milk steak. also i'm hard of hearing
if it makes you feel any better, as a minnesotan. we understand. we just like to give you guys shit. ice+snow fucks our shit up too. the *only* real difference is, the northern dot's have huge cache's of salt in giant mountains, and large containers of liquid salt spray stored throughout metro areas, so whenever the freezing rain starts, they hit the highways immediately to put down a layer of salt. most of the southern states just don't have that infrastructure because they really don't need it most of the time. but ya, we had a good 1/2" of ice with a good 9"-10" of snow up here a few weeks back, and trust me....it was a complete shit show in minneapolis.
it was 98, and it was 3 days of freezing rain. driving was bad, but it was all the falling tree limbs that fucked shit up.
as opposed to summer, when you grab your inline skates and hockey sticks to play in the road?
yup, here in texas all we get is ice if it gets cold enough and it's the worst.
yeah but the snow up north doesn't have a layer of black ice lurking under it.
strange. perhaps the news team got the last part but reported that as the total? it was certainly reported as 12 trucks. i was in shock when they said it. btw, thank you for the correction.
what places do you speak of? i need to avoid them at all costs
i'd also be willing to make a bet that the type of person who would choose to continually rev their engine in this manner is also the same type who would not be the most meticulous in their car maintenance...
that's also assuming they've put coolant in there. a leaking system could be low, the owner could have used regular water and rusted the radiator, or even the fact that people think it's okay to use solely water in the winter... i doubt that's a 2015/2016 car that burned.
i've learned some of the craziest cold weather engine tricks from russian guys. most of them incredibly dangerous but i guess where they learned this stuff you either get your truck running or you die. one guy's battery was dead and we didn't have jumper cables so he pulled the good battery out and held it upside down with connections touching directly on the dead battery. not something the average american would think to do.
in australia your car will bite you and is poisonous though.
i'll open the payday loan place right next door so they can come to me to try and afford to pay you.
the best snowblower i ever owned was purchased during a blizzard that was way out of normal for that area. we'd get snow, but not like that. every snowblower was sold out except this monstrosity that nobody could afford, and i was stupid enough to not care. i could have leveled antarctica with that thing. it stayed at the house when i moved away, the new buyer wanted it so much he made it a condition of the sale.
bread, milk, and eggs. because if shit hits the fan, you're gonna want some french toast.
if you have those, and god forbid -- a lightbar, there is no number of truck nuts that can help you. what you have to do in that case is unload your atv from the back and proceed as if you were muddin' in very cold mud.
the local problem in west texas is the high rate of morons we have. we've got the guys who feel that a 4x4 truck can do 100mph out on city streets in the ice and snow and "shale handle it jes fahn", and then they scream through a red light or stop sign and take out a bunch of people who were minding their own business and now you've got a bunch of people in the hospital, some of them die on the scene. and the excuse? "whale ah have a pigyep truck, it shoulda stopped!" bonus points: 8 out of 10 of these accident causing morons don't have a license or insurance. and half of those lost their license due to drinking and driving.
no, that would be arson. if it happens on its own, its not arson.
hold on, the dog's name was 'yellow'!? i've been living a lie for 30 years! i've been calling him 'yeller' but- my god -they are american so of course.. with the accent.. i, i need to sit down.
no, there's a lot of transplants in nc from the north, so they have experience driving in snow. but we don't get snow, we get snow, sleet, freezing rain, a whole mix of crap. but people drive like it's snow. there's the problem.
when i was in school in illinois it had to be -20 f for school to be cancelled. should have lived in colorado i guess!
if the show does move to a cold climate, i doubt that will be when they start using logic.
i love how the person replying to my comment from michigan is a jerk, and the minnesotan is the nicest one. i need to visit minneapolis sometime, seems like a great city.
we're not californians, we just drive to the rink in the summer.
or worse, it snows, melts then refreezes into a nice solid flat sheet of hell.
you were partially right, i asked my buddy who helps with some of this and the city only owns 12 but contracts all snow out to a private company who has over 70 trucks for this.
florida in the summer, and the southwest because of scorpions.
my dad is like this...i mean he would stop if it was redlining, and would have been fixed e in this situation, but one time it rained, and our dirt driveway got very muddy and flooded. then the temperature dropped to below 0 (midwest amirite?) and his little, 1990, murcury tercell got frozen to the ground. my dad tried to get it out and blew the transmission completely because "he had to get to work!" come on dad! people get really dumb when they are late for something.
that can work! in order to have your highest chance of success, make sure they're directly in front of the grill, blowing straight into it. it helps if they're on their knees, with their face level with the grill, and facing it directly.
hibernation is real. humans just have to be awake for it.
how is this different from using jumper cables? isn't it just the same as long as you don't touch the connectors? edit. not suggesting anything here, i just don't know anything about car batteries.
venomous. or were we so mad that the car bit us that we bit it back?
we are all sitting here patiently in suspense waiting for you to perform your grand reveal of said snowblower.... please don't keep us waiting.
i worked at a home depot as a cashier for a summer. at the returns desk, i asked why there was a small flathead screwdriver without a handle connected on a chain. i was told it was for paint cans. i found it hard to believe that somebody would be that dumb, but it didn't take long before it happened. guy brings back two cans of paint, and is in a rush, of course. i open the first can (its full of paint-colored water and just look at him with a "really?!" look on my face. his response: "oh that's so crazy, my kids must've gotten gotten into it." sure, they "got into" two cans of paint and you didn't notice. plus they refilled them with water afterwards for you. **tl;dr: people try to return water-filled paint cans more often that you'd think.**
"god dammit if i am going to die, i am going to die with the taste of french toast on my tongue."
do you have any idea what you can get on the black market for a loaf of sunbeam? retinal transplants and a kidney.
nah just take everything out and make it as top heavy as possible. then when it flips it just keeps going the full 360 degrees and ends up right side up again.
we use sand up here in idaho. it is less damaging to the road surfaces than salt is. but the thing is, sand doesn't melt ice, it just gives you traction on top. so you have to keep applying sand, is not just a one-and-done thing. and salt is only useful if it is warm enough.
somehow i was able to deduce where you live from that description! :-)
"enough" snow plows. i think you meant none. heavy snow in the deep south happens maybe once every 5-10 years. there are no plows and no salt trucks. during "snowpocalypse" the other year, kids were stranded on school buses overnight & local businesses invited stranded travelers to sleep in there overnight. and god bless chik-fil-a, yes it sucks that their owner's a homophobe, but they cooked up all the food they had & ran it out for free to all the people stuck on the roads near them. much of my family including my rather old mom were stranded but she was able to walk to safety using the snow boots she bought while visiting me in the frozen hellhole i live in now. i don't know if you can even buy snowboots down south without special ordering them online!
right, i was trying to clean my engine with gasoline while it was running. boy! i am one silly goose!
it's yeller, but it's meant as a double meaning; in that the dog both brays like a human yelling, and that his fur is "yeller," with an accent. so there's really no wrong way to interpret it, so you're good. it is actually "yeller," and not just yellow though, haha.
cary = concentrated area of relocated yankees. also, psa: 4x4s may get you going in winter weather, but they will not stop you. i see so many assholes driving unnecessarily fast in snow/sleet.
michigan here. the other guy is just jelly because it is goddamn cold outside right now. ignore him
midwesterner here. 67% of my town's annual budget is spent on winter road management. salt, brine solution, plows and their maintenance, and the wages and benefits of the people who drive them. *that* is why we can get 4-8 inches of snow overnight and still get up and go to work in the morning like nothing happened.
we live in the southwest. my dad bought snow tires over a year ago and has been keeping them in the spare bedroom. he's so fucking excited he finally got to use them he's called 3 times already asking if i need a lift anywhere.
also, lots of the midwest does this too because of brown-recluse spiders.
not my favorite uncle, he's aggravating a lot of the time
where's a good medically induced coma when you need it...
it's not really dangerous.. unless the upside-down battery is leaking acid i guess, or if you drop it and kills a pet or something.
and you just learned why most home owners are hoarders of some kind. sure i don't need it now, but what about 5 years from now? think of it as an investment lol
the turds have not hit the turbine, and i'd like some too.
sand definitely has merits. in the d.c. area, they also have a liquid brine solution (i think it's magnesium chloride) that they apply if it's going to be significantly below freezing when it snows. a few years ago, they accidentally applied it to the beltway at the wrong time, and it caused dozens of minor accidents when drivers hit the unexpected, semi-frozen slush.
dallas yes, amarillo no. dallas is a cluster on a normal day. amarillo knows how to handle winter weather (as much as any other southerly plains city).
you can't even buy a decent winter coat in the south, let alone "snowboots" (wtf are they???) :)
the dude i knew that actually did that had to be life flighted to the hospital.
in case anyone has never thought about this before, it's because *every* car has 4-wheel-brakes. your car with 4-wheel-drive isn't any better at stopping than they are.
actually they brined most of the main roads in the last 2 days. so once the initial rain washes all that salt off onto the shoulder we'll be left with pristine asphalt for the sleet/ice to stick to. fun times. p.s. i actually saw that mess on glenwood. i gave up before trying to climb that hill and stopped at a hotel to wait things out. it had taken me 4 hours to travel what normally takes me 30 minutes in rush hour traffic. semi trucks stuck spinning tires on slight inclines, cars skidded off everywhere, fender benders scattered like confetti, people driving with no windshield wipers and trying to see out of a small spot of snow-free windshield stopping periodically to scrape off a bit more. i was so done. lol
i love winter. if we actually have snow. because then we can snowmobile and snowshoe and all other sorts of fun winter activities.
southwesterner here. it snowed last night, and they shut down the city this morning - we need to stop spending 67% of our budget on party hats and breakfast burritos. but those burritos are so delicious.
you should humor him and let him take you somewhere
idk, nobody really in my area does this, and we have a fair share of those. might just be my area though, i have never found a spider in my shoe before.
people who don't understand how a radiator works aren't going to know what a dynometer is.
yea the fan is part of the system, it's not what cools the whole thing. it's like having a ceiling fan on in your home and expecting that to keep it cool during a hot ass day with the windows open.
not true. if you try to jump start a frozen battery, bad things can happen. at least with jumper cables , face isn't sitting a foot away from something filled with acid that can explode.
where the fuck was this when i was a kid??? i would have plowed the whole damn neighborhood if i had a fucking mini-bulldozer!
great. and now i'm in narnia and it's snowing here too. good job.
i've never had strong opinions on drivers not from the states i've lived in or the states immediately surrounding them. the sole exception is trucks from texas(cars i've not noticed this phenomenon) almost without fail they'll be driving insanely recklessly. i'm in north dakota now and it still happens!
also, dallas has these ridiculous sky-highways everywhere. it's insane how high they are and what distances they span. of course, they freeze over, and then everybody's fucked. every time i need a reminder of why i stay in my small-town shithole in east texas, i just go visit the metroplex.
my neighborhood in cary (suburbs) had already been sprayed this morning when i woke up. we're actually preparing as well as we can this time around.
that's how i learned how to drive. we used to chain a 63 chevy hood to the bumper and pile about a dozen people on it. double donuts in parking lots & unused airport runways- last one on the hood gets a 6 pack. hell yes.
visualizing burritos, instead of snow chains, strapped to a tire.
i have and i got tacos out of it. it was worth the nonstop talking about how great snow tires are and what a great decision it was to get them.
and the air quality in the tunnel is fucking awful.
when i have hot ass days i just stick an ice packie down there.
the puns are awesome! i wish i could come up with one of my ohm.
mmmmm... you can taste the fan belt and - is that grade 87 gasoline? i didn't know i was going to have to pair this meal with a fine wine!
what we did for fun before portable entertainment screens.
makes sense. you'd have to be a moron to stand in front of a car while somebody's trying to get it moving!
me too, i thought that was a given and he was a goner. glad he's going to make it.
he could say it to a job interview. "can you mention a stressful situation you were put in." "i was shot 7. fucking. times. while being a fucking hero."
people, make this happen. when you survive enough bullets to impress the terminator you deserve to smoke a stogie with him.
some states do have "victims of a crime" funds where people who have been assaulted/attacked have their medical bills waived
my exact thought was "*of course* he's fine now, he's so high off of the really good stuff".
i would love it if he had a son named chris jr. or just junior.
the original report said that a man "tried" to stop the shooter and was shot multiple times. i can see how this language could be interpreted to believe he had died, but as usual, the mass media prefers to report their news *before* they figure out what happened.
he will enter the gates of valhalla, furry and warm.
now i imagine him giving a spartan kick (or w/e its called) to the shooter chest while shouting 'this. is. oregonnn'
sadly, i saw a lot of stuff on twitter last night that the news media actually identified the *wrong person* as the shooter, based on forum comments made by the person.
there's also the nursing student who helped stabilize him until the ambulance got there.
it's not gay if you're secure with your sexuality...
i believe that this goes for humanity, it's just the assholes that make the news. this guy however deserves the highest praise.
paragon. now there's a word that doesn't get used enough. well said.
if you can get a tv show for having 8 kids, for being a child beauty pageant winner, or just for having long beards, then there is no reason this guy couldn't be rewarded for his actions.
it says damn it feels good to have a morphine drip.
exactly. he didn't sign up to kill some foreigner for some reason he doesn't know or understand. he stood up and fought for the people standing on either side of him, for no reason other than he was the one brave enough to do it.
i imagine the shooter's courage and aim faltering when seeing a fucking spartan running at him to take him down.
i think he already has one. a (nursing?) student tended to him before ambulance got to him, and i guess the only thing he cared about was yesterday was his son's 6th birthday. a man like that sounds like he doesn't want to be drenched in pussy, but rather make sure he is as good of a dad as he can be. this man has his priorities right in life.
"i dont see that on your resume son. i think im going to have to pass." "sir im wearing the medal now from it" "thats nice"
something tells me he'll be successful at anything he does.
just a wild guess but i'd say someone mentally unstable enough to pull this shit probably isn't wealthy enough to pay for everyone's hospital bills here.
insurance doesn't pay for everything. hospital bills are still expensive with insurance.
what kind of communist puts the $ at the end of the number?
i guarantee that dude is going to remember that day for the rest of his life, hopefully in a proud, fond way eventually and not nightmares over it.
had a teacher in highschool his name was mr.hammer he named his son jack. no shit.
yeah, fuck the shooter, fuck whatever deranged cause he thought he was fighting for.
yeah, seems like the details are fuzzy so i don't want to speculate.
literally evertime i read that quote i have to do that jaw clench thing to stifle a tear
i feel as though that nursing student should get some free college credits for his/her real life experience in emergency medicine.
what if your sexuality is gay? then it is definitely gay..
it makes for a good photo and everything, but i've seen this face many times. he's high as fuck.
they can cope with all the mad cash i'm gonna send this bad ass mother fucker (like $20, i'm poor as fuck)
that's exactly what bullet tooth tony did. no word on if chris mintz was carrying a saber though.
hows he going to survive drowning in all that pussy though?
yes. perhaps we should set up a crowdfunding site to create a sperm-bank with only his product? haha.
"that's nice and all but it says here you've been unemployed for over a year." "well i was recovering from -" "i'm afraid we have to reject your application, we're looking for someone who's done a bit more with their life then sit around watching tv."
does 4 years at getting-shot-at college count? i had an internship for a drug dealer once too.
it's america. he has the *freedom* to pay the bill.
yes, very normal and common...most students are on their parents' plan which is going to be a hell of a lot cheaper. the college plans are pretty comparable to aca marketplace plans a lot of times in expense which is to say all fucking kinds of expensive with shitty deductibles.
100% agreed.. i hope he wakes up with pride and not anxiety.. :(
first off, it's schmidt and seco.. oh, i see what you did there..
the crazy thing is i haven't seen a single thing about the shooter, just the victims and national response. i dont know if its a concerted effort by social media or the news, but i'm a huge fan of it.
i mean, don't get me wrong the dude definitely did what most people would never even dream of doing and did it for the right reason...but i'm just curious if he was actually successful to some extent. it would suck if down the road he started beating himself up over the matter. "i took some bullets and now have health problems because of my actions but other people still died and i didn't save a single person."
now there is a million dollar idea. whether that's us or zimbabwe dollars who knows.
*looks for a job* *gets rejected for being jobless*
he was rushing at him. most likely the gunman was just shooting at him and they hit where they hit.
no he doesn't. actually that brings up an interesting point. legally he is required to pay the bill, and legally the hospital is required to treat him if he is shot or unconscious or whatever. so, somebody could be injured, then forced to be treated, then forced to pay the medical bill. no freedom there at all.
i hate the insurance system as much as the next guy but this is just not true.
charged the gunman. took a few in the legs. went down from that. shooter shot him in the back. disclaimer: pure speculation.
by money order right? i know the mail takes a few days and so does the bank
well maybe they should have a job if they want a job so badly!!!!!
exactly. people generally don't know how much impact on your aim squeezing the trigger has. it can throw you aim way off. being scared, panicked, or excited tends to make you yank on the trigger that much harder. also it sounds like they had a hell of a fight over that gun.
in quebec we also have a program compensating victims of criminals (crime victims compensation act). it will pay all health cost (even dentist), pay your salary until you're fit to go back to work, etc, etc. it's paid by selling product of criminal activities (houses, cars, etc...)
seriously, mass shootings are as american as apple pie and baseball at this point.
it's says you get to own guns not get them for free.
i agree, your sexual preferences shouldn't affect your insurance rates.
if anyone is wondering how healthcare works in america, it's simple. don't. get. sick.
in america it can be a bit different. in some cases, the family or spouse can be held responsible and forced to compensate the victim. if the shooter has no family to collect from, they can then perform a postmortem sperm extraction on the shooter, fertilize an egg with said sperm in order to birth an offspring. this offspring is raised into indentured servitude, and the proceeds of the offspring's labor go to paying off the medical bills of the victim. once the payment is complete, the offspring is terminated.
were? they still exist. they're okay but they're much better on jeopardy! than wheel.

i just want to keep things convenient for everyone. credit card info is fine. might as well send your social security info, too!
your heart is in the right place but i don't think you realized i was jokingly trying to con people into sending me money for my own personal use.
just positioning your finger tip or first knuckle crease on the trigger will affect how your gun will move. finger tip keeps the gun straight, knuckle will push the barrel towards the center of your body. (left if gun is in right hand, right if gun is in left hand) pistols are actually really shitty weapons for any kind of accuracy beyond 20 feet or so in an adrenaline dump situation.
the former: if you are talking about in the middle of combat and moving around, very difficult. if you are talking about stupidly standing in the open carefully aiming while being shot at, difficult if the target is moving. if you mean at a gun range, easy, with enough practice. for the latter, that would probably only happen in real life by accident
in america the police spend money from those seizures on military assault gear and open bar, all you can eat parties for the department.
shhh it's hard to circlejerk with you saying stuff like that.
anyone who thinks the us medical system isn't broke, has never had an emergency or a reason to go to the hospital.
jesus. that started off dark and got darker. 10/10. would read again.
something tells me the shooter won't have future paychecks...
there is no way that guy is a lawyer. check his comment history... he works for some kind of small architectural company, and he thinks the shooter's parents will have to pay his debts.
names like "4reals" are stupid in the first place but names like lucifer, like, i get it, but there is such a thing as freedom of expression.
plus probably numerous bullets that missed him. it's unlikely that the shooter only took 7 shots at the guy. the guy is incredibly brave and is exactly how we should all hope to be in a situation like that.
actually, it was a middle-aged student. your point still stands, though. it's because it's less dramatic, doesn't have that awesome action-movie tinge of heroism, and doesn't involve a veteran (nothing against veterans, the classification just adds an extra taste of patriotism). i do hope we hear more about her later on, when the furor has died down a bit and we hear more about the victims.
true that! i'm not sure how familiar you are with apprenticeships in the uk, but i was once rejected for one because i didn't have enough experience...
yeah i totally agree. i was referring to these live situations like you say. as you said, not too bad hitting a target. having a really tight spread would not be easy with pistols but hitting a target with 100% accuracy is not too hard.
you missed the margarita machine. every police department needs one of these first, before they could even think about wasting the proceeds of civil forfeiture on compensating the victims of crime.
or is rich as hell. or has really incredible insurance.
but who is expressing in that situation, the parent, or the child? why must the child be forced to express something his parents chose?
the fuck? i can sorta see not hiring someone for being unemployed for a long time (yes, it's shitty and shouldn't be that way, but i *can* sorta see their point too, risk wise), but they're literally telling you they wont teach you because you haven't already learned?
well, to be fair the proceeds from civil forfeiture don't necessarily come from criminals here in the us. law abiding citizens get their property taken and not returned even when they are cleared of wrongdoing sometimes. not really fair to just give that money to victims of crime, right?
no, but it is partially covered under your canadian pension plan.
miss molly bliss... went out to pi.........ck some flowers. she stepped in the grass... was up to her a........nkle tops. she went to the coop... to let out a poo........r little chicken. the coop fell apart... she let out a far.........away cry. her uncle named mel... said "oh golly oh hel........p her if you can." screaming with grit, "oh golly oh sh.......e'll be okay." her boyfriend named mitch, was a son of a bi.........g truck driver. jumped from his truck, to give her a fu.......nny grin... the end.
that's exactly what i asked them, they told me it was company policy not to discuss the interview process, so i was denied the apprenticeship and any kind of feedback on how i interviewed that could of helped me in the future. looking back, maybe it's not a company i would of enjoyed being with! still sucked at the time though.
well, you see, *they* might be innocent but you have to go to court to prove that their belongings aren't guilty. i wish i was kidding.
dogs should rule the world and not humans because they're so pure
that's. adorable. petrified of dogs, all it takes is a giant hairy drooling newfoundlander to get him to change his mind. that's the right dog for the job, truth be told :)
a polar bear can be good be a good boy too you know.
my fucking dog just ate a whole goddam frozen pizza that i was keeping outside to stay cold for tonight's dinner. pure my ass.
yep i'd go around in a pack if i could, but reality means i can barely afford to feed my one dog and take her to the vet if she really needs to go
someone did a photo shoot before/after calling people beautiful. similar effect.
it looks like it's berating the young hooligans in its front yard.
huh, you took the time and effort to notice this, instead of just understanding the joke and laughing
that's okay there is no need, thank you for the offer tho i really appreciate it.
it's a pizza box.... have you really never watched breaking bad?
i would suggest that it's more your own fault for buying frozen food without a freezer than the dog's.
my inlaws have 6 welsh corgis, sometimes i love it but most the time i hate it, and i'm the most pro-dog you can be.
it's usually not the biting, but the shaking part. and ... why do you think squeaky toys make that sound?
"oh bother, there's a group of ruffian youths milling about on the lawn! i best root them out before they trample the petunias!"
huh, you took the time and effort to comment on his realization about the editing, instead of carrying on with your day ignoring the comment.
wait what? can you explain or at least re word it?
i'm currently working in psychiatry, and the psychiatrists who specialise in adolescent psychiatric cases are really averse to overuse of social media. there has been literature out for a while showing the correlation between this and low mood, and subjectively a lot of the consultants/attendings i've spoken to feel that their case load and intensity has worsened alongside the rising prevalence of snap/insta/whatever.
tell me, summer. if a human was born with stumpy legs, would they breed it with another deformed human and put their children on display like the dachshund?
nice job throwing away your dog shit like a proper owner rather then tossing it into the bushes like a lazy cunt.
great, now i cant get the picture of trump asking the crowd whos a good voter out of my head
curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the petunias as they were trampled was "oh no, not again." many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the petunias had thought that, we would know a lot more about the nature of the universe than we do now.
that's pretty much why i'm just like "fuck little dogs". i had a sheltie growing up. thing was an asshole. i dated a girl with a beagle, that thing was such a little shit. other yippy dogs are just high pitched and never shut up.
1. farm karma so account registers as legitimate. 2. sell to somebody who has it run by a script to manipulate votes on specific posts/comments.
i wonder if it's possible that it goes the other direction, though. to me, it seems more that a teenager's development and personality determines their social media behavior, rather than social media shaping who they are. obviously this is anecdotal, but just thinking about my own adolescence (i'm only 22, so social media was around)...i had a couple of friends who were emotionally immature, so when they got into social media, the way they used it wasn't the greatest. but it's not as if it changed them. it was just one more platform for them to use, for better or for worse. the way they chose to use it wasn't surprising at all. and then there was me and friends with similar personalities, who pretty much used it to ask each other homework questions, plan events, and talk about tv shows.

as a garbage man nothing pisses me off more than having to get 20 dog shit bags out of the bottom of a can. and yes thank you for picking up your dog's shit at the same time.
i live on 40 acres that i own. anyone walking in those weeds is trespassing. so i'll respectfully disagree that it's not "a proper place".
an upvote, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have.
i noticed that when i'm depressed, i'll be much mor active on social media....
the fact that you even do this makes you a hell of alot better than my garbage men. they don't give a fuck about anything. they'll leave em half full. take 3 of 4 cans. throw them everywhere.
yeah we all stand in dog shit and we also all know how annoying it is. it's not hard to dispose of a lil bag of crap and most dog owners manage it. you lazy bitches give the rest of us a bad name.
i quickly frost and cool my food this way. it's one of those things that you didnt think you'd need, but you really reallyy do.
i put 6 packs on my deck on cold days while preparing for watching the jets on sunday. i need each and every one of those beers to drown the disappointment playing on the tv.
i want you to know i hate everything you said. i love it.
everytime i just think of it as a comedian telling a great joke then going "oh jeez hey thanks for laughing at my joke everyone!"

who cares about elections when you have that much money in your bank account? you could buy an african country or island and be the king there
"barrack obama and mitt romney?? what is this, a crossover episode??"
looks like the same shirt too. where do these guys shop? senate 'r us?
it was, but not for the reasons you're thinking. mccain lost mostly because obama was unstoppable. palin was a catalyst that helped to unhinge the republican party. she gave a voice to the beginnings of what became the tea party...which eventually led to paul ryan...and mutated into trumpism. the gop was already fracturing by the time bush left office, which is another reason why mccain lost. it might not have been as bad if she hadn't been on the ticket, but it was already happening.
yup. pretty much why he and romney lost, and trump won. both mccain and romney are decent human beings who wouldn't "go there" to pander to racial fears of uneducated white men. all while trump was pointing at president obama and screaming kenyan muslim at the top of his lungs.
watching mccain follow that up by pulling his legs above his head and lighting a monstrous fart to an enthralled audience would have likely gained him enough votes to win it all back in 2008.
she and mccain just took a trip to the baltic states to reassure our allies there. you know, like responsible politicians do. haha
statler: "i wish trump got inaugurated every day." waldorf: "you were that touched, huh?" statler: "no! the metro's never been more quiet!" both: "doh, oh oh oh oh!"
that's a really good point. it would be how she's an insider, panderer, etc.
most all of them do in fact get along. political theater is a very real thing and people buy it all day long.
politicians are actors that do what their funders want
imagine how ironic that slogan would be if they developed dementia
2000 mccain was reasonable. 2008 mccain thought that a complete moron was qualified to be vice president.
i really think you're overestimating their wealth by a huge margin lol
i really thought larry david was an awesome bern, too.
biden would be the plot catalyst next door neighbor.
"pizza and socialism" is the name of my college rock band.
their comraderie is nice their senate bills are spliced
i can imagine a fandom for this on tumblr with far reaching theories and a shit ton of rule 34 probably, because internet.
it's gonna be interesting to read historians and sociologists looking back at the 2008 election with a greater perspective. the obama campaign's momentum was partly because of a well organized campaign and likeable candidate, but also the overwhelming tide of frustrations, hopes and dreams of the american public. people who wanted a change saw a lot more in obama than was reasonably expected, and envisioned promises he himself never made. there is an animated music video, vote 4 hope by mc yogi, that is a pretty good summary of what people felt and were wanting out of obama.
yeah, because jesus was a middle-eastern jew handing out free healthcare and food to the poor while having pretty negative relations with money lenders, and thus would have run as a democrat.
2008 was an election year where i wasn't scared of either obama or mccain winning. i knew they differed but both were men of honor and integrity.
she's wrong, but i can't help but think how many poor old people read things on the internet and don't know it's a scam and it's a lie. they are from an era where the news was pretty straight forward and you didn't have some jerk off blogger writing "obama from kenya!"
exactly, me and my sisters absolutely couldn't agree less on lost things political. and i have friends as well that are in the same boat. but i love my sisters to death and i find nothing more enjoyable that breaking bread and drinking beer with those same friends i don't agree with sometimes.
as a conservative moderate, every day i hear more of the same complaints and hate from republican politicians and regular people ("obama was a disaster, repeal obamacare, drain the swamp") and not actually talking about solving our problems is a day i get closer to jumping ship to a third party despite the power the party will now have on washington. people like mccain who want to engage in civil discourse and work to find compromises and solutions across party lines are becoming a rarer and rarer thing on both sides.
because he *chose* sarah palin. and because he had nothing to offer when the economy started to collapse.
it's way more acceptable for someone who has served to be a war hawk than it would be for some trust fund brat who became a senator or president. at least mccain understands the cost of war.
except the economy was in the shitter before election day. no one with an r next to their name had a chance nationwide. we would have had president clinton in 2008.
trump won because democrats voted less than they did in 08 and 12 while the republican vote stayed pretty constant.
except ted cruz - everyone has hated, does hate, and will continue to hate ted cruz
yeah, it's trump whose alone in the wilderness now. if you approval rating remains low both party will race to impeach him.
if by civil you mean both sides equally represented and bashing each other
2008 mccain was running out of options after joe lieberman turned him down. nobody wants to be co-captain of the titanic.
cindy mccain was estimated to be worth $100,000,000 back in 2007, with an annual income of $400,000.
the dude has a passport stamp, too. and little souvenir flags.
he does an excellent job portraying an old jew from brooklyn... it's like he prepared for this his entire life.
*biden walks in with an ice cream cone* biden: "what's going on guys?!" *laugh track applause: wheeeeeeeeeeew* biden: "i thought a heard a ruckus goin' on!" *laugh track* biden: "so i says to myself, i'll go figure out what these two knuckleheads are up to." *laugh track*
"bern and mccain are bros of age after obama's gone away the orange brigade will march us to the grave"
what are we going to do tonight mccain? the same thing we do every night bernie. try to filibuster the world!
of course both pairs would share a bed, without it ever getting sexual. leave that to the fan fiction
oh hey frank! i didn't know you were coming; i would have put my hands on!
it's really interesting that you bring that up because in some ways i think trump represents the tide of frustrations, hopes and dreams, of many americans too. if /r/the_donald is to be believed, many of those americans are the same ones that had hoped for enormous change form obama and are now putting their weight behind a candidate whose policies, but also mannerisms and behavior, ensure large change.
mostly because of the new focus on populism, telling the people what they want to hear even if it puts off problems that we'll need to face in the future. also not to mention the strategic attack of difference institutions over 8 years to decrease people's faith of those institutions. most people aren't politicking all the time, and it's far easier to get those people to take things in politics at face value rather than critically analyzing why arrangements are made, policies are adopted, and programs fail. when that kind of analysis is delegitimized it's easy to have voters believe what they hear as the truth rather than finding it themselves. there's a reason trump attacks the news organizations rather than the articles themselves. it's a far more direct and effective way to delegitimize the information, and future information, to his supporters. like i said, strategic.
i think jesus would condemn this entire country based on consumerism alone.
i was only afraid of mccain winning because of palin. had he had a more sane running mate, i would have probably selected him over obama. but the idea of palin being a heartbeat away from the presidency was just too damned scary.
i was talking about this with some friends recently. if it's true (and i hope so) that means eventually we'll be way better at rooting that stuff out. but, something will replace it. we were musing what things we might not pick up on easily when we're in our 70s, because it'll happen. my friend was like, "yeah, like we'll accidentally walk through a pepsi-beam, where a restaurant has an invisible thing that makes you crave pepsi. so i'll be like wow, i really want pepsi even though i normally don't like soda. and my son will say "dad, you're standing in the pepsi-beam" and point to some little pepsi icon off attached to a wall pointed at me. and i'll be like, no, no, i just really want pepsi."
yeah i was thinking the same thing but i just figure he probably didn't put that together in the heat of the moment, you know?
the problem for me, and i'm guessing others, is that while i don't hold people's politics against them and won't refuse interaction, when they start to hold my politics against me and make a problem out of it, i refuse to try to interact with them anymore. i'm a socialist - in socialism's purist form - and one of my friends is a laissez-faire, anarcho-capitalist. neither of us are offended by the others beliefs - confused, maybe, or not understanding, but there's no problem. people, it seems, have forgotten how to peacefully disagree.
this is exactly why people are so upset about this election on a personal level. so many of the policies are personal attacks on people's rights. saying you support that has turned personal. access to weapons and climate change are big and daunting enough to think about it as a broad issue of disagreeing, but possibly a civil discussion. telling someone you value someone who wants to take away reproductive rights and their life-saving healthcare system is a direct hit.
i honestly feel so ostracized as a conservative leaning moderate. my family is ultra conservative and my friends are very liberal, so my opinions get shit on from both sides. it's pretty tough, especially when my stance on most issues is conservative leaning but i couldn't bring myself to vote for a person like trump. oh well, at least i get the privilege of living in a country where my views won't get me shot.
they weren't clapping for his defense of obama, but his reiteration that he was disagreeing with obama on issues and that's what his campaign's about. same thing happened at the end of the first clip in that video. bringing it back to the campaign stops the boos and starts the clapping.
yeah. the democrats perhaps should have saved their ammo, so to speak.
ted cruz for human president was one of my favorite political commentary things of the past several years.
sorry, canadian here. but i was under the impression that bernie doesn't take donations? i thought that was a big selling point of his
they also don't become career politicians by being unlikeable, especially in american politics where everyone probably agrees more with certain members of the other party than some members of their own.
although if trump did eventually stand trial before the senate, i doubt he'd vote against ~~impeachment~~ convicting trump.
then trump gets invited and all is well until putin calls in pissed off wondering why he wasn't invited
he's just looking to suck some gen, why you gotta get all technical?
i immediately pictured a set up like in old tv shows and movies where a married couple slept in separate beds. i know that's the opposite of what you said, but it's what i pictured.
it's interesting because obama and trump supporters want the exact same thing, albeit in very, very different approaches. better jobs, less taxes, a safer country, better healthcare, and more opportunities for their children. with the progressives, obama was the answer because of his messages of hope and the fact that he was so different from career politicians. with the disenfranchised rust belt and others, trump was the answer because of his message of anger and frustration at a system run by elites that doesn't work for you, was so different from career politicians. taking out the rhetoric, lies, and party politics, we all want the same thing and if both sides stopped pointing fingers and accusations, we would be able to achieve so much. unfortunately, human nature -- anger and greed -- will always be a stronger driver of politics and policy.
there is merit to this statement. one black friday i was in line for easily 16 hours at a best buy. the crowd had become hostile over people cutting in line. the policy had to come and supervise to ensure no violence. the energy had became extremely negative. then a man came with a giant cross and started preaching, calling us idolators. now as a christian i dont advocate this approach, but as he preached i had to ask myself, "when's the last time i put this much time and effort for god as i have trying to get this new tv on black friday?" i didnt have an answer. he was right. i felt convicted of my idolatry and consumerism. i no longer participate in black friday
it's not that small. catholics in particular have a large left block
he's saying if he had, for example what if everyone but kasich had dropped out early? do you think trump still would have won?
it's almost like reddit readers are generally liberal
yeah, i have a short memory. she was poison to his campaign. i'm a bleeding heart through and through, but i still think it's too bad that palin caused mccain far more trouble than she could possibly have been worth.
that's actually a pretty amazing thought, i'd love to muse about shit like that with you guys. thanks for sharing :-p
also underscores that people look to leaders for guidance, something trump took complete advantage of by understanding you can just flat out lie and people like this lady has no ability to question it.
hell, my 50 y/o step uncle posts baloney articles a lot and it takes me all of two seconds to realize there is 0 credibility from the site, the writer and the claim.
ah, those silly boomers. working so tirelessly to stifle the science and progress that extended their lifespan.
my grandma shared a "historic" photo of vets in vietnam. i had to explain to her that ben stiller was not in vietnam during the war.
i am illustrating that the scenarios were similar. in fact, almost identical. in both cases, a member of the audience accused obama of being a foreign muslim to deligitimize him. the **responses** of the candidates were very different. we are agreeing here.
i think the problem is when people start to allow themselves to be defined by their political beliefs. unless i tell them, none of my friends could ever guess my political leanings, and that's a good thing. there's nothing i hate more than people who feel the need to constantly proclaim their political views, drop nuggets of political wisdom here and there, and wear tshirts with inane slogans everywhere. people's beliefs can influence, but should be entirely separate from their public personality.
day after election someone was talking about how "liberals need to put on their big boys and big girls panties and get over it" and i almost exploded about how this isn't american idol, this is the future of our country, extend a little empathy if people are concerned about a madman running the country.
i feel you on the whole "stuck between two polarized groups" thing. i'm a college aged liberal who leans right on certain issues (some states rights, gun rights, etc), with uber-liberal friends and profs and a mostly ultra-conservative family. i just want to compromise on some shit man, not scream the other bastards down.
look to your state legislators to help make that a reality! check their voting records, see who is actively serving the people best, and talk to them! at the state and city level, legislators are far more receptive to their constituents, and you can expect to hear an answer and to enact meaningful change. if we can praise the good and nominate them for office, these are the people who will succeed and take over for the federal legislators we dislike now.
i felt that obama ran too soon myself. i was an illinois resident and knew he would run one day, but i was thinking 2012 or 2016. when he announced in 2006 i was shocked. but was thrilled since i wanted someone who didn't vote to invade iraq.
that may be part of the issue. if she'd been as genuine throughout the campaign as she was in her concession speech she may have had a better chance. it probably wouldn't have erased the kilimanjaro of shady shit throughout her political career, or the ongoing fbi investigation, but i think the fact that nobody could relate to her was what killed her most. everything she said sounded focus-group approved. people proved that they would rather hear simple, digestible, and somewhat offensive speeches than a bunch of pretty words with no real meaning.
calibrating to the interest of each particular group you are speaking to with canned responses and mannerisms specifically designed for what that group wants to hear is how i think of pandering
isn't this his first term in the senate? honestly idc, i'm a republican and i hate lying ted
i believe he's talking about politicians in general.
yeah pence would be far more preferable for most republicans i imagine.
i feel a sexier hymen centipede vibe coming on here.
the problem is tribalism. the battle of team red vs team blue has fucked this country beyond belief
oh boy would i like to introduce you to my dad. he is a **yuge** supporter of big cheeto and would enthusiastically extol the virtues of the orange colored buffoon if you'd loan him your ear. in fact i know several unapologetic trump worshippers, what i have never encountered is a person who liked secretary clinton. every clinton voter i know (including me) voted for her either because of her party affiliation or because she wasn't donald trump.
did you get out of line that day? can't really blame if you didn't after 16 hours, just kinda curious.
a young middle eastern man confronts walmart for their policies. what happens next will warm your heart!
yeah, and i'd love to vote for him, but like, everyone is gonna vote for the major parties, and we'll just be better off if we deny that twit from the bad party, so i can't vote for jesus.
and those of us a bit more to the right think the same of obama. i would have loved to be able to vote for another kind, genuine human being.
my friends and i also discuss things like this as we try to understand why the elderly seem almost mentally handicapped. i posit the reason is due to their education during a period where much was unknown, conformity was strictly enforced, independent thought was discouraged, and the average person wasn't expected to excel or even be intelligent. think about it. the school systems back then mainly aimed to teach them to read and do basic math. i was doing more complex math at 14 than most of my grandparents generation ever did in their lifetimes. they didn't accept evolution back then. ecology as a field of study didn't exist. psychology was being invented/discovered. the big bang and much of maths hadn't been discovered/hypothesized. the school system was designed to create factory workers, plain and simple. and what it created was plain and simple people.
50s pressing the line of you should know better/youre just believing what you want to believe
seems fair, ignore the equal stupidity and ignorance of the older generation, the generation running government and making the tangible decision, and blame the damn kids.
someone claimed a pizza place were running a child prostitution ring for the democratic party, someone went there with an assault rifle to free the children.
oh i understand. my initial understanding of it was that you were saying the situation and the response are the same.
it's also the same people who bitched constently through obama's presidency.
i feel your pain, i'm in the exact same boat. liberal-leaning moderate with a few conservative positions, ultra-conservative family, ultra-liberal friends. fuck, where i work is a mixed bag but even there, everyone is either reallllllly liberal or reallllllly conservative. i can't talk about politics at all except on the internet because i'll get my head bit off from both sides. i made the mistake of admitting i support both feminism and men's rights once. yeah, never getting into that one again.
it's sad that americans vote for a politician they can relate to, rather than what their platform says and what their political affiliation is.
well, they could. they were just limited to the 2,000 dollar donation limit that most americans are limited to. also, they could have volunteered if they wanted to help.
i loved it! it was great! well, it wasn't bad.. i didn't really like it. it was pretty terrible. boo! booooh!
he's just a big "suits" fan. this isn't realistic jargon, but it's good enough to be on some tv drama...
by merely mentioning frozen then fried processed chicken pieces, you have doomed us all.
the problem is those damn wedge issues: gay marriage, abortion, etc. make no mistake; those *are* very important issues. but it's the strong opinions about these issues, on both sides, that keep people from uniting around the other issues that they agree upon.
a lot of people are huge supporters of him, but even the huge supporters spend a lot of time asking democrats how they can trust in hillary. if they spent more time focusing on their own ideologies, they might realize that trump is not the best choice for people that have a net worth less than $1 million.
of course he didn't, even jesus would fall for sunk cost fallacy.
maybe, but i can't complain of whatever benign approach works
and then the cops arrest him, give him an unfair trial, let the real criminals loose, and have him killed... truly nothing has changed.
i am part of the christian left. but we're diverse. i would say most christian lefts are cool with contraception, but not abortion. i say both have to be legal. i don't like that abortion exists, but until we create a society that stops unwanted pregnancies before they happen and better supports moms, abortion has to be legal. ideally, abortion would never have to be outlawed. we would just make the world such a good place that no one would seek out abortions. that's never going to be the case though. so they should be safe, legal, and accessible.
it's absolutely insane. and i've seen too many friends and co-workers fall into addiction from pinkness. (live in south alabama, there is what is essentially a pill farm not far from me) and it breaks my heart.
yeah let's hold different people to different standards, it's only fair to everybody...
to your last point. i don't understand why some people think that feminism and mens rights are mutually exclusive things.
woah. who eats frozen tendies? canes all the way!
and the political parties play on the strong beliefs people have regarding these issues to slowly gain more control over the government
i think i'm in the same boat as you. i'm not a fan of abortion but i don't think it's "evil"; i think it's an unfortunately drastic measure in a system that doesn't do enough to provide adequate sexual education or support. it's refreshing to see such pragmatism, because it's a really touchy issue any way you look at it
nah i've just given up on most over 60 to do anything other than fuck up with their decision making in politics due to their inability to not be greedy as fuck temporarily broke millionaires with a fuck you $2.75/hr was good enough for me in the 70s so it should be good enough for you today mentality.
you should work at the big bang theory they'll love you there.
how could an atheist give me moral support, if they don't have any morals at all? checkmate atheists.
judging the women just makes no sense anyway. judge the society that got them there if you have to judge someone
i actually made a comment like that in iasip, and apparently bbt is filmed with a live studio audience. not as fake as an entirely artificial laugh track, but still.
fair point! *continues to rape and plunder the countryside*
here's my stance on abortion. i can't ever imagine i would have one. that being said, i don't think the women have the right to make that decision alone except in certain circumstances. if you were raped, absolutely make that decision alone. if you willingly put yourself in that situation, i am of the belief that the donor (for lack of a better word) has a say. i don't think the government should make the choice for us, but i also don't agree that women get to make that choice for the men, either. if you can't afford the child or aren't stable enough for it, abortion is an option. if you don't want to lose your figure? then take birth control while using condoms and any other number of the available contraceptives. don't put your vanity above a child's life. yes, i've had someone tell me they got an abortion for just that reason. i still think prevention is better (and cheaper) than abortion, though.
mr president get down! *funky music plays* *obama proceeds to get down*
god i respect joe biden so fucking much. he grabbed the hand of the first black president of the united states, and literally walked into the fucking darkness with him. it could have been an *awful* time for them, but he didn't give a fuck. he double fisted his ice cream cones and said "let's fuckin' do this, barry."
wait! they'd have really made him president if obama died? i thought that was all just a joke.
same. "give it a few minutes. this will be on the front page. i'm sure of it."
this is clearly a joke comment, why are people losing their shit
not to be a party pooper but isn't that a significant waste of resources? i mean, angels are dead... or, at the very least, invincible undead.
i had no idea wtf you were talking about, so i had to rewatch the gif. you're absolutely right. biden points at himself with his thumb, then at obama with his finger gun. it clearly says "we did it together". i honestly didn't expect to agree with you. thank you for your insight.
i heard that he was planning on running for this election, but his son passed away around the time he would have to decide/start campaigning so he decided not to.
i agree, with the added bonus that i think joe biden was actually much more in tune with the working-class american than hillary. he wouldn't have been seen as so elitist and establishment as hillary was.
i really enjoying imagining that obama and biden think of republicans in the same way jfk thought of communists. *damn reds!*
when you go to wink but your 74-year-old, decrepit face muscles let you down
please delete this before mike pence gets any ideas.
so you're sayin the secret service would finger-bang the vp before he could finger-bang the president? wow, those guys must be good.
poor guy has a right. wife and daughter die in a car accident. then his son dies of cancer years later. whole family gone, all while attempting to maintain a country.
i started crying when he spoke about michelle. when he mentioned joe and they panned to him i lost it.
biden is blacker than russell wilson and rg3 put together.
and then made god damned friendship bracelets for each other. *sobs quietly*
i don't mean brother like a real brother but the way black people use it, which i think is more meaningful -derek zoolander
you should see who they're going to make president when obama leaves office.
while i love that idea, it'd be bad for the country, and the obama administration would never allow it. this whole time obama has made a *big* deal about maintaining the peaceful transfer of power. he could have tried to redo the election (as austria did), he could have ordered further investigations, he could have refused to meet with or congratulate the president-elect until there was a full national recount of all paper ballots. in all of those things he would have had the support of a huge segment of the public, and it could be argued that he was doing it on reasonable grounds, but he knew there was something more important and handled it with statesmanship. as bad as trump is, obama's emphasis of the role peaceful transfer of power holds in our democracy is one of his most important decisions. it is, after all, the pillar of our democracy, and any slip up makes it easier to justify abusing it down the road.
i don't really know what biden's style of debate is, but i'm sure it's entertaining.
at least now he'll be able to wash that bitchin' white trans-am.
he was qualified and well-liked by his base. if it weren't for his son's death, he would have ran and most likely won.
joe's brashness would have been a perfect match against trump.
people just fucking hate hillary. and with a little help of our comrade putin and trump had it on the bag.
yeah, joe is establishment, but joe didn't have nearly as much baggage as hillary. trump capitalized on her long list of scandals. i personally think joe would have had a better chance at beating trump, as did bernie. it would have been a win for the democrats for either one of them.
i want them & their families to go to acapulco, get some sun & some surf, & get regular updates from their tumblrs/twitters about them just chilling out. joe would eat all the soft serve ice cream he wants & tackle gerrymandering while jill organizes her return to fighting the good fight against breast cancer. barack & michele would *slay* at salsa class, fall in love all over again & embarrass their daughters. that'd be beautiful.
but what if paul ryan then kills pence and pardons himself?
i think killing the president is a federal crime, actually. i'll let someone else google that, though.
you mean to tell me that the joe genes are not going to be passed on?
it was cool having a couple of best bros in the white house after whatever the fuck bush and cheney were.
*googles* oh haha yeah very funny reddit, but seriously who?
and the whole point of the concept of a "vice" in the first place. on the other hand, we now have companies with 15 vice presidents...
i mean i'm not american, but don't you guys have arnold schndwehrfiuewrfiuewyrger as a governor, and wasn't reagan and someone else in films too? and a couple sons of presidents became presidents? seems like more of a popularity contest than anything. yes i know technically all voting is a popularity contest, but you know what i'm talking about here.
only limited to one elected term if you serve more than two years of someone else's elected term. serving less than half a term basically doesn't count. he'd be good for two.
every time paul ryan would say something, biden would make a face that said "lol this is some bullshit"
emotion. trump does well when he's surrounded by people less human than himself. examples being the republican primaries, and clinton. biden is substantially more human than trump. it counts as a potential game changing difference.
we may have witnessed the first ever (televised) vice-presidential pimp slap.
he'll be out there somewhere, bird-dogging bored housewives when he's done installing above-ground pools. the good life.
been saying this for a year. joe has a habit of being too honest, brash, and sticking his foot in his mouth, and in a "normal" election, would have been a bad thing at points. but in this election? he would have been the perfect anti-trump. but his son passing messed with him, and he admitted he just wasn't up for the campaign trail mentally.
trump won by 80,000 votes in the right places, and lost the popular vote by 2.8 million, he never really 'had it in the bag'; he barely scraped by on a technicality, much like bush jr. and like bush jr i expect his presidency will be another catastrophe for the world and the american people.
"man brings lunch from home to cut down on small joys" which is so true.
well, no, because if it came out after he was sworn in he could just get impeached and then shipped off to jail.
"make sure it's not the edited for tv version cause then you never get to see any titties"
no we're still good there, he has at least 5 grandkids from his sons beau and hunter and he has a 2nd daughter
sith lord and his apprentice? the twist being that cheney was the sith lord, and he made his apprentice leader to deflect the scrutiny that comes with being a leader. it was a brilliant play.
here, take a big sip of this water before we tell you. you seem a little parched.
the governator was actually decent. i'll admit he was probably elected based on popularity, but at least his popularity was based on being an all-around badass -- a helpful trait when governing a state like california. this doesn't negate your point at all, though. we californians just got lucky with arnie. also, jerry brown replaced the governator in 2011.
how many times do they have to be wrong before they realize they're hysterically against a person without any evidence, while supporting a person who the evidence has been piled on against? fuck i hate some of humanity, genuinely, a real cancer holding back our civilization and happiness.
"ohh joe there you go again (bringing up facts i can't refute)" sarah palin
40% of the nation would have loved it and another 20% would respect him for it.
it helps when that vp is fueled by pure hell energy. if cheney turned into a swarm of bats like dracula and flew back home i'd only be slightly surprised.
parents should never outlive their children. it must be the worst pain imaginable.
"special olympics tee ball tee pitches perfect game"
with the right drugs and quantities, you can live in any reality.
potus can pardon anyone including themselves against anything but impeachment.
it's mostly because of the aviators. 1. most of the unflattering nature of eating is the aggressive, unfocused expression you get while biting in. if you're wearing sunglasses, you look composed. 2. aviators are cool.
so. he still has a reason to potentially run for potus ? nice.
now i want to see a movie were bush and cheney are actual sith lords and scream unlimited power.
srsly, i can only get so hard. also, someone make a meme of op's gif: biden abides
someone needs to make one of those whitehouse.gov petitions.
and when obama heads off into the sunset and their worst fears weren't realised they sit back and think; "gawly, it's sure lucky we were so on top of that muslim, that could have got really out of hand"
his debate with sarah palin was also memorable. she tried to claim senator biden didnt know what it was like to be a working class person, and joe masterfully talked about his experiences in being a single dad.
it was a grown man laughing to himself while a child tried to lie about all the amazing things he could do. it was glorious.
i'd be surprised that supernatural evil does exist, not that cheney was the embodiment of it, though.
"god finally gives shout-out back to all his niggaz"
hmm, so i guess the potus could pretty much do whatever they wanted so long as the house was willing to go along and not impeach them. that's a bit unsettling.
yeah it's only a problem if you're a member of the labour party, it tends to be the right wing tabloids that actually run with that kind of thing
with a "order 66 accomplished" banner flying behind them.
yep, being a bodybuilder and actor doesn't automatically mean you aren't fit for a governing role just like being whatever trump was before he was elected didn't automatically make him a bad fit for a governing role. it's just trump himself making him a bad choice.
he called her on her shit, but went a little easier on her. (optics, i guess.) he was relentless with paul ryan. you could see pauly getting flustered. i still laugh when i think about that debate.
and paul ryan was adorable. "aw, kid, i'll get you a lollipop and tell you a story about ronald reagan." -joe biden, probably
"jurisprudence fetishist gets off on technicality"
that's the point, isn't it? if two branches of the government feel a certain way on a given topic, it's unlikely for that opinion and any consequential action to be made with intent that is malicious to the constituency. ultimately both should be held accountable to the people, and it's very unlikely for both to deviate strongly enough to allow the president any more power than the people desire.
actually it's because leo won that oscar. it upset the universal laws
there are a significant number of people who voted for trump that will deny to their graves that birtherism had anything whatsoever to do with race.
someone once said "being black you have to be 200% better just to be seen as normal". i can literally find no fault in the actions of first lady obama while having the seat of first lady. none, her mannerism, etiquette, activities, language, actions are that of the highest caliber of what young women should strive to model themselves after as a role model in both her marriage and her position. and this is the person with more headlines insulting her than any other female person in the world. it truly boggles the mind. if i was in her position, i'd have cursed every single one of you out, twice, on live tv, as obama looked in horror as i let you know just what i think of idiots who don't know anything talking shit about my husband.
i wonder how different the world would have been if mccain had of beat bush in 2000. i think about this a lot. i really think that was a huge dividing line in our history and not a lot of people realize it. maybe decades from now we all will, i dunno.
and here i am, sitting in germany where one half of the population starts talking and acting like it's the 1940s again and i still feel more comfortable than most of you americans.
it was a master stroke. ryan came in so far up his own ass believing his bullshit and biden played him like liberace played the ivories. that was and still is how you know a seasoned politician vs a poseur. i would have given anything to see biden square off against the cheeto messiah. biden would have had the stones to know when trump would have rolled out the bullshit half truths and countered it savagely.
its probably the most famous burn in modern american politics
it all makes sense now. everything that's happened this year... it all started with him! we have to go back! change the past to save our future!
i asked my dad why he was hating on her? that she didnt do a thing wrong. that he was only trying to hate on obama. and that it hurt me that you consider her a man. if it was true that she was trans. that shut him up really quick.
i think more people wonder what would have happened if gore hadn't been fucked by the electoral college/biased judges/almost definite floridian vote rigging
that's literally one of the things her grandmother said to me while i was visiting. she claimed that wind turbines drastically alter the wind pattern of the earth, which can cause the planet to stop rotating. i needed a forklift to pick my jaw up off the ground.
i found that biting my tongue just made me bottle up my annoyance until it inappropriately exploded. instead i found it better to just respond sarcastically once and make no further remarks regardless of their response.
i'm sure biden would destroy trump, but obviously it wouldn't matter. trump blazed through the election into victory riding on a wave of shit that his voters opened their mouth wide to drink. facts mean nothing. reality is irrelevant to those people.
it kills me how people can't distinguish someone's opinions vs who that person is. case in point: i'm pro-life, in most cases. obama might not be. we may share opposing view on this. i dislike that. however none of that changes the fact that obama has been the most suave president of my lifetime. irregardless of someone's hate on the stances of her husband, to dislike her simply because of those reasons is really selfish, mean, and rude. in reverse, trump is a crude man, i dislike him because of the crude things he does on the daily without remorse. his wife? i don't know her, as such i have no opinion of his wife. (yes i know she copied a speech, big woop, she copied from the best :d) i'm glad you were brave enough to explain your emotions to your father. i'm sure it made him think hard on the subject. i'm pretty curious to know what happened after you told your father all that? also what's different being transgendered?
let it go man... gore still lost when the fl votes were recounted by 3rd parties after the election had been decided. the real tragedy isn't bush, but all of the unauditable electronic machines that were forced into every district during the aftermath.
hmm that makes sense, i imagine god prefers idiots since they're much easier to control.
when does sarcasm develop in children? i think that kid is way ahead of the curve.
hahahaa, this is *reddit* we're talking about here.
i tried to deep throat a pretty small pickle the other day. it was really hard. i have a new found respect for people that can deep throat.
the phrase is "threw a party" not "tossed a party". it's an odd euphemistic use of the word "throw", it has no discernible literal meaning. welcome to english.
reddit is nothing if not predictable on these matters.
and he walked down to get to that row just to touch the player. the guy was a fucking bull in a china shop after he showed up.
last time i saw this gif i also saw this exact same comment. strange...
are you suggesting... dis-arm-ament? i am so sorry...
"oh no, that lady just spilt beer all over herself"
same. i've seen this several times and always see comments like "well give him a break he just got his new arms and doesn't know how to use them yet." this whole time i thought that was a bit of an overstatement commenting on how it took the player a couple seconds to pick up the phone.
yeah, luckily i was a huge pussy back then. i still am. but good thing i was then too.
it's worse for the person losing the teeth. trust me i know.
holy shit, i thought it wasn't funny because it's just a guy with a shitty costume, thank you for this comment.
that's concussion material. don't have to hit your head for the brain to wiggle around
and the bull was trying to gore the kid after he fell down. really committed to their roles, those fellas.
hey it's not that small. it was cold in the fridge, k?
he's a funny guy? funny, how? like a clown? does he amuse you?
conversely, as a teenager, i had started catching on to these little things (particularly the noises) and took full advantage. coming home late? don't ever step directly in front of the first stair, step to far right of the second, skip the 3rd entirely, all the way left on the next 3, middle of the next 2, then left, right, and you're on the landing. never ever walk through the middle of the hall way, and when you go to open the door, always gently but firmly pull the knob before turning it so it doesn't make that loud clicking noise.
shit, i still have one. it's where my gaming rig is set up. granted i call it my office now, but we all know it's really just a place i go to play games and privately look at pictures of kittens.
haha i like how she's holding the baby halfassed but completely focused on being impressed with the dad.
seriously she's just dangling her by the leg, pull her up!
you should have just wedged a 2x4 in there, you got swindled by the strut industry.
and also don't cross roads between vehicles, where you're damn-near impossible for drivers to see until you're already on the road.
the same thing happened to me. a kid stepped out from parked cars into the street and i hit him with my car. i felt just terrible, then to add insult to injury, my car insurance company sued the kids parents for the damage to the car.
that happens when they take 30 fps video, drop it down to 5 fps, and repeat the frames to get it to play without speed up.
i like how happy he is with himself while destroying the world around him in sheer ignorant bliss.
i saw that part, then when i rewatched it i noticed he also caused the phone fumble.
i'm just gonna flail my arms around like an idiot!
well give you a break. you just got your new eyes and haven't land to use them yet
i also used to fear eye drops. i still do, but i used to, too.
there are chemicals that denature the glue, you see. they also denature eyeballs, but that's irrelevant.
3 be fare its not like those things are imtorpnatn any ways
that must be one hell of a trick to show at parties. might bring up some questions though.
good point. my mom would be pretty pissed if i died from a pickle.
damn! thanks dude! i'll give both of those a try.
i have to do the door knob trick to sneak away from my puppy, haha
my name is actually alexa and i also have this power. you can bet your ass people in my house have been asking me even more lately. i will never understand why amazon had to choose a real name...
"fuck this kid, i want that man's dick in my vagina!"
well the dad is also like, "my work here is done, do your part." and gives zero fucks
that's what the wife said. but $35 shipped to my door is worth not having to dig around for a piece of wood.
if i ever have to cross between vehicles like that i poke my head out like a little gopher, assessing the situation before ever daring to bring my whole body out and walk in front of traffic. your think this lady would be a bit more cautious with kids. it's a shame she didn't get hit instead.
still doesn't mean you shouldn't look both ways before crossing. even if it wasn't a car, cyclists go down the wrong way down one way roads all the time.
that kid was younger, the only one crying, and slowest to get up. the older child got up quickly -- mother just noticed the one that looks in more pain.
exactly what i was thinking! i know it's instinct to pick up the little one, but you don't fucking walk away from the other child after you get him. she didn't even look at her, just grabbed the boy and walked off.
if you back the video waaaay up, he also caused the baseball player to fall into the stands!
pondarosa vs mcpoyle or something like that in the latest season
might also bring up some answers as well...to some lifelong questions.
no problem. just in case you want to deep throat another pickle...
well, now i'm 28 and haven't lived at my parents in almost 10 years. but yeah, there were other things they caught onto. they just stopped caring as much since i was practically an adult and was keeping my grades up.
for me it's more about predictive analytics. i really don't care what they're doing. but i know the cup is this close to the edge of the table, my daughter is sitting in this position, so assuming she swings around and hits it, it'll land roughly there on the floor. when she starts turning, that's when i start paying attention to see if she'll make impact. if she does, i put my hand somewhere between the edge of the table and the pre-determined location, and fine-tune as it skids across the table and starts flipping as it falls. then she laughs because dad just did something "impossible" and she does it again 30 seconds later to see if i'll catch it a second time.
that's how they got into this mess in the first place
have a 2 year old. can confirm. takes some practice but you can eventually go into this half-sleep state where you're still monitoring for suspicious movements/sounds/kid trying to kill themselves
well, he's in a very awkward position to get the kid
i was mostly joking. but my genetic makeup is like 40% white trash, so i was at least a little serious
at the beginning of the video he convinces trump to run for president.
that dude definitely cruises down the street at 15mph straddling the lanes and leaves people at red lights all the time. i can feel it.
i would've definitely done both of those things...
they were also more common back when it was more common for a family to have one computer that was shared by all. and before computers, they were usually called a den, or sitting room.
that one is really easy to prevent. strap your kid into the stroller after placing them in it. hell, even if you are too lazy for that don't let them stand up in the stroller. obviously a grandpa who doesn't give a fuck anymore. he just wants the kid to have fun while he is around. which is what grandparents are for. he just has to work on the whole 'don't let them smash their face into the ground' part of having fun.
yea but with head injuries like that it may not manifest itself until grade school.
girls def do get turned on by a guy protecting his kids.
"suspicious sounds" also includes total silence, which usually means something really bad is going on
not always, sometimes you're trying to avoid talking to your kids too
i did use a snowbrush after that, but forgot on the last time i was under the hood and that was it for me.
that part is a few minutes in. if you look closely at the start of the video you can watch as he accidently topples a little kid into the gorilla exhibit at the cincy zoo.
he probably parks in the spot right in front of the gas station, even though everyone who frequents there knows parking in that spot makes it harder for *everyone else* to maneuver around the pumps. then, because he's such a brisk walker, he beats you in line by a couple steps and proceeds to ask the hungover cashier how his day is and if he's "workin' hard or hardly workin!" before remembering that he wanted to grab a hot dog really quick, even though everything's rung up and he's been read his total.
it took me awhile to figure out what nail glue was. i was picturing lumber and couldn't imagine how she could mistake wood glue for eye drops.
maybe it's just being vaguely scared shitless all the time. the little fuckers spend *all damn day* trying to kill themselves.
that's not quite as bad as what my uncle made me eat.
where does one obtain a fucking stroller? the one we have is just a plain, boring, do-nothing stroller.
i've scorpioned before. surprisingly not as painful as you think. did i have a face full of sand? sure. did i have a kink in my neck for the next week? absolutely. but surprisingly not gnarly injury.
one time it was because the kid was at the bottom of the pool. it was maybe 3 mins of too quietness. shook the water out of his lungs and now he only has a slightly worse case of autism than he already had. please note, this was not my kid, just my pool, however i no longer bang chicks with kids.
well at least he has an exemplary resume, including being the chief engineer of deepwater horizon.
i know it gets said a lot but i'm really surprised how many of us make it to adulthood.
does your name mean fatal chemist or fat alchemist? or both?
wait a minute, pools give kids the tism? i was told it was only vaccination! my whole world is a lie!
that wasn't his first gig in oil and gas. prior to woking for bp, he was a ship captain for exxon.
yeah but there's a 50/50 chance you're going to ascend to literal godhood after you die. a trillion frenzied worshippers gotta do something to the warp.
evolution at work. those who are unsuitable fail to pass on their unsuitability onto the next generation, thus reinforcing the genes of those who are suitable.
turns out everyone mixed up vaccination with vacation
as a child he got the chance to take over the navigator's job for a day on an ocean voyage. that ship? the titanic.
seriously, if the eldar could create slaanesh just by doing a lot of coke and fucking everything, you'd think by now the humans would've turned the emperor into a chaos god.
i remember when i was this kid's age, and my grandpa asked me to take the trash up to the end of his long driveway. that week's garbage was rather rancid, and the nasty odor was wafting from the can as i pushed it in front of me. i kept stopping every ten feet to force down my gag reflex. after i finally got done and got back into the house, my grandpa was looking at me as if i was 'special'. "you realize you could've just pulled that trashcan behind you, right?" he said in a slow and even tone, and i was so embarrassed i didn't look him in the eyes for the next couple hours. since then, i pull the trash behind me now.
little guy is dedicated though, if you're gonna be dumb, you better be tough.
mom woulda just told me i don't get no dinner until i get the trashcan back where it belongs. my choice.
i'm quite calm and logical guy, love to argue but never really scream at people in anger, they don't really make me mad. but inanimate objects... once i tore a fucking faucet from the sink.
you're doing it wrong. you've gotta side step while pushing one and pulling the other. keep them away from each other.
the kid was no match against the trash cans superior striking ability and ground game. it completely can-handled him.
he's probably have normal intelligence if he didn't keep getting whacked in the head every week by a garbage tote. *edit in response to below:: "he'd" =) ...but is "tote" not the correct word here?
see the wind ? it blew his can down the street, now he has to bring it back home. source : 45 degree street denizen
i'd say he's at least 10. people can criticize! everyone's acknowledging that he didn't give up. it's how you learn! go trashcan kid, go. never surrender.
it looks like a new neighborhood. here in the states suburbia is a real thing... fewer people live in urban city centers, everyone's moving into the suburbs. the suburbs are frequently built with dozens or hundreds of new homes at a time built on old farmland. the grass is rolled out onto the lawn using sod. there is a tree sapling on the parkway, odds are 50% it'll survive though. in the usa there's very few laws or restrictions preventing developers from buying up large swaths of farmland and building a few dozen homes. there's no population requirements, nothing says there needs to be a need for new homes. if this neighborhood is still around in 20-30 years it'll likely have more trees, bushes, etc.
here's a dumber story to make you feel better. my uncle once asked my cousin to put a bunch of sugar packets in a glass container for a babyshower.... 20 minutes later he checked on him and saw that my cousin had seriously spent 20 minutes opening all of the packets and emptying them into the container. he was 23 years old.
or charlie brown's kite, or trying to kick the football!
after seeing your username, i'll bite. explain more?
i thought the same, kid stuck it out to the bitter end.
i had that same choice, but unfortunately for me i was a willful little shit. i went without food for a day and a half until my mom finally gave in and i got to wear my light up shoes and and batman shirt to school.
12 year old me would've loved a tractor. instead i got to buy my own shit.
unless the person being scared freaks out and punches/attacks them out of fright or natural reflexes. in high school we had a teacher with ptsd. a kid didn't know this and snuck up behind him, teacher ended up punching kid in face.
dude, i think he meant the child had pers-ooooohhhhh i see what you did
i'm trying to figure out how to get three. i can tilt one and push that one and tilt another to drag behind that one and put in the left hand. last i grab the third and drag on my right, but if i hit any snags i am a goner.
i thought you got gold for a stupid comment, then i got to the can-handled part
one of my group of friends favourite quote is "don't help him... watch him struggle"
i was wondering what kind of household has so little trash that it can tip over and not spill anything...that makes sense now.
[-----------------------------------------] bout this high
and that's one thing i despise more than most. those kinds of housing communities ought to be illegal to build.
wow...i actually facepalmed. haha...he must've been feeling like an idiot afterward.
yeah...mine was the same. only when i was about to actually put myself in danger would he stop me and tell me exactly what i wasn't supposed to do. like when he caught me playing with a matchbook in the middle of a shed full of dry pieces of wood and chemicals when i was 6. yeesh...how the hell am i still alive?
well the football was just because lucy was just a huge bitch
the fuckers just never roll straight. when you pull by the handle the can goes where ever the wheels want it to go. i always just manhandled them from the front. that and like in the gif the lid always finds a way to smack you in the face. and when the wheels inevitably fall off the cans always fall down. and people being cheap they just prop it up with a brick or try to "fix" them.
he also didn't show anger, and kept trying. im going to make an assumption that this kid will be successful based on a 20 second gif.
i was screaming "finish him!!" right before the powerslam...
look at this 1%er with his light up shoes. if i wanted light up shoes mom woulda told me to find some lightening bugs and smash 'em up on my feet.
luxury! in my day, we had to make our own shit! look at this fancy lad with his idle colon, flushing store-bought shit down the toilet like a kardashian. no luxuries like that on *our* farm, i can tell you.
that matched up with my inner dialog way too well.
my daughter's ex bf really like to scare people, a lot. my daughter has ptsd and other issues, so she didn't like it when he did it. one day, he got her really good in the bathroom. she just laid down on the floor and had a full on panic attack with crying and screaming. the ex bf initially just stood there for a moment, not understanding what just happened before he tried to console her.
there needs to be a subreddit for over-engineering solutions to every day problems like these. get together some civil engineers, a few 3d modelers, perhaps somebody with cnc machines and 3d printers to get prototypes, and then one last guy to sit there eating an apple and saying "why not just make two trips?"
a horizontal representation of your altitude, very nice.
it gives you a frame of reference for the lesson. source have kids if i tell them a better way they wont listen let them bust thier ass doing it the hard way then tell them. next time they are doing it the right way.
really, give kids a break. you're not born knowing how to do shit. i'm pretty sure i even remember a time before i'd learned that "actually, if i stop and think about this for a minute, i might think of a way to do it more easily." some grownup says do some stupid fucking thing and you just gotta do it.
here in my part of the world, your lot replaces the faulty bins with new working ones so you never have to fight bent axles, janky lids, and brick wheels
live in an area with high winds. high winds and they will go until they get stuck up against something. whoa to you if the wind is blowing from your house across an empty corn field that has been harvested. your bin will be on the far side of the field.
sometimes people throw out good stuff, but most time they don't, so if we see some nice stuff on someone's lawn trevor goes up, he grabs the stuff and basically he's doing them a favour, he's throwin it out for them, put it to the curb, that's putting out their garbage, that's not stealing, you can't get charged for that. he's not taking it, he's just taking it from there, and bringing it down to the curb...once it's at the curb it's garbage, so i come along and i take it, i'm just taking people's garbage, that's not stealing, so if he's not stealing and i'm not stealing, who's stealing? nobody, it's perfectly fair.
not me. hell i would still cry in a situation like this were things just seem to relentlessly compound on me and make me incredibly frustrated.
so you wouldn't have turned the trash can around and *pulled* it either?
you try thinking on your feet when you keep getting whacked on the head like that.
want to talk about 1%ers? in 1st grade i had a pair of shoes that when you pressed the tongue it would make (arguably) the sound of a rocket ship taking off. convinced my parents to let me wear them to school, and figured i'd be a smart ass and press it during class to see my teacher's reaction. it was way louder in the classroom than at home, and definitely got everybody's attention. then it kept going. and going. it was stuck in a loop and would not shut off. the teacher had to put my shoe in a closet to try to drown out the noise it was making. i had to wear *one* shoe for the rest of class. it was the most humiliating experience of my life.
that's what i was thinking. he better have amazing friends if he doesn't want them to just leave him in there while shitting their collective pants laughing.
maybe it's just because me and my family are mexican, but i never even considered that people may not have watched that show.
on the one hand, if he knew about the ptsd and that, *what a dick.* on the other, if he didn't, i can't imagine how guilty how felt about it.
yup. that's how my father did it too. smash your thumb with the hammer, "i warned ya, that's why i said hold it this way."
i suspect that the word you were looking for there is "woe" rather than "woah". :-)
after those first couple whacks to the noggin, his cognitive skills may have been severely compromised.
you make it sound like he's in a high pressure situation. he has tons of time to think about what's going on here.
this is reddit so we have a lot of armchair specialists in all sorts of areas, including but not limited to trashcan pushing.
actually i did have a mom but bark is funnier
the more likely situation is he just tips the thing over
i'm almost as white as sheamus from wwe and i loved that show.
i mean, my wife hates to be tickled but that doesn't mean i'm not going to do it...
i do the same with my kids. i'll tell them the right way, they'll insist they know better. i say "fine, go ahead. do it your way. don't come crying to me if you get hurt." then it fails miserably in exactly the way i told them it would. moral of the story: mama's always right!
sounds like he was pushing it out the door. started with right at the door and pushed some out and then kept backing up a little and pushing more.
he meant if you was ridin' in the cornfield on your hoss, and if the wind was howlin', you'd say, "whoa!"
i think the implication was that he's not thinking straight because of the repetitive head injuries.
have you learned nothing?! you should pull the trashcan...
my mom actually died when i was 13. i *wish* she still around to be hard on me.
but he doesn't really have much room to shift his weight and it's on wheels.
right?! every time i tickle your wife she'll yell but deep down we both know she likes it
yup! it really helped me appreciate my parents lessons more as i got older. once i passed through the teenage hell years of hate i realized they really did just want to make life easier for me, so why didn't i just listen to their lessons and i would of been ahead already! haha! mama was always right.
thank you for clarifying that. it's such a stupid way to do it, i was having a hard time figuring out what he meant.
go to the r/todayilearned subreddit, some japanese spirit named betobeto or whatever it is was the topic of a top post from there
i don't think we have any armchair experts in _pulling_ a trash can.
yeah, it's why it didn't tip over when he jumped into it from 4 feet away
yeah, no sharp objects in the ward. they're, like, super strict about that.
you guys are assholes. i tickled /u/obliterayte's wife *once*, and she told me she hated it, so i stopped. i haven't done it since. i'm a great guy.
ah right, i thought it might have had to do with something from outside in the world, didn't realise it was just more meta content from within the reddit shell. thanks.
you guys are giving his poor wife post traumatic tickle disorder.
you had day? i was only let out of the attic at night when there were no guest.
i have two, which i treasure dearly! she was truly an amazing woman and i am reminded of her every day when i look on my couch and see my beautiful quilts!
rip single person unless you were too young at that time
yeah, my grandma made us a wedding quilt, one of the last that she made. only my sister and cousin got one after us, she just can't spend the hours hunched over it anymore and her vision isn't good enough. i would immediately grab that quilt, no question about it. the last quilt she made was with my aunt, taking favorite t-shirts from another aunt who had recently died. i've never seen people crying like my cousin was when they gave it to her. quilts are great, the time they take really lets you know how much you mean to the maker.
yeah knitting 100 quilts for every event is no mean feat
my grandmothers church group also knitted her a prayer blanket when she was going through some serious health issues and for months after that she said she felt no pain. this past new year's eve she passed away but i always think about that blanket and how special it is. i'm glad you got to keep hers.
this comment right here is the only reason i had to read the thread.
that's an amazing gift. she must have loved you very much. were you very surprised when you received it?
it's never too late. try to learn a little on your own and talk to her about what you're learning. you could even try to wing it with a crazy quilt or a simple triangle or square arrangement. she might not be able to actively teach you but you could get wisdom from her comments on your recounting what you're learning.
i've only got one quilt my mom has made for me and i never use the thing because i'm afraid i'm going to wear it out. mostly just sits on the foot of my bed.
sorry for your loss friend, keep your head up i could only imagine how hard it is to loose ones parent
my condolences go out to you... *looks at username* ...tits_mcgheee. but honestly, this is how you celebrate a life, not mourn the loss. i hope the funeral was a nice service!
i've recently started to live alone and my grandma has recently started to cry about how she misses me... even though i only live 15 minutes away and visit every two days. i said to her, "grandma, what are you going to do when i get married and move away?? then we'll barely see each other" her sad expression changed in a moment and she tsked, "you think i'm going to live long enough to see you get marrried? pfffft" and rolled her eyes. wat
i have a "for when you get married" blanket from my great-grandma in my single-occupancy house. it brings me comfort and hope....
my read was that, every time a special occasion occurred, she made another hundred quilts.
that's awesome! i'm glad to hear you actively use yours too. for a while i had it kept away for fear of it getting damaged. then i realized she would have wanted me to use it.
this... so much this. my grandmother made quilts for everything it seemed. she would do various kinds and different thickness. when we moved to our new house, she had me bring the color swatches i had picked for my bedroom and made me a special quilt. it was a summer quilt that i spent many a hot night huddled under because it was the only blanket that breathed. i feel so happy to have those quilts - and when i have kids i'll gladly pass them down.
yeah, do you ever get the quilt anyway? at what age does your family give up on you and give it to you as a birthday gift instead?
my grandmother passed last week at the age of 84. i'm one of 10 grands who each have a quilt. if these other two grandmothers are anything like mine, then i'm sure they're laughing, telling amazing stories about everything, and sharing a margarita.
morristown, ny. a tiny town on the st.lawrence river bordering canada
and it's organic and real and you can touch it knowing she would have shared that experience of the way it feels. it's nice to have memory but nothing compares to that feeling of being jolted into one simply by the way something might feel, smell or look. sure it is just a quilt and one day in the future it will no doubt be buried in some landfill and forgotten... essentially it will travel the same path we do... born from love and care for someone to drag around and pass on until passing it on doesnt work anymore at which point it will have been nothing more than just a quilt although this quilt may have had more life than some who had lived
well you grew up having had that influence. out of all the people we meet in a lifetime not many have the staying power to find their way into the minds of strangers on random days in random corners. her life was so bright that even now after all this time she remains relevant. she may not have a physical body and i am not one to believe in any of the afterlife type stuff, but i do believe that just by you disclosing that info and how it will play into the rest of my day is indeed, in a way, life purest. she may not have seen you grow up but you grew up to who you are as a result of her still being with you... and i imagine she always will be. i love carnations.. my fav actually.
my grandma was my only friend growing up, the only person i was confident who loved and she is really the source of everything i consider good in myself. she was a real gem, always wore a smile and loved her family. she really is as vibrant in my life today as she was when living. margaret made the world and i am just lucky enough to be who gets to live in it. she could easily be around every corner and if i need to bend her ear then i do for she might as well be sitting in the next room. reality suggests otherwise but a grandson without a grandmother can misbehave a little i suppose
yea i cried esp when i realized she wouldn't be there for the wedding.
if that were the case, it would be quite horrible indeed. i can imagine something along those lines actually happening though.
my husbands grandmother would say to us (every thursday after we played cards) 'come visit me before it snows!' um. we'll see you next thursday nana...
i'm a quilter and can absolutely say, no matter how plain or fancy a quilt that i gift is, i gift them to be used. i expect baby quilts to be worn out, holes worn in them, the fabric to be stained. i expect wedding quilts to be loved, the couple snuggling together or separately or with the family pets. i tell everyone i give a quilt to that if their quilt needs some kind of extensive repair, to return it to me and i will figure out a way to keep life in their quilt. :)
this is true, i am currently on a quest to learn to quilt and there's so much to learn and everything gas to be exactly measured- even a 16th of an inch variation throws everything off...
i wasn't gonna say anything... but yeah, i noticed that. xd
that is very sweet that she did that, but as a person who is not planning on ever getting married i would be very sad if i couldn't have my quilt lol.
it really does lend to those who say a handmade gift is best. i am thinking case closed. it makes me wonder what future generations will hold onto, if anything, that could possibly compare. i usually give the standard gift card type gift but somehow i don't see my little niece one day in the future coming across a macy's gift card and having a sudden sense memory of her dearly departed... as she sits on the floor of her attic with legs crossed pressing the ancient retail gift card to her face while thinking she can still smell me on it before neatly placing it back into the chest where it was found knowing it will be safe... clearly, i need to take up handwork.... for the sake of the warm fuzzies i am robbing from the ones i love long after i am gone
exactly the reason they had lots of kids on the farm. and also in the 1930s, 40s and 50s childhood diseases were still common, treatments we have today were not available so not every child made it to adulthood. them there was ww2 that took a lot of the young men who did make it. times were really tough.
sorry for your loss. and yep! my grandma would be shaking up some drinks for all the other grandmas right about now.
i know morristown. they had the only girls soccer team that our team (hdcs) could regularly beat, back in the day. we... weren't very good. it's a nice little town.
thank you, actually tearing up reading your comment. she definitely was a huge part of my life even though it wasn't very long. it's kinda calming to think about this way.
you can't cry ever? do you tear up with a cold wind in your face? what about spicy food? or you dog getting run over?
if you have children, grandkids, or nieces/nephews, you ought to give them pictures of her and teach them whatever you know about her life. that way she'll be remembered for generations.
growing up we had a bunch of quilts from my grandmother and i had no idea that they were special. we hammered them as kids, like rub on concrete abuse and they were indestructible, just iron. several times when we went to see them she would fix them and we would carry on. i love that you are keeping the tradition alive. awesome. :)
not to derail, but after getting this far, the word quilt looks really weird
but you have plenty to remember your great grandmother by, she probably would've been upset at you for not using the quilt she knitted for you.
this is exactly what happens to me. i make something cool for someone in my family and it goes into a drawer and is forgotten about. i'm sure they don't realize how much more insulting that is than just letting it get worn and ruined. i don't even make things for anyone anymore. like, i didn't put hours into something for it to be looked at once and put away.
she gave them out to all of us hoping/expecting we would someday get married, but my cousins and i are not yet married and she passed away 2 years ago.
... i can't tell if your being sarcastic or serious..
i'm slowly nearing the point where i'll have kids. how are you finding two? as hard as poster above makes it out? we are thinking either one or two.
i am indian, we eat spicy food for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks. not crying. do you want me to get my dog run over, just to find out if i can cry or not? cold wind? i live in the tropics. sorry buddy, i can't help you.
that's exactly how it should be! although i am going to need to find a way to repair mine, there are starting to be a few too many holes.
well.. at 100+ years old, it might be more fragile than a newer quilt. i would be careful with it as well, and i quilt all of the time. i can put you in contact with a quilt restorer if you have any questions.
find a local quilt shop! the one near me is always having beginner classes, i think they even let you use machines they have there (they are located inside a sew-and-vac shop, so it is pretty convenient). and i think i've seen them through our local parks and rec center too? but i'm completely self-taught, from youtube and blogs and stuff.
i think it's a pretty common sentiment among us quilting folks. :)
does it look like a different word or just strange?
quilts are like magic items when the durability is depleted it disintegrates into a fine powder
as a fellow crafter, nothing infuriates me more than this!
you can have peace with 1 or 2. the attitude you bring will make all the difference. the less kids one has, the more attentive and responsive they tend to be, which can make some kids thus more demanding/fussy. if you are chill with your 1 kid and don't bend to their whims, they can be just as easy going as a kid in a "herd" would be. same with two kids; work to discourage competitiveness, jealousy, and bickering from the start and it won't get out of control.
damn him/her for asking all the wrong questions. now my lazy ass has to go look up dry eyes.
this right here. my family are all big quilters. i have about 20 and all were gifted for some reason or another. my mum has cancer and already quilted 4 baby quilts before she passes, just incase i have 4 kids, i said what if i have 5? to which she replied, 'you're an idiot if you have more than two, so i made you 4, even you are not dumb enough to have 5." needless to say a sense of humor also runs in the family.
you are amazing. #1 for responding to so many people. #2 for being a quilter. my mom is a quilter and the amount of work that goes into a quilt can only be maintained through an enormous amount of love for others.
totally spot on! i still have my first quilt, it's the one that gets probably the most use, too! i hate it, i am somewhat ashamed of it, but my boyfriend sleeps under it and it matches our couch pretty well, so it stays.
i once went with one of my library volunteers to a quilt show in fort worth. i can see how owners would be a bit timid to use such beautiful pieces of art. the truth is though they are even more beautiful when loved and utilized. i'm glad quilt makers emphasize this notion.
i didn't even cry when hillary lost. can u imagine my failure to sympathise and emphathise ? i didn't even cry when trump won. can u imagine my failure to ...... where am i going?
hopefully 2 of the potential 5 kids will be twins so they could share a quilt. otherwise you will need to develop an advanced scheduling system which takes into consideration cuteness, behaviour and stickiness of hands.
i don't have the skill (or patience!) to make the sorts of quilts that one sees in big quilt shows - so there definitely still is some hesitancy there at least - but for the most part they are meant to be used for sure. :)
amazing attitude on dying. carrie, you were way too young, and had much still to give.
my thoughts exactly, she really got in shape compared to how she looks in older photos.
do you know where i can find that, i'd like to watch it. and ffffucking cry.
aw, this comment section actually made me a little happier. thanks, reddit.
she'll be in the upcoming episode 8 as well, it wrapped filming.
stories like this are why every death means something. every death is a great tragedy, because how many more moments like these could she have had? :(
the burbs is so good. oh god she was also great in drop dead fred with phoebe cates and rik mayall (d. 2014). that movie is *not to be missed*.
she started super young. i think she was 19 in anh?
i think they finished filming 8, it's possible this will cause problems for 9.
sitting in theatre waiting for rogue one to start... just burst out laughing at this. thank you for that!
she was my first hero. as a little girl, obsessed with star wars, leia was everything i wanted to be. and as i got older and learned more about carrie and her life i really did admire her as a person, not just the character she played. rip carrie.
usually my front page is full of things that are hours old, i saw this less than 10 minutes of it being posted.
the same for me. she was the first one that i found that i realized that if she could get through the shit in her life, i could get through my issues. we have had many of the same issues, and she was someone who overcame hers. she was my bipolar princess
once this year has passed, all celebrities will suddenly become immune for the next 10 years until this shit happens again. maybe it was the cubs winning, needed a blood sacrifice or something.
probably even lower for an in-airplane cardiac arrest
general anxiety disorder/chronic depression here... she taught me how to find humor in my illness. gave me quite a few smiles when i thought i couldn't.
episode 8 finished filming in july. you'll see leia on the big screen a year from now.
just go basejumping in a squirrel suit in high winds. obviously death is picking off people with no rhyme or reason.
it's so sad. she always seemed like a lovely person and recently seemed so happy and healthy on interviews.
i thought that too. poor gary. he won't understand where his human went.
rogue one has shown that death can't stop star wars.
all stable really means is that the person isn't getting worse ot getting better. her condition must've been too far gone. rip princess.
we knew what we were getting into when it happened, dude. we knew the implications. we broke the final seal.
her daughter apparently gave the statement directly to people magazine.
sadly your body doesn't forget, alcohol drugs and whatever can do serious damage even after being sober for many years.
at times like these, knowing of another person's momentary joy does wonders. believe you me.
they'll probably find a way to retire her like with paul walker
if you had been, you might have become oxygen deprived yourself.
luckily disney has been rolling out those flawless cgi faces.
yes filming finished a long time ago. as for episode 9...
jesus, she was outlived by her mother? that makes this all the more tragic.
she broke the mould. leia didn't fit the hollywood idea of a princess, and carrie didn't fit the hollywood idea of a starlet.
when i saw this post i thought to myself "i can't believe i missed this big news. maybe it's a hoax or something" thinking it was hours old. then i saw the 4 minute mark next to the post and was very surprised.
i see two different posts about carrie fisher dying on /r/all
i'm proud of you.. and i bet carrie would be too :)
if leia dies in episode 8, that's going to be hard to handle.
no rhyme or reason? you can't outrun years of substance abuse forever.
better hope this doesn't come true or mi6 is going to be kicking down your door with some questions on january 1st.
i hope her daughter takes him in. carrie seemed very close to her, and i bet that means gary is real familiar with her
they might cg her death for a short scene or something. rogue one already showed that disney are not afraid to do that.
that would feel sacreligious just one year later.
from the reports of what happened on the plane she has probably been brain dead ever since
stable means unchanging for the time being, not that the situation is good.
made me think of this from skyrim paarthurnax: what is better - to be born good, or to overcome your evil nature through great effort?
i had to break up with a girl, in part, because she didn't understand how serious cocaine use was. she just kept saying that she would stop eventually and her body would recover. she was stuck in the "it won't happen to me" mentality.
there going to play "see you again" as she street races vin diesel in to the sunset?
carrie fisher and george michael weren't really in the age range. they died fairly young
this times a million - i always saw her as the first woman who showed me how awesome strong women could be.
she may have been killed off in episode viii, they'll pull a paul walker and she'll be killed off screen, or they've already finished filming what they needed for episode ix for her as well as viii. with a series as big and old as star wars is, i think they've made sure to get all the shots they need from the original cast.
i hope he got to say goodbye. animals, especially dogs, can be devastated when they don't realize where their friends have gone.
damn, i didn't know she was down for so long, all i had read was heart attack on a plane and she was doing ok... 30mins with no pulse isn't a "bounce back quickly" type of episode.
pretty much my thoughts. they likely knew it was over. they kept her going through christmas. long enough for the holiday to pass and friends and family to gather to say goodbye. in this case it's the best any of us could hope for.
i just watched that about an hour ago, and looked her up to see how she was doing. still alive and stable, i see. thirty minutes later i go on reddit and see she died. very surreal. she was hilarious on that though.
that's almost why i'm so surprised, there are aeds in most major public areas these days (airports, venues, schools, etc.). the fact that the number is still so low despite that...i mean do people not know how to use them? worse yet, do they not know where they are? i'm not sure if i'd be able to find one in a state of extreme panic.
after....who dies in episode 7 (i'm not going to openly post that spoiler, just in case), i don't think leia was going to die in 8. i think she was actually going to have a pretty important role in the next 2 movies considering who kylo ren is....(yet again, not openly posting spoilers) i figure lucasfilms has some sort of contingency plan in place, but it's still going to alter episode 9 and potentially even beyond.
she comes off as someone who has always been real to herself and to the public. no bs facade for being a celebrity. r.i.p.
pippin: i didn't think it would end this way. gandalf: end? no, the journey doesn't end here. death is just another path, one that we all must take. the grey rain-curtain of this world rolls back, and all turns to silver glass, and then you see it... pippin: what? gandalf? see what? gandalf: white shores, and beyond, a far green country under a swift sunrise. pippin: well, that isn't so bad. gandalf: no... no, it isn't.
would probably be seen as poor taste so soon after her passing to do something like that. will more than likely be an off camera death.
given the age and health of the actor, and the fact that they did a cg job of her while she's still around and would probably have discussed that with her, i'm guessing there would have been a conversation regarding this particular scenario. she may have ok'd it, maybe not.
even on life support is stable. could very well be the case.
i don't know. it sounds, if you reverse it, he's implying that just because i never was evil, was brought up a good person and stood by my beliefs, i'm somehow *worse* than a person who did some bad stuff but then was really sorry about it.
i think this is something people don't understand about cocaine very well. it's incredibly destructive to your cardiovascular system and prolonged use can easily cause irreparable damage.
but when you stress your cardiovascular system to the max for years on end, it certainly doesn't help...
and a "whats the alternative to "waking up on christmas morning"? not waking up on christmas morning??" joke...
i'm just sad for gary. who is going to take care of him and deal with that massive tongue.
i think that's the last thing they'll do; they'll probably wanna draw as little attention to it as possible. but yeah, i have no idea how they are going to do episode 9 now, especially since she was probably going to be pretty instrumental in kylo's redemption:(
thanks for a much needed laugh right now. and i could totally see carrie wanting to go out like that.
they both didn't live very safe lifestyles though. george michael had a partner who was hiv positive in the 90s and never got checked himself until 2007. carrie fisher did massive amounts of cocaine, that's something that takes a real toll on the body.
carrie fisher is the first character i remember being stronger than the male "lead". as a boy at a young age it left a huge impression on me and i'm sure countless others. fuck fuck fuck 2016.
19 meant a lot different then than it does now. i don't think i worded that well but i mean that as life expectancies go up and the economy changes people take longer to leave the "nest".
i'm really hoping that they planned to kill her off in viii and already shot what they needed, but i doubt it. i think they'll have to give her the off-screen death, unfortunately.
even if she had made it, she most likely would never have made another movie... there's no guarantee she'd even ever be aware of who she was ever again...
i was rooting for a miracle, to be honest. but 15 minutes with no pulse? definitely not a rational hope.
i saw a picture of gary a few days ago headed in to the hospital. made me tear up a little. just lost one of my 2 frenchies last month and the other one still looks for him. :-/ poor gary.
an aed does not "restart" the heart contrary to common beliefs, it will only shock fibrillation or arrhythmia, shocking will try and get the heart to go back to a normal rhythm. i've used aeds a few times, the ones available to the public talk you through every step. i advice you should always look around you, not just for aeds, also for fire exits and all that sort of stuff. (i do out of habit), you really don't want to have to think twice in an emergency situation.
you're probably right! we can all agree that if chewie dies, we riot, right?
one of the most beautiful moments in cinema. may we all meet in that far green country. rip, princess leia.
agreed. i expect the same with anton yelchin's role in trek. no easy way to do it... :-(
people is by far the best of the "tabloids" and they'll cover serious stories from time to time.
tmz probably had a hidden camera in her hospital room.
you could say that, yes, being brought up good & sticking to your beliefs might be morally superior. but i think that consciously overcoming evil puts you in a position of experience, one that might help you consistently make the right decisions in the future. i would even argue that everyone is equally susceptible to evil, and a perfect record might just suggest that you haven't been properly tested just yet.
yep. bought himself some extra years of living by not continuing down an unhealthy past. that is the best outcome
thank you! i owe it all to my wife. falling in love with her gave me a reason to live a real life.
keep struggling. each day clean is better than a day of slavery
absolutely. i have only ran one legit cocaine overdose and it was so different than any other overdose patient i have cared for. the heart doesn't forget. it adapts to what you do to it. that is why some marathon runners have cardiomegaly
"as long as i quit meth by june i'll have plenty of time for all my teeth to grow back"
wow, had to leave a fiancee because she couldn't give it up, even after having the "i want children" talk with me. it was kinda crazy, all i wanted was 6 months sober from coke before we had a kid, and she went full on crazy like i was asking for the moon. 3 years earlier she had spent almost a year in rehab. fucking nuts when you can't see the forest for the trees.
wow. made the connection to the pacemaker jokes but overlooked that one.
i was really impressed, thought it was another actor in facial prosthetics until i saw him speak. those subtle mouth/facial movements are really hard to do correctly.
redemption from within can also be a powerful storyline.
rewatched a new hope last night. the way she handles her rescue is amazing. taking luke's blaster out of his hands, declaring "somebody has to save our skins!", blasting an escape hole, mowing down a few stormtroopers, and then fearlessly leaping into the unknown. leia is fucking cool. goddamn this is rough.
well, her real dad was a major player all right. eddie fisher married debbie reynolds, elizabeth taylor, and connie stevens.
one of my grandmas had one son estranged, lost another son to cancer just a few months ago, and is losing her third son to cancer, my father. shit sucks. :/
i had a family friend basically go through what carrie did (long period of not breathing after a heart attack). he is very lucky to be alive, but his memory is completely fucked and has to live in a permanent care home. he can no longer make new memories and his older ones are fuzzy.
or like slash, who smoked some crack after shooting up heroin, died, was brought back, then went to buy some more heroin and record a track the next day despite being advised to rest for 6 months. or his cardiomiopathy when he was told he had between 6 days and 6 weeks to live, but he just went on tour instead.
i wouldn't be surprised if they write him off as accepting a promotion on another vessel. i don't think it's necessary to kill off his character.
they asked peter cushing's estate for permission to recreate him in rogue one, so they definitely have a protocol.
counterpoint: a perfect record might mean that i passed the test every time, while the other thing means that i failed at least once but then got better.
a beautiful story and wonderful to think about. congrats to you both then, you're an inspirational pair.
pm me next time you try to quit and are feeling the urge to drink again. we'll chat about something and i'll do what i can to help stave off the desire.
can you explain how it was different to other overdoses?
"meth mouth" is a result of poor dental hygiene and food choices, not necessarily meth itself. meth can cause dry mouth and clenched teeth like many other things, however these can be mitigated. it's important to know that the idea that you will most surely have meth mouth if you use meth at all is a falsehood perpetuated by the government and other anti-drug organizations. i do not support meth use, but even with meth, one of the most destructive recreational drugs, there is still a difference between use and abuse.
from experience: it is very difficult as a health professional to explain to people that *everyone's* lung function deteriorates after roughly age 25 and that smoking accelerates this many times. if you stop, your lung function will still have declined much more in the time you smoked, and the only thing you as a smoker can do is to stop today, not in 5 or 10 years.
my favorite one went like this, her: "i'm always getting nose bleeds. it's super annoying." me: "maybe that is from snorting too much coke. it is known to mess up your nose if used too much." *click* relationship instantly over, lol.
eh, i've noticed some people are better or worse at detecting uncanny valley stuff. his skin being too shiny/smooth was a dead giveaway. other cgi person was an even worse example of the same problem imo.
i think that racing luke would be even more fitting
they already shot episode viii, so she will be in another one.
he looked pretty damn real to me. i didn't even realize he was cg until i read about it. i think if you go in knowing he's cg then you just look for the flaws and find them.
sorry about your dad, buddy. does he had a chance of making it through with treatment at least, i hope? my dad has been in remission for about a year and a half now from leukemia thankfully! but in the beginning the outlook was really grim and there was almost no hope... things changed though and he's healthy as a horse now!
that's actually kind of surprising given it was a heart attack. it's a shame when that organ fails so much does as well even if its just a short period of time.
i read that as "promotion on another wessel" i already miss anton :(
then the only test you will fail is to help those struggling to escape what is bad, because you can never relate. you could have all the good in the word but then you may not have empathy.
other overdoses i felt like i could do something. opiate overdoses honestly are pretty simple. breathe for them and give enough narcan to bring around the respirations and watch your blood pressures. the cocaine overdose was just like flash pulmonary edema that would not respond to any treatments.
cannabis also causes dry mouth. the government likes to parade mentally ill homeless people around and say that meth made their teeth fall out. the propaganda surrounding drugs is ridiculous.
hell, dont even start. stop before you begin. i am waiting on a fucking mri result on my liver and lungs. i smoked for 7 years. 7 friggin years. that was it. i quit over a year ago. i am 28 waiting on a scan for cancer, a possiblity discovered in a routine physical. i have 3 kids. i may have to leave them behind because i used to 'enjoy a smoke'. don't. fucking. smoke.
i think the big problem is there are all those carcinogens. even if you return to normal lung function cancer may occur.
so now the horrible decision they have to make, alter the script (and presumably the third movie's plot as well) so that leia dies, or find someone else to replace her in the third movie. (assuming she wasn't going to die in 7th anyway)
i 100% did not know and noticed immediately. i thought leia looked great until she moved her mouth.
that is *exactly* the point at which i wrote that comment. it's heartbreaking.
thanks for posting the truth and keeping it real . best wishes on that .
yeah my mom developed lung cancer 15 years after quitting.
the only reason i knew leia was cgi was because she looked too much like 1977 carrie fisher to be a body double (though if they said they used an old unused clip of her i would have believed it). on the other hand, i saw the original star wars trilogy so long ago i thought tarkin was a new character, so the thought of him being cgi never came up.
the point of cpr is to supply the brain with oxygen. but really, it can only do so much.
what most people don't realize is that cpr isn't really as magical as the tv and movies make it seem. it has a relatively low success rate of survival. sure, it's still 2-3x higher survival rate than doing nothing before the ambulance show up, but it's typically between 5-30~% likelihood of survival and it's pretty physically brutal on the patient. in one japanese study of 95,000 cpr cases, just eight percent of patients survived for longer than a month after being revived. in the cpr courses i've taken in the past and recently, the instructors have joked around saying if you don't break a rib or two you're doing it wrong. it's far from gentle and has a low rate of success when you consider the statistic. surveys have shown if given a choice, most doctors would refuse cpr to be done to them even in life and death situations. they know that survival does not mean you'll ever be the same again after the ordeal. like you said, cpr can only do so much.
yeah, like mystique handing over logan to the real striker for... some reason.
to be fair, they've made the backdrop appear to be seamless. jackman still has the same drink, nice.
if you loved the first interview, holy shit the new one is so fucking great.
nah, it's cause he's a magician that can clone himself.
it's fun conversation without shoving your nose up the stars ass. that's the problem with american late night shows.
it looks like magneto did a magic trick by making his orange juice disappear and ian mckellen is like "are you not impressed?" but patrick stewart is all like "pssh, watch me make this wine that used to be orange juice disappear."
you see until i read your comment i completely forgot about logan, now i am gonna go and see it (only after john wick 2), i hope it pisses you off because you think everything is marketing
should've seen /r/videos. the hydraulic press channel promoting logan, then the norton show about logan cast.
what do you mean, those are a tom haverford original. 1 of a limited 10 run of shoes. very exclusive.
because comics need problems and what better way than keep the problems which could've been really solved through stupid reasons, like stark will be able to cause him trouble if he goes bad, even if he doesn't install anything such or his legs will get disabled by emp, which stark has solved but idk why that's not applied.
if i remember correctly they get to select their own drinks (with alcohol if they want, there have been really drunk guests on the show).
we seldom laugh out loud at graham norton, but this one really did have us in stitches.
i concur totally. graham just lets his guests talk amongst themselves, usually with superb results. check out his regular miriam margolyes on the couch. guaranteed insanity.
and then patrick makes all the women in the audience's clothes fall off and they see everything.
reminds me of when headlines went around, saying "ian mckellen marries patrick stewart". turns out they just meant he conducted the ceremony and officiated patrick stewart's wedding to sunny ozell, but those headline-writers clearly knew exactly what they were doing.
that went beyond patting into full on groping i think.
every story i hear about one or the other or both, i just love them more
i mean, it's a nice tie, but i wouldn't call it _perfect_.
are there people who think everything on reddit is supposed to be original content? there's a reason why every link on reddit is a link to *a different website*. it's meant to aggregate links to good stuff from all over the internet. complaining that a reddit post came from somewhere else first is mindblowingly pointless.
my roommate and i have started going through parks and rec again because he's never seen it. reddit has been full of references lately i find.
wasn't the obvious manipulation of reddit a front page article yesterday as well? not trying to undermine you in any way, just pointing this out because it's almost predictable that marketing shills pushing these things to the front page might try to cover up their eforts and not like people pointing them out.
it's only manspreading if your just taking all the space on the fookin tube while obviously you could be letting people in
i live in a big city and use public transportation. speaking as a guy myself, the number of other guys who insist on spreading their legs so that they push your legs and take up space into the other seat is unbearable, esp in rush hour. i don't care how big your balls are, this is about common courtesy.
i watched some of the interview with jackman and patrick stewart. holy crap, how drunk was patrick? i'm guessing he'd had a couple before he went on because he was *so* touchy feely and random.
the prestige. batman and wolverine fight over who is better at magic.
the character in origins was a completely different character who shared the diamond ish power of frost. notice she wasn't even telepathic. xavier has a drug that let's him walk, as well as just projecting himself as walking with his mind, so he very well could have been paralyzed before origins. and scott's age is exactly right. 14 in 1979, which is when origins takes place, 17 in 1982 when apocalypse takes place, early 30s in the original xmen movies. so none of those really conflict.
reddit is always going to be full of references to major network television. don't let the circlejerk baader-meinhoff you. which is its own circlejerk. see:futurama, it's always sunny, the office, family guy, game of thrones, breaking bad, seinfeld, the office, south park, all of the netflix originals basically, friends, doctor who, etc. any given day for the past 4 years i've see at least a quarter of this list mentioned on reddit.
nah, that's just being an asshole. some folks spread their legs, others lay bags in seats, and some just lie down or piss everywhere. the need to retaliate against sexism with new sexism is wasted effort, and counterproductive.
those are just assholes, same with women putting their purses on seats. it's not about gender, it's about people who have no situational awareness
no no, you got it all wrong. that's patrick stewart sober, when he's wasted he goes all captain picard on people.
when they had the cast of monuments men on (damon, murray, and bonneville), they were all quit plastered. george clooney later took credit for getting them drunk at the premier before they got to graham's stage.
well considering how much time this interview has spanned i'm sure they have had many drinks, so i would think they've had someone bussing the empties.
the best talk show host currently on-air in my opinion.
and alfred. and black widow. and gollum. and sting.
his brother and his wife have north american accent, but their son has an english accent. the future is weird.
joke, something something head something something....
so a few things: origins takes place in the 70s. cyclops is a teenager there. x-men takes place in 2000. putting cyclops at about 40. the guy in the movie is not that old. also, the girl in the movie is credited as emma. and she just happens to have emma frost's powers? come on, guy. there's a ***really*** simple explanation here. the x-men movies have no real continuity overall. they were largely made as a cash grab by people who didn't care about the source material. that's why they had the audacity to turn deadpool into a teleporting wolverine with laser beam eyes.
'"welcome... to the woorrld of tomorrow! dayman and i were on a break, because a heisenberg always pays his debts. giggity!" - wayne gretzky' - michael scott
i can see why you'd dislike him as he tends to get shoved down peoples throats. kinda reminds me of jon stewart with the daily show. a lot of things he says are valid but then mindlessly regurgitated across the internet and memed to holy hell. but he does make a lot of good points. he's slightly hypocritical but hey so was jon stewart.
he *did* do an american talk show based in new york in the 00's called ny graham norton. was a complete failure, the audience and the guests just didn't get it apparently so he had to change his style and that just made it mediocre.
i really hope you don't think nicolas flamel was just a harry potter character....
he was clearly obsessed with magic though, i mean the lengths he was willing to go to to one-up a guy....
well the music in that one came from egot winner bobby lopez (frozen, book of mormon, avenue q) who's now way too famous to write songs for tv anymore.
it's the double down with vegetables instead of meat and cheese.
i mean the x-men comics themselves care fuck all about continuity with a million different timelines. i wouldn't say they didn't care about the source material, there's just a shit ton of conflicting source material. i am biased and do enjoy the x-men movies. they're fun and cool and have good looking people telling a story that has some modern relevance. your criticism is totally valid though. they're not perfect. original deadpool is a great example of where they have missed the mark at times, but that's also a very difficult character to get right in a film vs a comic.
that's a good point. people going crazy over every video he posts did get annoying. i originally disliked that he just did reactions to already funny videos, and he gets praise for being original or funny himself. i like his original videos hes done a lot more (vape nation was good)
would it really be that big of a deal if they did?
oh yeah definitely a thing. it's called the naked chicken chalupa and they even have a box meal for it.
while i might agree to an extent, a lot of the mcu movies still work out as stand-alones. albeit the reason why guardians is generally considered the best or most unique is because it was a complete gamble by the studio and while they did lay a few seeds it was intended as something fresh that anyone can watch thing out having had to see half a dozen films before hand. the continuity of having to have seen 14 films will only really be a problem with infinity war, potentially black panther and the final avengers film.
yeah, he himself felt kinda weird about only doing reaction videos. though, typically, rather than "already funny" video, they'd be videos that were funny either to a different demographic than his, or for a different rrason. one of the oldest forms of comedy is at play here, it's a bit ignorant to write it off as "he's considered funny for leeching off of other funny things"
to be fair, just about everything about mark wahlberg is indicative that he's an asshole in general.
no but real life nicolas flamel was extremely interesting too
your taco scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could they didn't stop to think if they should. because yea obviously they should
exactly, and hugh jackman is canadian. wolverine is an australian national treasure, you thieving canadians can't have him.
if it makes you feel any better, they're terrible. it's basically a chicken sandwich from any other place, but with no bread and chicken for a bun (in a taco shape). so just chicken wrapped around lettuce and mayo, basically. i mean, it's okay, but i'd much rather have basically anything else if i'm eating there.
don't click to continue it's just bunch of people trying to get gold without being funny or anything.
i think my favorite part was how thankful and loving she seemed even with just the toy dog
the teddy is gonna get humped to oblivion by that dog. rip.
that stuffed dog is going to get torn apart by the real dog in a matter of days.
losing my beagle = worst day of my life. i know this means i have a pretty charmed life, but fuck, it sucked
the "pretend something else is your pet" thing worked on my parents as well. i ended up with a very similar moment to the one in this video, in fact, but with a cat!
when i was little, i would rotate which stuffed animals slept on the bed with me so none of them felt left out.
i teared up. it looks like a cocker spaniel and my 13 year old cocker is laying next to me on the couch snoring and it makes me have a serious case of the feels.
i'm not bawling but normally i'm a bit more stoic than this.
or keep it for puppy to snuggle with, they can miss their litter mates at first.
i would add, before you get your kids a dog, make sure they are not allergic. got my daughter a puppy last year. then she started having constant runny nose and sneezing. turns out she's allergic to dogs. we refuse to give up the dog so we have to manage the allergies instead.
i bet that dog will hump the shit out of it so you could say it is win/win.
i realized in this however long clip that my life is shit. i have never been this happy about anything to this second in my life.
i'm sure it was worth it. you rock as a parent! i'm sorry for your loss
read this as sunnyvale and was trying to figure out which tpb was nicknamed lotso
pug is a pug's default setting. unless it wants to chase something. which case its a pugrocket setting.
i've never met a particularly smart pug but damn if they are not the happiest dogs!
the day my beagle died was the day i learned it is possible to cry so much you end up sick for a week. it's crazy how much a dog can steal your heart
agreed. silver lining is that you've felt that sort of pure unconditional love. that's super special.
i cry when i think about my dog from 30 years ago.
my father died when i was ten, everybody and everything dies. one of the few good things about dogs living shorter lives than us is they usually never know the sorrow of our deaths. they live thier lives within our lives, the love they bring never leaves us and the sorrow of thier deaths is only our burden, not thiers.
wait until between january through march when those christmas presents end up in the shelter. many people think it's adorable to gift a dog without researching the kind that will fit their family or understanding what actually goes into a puppy. many of them are given up around this time and you should probably have a decent choice. i hope you find the fight doggo! there's nothing else like it in the world.
we need a hypoallergenic dog so a puppy is unlikely--we'll need to take an older dog from a rescue if we can get a rescue of that breed at all.
my dog died when i was 15. we got him when i was about 8 months old and i loved him to pieces. i thought i was getting a dog for christmas that year...i was mad that i got a diamond ring (birthstone ring). the next year i begged for a dog for christmas, even ignoring my parents' credit card they gave me to buy something, anything, else. 11 years later, my mom said my new dog was the best dog she's ever had. they are moving to florida and taking her with them. anyway, diamonds aren't this girl's best friend...dogs for life.
i rotate the cofee/tea cups i have so no one of them feel left out... i'm 32
i have found myself arranging mine so that the predators and the prey are not together when unsupervised (i'm also in my 40s). mental health issues be damned, who knows what those things will get up to when i'm not looking.
i almost wish i didn't already have two dogs, so that i could get my kids a puppy when they inevitably ask for one.
did you consider getting rid of the kid? (this is a joke!)
i delivered pizza for a while. there was nothing i could ever get as excited about as a 4-6 year old seeing the pizza guy.
yep, like she was disappointed but trying not to be shitty about it.
i read it as sunnydale and for second was thinking trying to remember what episode of buffy that was.
even just a comic book series that spawns some sort of stranger things - esque short tv series, i would greatly appreciate.
the big surprise is that he got her a new grandpa too in a box in the living room.
ugh i want to get one so badly, but i would feel like a monster because of their health problems and me helping cause more breeding and shit.
he seems pretty content being a pug in a box though.
get the daughter first because if you get the dog first you won't be able to make a video like this one.
that dog looks so confused it's amazing. "why is this human howling?"
it feels like yesterday i picked up my now 6 year old gsd. i am not looking forward to the inevitable.
he lives on in your heart which means you absolutely can say he is/was/always will be yours.
i'm about to cry thinking of my first dog ever getting near that time. he's showing signs of slowing down and my heart just drops everytime i see it.
my two family cats were 11 years old when my mom died. people say cats don't care about people, but that's not true. they were walking around, meowing, for days on end after she passed away, looking for her. even though the two didn't get along very well, they'd both sit on her side of the bed, waiting for her to come lay down and pet them, but she never came back.
what's your favorite hot wheels car you own and which one do you want most right now??
"sorry cindy, but the harvest hasn't been good enough this season and we need to eat mr. pupperson to make it through the winter. he's going to a good place, our bellies."
wait till jan/feb though, a lot of people buy puppies over the christmas holidays and then dump them when they realize puppies are work.
do it ... you will get a loved one and lifelong friend
that's what we needed.... the secret life of ~~pets~~ stuffed animals.
i aksed for a puppy or a cat, never got any. then my parents divorced, and my stepdad brought a cat, and my stepmom brought a doggo. life's good. except that i'm abroad now and wont see them for another 8 months
that's a good quality though...not throwing a tantrum when you don't get everything you want. she seems more balanced that i was at that age.
dont you dare let lotso be abandoned. you sleep with him when your son doesnt want to anymore!
bob, the human is back. no no, don't look. yes bob, i know it's racist, but what can you do? they don't know any better.
you can adopt one. there are tons of pug rescues all over. just google 'your city' pug rescues and you'll probably get a result that's pretty close to you. i adopted a 3-year-old pug 2 years ago and she's the best!
nah. reddit knows best. fuck that guy and his kind gesture.
some people need time to mourn, and a new dog is really painful to them. some people want to pour their love into a new life right away. crazily enough, both types of people can exist without either being wrong!
it's also highly likely that they knew she was going down for a while, and she was crying for a long time over it before the day finally came.
can confirm, had dog already and got her a new kid. dog was unimpressed.
i know! there really is nothing better than a kid who appreciates stuff, even little things like a smile and a thank you for holding the door open when they're with their parents or whatever
i don't know how popular this opinion is but it's exactly that that makes life beautiful. when you figure in the uncertainty of the entire universe what do you figure the chances are that you'd meet your lovely doggo? probably not very good. but you did meet and it's just that bit of the unknown that makes things like meeting friends, puppers, doggos, that nice homeless dude down the street all the more beautiful. it didn't have to happen, it wasn't even likely, but it did. go rub that doggo's belly bro.
cats care. my daughters cat will come and sit on her lap if she is crying and rub her tears away with his checks, both claiming her as his human and purring intensively at the same time. when she goes on school camps or visits relatives he pines and sulks until she comes back. when she is sick with the flu he will not leave her side. i love cats
no, don't wait. shelters are near capacity year round and there are dogs who need loving homes now. it's never a bad time to look to adopt!
i was never a dog person until i made the ultimate sacrifice and got my husband a dog. now i get jealous when the dog cuddles him instead of me.
and the dog loves everyone, don't forget that part. a dog can bring clear, unconditional love to people who might not have it already. dog dgaf who lied or cheated or said mean things. dog just wants to chill with his humans.
that's why i stopped taking mine. sure, i tried to kill myself a couple weeks later but then i smoked some heroin and i was fine. wubalubadubdub!
you should probably drink that. mdma makes you really dehydrated.
*when somebody loved me* *everything was beautiful* *every hour spent together* *lives within my soul*
... right? oh god queenie, what have i done?
no bob, wait! bob, stop trying to fuck the human! damn it, bob!
we need a link to all the animals dumped post-christmas.
it is almost like people process emotions different. amazing!
* sold to a korean restaurant. welcome to the real world with consequences kiddo.
you've at least one ally in this belief. i've loved and lost many friends over the years: cats, dogs, and even horses. every one hurts, but i remember the beautiful moments more than i remember the hurt. you know the difference when the hurt doesn't stop you from loving again. now, people? fuck them.
my little sister is special needs and once in a while has these screaming fits, my mom got a kitten for her to see if it would help. turns out whenever my sister has one of her fits the cat rushes right to her and snuggles with her because my little sister does feel better when she can pet her kitty. i swear that cat knows exactly what's going on cause there's never any hesitation from her.
what if he gets one now and then another after the holidays are over?
those nintendogs are still there, patiently waiting for you to return, for just one more stroke on their ears from your stylus
only tangential related story: wife and i both came into the relationship with dogs (that we coincidentally got near the beginning of the relationship). my my dog *hated* her at first. he would tear her stuff when she spent the night, try to push her off the bed, the works. now the traitorous bastard cuddles her more than me.
we have had fights between our kids stop immediately when we point out their angry voices are scaring the dog. it is amazing how they stop and then both go and make sure the dog is okay. they dog responds to moods so clearly and without hidden motive it makes everyone better people.
i don't trust people that don't like dogs, i also am wary of people that my dog doesn't trust. my dog loves everybody, if he acts weird around someone i am on my guard.
not trying to sound like an asshole but you especially have to train bigger dogs not to jump on people when you get them
no because he didn't link it... lazy assholes, all of you.
wow. never thought i'd see the proper use of "wubalubdubdub". that being said, you doing okay over there?
'they wanna be a swan, they'll get fucked like a swan.' 'jesus fuck, bob. calm down.'
at least somebody's gonna get what they wanted for christmas.
that is lovely. cats are wonderful creatures and so much more loving but they seem to take a level of executive decision making and decide when they are needed. they are like fluffy little emotional paramedics. they do thier own thing but will be there when their is a crisis. also i am glad you sister has a kitty paramedic to help her out.
our (female) rescue cat for the first two years saw my wife as a rival for "daddy's" affection, and acted accordingly. never pissing on here stuff or anything, just giving her the stink eye whenever she saw her, and refusing to let my wife pet her. 8 years later, she will snuggle with my wife, but only if i'm not in the house or busy working in the home office, and she (cat) gets lonely. she's a daddy's fur girl.
seriously! my doggo has "happy cries" when we get home. she just runs around, wags her tail, grabs a toy and cries, cries, cries for about 10 minutes. as soon as my mil comes over, the dog goes ape-shit and tries to jump on her and hug her and cries even more. yes, i'm a bit jealous. but i think it's because the mil is a pushover whenever she dog sits. she'll give her a treat, feed her earlier, etc.
it's really the first time they care about someone completely besides themselves - that sense of empathy just builds faster with a pet.
yep. our new pup was big on jumping, which wasn't cool for our then-5 year old daughter. he learned pretty damn quick a) not to jump on her (or anyone), and b) not to play rough with her specifically, at all. puppies learn very quickly, if you're consistent with your training. never did get him to stop licking knees though...
and ultimately got punished for it. another example of why some people actually shouldn't get a dog.
in all fairness, making roos can be a pain. you have to get the ?context part correct, and find the most recent roo, and then make sure you are on the real roo subreddit and not the fake one.
eventually got my shit under control and went back on the ads. still want to die but i'm less likely to do anything about it.
i didn't believe it was real at first...seemed like something straight out of parks and rec lol. 100% real though.
that feeling can go away eventually. it did for me.
yep... have a 2 tour army friend who is ptsd'd to the point of barely being able to make it through his day. his stories about trying to get help from the va are heartbreaking. "the first thing they ask when you have a va visit for ptsd is if you feel like hurting yourself or others... they should really ask that before you leave."
the nationwide suicide rate is 14 in 100,000. for veterans it's 30 in 100,000, which is lower than the suicide rate for engineers which is 32 in 100,000. for people who work in farming, fishing and forestry it's 84.5 in 100,000. according to the cdc
major advances in field level trauma medicine. ww2/vietnam maybe one guy could make a tourniquet out of something? now literally everyone in a platoon is trained on controlling bleeding, and fixing tension pneumothorax (2 top killers in combat). combine that with armor advances, and some of the other technology (not having to send guys into meat grinders like normandy, for one) you get what you have now. not sure how to quantify it, but the ratio of killed to wounded must be drastically changed with our modern conflicts as well.
sorry for the loss of your friends and your struggles and glad you're still alive, sir or ma'am. if you don't mind my asking, are there things i can do as a brother to man suffering from ptsd to help him stay afloat and get what he needs?
it's true. contrary to popular belief, shazza does not suck cock for 10p.
very sad.. i can't do anything but giving you a hug..
i was thinking the same thing. were the suicide numbers all from deployed members or did they compare the entire u.s service? it makes sense the suicide number among 1m troops is higher than the total troops lost in iraq.
yeah, but just take a look at the middle east, all peaceful and democratic now.
there's no place in society where you get treated ok after talking about mental illness except your friends in your own home (sometimes) and your therapist.
i had scroll all the way down here to find someone besides myself that realized this.
and if we can only afford one or the other, give it to the vets.
this is the root of all of our problems as a society. i honestly can't pinpoint when it began, but it needs to change. you would think with all of the forms of communication available today, we would be more caring towards others (because the ability to reach out is easier). nope. instead we take selfies, write blogs about ourselves, troll each other, bully peers, and so on. like you said, everything is ingrained to be formal. getting to know someone is a faux pas for whatever reason.
in fairness, it's pretty easy to hit sleeping targets with bombs in the middle of the night without any warning. americas actions were pretty cowardly.
it's just a good job with great benefits to most recruits.
it's a dumb question any time. i am ex army, i hurt myself regularly. i know it isn't a good thing. i wish i could magic it away, but i can't. so i muddle through the same way thousands of other vets do. the question, though, is as silly as it has always been. if i don't want to be held against my will at some facility, my answer to that question is no, regardless of what the actual answer to that question is.
i don't think he's talking just about soldiers, but mental health as a whole. mental health issues tend to have a stigma around them which causes them to either not be taken seriously or ignored because people are afraid to admit that they need help. it's not necessarily about doing more (although obviously that's another part of it), but more about awareness that *mental health issues are serious* and nothing to be ashamed of.
i've asked this before and i don't mean to be insensitive, but how do we know all these suicides are due to ptsd? i haven't really seen solid numbers. i've known some people who joined the military due to a lack of options and to escape a shitty situation. i wonder if some of these people maybe didn't have all their issues resolved by joining and if they would have been just as bad off emotionally without military service. or maybe even worse.
i work in a hospital and after seeing some stuff, i'd never want to be a doctor. they kinda joke about missing out on stuff like family things, but that might just be their way of coping with it all. some work long, odd hours with plenty of stress and lots of responsibility. when a patient dies, the *doctor* is the one that gets the blame, regardless of who else dropped the ball that time. it pays good and you get to boss people around, but i think i'd enjoy the free time more than those things.
it's terrible that that happened to him, but he seemed like a really good person. i'm sorry.
don't. find a new career. take a long vacation. you're one of the good ones, we need you
my dad grew up during that era, and told me about the insane news coverage going on, where they'd report everything, show real combat, as it happened etc. he likes to joke that he's quite sure the news networks numbers on viet cong killed were quite exaggerated. he jokes that if those numbers for viet cong killed were true, the us killed the entire population of vietnam several times over.
what's up with fishing, farming and forestry? why so high?
it's probably due more to the fact that we outspend on the military by huge unbelievable amounts compared to our enemies. they're simply overwhelmed by it. they don't have the technology, or the resources to compete, we're the undisputed global military power.
not to mention america's bombing of sleeping families on live television.
free college and decent pay/benefits. of course, a lot of enlisted folks aren't the book-learnin' type, and they throw their money at strippers and used car salesmen as quickly as they can earn it.
if money is an issue, go to the dav (disabled american veterans)join for 20 bucks or so and they will fight for your disability. they are an awesome resource.
even without the security clearance issues, in my afsc going to mental health almost always results in getting relieved of duty (and therefore spending your days mopping and buffing floors, shredding papers, and other assorted bitchwork). the same thing that happens to the fuck ups and criminals. awesome for morale and definitely wouldn't make me want to kill myself even more (i'm not suicidal, this is just showing how fucked my career field is)
you don't even need to talk to *anyone* in your chain of command. you can self refer, and all you have to tell them is "i have a medical appointment" if you go on meds, you'll be non-deployable for a certain period (90 days, i think?) but your profile doesn't list the medication, only that you are taking *a* medication that messes with your deployability, and this can (again, i think), only be seen by your commander. even as a soldier, you still have a right to confidentiality, only limited if you tell medical personnel that you feel like hurting yourself or someone else, or that someone is actively being abused. the army has a shit reputation for the mental health of it's active duty soldiers, but a lot of shit happens because soldiers don't know their rights and/or have leaders who think it's *their* right to know that soldier's personal business.
i'm not the user you responded to, but in my experience, cost/funding is the biggest barrier to accessing mental healthcare. i 100% agree with you that mental health for all populations needs better consideration both in terms of funding and social attitudes. however, it makes sense to me that the treatment of trauma experienced as a result of military service should be funded as part of the military budget. it would not make sense to have the military budget cover outpatient therapy for people unaffiliated with the armed forces.
it basically is, i don't know why people latch into this narrative.
i agree. i have acceptable mental care from the va. i have my choice of psychologist and have a psychiatrist with medications all for free. even when i was in the service the same was available to me. there was a stigma attatched to it. i didn't care because i wanted to get better. i think the resources are there but there is a mindset problem that keeps it from getting used. i don't think this is a lack of funding issue. this is an attitude problem. the military needs to normalize the mental health aspects. you aren't weak because you are going to mental health, you are in an unforgiving job out under crazy amounts of stress in dangerous situations. you probably can't deal with that on your own without giving something else up like your health (through drinking) or your relationships.
right. isn't that a phrase that carries legal weight behind it these days... if you walk into an emergency room and say "i am a danger to myself and others" aren't they legally obligated to put you on a psyche hold? nearly done it a few times myself during my own non-military related mental health issues... but then you think about what's going to happen if you do and it's like... i'd rather take the chance i can ride this out. wish i had something to offer you and everyone else other than my good wishes.
it's a depressing job. you have to euthanize allot of animals.
yeah, having a car and a garage was not helpful for me, and it's largely the same thing (talking about carbon monoxide). there were multiple times when i had the key in the ignition, but held back for some stupid, petty reason.
yeah, that's actually the exact reason. one of the best paying specialities and fewest hours worked.
you're right that there are laws that mandate caps on workable hours... but unfortunately many residency programs just ignore them.
i wish if i can do that but unfortunately i invest so much in medicine i don't want to waste all my father money but what's the point if i am a failure why even try ? i just did one of my 3 exams and i am going to get the result in a week i am not sure what i am going to do if i failed it or got a low score it's soooo comparative here i am will not have chance 4 years of depression and 7 years in medicine and then all that for nothing ...... i am done
a combination of low income, work-home imbalance, socioeconomic inequalities, general isolation and unwillingness to seek out mental health services
i just miss talking about dicks and killing things. people don't understand the sense of humor gained
men are more likely to successfully commit suicide, while women are more likely to attempt suicide
this is really helpful information. thank you for sharing this to help me better understand how the process works. i fear the articles i read gave me an inaccurate impression and i appreciate you bringing that to light for me.
i agree, used to work with severe mentally ill people trying to get on disability, and it went: denied at least once, usually twice, then hire disability attorney, win case, get disability. have all doctors, social workers, and other medical personnel write notes for your hearing. my 2 cents.
no i have not. i'm actually watching my brothers house and the dogs while he's out of the us. but when i get home i'm gonna contact them. there's a company that will help i think it's vso or something that i had applied through so it wasn't independent. i have faith in them. but regardless, i will still explore my options and lawyer up. thank you.
well i am currently unemployed. that income would make such a difference to me. i'm living in a veterans homeless shelter. and i have my release date in a couple months. i'm stressing pretty hard. but with that income i could qualify for hudvash housing in sect. 8 and they only require 30% of income for rent. at least that's enable me to get back to a stable ground and bounce back to being a contributing citizen of society. and who knows, maybe that'd help my depression and mental health issues.
we once had a suicide prevention class taught by a gunny who somehow turned it into him bragging about how when he was a cpl he hazed two of his boots so badly that they tried to commit suicide. leadership isn't always encouraging.
maybe it is for enlisted, but this should not be a factor. look at sf-86 again, the mental health page -- secdef changed it in ~2013. it is only applicable to involuntary hospitalization for mental health or violence related to mental health.
in combat units, especially infantry where i am, there is a giant stigma that anyone who gets mental health treatment is a pussy or can't ever be in your platoon again for fear of them breaking down. another thing is fix the goddamn va. one thing they can do is not deny soldiers the mental healthcare they need when seeking it.
there's much bigger issues than costs for the patient, ptsd is a nebulous and poorly understood affliction just like most mental disorders. it requires deeper research and exploration of all methods of treatment. today the treatment for ptsd that most doctors will give is some counseling and lots of drugs, none of which are universally effective. maps is doing an interesting study using mdma to treat ptsd which has had a lot of success.
it's less shocking when you take into account former soldiers from both ww2, korean, and vietnam. we have a lot of former soldiers and though their suicides rates are higher then average, there are other risk factors that make other populations more prone to suicide. this picture makes you think that it's only suicide from soldiers that have gone to iraq and afghanistan, but those suicides include the older generations that have served as well as this new generation.
or the government (taxes) could just pay for everyones mental (and other) health
and that's before adjusting for the male heavy sample of the military.
yeah, i'm beginning to think my original comment was based on some misunderstandings. which is good, if it means all veterans have access to free mental health care.
er nurse here. you are correct. you would be placed on a 72 hour hold, have blood drawn, a urine tox screen done, and be forced to change in to paper scrubs. you would sit in a room that is stripped of anything dangerous, hopefully with a tv, probably not, and have a security guard sit in the room with you. i am a big believer in the "first concern is your safety" aspect of it but honestly.... i would never ever recommend coming to an er to initiate psych treatment. i feel like it would push a totally mentally healthy person to the brink.
i would say that it is dumb because so many people simply are unable to answer it honestly, usually due to the legally required results of an affirmative answer.
it almost always is, and the answer to those people is still no. i hate that i have this issue, but i know from experience that keeping me locked up makes it worse, not better.
yea, vets will always charge at least the price of the materials/drugs, if not the price of the material plus what it costs for the vet and vet techs to perform the procedure. some will charge more, unfortunately, like any other procedure, since some view it as a business. i bet there are vets out there that will lower their price if you cannot afford it, or something, but i don't know how many would do that, and how many wouldn't. local shelters, since they are non-profit and usually operate at a loss, will often put your animal down with the same amount of respect and dignity, and only ask for a small donation, like $50 or whatever you can afford. however they might not allow you to take possession of the body or arrange for it to be cremated and the ashes given back (but it doesn't hurt to ask, and sometimes people cannot pay $250 out of pocket).
yea, i pay out of pocket, b/c the vet i go to knows me and when the charge is really high or there is a sudden cost, they let me pay weekly or monthly until the charges are paid off. but that pet insurance is a great thing for most people, and i really should get it regardless. i'm just lazy, even though i know several people who said without it they would've lost their animal. sometimes they don't cover all of what they should, but when you really need it, the insurance can be a life saver and allow you to pay for procedures that could be a few thousand dollars or more!
damn, why have a dog if you have no emotional attachment to it? i do sort of get what they're saying though, not that i agree. tons of dogs are put down every year, and every dog adopted from a shelter is one more that doesn't. so, i guess in this person's mind, they're giving one up but saving another. you can't save all the dogs, so they're choosing to save the one that's heathy. again, i can't stress enough that i don't subscribe to this philosophy (i just spent 3.5k when my dog tore his acl) but for someone who just wants a dog, any dog, i can sorta understand it, even if it is cold af.
let me tell you... it'll get worse. my cats are 3 years old and i love the chompy little buggers more every single day. i give my wife crap because she used to say she thought kittens were cute but she didn't care for adult cats... now she loves the grown ups even more than when we had them as kittens. congrats on getting a new cat. one tip for you... get yourself a turbo scratcher. my cats favorite toy by far.
it seems like there should be a veterinarian specialist whose only job is euthanization. i daresay there are some people this doesn't bother.
modern vehicles have catalytic converters that remove the majority of carbon monoxide, making the exhaust fume method mostly obsolete. you'd probably die from lack of oxygen than from carbon monoxide, and it would take a lot longer too
you just have to take it one day at a time man, one exam means nothing in the long run. even if you're talking about the step exams, you'll look back one day and laugh about them while you're making a comfortable living helping people. there's so much you can do with an md degree you're never stuck, and being a doctor alone is something you and your parents should be proud of. trust me, i'm not going for an md but another professional degree in healthcare and am in a shit ton of debt and things do sort of suck right now, but i have confidence it'll be better down the road. just stick it out dude, you were smart and accomplished enough to get into med school, so you've also got what it takes to make it through.
being a soldier is stressful but it also gives you a good support net. not just veteran's services (they kinda suck anyway), but the nature of the job earns you close friends.
just like another person described in another comment for this statistic about the military, i'm assuming since it is a mostly male dominated field the statistics look higher since men off themselves more often than women
a 50% increase does not seem perfectly normal to me
well i survived the marine corps, but am currently getting a degree in forestry and natural resources. should i be concerned? not that i'm gonna kill myself, i just want a good job.
more suicide attempts for women are *reported*. it is a crucial difference. men are far less likely to seek medical care or psychiatric care so i find it very likely their suicide attempts are underreported.
of course! i mean, i can only give you my first hand experience, but i did kick a lot of people out of the military (all for negative things) and i saw first hand how the process works. i also had counseling once a week and took medication, but it never affected my work and the only thing my chain of command was allowed to ask is what time my appointment was that day, for verification purposes.
thank you for your service, and i hope your outcome is beneficial.
is there a way to rush it? i've lived in a shelter before, that shit sucks and i feel for you for sure. if you have a computer/internet access and can write i suggest looking for an seo content writing website to work for. there are a few but i suggest looking into it yourself and finding what you think works or else it looks like i'm a shill or whatever. they are called content mills sometimes and take a very very small level of practice to get good at working for. mostly they just want you to speak english. anyways, hope you get out of the situation. while i didn't participate in the military or anything i do have ptsd and it lead to drinking, problems with being homeless, etc. until i started working on the internet and shit. it's better than regular jobs to work for yourself because you can take time off when you need it to have a mental health or therapy day.
i wish this was true for those that need such help. but as someone educated with it services, i cannot imagine a situation where nothing is logged. i can see situations where it would take a formal investigation to show such but something will be logged somewhere and definitely on deployment. anyone who reads this, please don't give up looking for help. this suggestion might be it. contact them when you are completely outside of command for more information on how to avoid logging.
exactly. most of the oft-cited veteran suicides are older men who served from vietnam to the 80s. also note that this demographic - older men- is, by far, the largest one for suicide, veteran or not. men suicide more than any other group. the majority of vets are men. maybe we should talk about why older men are killing themselves at a rate triple of any other group? nah. that's not how our society works.
oh man so much this. i wish i could go back in time and relay this to fellow soldiers while i was still in. this needs to be a mantra and staple of leadership in both military and civilian world. leaders need to instill this in their people. teach them that confronting those demons takes courage and is a sign of strength.
it's not fake pretending masculinity though, sometimes trauma might affect one guy out of a group and he'd justifiably feel self-conscious about that. "why are they okay and not me?" another worry is that say you're going to be given some sort of career boost, be it ranger school or a promotion or what have you, they might feel that if they're seen as "mentally ill/unfit" they're going to be passed over or miss out on something.
i must have a different experience over here in pog land. every unit i've been in has regarded bh as no different than any other kind of health issue, other than the fact they have to emphasize that. if you need medical attention, fucking get it. but yeah, i hear so much shit about the va i hope i never have to use it.
i agree that we need to explore new avenues of psychopharmacology, in addition to all the other areas for improvement that pertain to efficacy of symptom reduction. my master's thesis was on barriers to mental health care, and the literature i reviewed was pretty consistent that inability to afford treatment was the most common obstacle people encountered. no matter how effective an intervention is, it's useless for a client who cannot receive it. that's what i'm talking about when i say "cost/funding is the biggest barrier to **accessing** mental healthcare."
i'm in total agreement, but in my perfect world, ideally we'd just stop getting people involved in unnecessary conflicts that have such high human costs (both in terms of body counts and in terms of psychological effects). that being said, i'm not looking to implicitly disparage the sacrifices of soldiers here, as i think the political questions of which military actions are justified and which are not is quite a different (albeit obviously related) topic than how best to help a client population in great need.
not to downplay the problem, but if that's the case then this picture is super misleading.
actually, the research base for emdr is controversial. although some people have found great relief from it, it does not have the scientific support that other psychotherapies (prolonged exposure or cognitive processing therapy have). furthermore, pe and cpt have support through randomized clinical trials, which are definitely the gold standard quantitative forms of treatment efficacy research.
i got pet insurance just so i would never have to make a tough decision. on average it's going to cost more for the insurance than to pay out of pocket because, of course it is, the insurance company isn't going to just give people free money. but i never want to be in the position where i have to decide whether to spend 10 grand on my dog or let her go. i buy the insurance for the peace of mind.
do you know how much it costs on average? i have a 7 year old hound with no preexisting conditions. edit nevermind got online quote for $70/mo ($200) deductible or $40 ($700 deductible)
they puke, they sometimes shit or piss outside the box (not often, thankfully), they destroy your furniture and break your things, but something stops you from killing htem or abandoning them, and you couldn't bear the thought of letting them get hurt, regardless of what they break or destroy. this must be something similar to what having kids feels like, except of course not as intense.
yeah you're probably right. i'm very fortunate; hopefully i'll never have to choose the latter option. but i can see how someone struggling to pay the bills could really grapple with this decision. it's such a shitty situation. hopefully in the future with the amount of pets being neutered/spayed we won't deal with such a huge influx of them and they can be better taken care of. although, i wasn't really talking about people who grappled with the decision. i was talking about the people who surrender their abused pet at the shelter and immediately look for a new one (when it's obvious that they neglected their previous pet). trust me, people can really be this horrible.
i understand what you mean i just everytime i remember or see one of my friends d's already started thier residency i get killed inside of how much faliure i am ....it's so hurtful i hate that feeling so much i am so angry at myself i have no love for me .....this is why
just admit to yourself when you develop a problem. your not in the corps anymore. you don't have to be a tough guy if you have mental or physical health problems because there is no longer risk of discharge.
failed suicide attempts are not your normal "seeking medical care" -- it's emergency care, and there are usually other people involved. men also use guns a lot more -- a botched suicide with a gun generally requires medical care. though women use pills a lot more, go to sleep, and wake up -- these may often go un-reported, since you may not seek medical care when you wake up.
will do. i didn't know that and never heard it for an honorable discharge. but il look into it. thank you.
it's also worth noting that, based purely on age and gender, soldiers tend to be among the highest suicide risk demographic. even so, the rate seems higher, and definitely worth investigating.
and no matter what anyone saids, they will be. no one can outright say that mental health is the reason someone is passed over but they'll find another reason outside the range of discrimination claims. they (people in power) always do.
i know. i hate the suicide awareness training. personally, i don't think it does a lick of good. all it does is give the brass a way to save thier ass if a soldier does commit suicide. you know the very first question you get asked as the commander when an ideation, attempt, or successful suicide happens? did the soldier have suicide awareness training in the last 12 months and do you have documentation of that training?
it has definitely gotten better. but the infantry is a bunch of alpha males who don't like any sign of weakness which is by far my lest favorite part.
this makes sense, if a person has serious mental health issues they generally can not keep a job. if they can not keep a job they do not have insurance. if they do not have insurance they can not afford mental health. so they have no where to go. most likely family members will not be able to afford to pay for someone to get treatment either, if that person does not have insurance. as we all know the costs are incredible.
i have add and i have tried it before and it is really expensive if your insurance doesn't cover it. (100 dollars per session with the therapist i went to) there have also been studies that disprove neuro-feedback, saying it's the placebo effect that makes people improve. but even after knowing this the last couple of sessions i went to before quitting, there was slight improvement in focus. though i think i improved my mental state without it. it's a confusing thing, really. but after 10 sessions i quit it and i'm fine. it might be different for ptsd.
agree 100%. both psilocybin and mdma have shown huge benefits for trauma recovery and counseling. they've been doing research on mdma in some other western nations for years now, and i've seen quotes from therapists who claim that one session where the patient takes a dose of mdma leads to breakthroughs and progress that usually take months or years to achieve. it really is a shame that the broken, corrupt, vile dea is such a massive barrier to science and healthcare in the us that they would rather blindly stick to their agenda than help veterans of war.
now they are just investigated for malingering. guy in my squadron approached a therapist 3months prior to deployment and the commander was informed. they put him through absolute hell to make him prove that he had issues stemming from our last deployment. it's fucked, they made such a big deal about it everyone knew he had mental health issues, leadership made it seem like he was the problem and anyone approaching mental health drs would be investigated. that shit made it pretty much impossible for anyone to get the help they needed. i knew there was no way in hell i wanted to deal with that shitstorm so i didn't seek help and my problems got worse. there is a culture in active duty that seeking mental health help still makes you a coward. sorry for the rant, this stuff just rankles me to no end.
it's totally the case whenever military suicides get mentioned they never mention that the plurality of those suicides are coming from older generations, like i said before ww2, korea, vietnam, and desert storm. also from people that served during times of peace still count as military suicides. statistics can be so misleading.
oh god, lol... i did think "thats a weird abbreviation". what a tard.
there are jobs that require a medical degree but don't require a residency or involve patient care. you might want to consider looking in to some of those. medical examiner is one, others are working with healthcare companies doing technical writing or reviewing what other people have written. it's worth searching for or making a post in r/medicine for suggestions for alternative career paths.
i think most of the rest of the male difference is explained by age/race demographics. that female stat is fascinating though. my totally unsupported hypothesis is that the military attracts a specific type of female who, among other traits, has a higher propensity towards suicide.
i would argue that spending all night crying with a gun in your mouth is just as much an unsuccessful suicide attempt as taking a bunch of pills and getting your stomach pumped. the former won't end up recorded as an attempt but the latter will. i would also argue that the shame of failure is more strongly emphasized for men in society and failure at suicide can be doubly shameful.
i'm looking right now to see if i can find it again, but i'm away from home and phones about to die.
sounds great, then. hope it works out quickly for you
exactly. no one is going to want you in their high speed unit if they find out you're "defective."
the way our government has been approaching drug regulation for the last half decade is absolutely disgusting and in my opinion nothing short of a crime against humanity.
couldn't agree more and the homeless situation really got bad from the 80's on.
and to me, this makes the problem worse. instead of getting healthy, these same people are living in constant fear of being found out or stigmatized on top of the issues they are having. it's ridiculous--a cold doesn't make you terminal so why the hell does depression make you "crazy"!?!
~~let me clarify--a person who found treatment 5-7+ years ago for a mental illness and has proven, on record, that their treatment was successful (no more meds, etc) would still have the label of being unfit.~~ ~~an example of not being mentally fit would include violence (against yourself or others), drug misuse/abuse and not seeking treatment when you know you're not well. despite what people think and the different shapes and forms of mental illness, many people know "something's just not right."~~ i see where you're coming from and quite frankly agree; if you're not fit, you're not fit. **you've given me something to think about.**
i figured my "hundreds of other diseases and physical ailments which affect performance" covered everything, it was not my intention to limit scope to genetics. my point is it should be treated just like any other disease or ailment. if it's the same as a disease that can be treated a cured it should obviously not affect their future any more than getting the flu. if it's an on going or still present condition however, it should be expected their opportunities will be limited but in no less honorable a way than someone who lost a leg or sustained an eye injury in the line of duty.
the stopwatch on the iphone is based on the clock, so manually set the time and you can see what it does for yourself.
surely someone started this with the original iphone when it first came out? in which case our wait is almost up!
damn, that dog has a good chance of being dead now :/
welp looks like we can replace waterboarding since we have this now.
if he left it running the rest of his life he would have only one more milestone to watch.
well if it used primarily for shitting, it would fill up
yeah, the issue was never really going to be about how the time was stored, specially since a number like 99999 is not a special number in binary form, so there was no reason to expect any special behavior. the thing i was curious about is how the timer would be represented on the screen, since this is such an extreme situation that it wouldn't be surprising if the apple engineers just didn't think that it was worth the trouble to handle it. although a font-scaling system is a pretty simple solution that they almost certainly already had written (i think the calculator does something similar) and just needed to implement.
the ipod stopwatch depends on the internal clock, so starting the stopwatch, changing your phone time to years in advance will show the stopwatch running for years.
vintage internet, before meme's took over (uploaded on 16 jun 2009)`
i always feel like people are putting themselves in a cryogenic sleep when they do this. bon voyage!
he probably doubted everything he was sure about before.
good news is he has a 10,000 hour head start. only 89,999 hours left. 3,749 days later....
depending on how many bits the integer is, the number will most likely go to 2 to the power of n then reset back to 0.
nah, aussies are good about protecting their dogs.
even worst, if someone else had this brilliant idea 400 days ago and had now been out done
are you saying australian's are a bunch of lying criminals?
can confirm. i was at a summer camp with 60 guys in each cabin. on the last day, all 60 of us shit in the same toilet without flushing. the shit mountain was over the rim. it was pretty tricky for the last few guys.
digg was obviously the winner of that battle in the long-run.
font scaling is built into uilabel. there's a property for minimum font size you set. the text will shrink as it needs space.
no it's just calculates the time from the start time when you open the timer. so you just have to wait until the elusive day and power it on.
38p gbp to charge an iphone from 0-100% for a year, fact checked for my own bills
not for the next 10 years though, not that same phone.
then turned around and beat the shit out of his ~~wife~~ kangaroo
this was 7 and a half years ago too, so we only have to wait about 4 years
it could theoretically be a 32 bit clock, with a precision of up to 0.1 seconds you could measure up to 13.6 years before your counter resets.
not sure if you're aware, but it only stabilizes 1080p and below. if you've got it set to 4k recording, you won't see anything, but the 1080p is pretty decent.
he's not saying it, he's implying it. there's a difference.
yeah, reddit kinda fell into obscurity. i wonder what happened to it.
i imagined so. i just don't really know anything about apple's ui framework/api, so i didn't want to speak in absolutes.
pfft yeh right like anyone would lie on the internet.
b/c the engineer writing the stopwatch for ios 4 probably just did int current_time; without ever even considering someone may want a 10+ year timer
cheers for that one, the laugh made me get past my frustration at the dumb parent comment.
more like 10 years, it costs around 1$ per year to charge an iphone one time a day for 365 days.
"everyone calling this thing a vcr like they never heard of betamax" is what your comment would be 40 years ago. popular technology changes and when things become obsolete/redundant (like an ipod) it is pretty common as well as easy for them to go unheard of.
could you set the date back a couple years to trick it?
til: there used to be videos of normal people internet. all we have now are 'uge buildings, 'uge boobies and 'uge stars.
what an inflammatory title. i prefer "stardust".
now im thinking of trump as a villain in dragonball z, which makes me laugh.
could also be that the seconds and the minutes are 8 bit shorts and the hours is a 32 bit unsigned integer. which would mean a little less than 490k years of wait time... also there sure is a way to get a headstart on this, or maybe you'll get an answer from apple support if you make the mail funny enough xd
for those wondering why, it's because it doesn't use optical image stabilization (i.e. the lens itself is fixed -that is unmoving- like the desperate pleas of your crazy ex-girlfriend when you tell her you are never getting back together. what is happening is that when recording in 1080 or lower, the whole 4k sensor is still active, but the software is only saving 1/4 of the pixels- the 1/4 immediately surrounding the dead middle most likely. then, using the various motion sensors, it detects when the camera it's moved and counteracts that movement by changing the "frame" of pixels it is choosing to record in the opposite direction.
you underestimate medical technology. he could live to see 9,999,999 hours or 1,140 years 99,999,999 hours or 11,400 years 999,999,999 hours or 111,400 years 99,999,999,999 hours or 1,114,000 years
stop fucking reminding me of /u/lordtuts. im trying to let it go.
i never understood the drama behind 'uge. mericans drop the h in herb all the time
no moron! the i was inserted because the triumph was achieved during his third term. hence its a combination of trump and tri.
it's twice as big as the starkiller base. it's yuuuuuge! and the bothans will pay for it.
i'm imagine his giant face on the body of a massive sandworm.
because he's the only one that runs and dissenters are murdered?
signed probably, so only slightly less ridiculous.
i don't care enough to go to those lengths to find out.
hey man, is there something on your mind? you can talk to us about it
the elder lich, unmoving since before the time of recorded history, stirred. picking up the ancient device that lay on the arm of its throne, it glances at the flickering screen once. it rasps "oh, alright" in an unknown, forgotten tongue, before setting down the device and returning to slumber once more.
and people thought there is no reason to update to the latest iphone.
the examples he gave made it pretty clear what he was saying, he'll intentionally over or underestimate things because he knows that he doesn't know the exact answer so he chooses to be wrong in the direction that will disappoint him less.
it's more about his extremely limited vocabulary than the way he says the word. he's got about a dozen adjectives he uses to describe the world and that's one of the common ones.
god emperor trump? we gotta get on the golden path somehow.
remindme! 1277 days "i, too, want to be early to this party."
i don't know where you got this information from but it's not true. we are mainly part koala
i figured it was from something, but i had no clue it was from arthur.. damn.
there's overestimating and then there's thinking it costs $10 a year to keep an ipod charged.
or maybe the guy in the video did the exact same thing.
yeah but he can qualify those adjectives with "so" or "like" for virtually endless possibilities.
remindme! 1277 days "wow, you still use reddit all these years later? *nerd.*"
spending most of your day in a tree fucked up beyond belief does not make you part koala. sorry.
understanding data types kinda ruins the mystery doesn't it?
that's hardly messing up their practice of keeping things within a tolerance of acceptability. on that scale if they are off by +or- 10 dollars, even if that means their estimate is 1000 times more or less than the reality the effect on their life is the same. if they guessed 1000 dollars a year then i'd say "there's overestimating then there's..." since that level of error would actually affect their planning and lead to diverting funds to a nonexistent expense.
don't forget "very". and "very, very". and "very, very, very".
i've been using reddit for close to 7 years. i suspect it will be around for a few more.

hahaha best part of the gif. he fades out when he sees hillarys face
don't forget about w coming in from the right at the end to invite everyone within earshot to 4-wheeling back at the ranch
"will you, in sickness and in health, take side glances at other women's asses, stare longingly at their titties, and think about other people while having sex?" "i will" "will you not be able to help yourself in making lewd, sexual comments about other women in front of your spouse?" "i will" "then by the power vested in me, i now pronounce you, man and wife. you may now get slapped by the bridesmaid for attempting to pinch her ass."
exactly, when she made that look i thought, "oh, i know that look. it may not have been ivanka but he was definitely looking at something a little too much." may have been anything but that look on her face was most definitely, "are you fucking serious right now?!"
you can read his lips. "ivanka". its all there folks case closed.
what gets me is the little head nod of approval bill does after he looks away from hillary.
honestly though. this is the first time in a long time i saw something out of hillary that made me realize she was human. really shows how impressive of a job she did making herself unlikeable during her campaign
gw bush : guys you realise you are thinking loudly?
let's be honest, at least 3 and probably most of the ones that are alive and not blind. for obama, even if ivanka wasn't his type, i'm pretty sure it would permanently excuse him from future insults from trump. trump would be so emasculated and jealous of obama that he might even respect him.
yeah, that definitely wasn't the biggest problem at the time.
she doesn't even look mad. must just be the standard in their relationship.
it's like that gif where homer slowly backs into the hedge.
his daughter got arrested near my house for using a fake id to drink underage! i am living life!
and then he realizes what is happening and backs out quickly.
i think the fact that hillary caught him and smiled about it says much more.
that is the face of a man downloading to the spank bank. older processors take longer.
"seriously? you're going to do this today, in front of all these people?"
it was more of a i'm already fucked so i might as well keep on looking.
honestly, he looks like he's not all there. the way he moves and acts reminds me of my father, who had a cva/stroke a couple of years ago. also the appearance. he lost a fair amount of weight, he has a slightly sunken face/expression, similar to bill. when i look at bc, i see someone in a declining state of health.
she's not surprised any more. she's just like, geezus bill. the cameras are on us. fer fuck's sake already.
maybe we saw a different gif...she was staring daggers at him.
yup that's what i thought because that's what i would do. if i stop looking it would show i'm guilty.
a negative number? that means he forces other people to give them.
i thought he was doing the matthew mcconaughey 'alright'
gw bush: dem titties shure are nuculyar, ah teheheheh
she looked stunning to me. i don't like trump, but she's hot.
'i gave her some obamacare that even you and the republicans can't repeal, donald'
i also wish he hadn't signed the bill to repeal the glass v. steagle regulations act that allowed our banking industry the freedom to rape the american public for record profits.
i wonder if they even talk to each other anymore when they're not on camera.
makes sense. white lady cracking jokes to a black president in front of his* black wife at a black icon's funeral
from personal experience this is not a good way to do things.
well house of cards is largely inspired by the clintons, so... makes sense.
and it wasn't the first or last affair he had either. honestly i'm sure she feels that the worst part of the lewinsky scandal was the massive attention and public humiliation it brought.
there is a fain squint, a "are you fucking kidding me" microexpression.
"yeah well i was hoping for a better view, but here we are at the bleachers"
people can speculate all they want, but i'm 99% certain it was this face that cost her the election.
it's probably just a joke, no need to jump on any wagons.
maybe he was looking at eric. i can't look away from that guy. he looks like he has fetal alcohol syndrome.
i'm completely convinced they have a house of cards frank and claire underwood type relationship where they're in it for the long game. a couple mistresses and boytoys here and there doesn't matter when you're playing at the level they're at.
that looks she's giving him is the exact mindset i had when i left my ex. nobody should have to put up with that crap lol. (men, you guys too!)
there is some quite remarkable stories about how kennedy would shuffle girls in and out. kind of makes me want to be president.
quickly find something else and lie that you've recently picked up an interest on mass manufactured event chairs, and keep nodding.
i actually heard his voice in my head saying "awll-riiight" as bill mouthed those words
mouth the word, you don't close your lips for the third syllable
i just realised tiffiany kind of looks like lindsay lohan too, she's gorgeous
can you imagine hanging with him and bill?? it'd be wilder than the hangover.
well, to be fair, it really was the end of the world for several hundred thousand people living in iraq and afghanistan.
i mean, yeah that or that it's a funeral and they're heads of state so perhaps a more somber tone is appropriate.
i thought house of cards was largely inspired by the 1990 british show of the same name
i whole-heartedly agree. being cheated on is humiliating enough. now, literally, the *whole* *world* knows about it. shit sucks.
yeah and he likes to fuck, he's got a fucking problem.
i saw that too, wasnt sure the first time, had to see it again
yup. it's a "seriously? seriously. you disgust me, you predictable piece of shit" look.
hillary knows, why do you think she doesnt care that bill gives no shits about her?
.................*glances* "yup" *back to looking*
you grossly underestimate how stupid people can be.
i guess if you're the shadow of a man at noon, he must be standing on top of you.
the underwoods are almost certainly modeled after the clintons and their *alleged* crimes.
and they can't charge a husband and wife with the same crime !
lbj was even worse. often showed his dick to staffers when he ran out of arguments.
you will end up having to get rid of a dead hooker.
yeah, this actually made me really like michelle obama.
i love that they invested this massive budget into what is a very comical scene. those three minutes probably cost more than i will ever make in my life.
ba-doop boop me undies! me undies! no more sweat balls ba-doop boop...
if findin' somebody real is your fuckin' problem bring ya girls to the crib maybe we can solve it
eh, usually we will say "this never ceases to entertain me". the other ones will get the point across but "ceases" is the most common way i hear it. i've also heard "this never fails to entertain me." either one works
you have to take into account that the footage in the op was shot with a telephoto lens which brings things closer together while the photo above was taken with a wide angle lens, which exaggerates distances. i'm not saying they *are* the same moment, just food for thought.
i feel like it's hillary's look that she gives him that makes it seem less than innocent. if my wife gave me that look i would know instantly that i'd been caught.
i guess if you're the shadow of a man at noon, **it's high noon**.
poor white southern democrat who loves junk food and his well-off harvard educated wife?
dick morris is an estranged former political aide of theirs that resigned in disgrace after it was revealed he visited prostitutes (and liked to suck on their toes), plus had a love child in texas -- he is not really to be trusted. he's a conspiracy theorist and the chief political commentator of the national enquirer.
lbj: "okay so here's the plan and here's what we do" staffer: *presents counter argument* lbj: sigh... *unzips pants*
when she was 'herself' back in arkansas and when she was first lady she got nothing but shit. they even blamed bill losing the governorship on her not taking his last name. we get the politicians we demand.
i figure the secret service is pretty used to it by this point.
there was a nyt article on his composure when visiting family of wounded soldiers. one mother was so distraught about her son's disabled future life that she was just yelling and hurling insults at him, and the reporter wrote how amazed he was that he just stood there, took everything, and just nod his head and he was in tears for that wounded young man. and when an aide or the reporter (i forgot which) asked him, dubya said something like she deserved to be heard and it was my duty. guy wasn't just jubilant. he was practically presidential and saint compare to 45. god help us all.
that's weird, i was thinking it made me like them for being able to laugh at a funeral. there damn well better be some good jokes in my eulogy.
the writer worked for hillary's senate campaign. also: ~~harvard~~ *yale* educated wife.
the show runner explicitly said they're the clintons.
i thought the underwoods were based on the clintons when i watched, but they're not. the creator said that hillary is the closest current actual politician to claire, but i don't think he said she was based on her. robin wright says her character wasn't based on hillary. frank is based on the same british house of cards character, francis urquhart, but the creators have mentioned that lbj and margaret thatcher were their initial inspirations for his character.
is it possible she's just not a very likeable person
remember when they imprisoned a future international hero for 27 years because he didn't like apartheid? lol.
yeah i always got a lebron james vibe from francis as well
my favorite story is how when he went to visit a soldier who was injured on 9/11 at the pentagon. when a military member is in the presence of an officer or someone of higher importance, like the president, they salute first. bush walked into the room and rendered a salute before the soldier did, and held it until the soldier had the strength to return it. that's something you don't see often.
if obama had a son he sure as fuck wouldn't look like that.
the first few frames of a slide has no deceleration, so alternating between sliding and jumping can conserve a lot of momentum. it started out as a glitch that was wildly popular (kinda like wavedashing in melee) and became a full fledged feature.
it's such a photogenic(for lack of a better word) game. almost every match i've played has had a moment where i either went "holy shit" or started laughing manically.
and it has just enough brutality with the executions for you to have a small break in the chaos and go "fuck yeah!"
titanfall 2 is one of those games that is "easy to play, difficult to master", which in my opinion is the best formulae for developers to implement in a competitive multiplayer game.
i always thought it was too short. i'd actually buy a campaign dlc
just blew my mind: this is the best spiderman game since spiderman 2 on the ps2
that's homestead, which is the only map with such an open area. it is also one of the worst maps in the game. i'd say the worst but a lot of people hate crash site too.
in the days of halo 3 was great to watch the pros play. i miss those days.
same but the quick movements in titanfall plus the awesome mechanics make it superior. honestly kind of amazing how different first person shooters have become from one another
that's all this game is is attacking titans and becoming one.
you still could. it did so poorly it's already dropping in price. shame 'cuz it's a great game
i fuckin love games where movement is an aspect. might get it just because of this honestly...
i ran in a building once and saw a grunt pulling his buddy to safety after he was shot. moments like that were nice to see
i think this is the smarter way to repost though, you get link karma from the repost and comment karma from crediting in the comments.
is it like b-hopping in other source games or is there more to it?
except release it at the same time as bf1, or so i heard :(
i've been on the fence about getting titanfall for awhile but i think i may actually get it.
look at that proscreen though... 1174. that's a lot of time in just one weapon
you do a kill like this at least 5 times a game as a sniper in tribes ascend
most of the tribes players hated it, but i absolutely loved it. so much fun.
i'm screenshoting this reply to use in /r/quityourbullshit in the future when you try to take that sweet sweet karma when this inevitably gets re-posted. /s
i think you mean cinematic lol. i love games like that which is why i enjoy battlefield so much.
i really hope the graphics don't remind you of halo combat evolved
yeah, same. it was so good but so short i finished it in two days.
fuck crash site with a steel hoe. any map that has 90 percent of the area as shared titan/pilot space is bad and it should feel bad.
no need to be salty man! i did that too! there are so many ways to go even faster than tf1. your practice of speed already gave you a massive step ahead of everyone. compound that with the fact that there are more ways to access such speed! (grapple hook, gravity star boost, sexy stim, etc.)
i was being sarcastic but neglected to "/s". i got both and prefer titanfall 2 for being so bugnuts crazy. funny thing is: both are ea. they put out competing products around the same time.
they play very different. i really enjoy bf1 i is not as fast pace and stressful. i tried the tf2 multiplayer trial they had in dec and didn't care for the pace. i stayed positive k/d but i was stressed out the entire game. i did play tf1 a lot when it came out and was familiar with the concept just didn't care for it. i will grab ti up for the single player campaign and some light mp when it drops to 20 bucks or so.
in your eyes maybe, but some people might think the weaponry and historic elements in ww1/ww2 games make them superior
have you tried reflex? was thinking of getting the game because i want something faster but also newer, but wouldn't mind knowing how it compares to quake (i never played quake).
it's pretty much exactly bhopping, except you have the slide to make it slightly easier.
that decision wasn't made by the devs, though. ea set that months before it came out.
*thrown ~80 meters* "...i think i'm gonna need a new pair of pants." "i'll add that to the next supply shipment." man, i loved bt, too. closest i've felt to a character in a while, despite being non-human.
it's fantastic. the devs are adding new dlc, which will always be free.i recommend getting it
there's plenty to not worry about match making. edit - i'm on console so i shouldn't speak for the pc community. hope to join you soon!
no, not at all. it stands alone. pretty well in my opinion, too.
he used a grabbling hook which is a tactical ability. you get two by default and they regenerate. after he hit the ground he started bunny hopping, which isn't really an intended feature, but it requires constant sliding and jumping back into a slide over and over again. it allows you to go way faster than intended.
i had the same feeling but then i realized that the car is a very consistent weapon. that or just use your points to buy up your favorite gun after you regen.
i'd definitely recommend it. i played doom earlier in the year and thought it'd be my goty until i picked up titanfall 2. campaign was awesome, and multiplayer can be amazing. even matches i lose i still feel like a badass.
personally, i loved titanfall, but i don't think they're in the same league as far as fps campaigns go. it's no real fault of titanfall itself, but that style of shooter has just become so stale, gameplay wise, over the past few years, that doom's campaign was better just for change of pace alone. plus, doom's weapons are more fun and glory kills give you that giddy feeling that titanfall doesn't come close to.
it went the way of many games. servers come and go. many team vs team fps games have come and gone. i tried planetside for a while but it wasn't the same
finally u/saaggybuttcheekz and u/anal_vacuum have overcome their differences.
yeah but see battlefield doesn't have giant robots and jetpacks
ah, australia. the multiplayer trump card. friendly fyi, the game has gone on sale for half price multiple times in the past. i'm sure it will go on sale again.
everyone feels that way man. in this game, in any game, any hobby really. you could even say that is just life. someone out there will always have more, do more, be more. in my opinion you have two choices once you realize this; either rise up to the challenge and try harder or you could remember to step back and remember that youre also supposed to be having fun. plus the game is not like cod, the game is dynamic enough that it neutralizes those ritalin munching bastards. theres npc ai enemies for both sides that can actually cause enough distraction. also no matter how much dope and godlike reflexes a person has, you cannot take on a titan singlehandedly. titans avoid engaging titans head on. except for toothpaste46, he's got guts
i sat down and played the while thing in about 8 hours. definitely too short, but it was one of the better campaign experiences i've had for sure. that massive titan battle o.o
unfortunately that's not a good thing for titanfall, titanfall's parkour system doesn't take well to wide open areas with nothing to jump on (unless you're a god like op).
they wanted to steal as much market share for cod: iw as possible, so tf2 was bound to suffer.
basically, different people enjoy different things.
in all fairness, the reason why this clip is so crazy is because of how hard it is to actually get up to this speed and hit a shot like that. on console in my experience, 80% of the people playing aren't able to take advantage of the mechanics to ever get going this fast.
the international organization for standardization should work towards a common standardized semantic platform so we wouldn't need these kinds of discussions.
but at the same time most are trying to keep plagiarism from happening.
considering the top character on the training thing has a slide hopping ghost, it appears the devs also use this technique.
timing isn't that tight in titan fall 2 and you can airs trace and turn just not at a 90 degree angle
yup. ea fucked respawn good. meanwhile titanfall 2 is way more fun than bf1. there's no comparison.
i thought you were talking about team fortress 2 and i got confused for a second
my favorite was jack explaining what a hot streak was, and then having bt say he's been on multiple hot streaks recently. he was really easy to bond with, they did a great job.
god, i wish more people played infinite just for e3n. he was absolutely fantastic. i actually think i prefered him over bt.
on pc you can play attrition easily anytime at all.. mixtape which has almost all the gametypes does ok during peak hours, but late at night, 11+ in hawaii becomes empty. they are reworking the matchmaking into one queue though, where each person says which gametypes they are ok with playing, and then just put em into one of em. the way it is now there are like 13 different options and 9 of em are empty. hopefully it will help a lot because i love titan vs titan.
if you're only playing in prime time for your region i wouldn't doubt it. try playing in off peak hours and good luck. routinely see sub ~600 population. easily my favorite fps of 2016 (and by a wide margin at that) but let's not make things up about how deep the player pool is.
already got my money's worth i think! easily my favorite fps of the last few years.
alright, thanks for clarifying. i don't play many multiplayer games and was looking for a good one.
i think the bunny hopping is actually intended to be in the game. the loading screen hints constantly tell you to chain sliding and jumping for faster movement.
the whole escape system makes you feel good even if you lose, which is nice.
seriously. the big draw of titanfall is obviously the giant robots, but they somehow managed to avoid the situation where not being in a giant robot feels like a chore in comparison by declaring that, okay, when you're outside a mech you are technically classified as air support. i can't think of any other fps that's such a blast simply to run around in.
really? i actually think doom's campaign was more stale by comparison. and i don't mean that to talk shit on doom, it was good. but in terms of comparing i feel doom was the same straight forward "just move forward and kill things." the game felt the same the whole time. titanfall 2 introduced a new mechanic like every other level and never used it again (in a good way). "here is this really awesome amazing thing, okay we're done with it. here's this really awesome amazing thing." preferring doom's campaign is fine, i won't knock that. but titanfall is anything but stale and kept things a lot more fresh than doom's campaign did.
ah, i see. i do miss tribes. that game was a blast. i remember playing that ice level with the spire in the middle with the "hold the flag" game mode ... best memory was getting a hold of that flag a minute or two into the game and not letting go till the end. nothing felt better than getting into the skiing groove in that game, when you're hitting all the slopes absolutely perfectly and the other team can't stop you or even intercept you. fond memories. i don't have much desire to go back but i definitely had fun with it. that's the way it goes with online games though, you're right.
toothpaste46 games in a recliner so the footrest can support his massive pair.
it was an incredible campaign, especially that bit! i loved how you actually entered the battle via titanfall.
i would just swing through the city for fun sometimes with no destination in mind and have a blast.
"well, our biggest competition, cod, is coming out soon, so we should release battlefield 1 sooner to get the most money! oh, and be sure to market the _shit_ out of it. what's that? tit-and-call doo? ah, just release it between the two with minimal marketing, it'll be fine." -someone at ea, probably.
the top character is actually gamesager, one of the players who the devs put in the game.
i liked tribes 2 a lot ... is there a way to play the original tribes? for science?
it's so good that i feel obligated to buy the titan skins so that they will make a kick ass third. hope my 15$ for skins and 50$ for the game gets them there...lol.
i must have missed that line. i played through the campaign once and i'm not recalling any of the bt lines people are quoting. does he say different things through multiple playthroughs?
i went with "thats cold bt...." and he responded with "youre right, major anderson is extremely cold, to the point where human life is impossible." i actually laughed a little.
man, i really miss frontier defense, though. it was always my favorite game mode, i was almost devastated to find out it they did away with it entirely.
damn, really? i play all the time outside peak hours and i get games all the time
hmmm, interesting. i've never seen less than 1000 players actually, and the lowest i ever saw was before the christmas sale. it's kept a consistent 2-4k since then, depending on the time. this sunday morning it was around 4000. i don't doubt you, just saying that the player pool isn't as bad as many make it out to be in my experience.
i love this game because it feels like a combination halo and cod... and the giant robots, those are cool too.
for those wondering, you are given the opportunity to get the same amount of "points" as winning if you evacuate on a drop ship, which the enemy team has a chance of denying.
i haven't had problems with this. usually i'm just zipping around with the epg or softball having a blast.
i never play campaigns on shooters like titanfall or cod....i couldn't put this one down til i was done. so much damn fun i wish they'd add a sp dlc but i know it's not to be.
is it? i didn't even notice. i just had it saved from when i first saw it.
yeah there was a rainy level, mostly open but with a large tower in the center. spent a lot of hours raining plasma onto enemy bases from the tops of that tower as a juggernaut. hitting all the right skiing spots was great, but so was arcing that mortar shell just right to get it right down a rabbit hole of the base and get a half dozen kills. or the tropical map with the a floating ship on either end. hard to ski on that one, but when you hit the slopes just enough, and fired just at the right time to lob a mortar shell into the hangar bays right as you sailed past was just the best
same here it was probably one of the best deals i've ever seen.
bhopping and air strafing were originally bugs from air acceleration in quake and/or doom (can't remember which). they became so popular as pro techniques they were added into other engines up until around the time of source 1.5, when it became easier and more people railed against it. i highly doubt anyone putting that into their game on release in the last 20 years is unaware of that history, instead its kept to give players a way to continue to edge and improve a pro player's capabilities.
i think the records have pretty much topped out at 14 seconds + getting all kills (although you don't really go much faster by skipping the enemies).
neither am i. i saw it on youtube. i watched how to do it and i still don't know how to do it!
your 65 dollars has payed for one developer to work for one hour. woohoo!
pretty much the same with me. if enough of my friends get online for battlefield, we'll squad up and go play that. if it's just me or maybe 1 or 2 friends, i'll/we'll play titanfall.
i bought bf1 instead of titanfall anecdotal i know
the love quote is from early in the game after you get the first weapon upgrade "tone". i think it's only on level 3 or 4.
i feel like it might be likely in a dlc. they promised to stay active with creating new content, and so far theyve been fulfilling that promise. they are on their second free dlc.
was there a player bump recently? might have to reinstall and give it another bash. haven't played since before the holidays myself.
lowest i've seen it on eu servers was around 1500.
halo too! i could totally see that. sounds amazing.
oi mofo, your teammates are relying on you to help each other escape, so you need to suck it up!
pilots can do a lot of damage to titans if you can stay in cover. then your team will be the ones with the titans.
the devotion and volt have pinpoint accuracy at long range, despite being an lmg and an smg, respectively. the volt even maintains its pinpoint accuracy without needing to be adsed. in fact, most of the smgs are pretty absurdly accurate at range, apart from the alternator. the hemlok out-performs snipers at almost all ranges, being a 1-burst kill up to far ranges, and amped it's a 1-burst kill at all ranges.
haha, it is. he's my favorite. ever. god he's so perfect. i'd fuck him.
i am running a 480 with an oldschool i7 (930) and i get flawless framerates with titanfall 2. so yea, i agree.
it was quake. doom wasn't 3d and didn't even have jumping. a lot of games after it used the same engines or modified versions of it and also had bhopping
you actually gain time on the gauntlet score if you skip enemies.
+1 and ik at least 3 more of my friends are in the same boat. of course they are different games but i think there is still a large overlap of player bases. i would have loved for a early summer or spring release, but then titanfall would be going against overwatch. maybe waiting until now or the upcoming spring wasn't possible for ea/respawn.
yeah when you get tone bt keeps talking about how amazing and how you should use it
i play on ps4, usually hooking up to a new york server, and 7k seems pretty normal for when i get online between 10-12pm
console usually have a lot more people online, it's the same for battlefront and battlefield whenever i look.
yep, following the sale around christmas, the player base about doubled on pc iirc.
attrition... why does nobody play anything else :(
usually it is not a problem, but when i am top of my team at 5 and 15 and the rest of them get wiped within seconds of the escape being active it feels insulting.
same for titanfall, but there is a grey area where you can respawn. basically the game ends with a victory or defeat message and for a few seconds (not sure how many, maybe 10?) you can still respawn. then starts the epilogue where you have to escape/deny the escape and at that point you cannot respawn. the drop ship comes about 30 seconds or so after the epilogue and leaves once everyone is on board or dead, or it can also be destroyed (2-3 offensive titans destroy it very fast). so far ive seen the ship be destroyed a lot more than it leaving, but it happens.
its a lot harder to do in the epilogue. the titans make the ship look like a pepsi can in a shooting range.
titanfall 2 is pretty well optimized for amd cards, probably better than its optimized for nvidia.
i thought that was the internal sim card to make skype calls?
probably loads of malware and viruses from danke internet porn.
actually, i do get stuttering on other games aswell. also screen tearing.
screen tearing is normal if you don't have freesync or vsync on. i dunno why you're having stuttering issues though. are your temps fine?
congrats on getting out, and best of luck on your recovery! i would also love to read your ama if you ever feel up to it.
yes, every "therapy room" is equipped with cameras and listening devices, as admitted by the "church." do they use it for blackmail? no, they use it to discredit you when you speak out.
when you reach the top of the bridge (otp 8) you will be told that god is a lie for lrh, and there are more levels ahead, that will cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars. there is no end to scientology.
i am an sp (supressive person). you are not allowed to be in contact with an sp. i would love to talk to my former friends and see my goddaughter.
weird reactions? no. i got appropriate reactions, "why are you in this crazy shit?"
i felt alone. if you ever confided in friends then you were (as policy dictates)... reported and turned in. very 1984, very george orwell.
do i think? i know. hi karin pouw and members of osa! if any sea org member is currently reading this and works for osa and wants to leave, i will help you... including karin.
most scientologists are 2nd or 3rd generation, they were born and raised into an ideology and have been surrounded and isolated. it is all they know. they are victims. most of the original scientologists are all out and have spoken out. unfortunately, their children were indoctrinated by them.... are still loyal, faithful and have cut off communication due to the policy of disconnection.
because i was taught to believe that the controversy was due to people being unaware of what scientology was truly doing in the world which was good things. i also felt the press was focused on making fun of scientology and not what was important, so it was easy to turn away from the information. and also a major part of scientology is learning how to fight your critics. if i wasn't fighting i wasn't being a good scientologist.
speak to your local councilmen/women about cracking down on the abuse of its citizens. i believe people have influences, they know judges, lawyers, police enforcement i think everyone bringing attention to these abuses can help. it takes a community to police itself.
the higher up is singular. and he definitely knows. however i believe most parishioners and sea org members (people who work for the "church") are int he dark and believe that they are doing amazing things for the world. and david miscavige is directly responsible for that fraud.
long term struggle, however, seeing the "church" attack those who were speaking out, those who gave their life, life savings, their children to this organization that were once considered exemplary scientologists or staff members of the church to being liars, bitter apostates, and what ever vile sophomoric, vitriolic adjective they can find overnight says a lot about the organization.
if you want to get them out there is no way to do it nicely. there is no way to do it quietly. you have to challenge them by saying, "if you can think for yourself, if you have truly accomplished what scientology says you have accomplished, you should be able to speak freely on any subject. if you have completed the "pts/sp course" you should be able to confront and shatter suppression." you should ask them how is it then that you can't watch a movie called going clear or look on the internet if you are the elite of the planet and handling the planet's ills if you can't think for yourself. i only hope that your challenge will get them to simply look.
it's very upsetting. i'm only an actress with a short window of interest. so it is up to the authorities who have to do something about it and the judges who are hearing cases of abuse, coerced abortions, being held prisoner, fraud, mental and emotional imprisonment. they won't look at cases to decide its a religion. they have to separate and look at the law. your doctrine is abusive. it mandates that you abuse people.
the policies of the "church" are the policies of the "church." they will not change, and there will be someone right behind him ready to pick up where he left off.
yes my first reaction was "are you all fucking nuts?" and then i looked at my mother and said "what kind of bullshit did you get me in?" my only option was to leave, but at the time my family was not ready to go. the "church" told me i didn't need to believe it, just do it. and they always pose this question: "are you ready to leave everything you've ever known?"
i was punished for doing stuff magazine because it was too racy. they would not want us to do anything that would be considered not "becoming of a scientologist." i see they have since changed their stance of what they believe is "becoming of a scientologist."
if you really look at the numbers at the entertainment industry, in comparison to the small number of scientologists that are celebrities, the number wouldn't even register. i think scientology has done an amazing job convincing people that there is a great number of celebrities in the "church."
they gain a purpose. they gain a group. they gain a sense of accomplishment (awards, certificates). they gain an education that in the real world lrh states would be equivalent to getting a "phd in life." you become an elitist. that you have all the answers in life. if you have a question about life, you are made to think that scientology has the answer.
i have read stories on the internet. i was told personally by a few people that i personally know that there was sexual abuse. when i was 16 and working for a "senior scientologist" who was in his late 30's, he had sex with a 16 year old friend of ours. and the "church" handled it internally. all abuses are dealt within the "church" as it is an enemy act in the "church" to prosecute another member. please do not take my word for it, just google the words "scientology and sexual abuse."
i am. i'm okay with it because i knew what i was getting into and i knew the policies of the "church" and what would happen by my speaking out against it.
great question. because very early on in the brainwashing process, l. ron hubbard's "technology" teaches you that outside sources (i.e. the news, the internet, books, magazines) are all lies and hellbent on destroying something decent like scientology. the ama, and apa, and all "governments" do not give scientology its due because they have a vested interest in not healing people and not helping people. and scientology is in the business of making people better. so scientologists are taught that their safest bet is to get their info from the only true decent people...and those are scientologists. and if they look on the internet, if they read time mag, they will be met with punishment at their expense. and, as a scientologist...you have to confess that you've read outside materials, and that will be met with punishment at your expense.
the policy of the "church" does not allow them to come to me. former high ranking sea org members like debbie cook and former members like katie holmes are forbidden to speak to other sps. certain members are forced to sign agreements that does not allow them to speak to ex members.
thank you! watch our show tonight and spread awareness. it is bigger what people think. this religion is massive.
was she on antidepressants or any mood stabilizers? scientology's vehement anti-drug policy might have gotten her off medication that was keeping her happy and (relatively) sensible about sleep, sex, cleanliness, etc. in another post, leah did mention suicides happening for presumably that very reason.
i would say the "church's" fair game policy, and how they systematically go after anyone who publicly speaks out against them. anyone who speaks out against the "church" is seen as an enemy.
when i was a scientologist i saw hollywood as a dark, lost bunch of souls that needed saving. now i see it as any other business and that we're all just trying to do right by ourselves, right by our friends and family and that people outside of scientology are not bad.
yes my view of religion changed in that i am no longer a bigot against people's religious beliefs when it doesn't harm other people, promote killing people for their beliefs... like extremism. but if religion brings you comfort, hope, and a sense of community, i say "whatever works for you."
no, and if they did hear about it, we were told that those claiming abuse were lying. then i would have been interrogated and even punished for asking.
the "church" doctrine thinks that fields of psychology and psychiatry are a sham. they deny mental illness and afflictions. they promote that you can heal your psycho-sematic issues with their "technology." they will get in the way of people taking medications. they will prevent people from getting the real medical help that they need. and in some cases have caused suicides because of it. scientology is mentally abusive because we are all taught that we are responsible for everything.
i'm sure there were tools that helped me to be able to communicate better, not be nervous when i walked in the room. acting classes would have been cheaper. or maybe staying in brooklyn a little longer would have been more beneficial to my acting career.
we had special course rooms in separate parts of the buildings. any complaint we had about the outside world was met with agreement from the "church." we were serviced differently, we had supervisors doing courses in our homes, giving special schedules to celebrities. staff was interrogated by the church. often times there were sea org members working for celebrities in their homes, personally working for them. i know of one celeb who had a sea org member working in their home and sea org members were averaging $25/week. the labor laws don't apply to any church therefor they were made to work ungodly hours, forced into interrogations if making human mistakes around the celebrity.
doesn't look like got to this comment, but she said in another response that her first step to leaving was how quickly the "church" would turn on anyone who wronged them, even people who dedicated their lives to scientology.
no, i'm not an atheist. it's not about being anything now. i do have faith in god. i do not judge people for their faith. i judge people who use religion to hurt people. i don't believe in a religion that shuns people for their beliefs, or that you should hurt people for their beliefs.
that's not downvotes, that's just a reddit algorithm to prevent posts from staying on the front page too long. it's perfectly normal
greater awareness. exposing the truths. not letting to continue to let them bully people into silence and submission.
they don't tell you about xenu until you're at ot iii - operating thetan level 3. you won't get that far until you've spent many thousands on auditing and classes. most people never make it that far. the thing is, xenu is actually an incredibly important part of the religion. it's the explanation of why there is so much suffering on earth. it'd be like if christianity didn't let you know about the crucifixion until you'd donated egregious sums of money to your church.
i'm a big fan of louis theroux, but i thought that was one of his worst documentaries. going clear was a much better doc on the subject imo.
i believe in germany scientology is not considered a religion and so is not granted charitable status. can you believe these feckers get to pay no tax everywhere else in the world, and particularly the usa? eta: it looks like reddit is infiltrated with a scientology posting filter. apparently "you are doing that too much. try again in 5 minutes." when i tried to post this. utterly absurd.
she grew up in the religion. her mother left when she did.
i'm sure that ex scientologists can get therapy, but ex scientologists would not go to group therapy - particularly those who aren't necessarily "out" as ex scientologists. they would be afraid that the church would find out about and plant someone in the group to report back all the bad things they said about the church. there are a lot of non-practicing former scientologists who didn't necessarily have any sort of falling-out with the church and still have friends/family inside who they would not want to be disconnected from.
jenna miscavage hill's book, beyond belief, is an incredible account of what it was like to grow up in the "church" as a child of high ranking sea org members. it's fucking scary. so happy for everyone who has left.
god is lie for lrh? do you mean our ideas of god is a lie, and lrh is really god?
as an ex-jehovah's witness, believe me, i feel your pain.
the number of questions you've answered and the quality manner in which you've answered them is admirable. much appreciated! do you fear reprisal or feel the need for personal security or are these issues you planned for before leaving the church?
this is whats terrifying about scientology. not only is it dangerous in its fair game policies and abuse of religious freedom laws, but despite its young age, it's already beginning to indoctrinate children as a primary function... it should have been gone decades ago, but it's held on.
i was raised in the jehovah's witness religion cult. i've gotten the same question and my answer is very close to yours lol.
holy shit, there's a church here where i live. i had no idea.
are sea org members almost completely cut off from outside influence? trying to sort out how the brain-washing can be so deep.
kind of the same tactic i use with my jehovah's witness relatives. they're also not allowed to look at anything anti-jw online. my reasoning was the same. if it's *so* absolutely true and unquestioningly obvious, why be so afraid of exposing your followers to criticisms? any organization that wants to limit the information its followers are exposed to is doing it because it has something to hide. funny how cults have a way of falling into the same playbook when it comes to controlling people, even if the actual doctrines vary widely.
i get the feeling you're a very sincere and realistic person from reading your answers. i hope more people are able to open their eyes and move on.
the mormon church tries this same thing. they literally say "if you leave the church, where will you go?" and advocates for continuing to make church practices a habit even if you don't believe - and that the believing will come by doing (or, brainwashing yourself into it).
how do they punish you? financially? physically? psychologically?
people have accused the church of blackmailing participants, perhaps by using incriminating/ sexual photos or secrets that come out during auditing. hollywood has been accused of doing the same thing to "starlets" and child actors, as a grooming process. do you see any similarities between how young actors are "controlled" and how the church of scientology treats its members?
i was involved with this facebook contest for nonprofits and noticed this really small nonprofit was impossibly kicking ass with the votes or likes or whatever they were. i also noticed a scientologist i know (who's actually a really awesome person, for what it's worth) was one of the likers. took a little peak into the nonprofit. it was some kind of after school tutoring program that i guess was for poor people. then i found out the books they used were supplied by some scientology-owned publisher, which was the only real public connection to the church iirc, and i had to dig for it. so they had a pretty nice scam going. not even sure the publisher was part of the church or openly for profit, but either way they funnel money from these seemingly little altruistic grassroots nonprofits to the church or l. ron's estate by supplying shitty overpriced books to indoctrinate children with.
people are always saying they think scientology offers nothing. as true as that may be in reality, many of those things sound wonderful and are very much sought after in life. people have innate need for them and are drawn to all sorts of groups and ideologies in their search for them. i think this is an important answer and something that people need to be very careful about when they are lead in their search for answers in life.
your strength and poise through this is really something. you are so calm and self-assured. what a complete and total badass.
which is why in her autobiography she spilled all her (and her family's) dirty laundry so they'd have nothing to hold over her head
oh god... this sentence unsettled me more then anything else in this thread...
i have tremendous respect for you and what you've done since leaving the "church." you have a lifetime fan in me just for that...and for playing stacey carosi on saved by the bell. keep up the good fight!
how is it that you are still able to speak out against them? what is different about your situation than the others that have tried and been shut down?
"those claiming they were abused were lying! here, let me abuse you to prove to you that you are wrong to question if abuse happens here!"
and scientology creates such internal stigma and distrust of doctors especially psychiatry that even decades after people leave they may still be suffering and completely refuse help. its a real mind fuck and gift that keeps on giving.
sorry, but if a ponzi scheme is illegal, this should be illegal.
that is rather frightening and i comend you for being very blunt about the entire affair.
i misread that as $25/hr. read it again, and guffawed.
it's really great of you to go back and find the answer for him
loving this ama. i'm surprised the government hasn't cracked down on these psychos by now. then again depressingly enough, it's probably because the feds and states side with them.
so, it's like a "religion" with shit ton expensive dlc's?
the podcast "oh no ross and carrie" investigated scientology by taking their seminars. it was an interesting and entertaining listen. it sounds like if your life is even remotely on-track that their seminars and advice are laughably useless. you're being advised by the lowest members, many of whom are recovering addicts and others who severely needed direction in life.
i think one of the scariest things about jenna hill's book is that if he let his own niece be treated like that, imagine what happens to everyone else not related to him!?
absolutely. scientology will go balls-out to make sure a spouse doesn't leave with children. they'll very often start with threats/intimidation and quickly escalate to having the other parent file kidnapping charges/pursue it as a parental abduction. at that point, they're pulling out all the stops in the propaganda/blackmail aspects to smear reputations and paint the escaping parent as unfit, and throwing the resources of scientology into custody battles.
the best way for us to support her right now is to tune in tonight to watch her special. scientology sends letters daily to the tv networks to try to make them cancel her shows or prevent them from giving her shows.
as an ex jw all the coded language feels very familiar, and tbh i get that vibe when i read the donald too, not saying its a cult, but the language programming used to constantly reaffirm and reinforce feelings of being correct and dehumanise and humiliate those who don't believe bothers me, its a successful indoctrination tactic (also they have been factually right about certain things, which religions lack)
scientology points to their front groups (narconon, cchr - which fights against psychiatry, related medications & drugs, and their volunteer ministers who show up at disasters offering a pamphlet -way to happiness- and touch assists to "heal" people. they don't actually do things for society or offer true charity like most churches do.
boggles my mind that it hasn't been brought to an end yet!
seriously... i keep reading through all of her comments and keep seeing the word, "punished." wtf are they doing to people?
i think in going clear it said they were using his homosexuality to blackmail travolta to keep him in check.
yup get it out of the way so nothing else is surprising. "but you had a!....wait...ok but certainly this!...hm..." makes your credibility way harder to take down.
yep! /u/maxlyman and /u/hannahnewman875, for example!
*2 years from now* til leah remini was last heard from after doing a reddit ama about scientology
1. celebrity. its easier to take down a no-name critic than a celebrity in the public eye. 2. she's coming out with all the details of her time with the church on her own. the most common blackmail they use is threatening to tell about things you did in the church if you ever become a critic. if you get there first, they have nothing left to stand on. 3. its been easier for ex-members to come forward since a lot of the details of the abuses of the church were brought to light in the late 2000s, early 2010s with operation chanology. laugh all you want about anonymous and 4chan being superheroes for a minute, but it really was an effective campaign at bringing attention to the cult.
trying to dig up dirt on two guys who showed up on the red carpet wearing dresses and tripping on acid - i doubt they'd really give a damn.
they tried, the irs attempted to take them off tax exempt status and in return the "church" infiltrated the irs and threatened the life and well being of the irs director and his family.
i wish i could get a $20k settlement to waste on bullshit and weed :(
good point. 'not technically' crimes seems to be their bread and butter.
it was almost like she was abused worse *because* she was related to the leader. it makes no sense.
she seems like a really kind and humble person. so glad she was able to find freedom and create the life she wants.
in my head, this is exactly how i imagine those conversations.
"can you think of a single degradation that has not happened to you?" winston had stopped weeping, though the tears were still oozing out of his eyes. he looked up at o'brien. "i have not betrayed julia," he said
she's right over there, see for yurself! oops, she just got on that bus, you didn't look fast enough.
in jenna miscavige hills book, beyond belief, most of the punishment, for kids at least, was harsh physical labor. loss of privileges, being ostracized, demeaning jobs, etc.
wait... there are people who think travolta is straight???
a great way of disarming someone is to be entirely candid and honest about oneself.
read the book. it's even more detailed and frightening. rpf (rehabilitation project force, i believe) is nothing to fuck with.
have they ever revealed secrets of any celebs before?
katie has their daughter. her ex already programmed his first kids against their mother. the threat of doing that to the daughter, taking her away, or constantly going after custody in court would keep almost any mother quiet, to keep her child safe and with her. it makes sense. how very sad for both of the women who had children with him.
oh, wow, that would make so much sense. think about the name. they call her suri, like the surrogate bodies in that bruce willis movie, surrogates. she is a surrogate body for lrh's soul. freaky.
during an investigation, police suddenly decided it was a suicide for sure
being a celebrity has its perks. but i'm assuming she has to have some sort of protection, right?
and she doesn't have ties left to scientology like family members
i know, i'm the fucking worst. it was going so well too before i came along.
that is an almost comically grotesque method of suppressing dissent. also if the irs can't stop them, who can or will?
it does make sense though. people in the church probably think "he let his own niece be treated like that, imagine what's gonna happen to me?"
shall we round up the mob, pitchforks and torches, maybe go bust her out?
there's a cult where i'm from called the twelve tribes. they're like this weird hippie judeo-christian communal group. i've seen them lure in musicians like that by having acoustic nights at the restaurant they ran. they even have big busses they take to music festivals to recruit out of.
doesn't matter if anyone cares as long as they can make him believe people care. and there definitely are people that care.
they wouldn't do it directly. we'd see it as a leak of some kind, maybe an expose by a former acquaintance, etc. so probably, but not directly.
holy crap. did you come up with this just now? i always thought the name seemed strange, but could never pinpoint why.
shot 9 times in the back, open and shut case johnson
i got id'd, followed, harassed, and shoved by the local osa head (hi, cathy!) when i was part of chanology back in houston and austin in 2008. "always attack, never defend" was not something they were prepared to have turned back on them... nor was the rasterbated poster about how female sea org members were forced to have abortions.
i've seen that movie many times and had to check imdb because i didn't know artie lange was in it, and forgot leah remini was in it too.
you obviously havent seen any of the mission impossible movies. tom cruise will kill us all. please mr.cruise spare us!
scientology - when a movie script gets *rewritten* for a religion.
if travolta is sticking around over blackmail, i really *really* doubt that its because he is gay. ron miscavige (the supreme leaders father) defected last year and wrote a book about it. he says that the church used its clout to fix some criminal allegation against him. he said that even as a father to the leader, he knew that this was ammunition they would use against him. i suspect travoltas dirty linen is more along those lines. we know he has faced various same sex groping allegations over recent years, coinciding with churches waning clout and influence. i think the church probably used its intimidation tactics on accusers back when they could get away with it which saved his ass in his earlier career when there was no recovering from grabbing an unwilling masseurs balls but it also made him beholden for life. **tldr** the guy who starred in drag in hairspray, the musical is probably not afraid to be known as gay, it would have to be something more sinister in that closet
i remember laughing at katie saying suri picks out all of her outfits for her, but now d: glad katie was able to get away, and if that means tom not being in suri's life it's worth it in this case.
not to mention, the anonymous of today almost completely divorced from the 4chan of today
heh, mine was brian in the minneapolis org. he was never very physical, but i can't count the number of times he would try and do the mind control stare down and ask me "what are your crimes?" and "why do you feel the need to do this?" over and over.
pffft. all i have to do is put my hand on his forehead to hold him back. we've got reach that tom could only dream of!
~~written and directed~~ prophesied by l. ron hubbard.
i heard if you punch tom cruise in the nose he instantly leaves you alone and that is the one thing you should do in that specific survival situation.
i see a lot of hate from people, not necessarily on this site, who claim you can't learn anything from watching a cartoon like south park. i could name a dozen episodes that all held astute positions on many things. the scientology episode is no exception. it tells the truth but because the truth is so absurd you can't seem to actually believe it.
daesh are involved .way too well coordinated and with may too many resources, as it seems so far, to be anything but an is sleeper cel or some related group
well at least they made it a quick, easy number to dial....
totally random too. the chances of being a victim are nil. i couldn't help but think to myself, if only i had chosen to go to that *other* restaurant i was thinking about. are family not just tortured by those questions and the completely random and senseless nature of it?
i hope those who really need it are able to use it.. whole world is tweeting it..
it scares me more that were unmasked. they knew their death was going to happen. these are dead men terrorizing the living.
try the embassy numbers. they should be able to help
please help encourage people not to put their home addresses out publicly in tweets. who knows what other individual crazy fucks that may be part of this terrorist group are out there and will try to capitalize. i'm encouraging people to give personal information via pm. ps: be careful out there guys. my prayers are with all of you.
i live between hampshire and surrey, near some military bases, and can confirm jets have scrambled here. not sure if related but you never hear them usually.
cnn isn't doing much better. "an american band was playing at the concert hall, the terrorists likely knew this and are using it as a way to attack america as well. "
dude this is what got me too... it's not trivial, everyone connects to things in your own way, you know? most of the eodm are from my town and we see them and drink with them regularly. the fucking coincidence of them being who this happens to, across the world...
this sounds to preplanned to be retaliation. the france germany game several attacks at once. they may claim it's retaliation but it seems clearly planned for a while now.
you answered your own question. the more significant the location the bigger the impact.
first time i've laughed in this thread. 0118 999 88199 9119 725..... 3.
thank you, not gonna lie i'm worried for him. i can't get him to stay so i'll try to keep him safe
seriously. this is fucking insane. (where did op get this shit?)
i was just assuming it was about friday the 13th. might be a dumb assumption though.
they knew about it and if they didnt call ploice yes they are complicit.
that's sorta how terrorism works though. creating terror. fuckin scumbags
at least on the mobile app you can filter tweets to those "near me".
this is fucking surreal what is happening. my family have just been glued to the tv watching this whole thing unfold, reports are going here and there about how it must be isis or al-qaeda but it's so perfectly coordinated
europe is going to be more xenophobic than ever if this turns out to be muslim extremists.
what's the "last time" you're referring to? what happened?
happened in boston too, during the police hunt for the brothers.
it's true - the band playing was eagles of death metal promoting their new album, rolling stone reported their facebook updates saying the band and their openers were safe.
i could not agree more with this. i escaped the bosnian war when i was 10. i was fine during my teens (though slightly socially anxious and awkward i suppose but isn't that normal?) - it didn't hit me until i was in my 20s. now i go to therapy 3 times a week for ptsd. the trauma crawled up into my head very fucking slowly but when it did, i went insane. got addicted to coke, went to rehab (been 9 years clean), suffered insane mood issues which came out of nowhere and then i was diagnosed with severe epilepsy. don't fuck around with trauma man. best to see a therapist immediately.
i agree to an extent but they're not after specific targets, just numbers of people so they could come in to any house i'm paris and slaughter people so i think overall it's better for the 'doors to be open' so to speak.
brussels checking in, i really don't like this shit. fucking hell, i have friends in paris.
uk here. thoughts and prayers being sent across the channel to every parisian and french person affected. stay strong.
"joke predictions" are something pretty common on jvc (the french site), it's kind of a meme there (like 100+ threads like this a day). so it's weird he posted that but in a probability way more than in a prediction way.
huh, i thought it was just the sound of the crowd rising with people making sounds of surprise or confusion, which can sound like a cheer.
in retrospect, probably because the shooters were wearing explosives.
we can only make a change when people stop living in the stone age thinking the crusades are still going on
i was about to come back to this after i'd checked out the name. i said to my son earlier i feel i want to write in and likely will. it was a really nasty piece of 'journalism'.
this one. they mentioned the hostage takers were looking for people that are hiding. not sure how they would figure this though.
yeah, this wasn't something that was thrown together in the last 12 hours. this type of attack (multiple gunmen, multiple targets) takes months to plan. i'm afraid of what's coming america's way though. the french, russians, and americans all recently stepped up their military campaigns against isis, and france and russia have been hit recently.
yup, this is pretty much an everyday thing in iraq & syria right now.
couldnt agree more. have to give a weekly news update of french news everyweek for a class and french24 is my go to. great site.
yeah it's literally a frame from the shooting video
the location feature on mobile twitter will sort that out to a large extent. the local tweets will have more specific info. e. my location tweets, for example, are mostly local news, but i can change it to see just paris tweets and get much more information.
you have no idea how important it is that you guys keep saying such things. i wish you could say it louder and we could give you a megaphone every now and then. we really need to hear that more often in the west. that we're not alone in this and that there's some predominantly muslim countries who genuinely hate those assholes as much as we do. we really need all the muslims around the world to take a stand and scream "fuck those guys" at the top of their lungs.
sounds like they just did. flashbangs, high explosions (breaching charges?) and auto fire heard live on radio-canada next to bataclan 10 mins ago.
probably is. wouldn't be surprised if there are immense crackdowns on syrian refugees and anyone leaving the middle east
i imagine it would be related to the hebdo shooting. people post videos and descriptions of police movements, terrorists monitor social media and everyone posting basically becomes a spy satellite for the attackers. surprise becomes impossible.
good job on being clean for 9 years! that's quite the accomplishment.
this is my second day here. first trip to europe. quite the experience.
and kyuss. when they were around. damn good band.
worse in terms of casualties, but in terms of exposure i think it fits their agenda to have it heard during a football game (most famous sport in europe) between the two big central countries of europe.
explosions were said to be grenades but i now keep hearing about suicide bombers, it has to be terrorists
they have the highest muslim population of a western european country, thus with all the tensions going on with isis, it's more likely to happen in france
who else would do it? genuinely asking as i legitimately cannot think of any other group...
who knows man, it could have been done pre-planned or impulsively. the scary part is, for one to perform jihad, it doesn't take months of planning. just gather enough brothers, arm with aks, and go to a populated place and indiscriminately shoot people. it doesn't take a genius to perform these mass murders and that's what's truly scary
did they not remember what happened with the news in munich during the olympics?
and please seek counseling quickly to avoid ptsd. quick counseling soon after the event helps significantly to avoid or minimize ptsd. so glad you are safe op. and so sorry you had to experience this.
please be safe. if i were you i wouldn't go anywhere that could be crowded and just try to get back to your hotel or seek shelter by checking #porteouverte
exactly. lots of press and cameras rolling during match, not so much after the fact.
makes me wonder about germany though - true, germany doesnt have as much of a history with colonies and also a noticeable muslim population which immigrated here in the 60s...but so far we had no terror attacks ("only" domestic terrorism with raf and nsu), is germany doing more for its immigrants or are we just lucky (i know some of the 9/11 guys lived in hamburg but germany was never a big target apparently)?
seconded (source: md). it's most important to focus on your own well being now, talk about it if it helps, don't talk about it if that feels better. having flashbacks, nightmares, problems sleeping is a completely normal response to having endured such a stressful and unthinkable situation. however, if you notice that you have problems functioning well on your job, family, friends after a few weeks, then it's time to seek help. (just saying - sometimes it's okay and natural to psychologically respond to things, it becomes ptsd when that physiological response doesn't go away).
give it a couple of years. intelligence communities are alleging that possibly thousands of isis members are now in germany as "refugees".
this. i'm a psychologist and the current guidelines are to take it at the victims pace. talk when you are ready. don't let anyone push you to talk. also thoughts are with you and every directly and indirectly affected by these atrocities.
its become a huge part of music festival culture. people always holding signs with creative things on it. one of my favourites from shambhala this year was a jar of smuckers and the words "this is my jam". it's tons of fun. then there's the artist specific signs. at space jesus for example, there was a sign that said "if we don't sin then space jesus died for nothing." at bleep bloop one read "in bleep we bloop." that one is simple but makes me giggle as i trip balls listening to good music.
whoever wins the swing states gets a much larger boost to the electoral vote than the popular vote. since obama won the swing states, the electoral college worked in his favor to boost him well above where he'd be based just on the popular vote. 53% of the popular vote but 68% of the electoral votes. it's just how it works
i don't think they are protesting that he won. they are saying fuck what he stands for.
that's kind of what's happening. protesting the candidate and his views. i don't think most people expect to overturn the election. but they are saying that they won't except trump imposing his fascist plans on america, election or not.
that's why if i ever end up in prison i'm gonna introduce myself as "the mitochondria" then they'll all know
[](/shopdotmov) either way, now i want a giant straw.
i do believe that was the idea, i heard it was seen at multiple protests
i liked the flag of kim kardashian sucking dick that someone waved at a kanye concert.
i dunno. that sounds more like something you should be saying about trump, whose margin of victory was razor thin in terms of actual votes but healthy in terms of electoral college votes. obama got ten million more votes than mccain and six million more votes than romney. clinton may get a close to a million more votes than trump, but probably not. obama /crushed/ mccain and had a really good showing against romney. trump barely won.
they're democratic voters in the sense that they voted for a democratic, and presumably liked what that democrat stood for. it's logical to think that the democrats might appeal to them again.
is it a bad thing that people thought that an orange buffoon couldn't win the election? it just means that people have a high standard for something that should have a high standard.
remember the old saying: if you can't say something nice, you must be ann coulter.
what else can the people do at this point? if pence talks trump into implementing anti-lgbt policies, what can we do but protest? protests can move public opinion, show politicians what the public is passionate about (and consequently what will get them voted out of office), etc.
well to he fair trump didn't get to decide whether the electoral college exists or not. he could still be against the electoral college (although it's benefited him so maybe not).
whats the end goal for protests though? resignation of president who was elected via democratic election? considering he hasn't even been sworn in nor caused damage to society, what are we protesting about?
alright, this thread is killing me now. take an upvote.

hi, i have nothing to do with this sign. just wanted to join the conversation.
not unfortunate from /u/hefk's point of view. mother fucker has the market cornered!
you beat cancer and then went back to work at the carpet store? laaaaaame.
as much as i like to believe in better things from people, multiple reports from others who have associated with trump have said what we get is what we saw. hope for the best, expect the worst.
i just hope that senate democrats have the courage to shut down the government and refuse to pass any legislation, like republicans have for the past 8 years.
or even the assumption that all the people protesting didn't vote and are "entitled millennials".
it's notable that trump's margins in florida, pennsylvania, wisconsin and michigan combined are not even close to clinton's national popular vote margin right now, even before we are done counting votes. not saying we should disregard this particular result after the fact, but perhaps it's time to dump the electoral college given that two of the last four presidents (including the elected one now) got into office after getting fewer votes than the other candidate. it's getting to be ridiculous.
i tried and it wasn't enough. i live in a state that voted for trump by huge margins and every time i go out of the house now i feel like i'm surrounded by people who have made themselves willingly deaf to the truth.
my safety is of secondary concern to my voice, but thank you, i will try.
oh man. i'm not sure that would go well. if that ever happens, depending on what led to it, we may have to have some sort of emergency reelection. i just imagine trump doing something extremely bad and getting impeached. and then they "well pence is president now because that's how the system works". the protesting that could come from that, i don't even want to think of it.
i am on my phone but if i will revisit this tomorrow with links since trying to paste them all from various tabs is hell on mobile. i agree that insinuations can be read subjectively so let me say that he has objectively said aloud on tape that he'd have to sue journalists for libel when said journalists hadn't committed it, and that he has objectively said in interviews firstly that kim jong un is amazing and strong, that putin had amazing approval ratings (as if putin s approval ratings are factual), and that when duterte called obama the son of a whore it was ok cos obama is a weak leader. brb with links
a blend of disappointment in the democratic youth base over bernie and the arrogance of the media in presuming trump to lose cost clinton the swing state voters she needed. if you're unhappy with her for stealing the spot from sanders and you're hearing republicans are jumping ship and there's this magical alleged wave of hispanic voters coming to serve trump karma and all the media sources tell you she's a shoe-in anyhow, why bother to vote?
i can't upvote this enough. i think you're right. this was no surprise.
at this point it's merely about voicing opposition, hence the "not my president stuff". if the trump presidency goes seriously tits up which it may very well do, people are going to be judging the american people pretty fucking hard a few years from now if nobody voices opposition now. and of course, it's to show trump people intend to oppose his presidency every step of the way if he does things like put a climate denier in charge of the epa (which he is doing). also i think people are generally just angry that this clown got elected and didn't get the most votes again, just like in 2000. bunch of people are trying to get the electoral system scrapped or reworked.
i see pennsatucky and leanne from oitnb. ironic, i suppose, as trump is the new orange.
hillary probably hasn't grabbed a penis in decades, so it would've just looked like sexism toward the idea of a female president.
me too, that shit's scary. it looks like a fucking mouth.

holy shit! this guy took roy totally off the grid!
i respectfully disagree-- i see america as being built on bigotry. i think this is partially a semantic issue, my definition is probably broader than yours. and i'm not saying this in a villifying way, just in an "evidence suggests the experiences of certain historically oppressed groups tends to show things are much worse for them even accounting or class". i don't want to point fingers and shout racist-- i know this isn't a solution at all. this can only be addressed through education, conversation, and the spreading of real non-politicized research and information, however, not hate. i also see the resistance to what people identify as "identity politics" and "pc culture" as being one-- although far from the only-- reasons for the elections outcome.
have you got a link to him saying that? please have a link to him saying that.
-obama believes in man-made climate change and net neutrality
i think part of the difference is people didn't know at this point 16 years ago. recounts, lawsuits for everybody! by the tone it was called, i think they were worn out with it. and well, democrats just weren't excited about gore. i think another factor is the internet has at least some play in this. yea it existed in 2000 but it wasn't part of who we are as a culture. it was some people posting on bbs and making geocities pages. it's given literally anyone and everyone a voice today and they carry it with them in their pocket. that comes with all the good and bad that it brings.
the difference is these people are fucking crazy.
there were three types of trump voters in this election. those who supported his bigotry, those who excused it, and those who ignored it. all three types rewarded it. i tend to think of our social media feeds as a sort of selfie. they're choreographed and reworked to fit our self image. by contrast, elections are like candid photos of our society, raw and more representative of reality. in many cases, we don't like how we look in such pictures, but it's not the camera's fault that we don't like what we see. the onus is on us to quit looking like collective shit.
i'm not sure that's true. we should do and encourage whatever can be done to 1. show trump he doesn't have some kind of mandate of support 2. show vulnerable people they do have support, show trump he won't be able to suppress first amendment rights and 3. most importantly, encourage people to be active for the 2018 midterms.
ty. appreciate it. some things are buried, or hard to find in certain bubbles.
yeah, we tried that. "when they go low, we go high," remember? america decided it wanted low, so now i guess we all go low from here on out.

just remember that the majority of voters voted for hillary. millions are petitioning that the electoral college uphold the popular vote.
you know, as a mixed-race mongrel, i don't appreciate being compared to those hooligans
exactly. this was no ronald reagan landslide. it seems like a lot of people are confusing "shocking upset" with "overwhelming victory." it waan't.
judging by the exit polls there, trump supporters were more worried about immigration (and immigrants threatening their jobs and overall security) than they were about the economy.
while i completely agree with you. there is also a large population of democrats who didn't vote simply because they live in a incredibly blue state to start with. having lived in illinois most of my life, i can understand why some people in non-swing states feel like it is pointless to vote since hillary was going to receive the same number of electoral college votes regardless of how large of a margin she won by. i disagree with that line of thought, but i understand it. i'm sure people in california encounter the same problem.
friend of mine is getting ready for 5 under 2. first time around it was twins. this time around its triplets. needless to say hes gotten a vasectomy
thanks for the recommendation. its so sad that great shows don't last long, but at the same time i think their short lifespan is what makes them so good. doesn't give them time to job the shark or go overboard with the same useless jokes.
yes, and i'm one of them even though i don't put much stock in change.org petitions, especially one of this nature. it seems like a nice enough way to voice protest, but the probability of success is infinitesimal.
as a person of disreputable reputation, you're probably right.
go after the blind people, they'll never see it coming.
i agree. the conceptual starting point for pretty much every elite opinionmaker was a comfortable clinton victory. i even felt that way the first few days, but i'm starting to look at the numbers more.
sure, she should've campaigned. i'm just saying that her not being progressive or left or too pro wall street seems like it wasn't the problem at all. feingold certainly spent a lot more time campaigning there for himself, and again, he did worse.
you're conflating racial minorities with any kind of demographic minority. democrats champion racial minorities, but rarely champion rural voters, since rural people tend to prefer less government. racial minorities tend to be in urban areas too, which makes it less likely they would support rural ideals.
he should have doubled up and gotten an abortion as well.

my brother is 13 months to the day older than i am. i have 5 siblings, and none are separated by more than a year and a half. my poor mom. this might be part of the reason she was always emotionally, and even physically, distant.
i asked for a wet wipe and they said we don't do wet wipes, i said 'the fuck you don't do wet wipes', i'm paying two ton a head and you don't do fucking wet wipes, they said no we don't, i said 'well send out for a wet wipe'. i've got shrimp all over my hands, i stink, i need a wet wipe.
my mom had her 2nd precisely 413 days after the first, and the third 413 days after the second. i came along 907 days after the third, was the accident. after me, my mom had to have a full hysterectomy, all of the plumbing out, because catholics didn't believe in birth control. you could rip out a woman's uterus and all was fine and dandy with the good lord, but god would strike you down if you took a pill to interfere with his will. it fucked her up permanently, she hardly left bed after that for close to 40 years. i feel immense sorrow for my mother's generation and for all that came before her.
ahaha, definitely read that in richard ayaode's voice :)
that's what i was thinking too. that is one hell of a control burn!
remember that pete & pete episode with the lawn competition?
i grew up with a lot of neighbors but we still were on a well. rural life, man.
yea but parts of his house were not blocked by the road. he was a smart motherfucker
missing out on future lawsuits when their garden sprinkler systems don't prevent house fires
kevin oxbridge and that damn song troi can't get out of her head.
local code probably prohibits irrigation systems, while this is a fire suppression system ;)
paging u/shitty_watercolour or u/awildsketchappeared
i would imagine that guy's house probably has a well, judging by its location
it would be advantageous to run soaker hoses on the peak-lines of the roof. the majority of houses that burn down from fireworks are from them landing on the roof. the soaker hoses use little water, but will keep a steady down-flow over the surface. kind of a lot to go through depending on how often you face the problem.
well that went from pretty cool to depressing as fuck. thanks.
i'd imagine a combination of both was necessary, because burning embers would definitely have fallen on his property. i think without the road the sprinklers wouldn't have been enough.
i don't think it was very controlled :/ i get what you're saying though
i'm sure a good chunk of that ash ended up in his lawn =op
fires add nitrates, phosphates, and carbon to the soil and can revitalize old soil like a dose of natural fertilizer. some grasses actually need fires in order to seed and germinate, similar to many old-growth trees like sequoias. so the grass that grows back in from the burnt out areas will likely be lush and green. small comfort for the people who may have had a home burn down, but they'll still have a killer lawn.
after looking again, i think you're right. it looks like a well cleared fence line.
i am completely surprised that my answer to this is yes.
i'm glad i'm not the only one who thought about this episode of tng when i saw this.
you think closed windows makes a house air tight? lol
in florida they put nearly all the sprinkler systems on either canal feeds or wells. one of the perks of living so close to the water table.
i don't know what this guy's doing, but i use a ram pump to fill a tank which feeds my irrigation system. the only power needed is flowing water. with that large body of water right there, assuming that's his, i don't know why he'd waste well water on his sprinklers.
then you can come back to a nice dinner of steamed house.
haha sorry. on a slightly lighter note, shortly before they evacuated, the fire crews were using the little pond on their property to scoop up water with their fire helicopters. my dad said he was riding his horse by the pond at one point and one of the choppers got really, really low to dip water...much lower than the other helicopters had previously...and when it banked to leave, the rotors hit the water and boom -- sucked the whole chopper into the pond. he said he jumped the fence with his horse and ran up to the waters edge and was about to jump in (despite not knowing how to swim) when the pilot's head popped up all wide-eyed. he threw him a rope and hauled him to shore. the pilot was pretty shaken up, but apparently didn't get injured at all.
this is my hometown, very very much not a controlled burn :(
in southern ks, where this was taken, they burn off the pasture land every couple of years to cut down on the woody growth. the grass will come back green as ireland in a few weeks (native) grass is well adapted to fire. if you let the field go too long between fires you get too much fuel load and the fire will get hot enough to burn the roots of the grasses. but the article says this family had cows so i bet the land was managed.
which is great, because they're going to need somewhere to sleep.
yah, this is a huge one. we really do not recommend leaving sprinklers on if you are on a main city water line for the reason you stated. if you want to sprinkler your house on the city infrastructure, get an above ground water tank you can switch over to prior to evacuation. that being said, i never tell people not to turn their sprinklers on since that is their choice and it is not against the law or fire code, at least in my area.
wouldn't mind seeing that thing run bet it's badass
as i understand it the goal is to saturate the ground and vegetation before the fire arrives, not so much to actively beat back the flames. use whatever gets the most water on your roof, lawn and trees before you need to evacuate.
oh my god i remember that and every time i see a quality sticker on my clothing i think of it. also the episode about dotting the i in band
if the utilities were underground and the distribution point and connections inbetween were undisturbed, it could happen.
i remember hearing a long time ago a story like this. guy absolutely soaked as much of the area around his house as possible as late as possible before having to leave. firefighters said they were able to hold the line and save the house because of it, so maybe it's both?
smoke from a house fire is worse by orders of magnitude because of all the toxic shit houses are built from. source: i build houses.
this is correct. there was a wildfire around my house that spared our property, and the smoke smell was gone in about a week.
doesn't have to be completely air tight (though a house with storm windows is generally airtight enough that you can't safely run a gas heater without opening a window or vent). just needs to prevent airflow in, and i can't think of any reason for flow in to be happening. hotter air outside means lower air pressure outside, so net flow through any small air gaps should be from inside of the house to out. how would the smoke get in?
his sprinkler system might even be pulling from the pond beside his house.
really. well, i'm from utica and i never heard anyone use the phrase, "steamed house."
yo this is your hometown too? same dude! i actually live in the highlands outside, north of hutchinson. fire was literally across our street. yesterday i took a long walk to observe the damage. several homes had fire directly up to the edges of the lawns. a house a couple blocks from our place had everything around their home completely scorched as well. their propane tank was even scorched, luckily it didn't explode. yes this was a rough event to go through. i'm lucky as i walked by one of the homes that was completely destroyed. i cannot express the overwhelming emotions that flooded me witnessing such a horrible tragedy. i'm pretty scared still, as authorities said this seemed suspicious. still, i feel beyond blessed to have gotten through this unscathed.
there's been some really interesting studies done by kansas state over at the konza prairie regarding controlled burns. basically if you let it go more than 10 years it'll be gone for good and claimed by cedar trees. those fuckers are the devil.
so, should i find myself in a similar state, how would you button up a house ahead of a brushfire?
not to mention a fair few sacrifices ... for the greater good.
right? would be cool to get an idea of how he did it.
"hi, i'd like to talk to you about a new testament of jesu - oh, christ!"
oh yeah? well my dad has a fire extinguisher that i got for him so how bout them apples
yeah, you don't need to put the fire out, just keep things wet long enough for the front to pass by.
it was the daughter, who is a child, that said that. the woman actually says that "god loves and cares for all, not choosing one family or home over another."
ok, i thought it was just my shitty connection. sounds like an awesome picture; i can't wait to see it.
it's also not unusual for cows to assist in fighting fires. if i were these homeowners i would verify the pressure on all their fire extinguishers are still good.
yeah, i've had to go to the stream down the road to get buckets of water to flush the crapper with before.
really? nothing for robin williams or alan rickman?
lets say there's a house that's about to be built - the foundation and some of the initial plumbing is done. the lumber has been delivered and is sitting in a stack in the yard. now lets say it floods, and this stack of wood ends up underwater for a week. is it ethical for the builder to still use this wood? what kind of issues could that cause? i'm asking because this exact thing happened to my neighbor, except i don't think he knows. i do because i watched his house go up. they used the wood, every board.
"hotter air outside means lower air pressure outside" wat
they might when it's the thing that stops *their* world burning though.
sometimes they will go back to the date the system was installed, and if there's no proof, the year the house was built. it's intended to stop people from hiding violations on their property and then getting a slap on the wrist when discovered. your property belongs to the government, not you. how dare you have something unpermitted on our land that you paid for.
my understanding is that the tall grass prairie is and has always been a managed ecosystem. if the native americans had not been doing controlled burns the tallgrass prairie would be timber-cross, and the bison would be elk.
close everything up tight. windows and doors. get rid of all your patio cushions and furniture and do a sweep around the home prior to evacuating to pull stuff away from the structure, time permitting. leave all the lights on and keep the doors unlocked. pull the emergency cord on the garage door so firefighters can open it from the outside if needed. if you have fabric blinds and there is enough time, pull them down prior to evacuation.
for those that may have missed it scorched earth policy...
i wonder if it's a high pressure system or more of a low pressure drizzle
wait, "a" new testament? not the new testament? is it like the new new testament? testament 2.5?
only have pics of it, on my work computer though, not here at home i think.
he said drop the input into a water basin, so i'm assuming they tried it in a lake or something.
i don't think christians are trying to take away from the skill and dedication of the staff, they just believe that god has his hand in everything and deserves thanks for the protections he gives when he does. if they aren't also **extremely** thankful to the people involved then they are not so much christians being assholes as asshole being 'christians'
no. maybe it's because i'm into star trek, old and new. i just felt like he and the character he portrayed were so full of life kinda sucks that it's over. idk hahah. just my opinion.
he just got confused about which state has all the dank smoke.
i think it would be ethical for you to inform your neighbor, and perhaps provide photos if you have them. even if he can't get compensation from the builder he will know what problems to be aware of in the future.

but then they're actually thanking god because he stopped killing the kid, not for saving him. there's a difference. if you stab me a few times but stop before i'm dead, i'm so not thanking you.

yeah, all of the 0 people who are planning to actively flee a wildfire and are prepping their house to return.
there's no way he's on city water. that's a private well for sure.
i used to put my dick inside a hole in my teddy bear
if it were me, absolutely. i've talked to dozens of homeowners who have lost homes. not a single one of them felt it was ok to lose a home because their insurance covered it. every single one of them installed better vents when they rebuilt. money can't replace valuable family items and memories.

as a 55 y.o. 5'6 indian guy how do i become white ? am i too old to be white ?
no. inside every chiseled black man there is an even more chiseled white man. the chain starts with a fat white guy (this is why in chess the white pieces go first), then you have increasingly chiseled black and white men in layers until you reach a very buff asian at the centre. source:
everybody wants to be an african american, but nobody wants to lift any heavy-ass socio-historical burdens.
fat white guy checking in, honestly, fat white chicks don't even want us. fortunately i got married before i got too fat to lock one down.
it's actually black american men, not black men around the world. africans tend to have lower rates of heart disease than white american men. turns out the difference is really diet - black men in the us tend to eat poorer quality food than white men, because of poverty, food deserts, etc. it's nutrition, not genetics.
you have u/larsofthemohican to thank for it. and he can also do that freaky shit.

depends if you are talking about colors in the light spectrum or colors in the color palette.
... but... doesn't that assume that if they vote they vote the way the south wanted them to? did the south think that black men should be able to vote and also think they could force them to vote a certain way?

as someone who went from skinny to fat to skinny again my dick stayed small the whole time. feels bad man
if only, i'm subbed and it barely shows up in my feed
this is what it's all about. i hope you find what you're looking for. :)
in all seriousness, i don't truly understand how the trends of posting photographs began, but if it's something that validates the person, even if temporarily, i just let it go through. if you look at some of the non-selfie content, there's actually some great stuff, including motivational quotes, personal stories, and overall, a bunch of strangers anonymously trying to help each other out. sometimes superficial, sometimes profound, the whole thing is quite beautiful. i'm glad some people can find a bit of comfort in letting their thoughts loose in this sub, while receiving some genuine feedback and positivity for their concerns.
well, whichever one makes me right, i was taking about that one.
i'm assuming you're not american. in our congress, we have a house of representatives. each state gets a number of representatives based on the population of that state. so if slaves count as part of the population, that state will have many representatives (surely all white) who can vote.
no, that's michael; you can tell because of the way he is
that's cool if it's real...i truly wasn't sure. it seems a bit surreal that pretty people feel ugly.
hmm... if all the colors mixed together equally makes white, does that mean white is equality?
how do you know he didnt just find a jar of honey after finishing comment?
your only mistake is thinking that you're a big mistake. and if you were a mistake, then you are a wonderful mistake!
that's only with light. with pigments it's the opposite
yeah, i almost saw him as the line as well. its crazy what some people do to be that skinny.
anytime i find surprise honey it's followed by an exclamation point?
best thing someone ever said to me, i hereby revoke my future efforts listed above and will continue being the mess i am thanks
ditto. all opinions about opinions about tattoos are the same, in my opinion.
damn, the app collapsed the chain. i can't believe i fell for it.
those aids weren't permitted, theyll have to come out.
i tried to hang my own garage potato once. once. always hire a professional.
i don't like this paint color. this isn't the house for us.
i freaking hate how the couple always has the same lines as all the other couples on every episode of any show. i only watch the shows because i'm nosey as fuck and i like houses.
what annoys me more is when they're redoing a bathroom or kitchen and their budgets are completely off-base. a full kitchen? that's $10k. redo a bath? $5k. buuuuulll. fucking. shit. maybe for materials. that stupid show with the orange chick and that dude with the giant ears does it all the damn time.
i lived in a 2600 sqft townhouse for 2 years with 5 other people (no couples) and we still couldn't use all the space. whole rooms sat empty. when i meet people who insist they need 3,000+ sqft for three people or else "they just won't fit", i'm wondering "what the fucking fuck do you do in your house?!?!" now that i've have added 2 people to my 998 sqft apt (1 bedroom, 1 bath, + den) and we haven't killed each other yet, i'm thinking i might eventually be able to do that tiny house thing eventually.
possibly the best standup comedian around right now. his writing is impeccable.
ah german milkmaid porn i hear that can be expensive, they only trouble is there are so many. which ones though? which ones specifically do you use?
that show where vanilla ice remodels houses is so damn weird.
"we want an open floor plan, with a beach view, and bedrooms on the first floor" realtor shows them house with a closed floor plan, in the heart of the city, with bedrooms on the 2nd floor.
good thing you didn't drink if they said this house has or has no "character" or "charm" you might be dead right now.
rofl. then though shall create thy check list for must have features. thy three houses shall meet no more than two and no less than one of though desired features. never three.
kinda depends, is it haunted? probably high property taxes. pass.
my wife and i just bought a house, and on day one told the real estate agent we did not want an open floor plan. i told the agent that i only wanted to look at 3 houses and we would decide on one of them over a commercial break.
the realtor leaves for a few minutes, only to return with a set of four solar panels in their hands. they hand the panels over to the couple and go, well there's your $20k...the rest of the house is on you."
or the broker who knows your budget is only $150,000, but really wants to show you the perfect house that's *slightly over budget* at $350,000
i'm a casual watcher and i know no one in heels or makeup is doing work. it seems pretty obvious.
same thing happened to us!! our mortgage broker offered us a $1m loan with basically no proof of income. i couldn't believe my ears, and honestly knew then and there that there was a problem in the economy. we waited to buy until after the bubble burst (but not at the bottom, sadly)
yeah i have 1 friend and he won't even come to my house
she cheated. he ran into the woods with a gun. my heart goes out.
what gets me are the people that buy a small 2 bedroom house for $900k. where i live you can get a nice 5k sq/ft house for $350k
i saw one of those tiny house hunter shows where a woman bought a small trailer type house. she had two teenagers, a boy and a girl. that amounts to cruel and unusual punishment.
i'm friends with an owner featured on *bar rescue*. at the end, the owner was very dissatisfied with the job done. things got a bit heated and ugly and as a result there was a huge public backlash. people were raging about how ungrateful the owner was for all the stuff the show gave them; to the level of phoned in death threats for months afterwards. truth: the show didn't give them *anything*. the show got free stuff from companies in exchange for the product placement. and some of the stuff involved, like customer operated automatic beer dispensers, wasn't even legal to operate in that county. y'all are watching great big commercials that are occasionally interrupted by commercial breaks.
tell me about it. my wife and i are looking for a place and we've lost out to cash buyers on almost all the houses we've put offers on. one place was a bit dated but in our budget. the sellers accepted a cash offer that was$15,000 below ours. three months later the house appeared on the market for $150,000 more... and they totally ripped out all the period charm when they did their cheap ass flip! can you tell we're bitter?!
i hung a vegetable in my garage once. besides the wheel chair it was pretty easy to manage.
that one outlet cover is a bit askew, lets try another city
i live in a loft in st. louis. its between "meh" and "why am i paying so much to live in this high of a crime rate."
does it remind you of a butthole? no? how bout now?
yes, which means that the production company just walked them through a much better property knowing that the couple is already committed elsewhere. it's deliciously evil.
its not that i don't like these "girly" shows like this or say yes to the dress, its that my so hates the way in which i like them. "hahaha look at those idiots!" is sometimes not the correct reaction to a gorgeous wedding dress that happens to cost 30k.
i'm from the midwest and live in sc. trust me, i know.
wait. so something on tv is misleading the viewers for ratings? inconceivable.
people being shown houses by producers. the first reality show that tried to show home buyers found out home buyers don't make huge decisions on their schedule. next season they only took on people who recently bought and shows them other houses. seriously, who looks at 3 houses then makes a decision?
they ask for 510. you counter with 450 and settle for 480 now you have $20,000 to spend on hookers and blow
i don't think they include labor costs since the craftsmen usually work for the show. plus in every show i have watched they start taking something apart and discover they need to fix something else so the budget for the redo drops even lower.
do you have a 5k house or do they have a 100k countertop?
this is an american thing. there are certainly places in canada with insane houses, but i've never had space pushed on me until house shopping in the states. we literally could not find a house smaller than 2000 sq ft. it's just us and animals. my old apartment was 1200 and that was more than enough for us. mostly, it's just way too much house to maintain and clean.
love the guy. i usually have have no issues with swearing or dick and pussy jokes (my own level of discourse is down in the gutter), but having seen his two specials with relatively very little profanity, i have a whole new outlook on standup. he was actually funny through wit, not just shock factor. props.
and if you like those look up the top part on spotify.
i enjoy how you didn't even bother to feign disgust or disinterest which is the way this joke pattern is supposed to work. the way you did it, you're straight up just expressing your interest and asking for porn suggestions without even being jokingly discreet. but maybe that was your intent...
i kinda liked that one where adam corolla was doing contractor work. he actually was a contractor before he got into radio, and back when he was doing loveline, he used to love busting out the contractor jargon when the topic came up.
well did you go with the one that was slightly over budget, the one that gave you a longer commute, or the one that ended up having an open floor plan after all?
on the flipside, i've seen brokers do that to give a reality check to picky couples. the couple will complain about everything, so the broker shows them a house that has exactly what they want, and then the price tag on their desires.
i had this discussion with my nephew. i live in amsterdam and he lives in a remote part of nl (oost groningen). i have a small 1 bedroom apartment, he has a big 4 bedroom house with a large garden, attic, garage, etc. both cost approx 300k. he was laughing but i said: i live near 1500 restaurants, 50 cinemas, 20 theaters, 2000 bars and what not. you live near 1 supermarket. he says, yeah, but where do you spend your saturday nights. i said: on the couch, but at least i have a choice.
these shows were the greatest advancement in marketing history imagine being a fly on the wall in that pitch meeting "i believe people will watch a 30 minute commercial that we can sell adspace on - and we won't have to pay the actors or build sets"
a lot of states have begun putting laws that make flipping significantly less profitable. many of these include laws requiring the house be held a minimum of 12 to 18 months before it can be sold. since most flippers are small operations, they can't afford to hold properties that long unless they're renting them out in the interim.
i don't like the chips ahoy in the cabinet, let's try another dimension.
i saw one show where an "eco-conscious" couple wanted a kitchen made from sustainable materials. they tore the existing kitchen out to to do it. stupid cunts.
i loved the paint job, the stainless steel appliances, the flowers, i didn't like that there is only one bedroom for 5 of us, but we have to sacrifice some things so we bought it for 6 million.
real estate agents always look like your mom, and they have this kind of fun mom energy
well, time to ruin the illusion. they've already picked a house before the taping starts so you aren't seeing any reality crushing anyone's dreams because these people get what they want.
have you seen the results of when the average man is left to his own devices? my poor dad would hang a shovel on the kitchen wall if he thought it was in some way practical ':/
yes but it also means the prices on those other houses might be complete lies since they aren't buying them anyway. hell, they may not even be for sale.
they are correct. the company was looking to film in portland. my sister just bought a house, and they contacted her, since the county lists all the houses that were just bought. she never actually went on the show, but they were plainning to go to her brand new house, and two of her friends houses to 'decide' which one to buy. you have to come up with a reason to dislike the other two houses, since you have already closed on your house. if you ever want to guess which house they will 'buy'. its usually the empty one, since a house will be empty the day of closing. meanwhile the other two houses may be owned by friends of the people buying a house, or houses for sale, so they will usually have furniture.
never. completely gutting and refinishing a house usually take 30-60 minutes. the trick is doing most of the work during the commercials.
i would say "can't we just take a vacation for a month instead of buying that dress?"
trump is going to have a field day with hgtv when he finds out it's 90% fake.
nah the problem is when they go, "it needs 6 baths, 7 beds, and at least 5500 sqr feet, made after 1990 but my budget is only 500,000."
can confirm. step-brother and sister-in-law were on one of the shows. they had to pay for their own appliances and the show paid for everything else. they got around $45k worth of labor, counters, and other shit free.
hah yes every time with the shower built-ins...or when she's in pristine yoga gear and acts like she's laying sod or something...
in between those two - but in the lower reaches ;-)
i would love to see pics of this! if you have time.
i'm inclined to agree. growing up i expected you could get a small house or apartment for really cheap and i would have been happy since all i needed was my computer and a tv. turns out that houses around here start at about 2000 sq feet and there's no such thing as cheap housing.
i like jim gaffigan for this reason. also, i have kids so i can watch it with them in the room.
well we can't all behave like dogs without horses, after all.
that's a review that is going to make me watch it!
he still is a contractor. while he has a mini media empire, a line of alcoholic beverages, and acting/comedy he also still buys/refurbs/flips higher end homes. thats how he actually affords all of his race car shit.
under budget, open floor plan, and 42 mile commute
that's why i love watching the tiny house hunting shows. most of the episodes involve the buyer complaining that the house is too small, and the broker explaining to them exactly what "tiny house" means.
you could make it 3000 restaurants, 100 cinemas, 4000 bars etc. and i'd still rather live in the big house in the country.
let me tell you about this place called "the midwest".
a lot of it came out of the 2007 wga strike. they didn't have any writers, so they pushed the reality format and it happened to work fantastically. since then, lowered tv ratings across the board thanks to the internet meant that the format was here to stay. but the idea is hardly new. price is right is a straight up unapologetic hour long commercial.
this single dead ant from 57 years ago is really annoying, let's go back in time.
happens a lot with old buildings. eco-conscious groups, organizations, people tear down an old building and create a ton of waste to make an eco friendly building instead of just modifying the existing structure which would be more eco-friendly
no people are really like this. why they want you to "stage" your house just right. it's more likely to sell then say it being clean and empty. as people are to stupid to imagine what it could look like. same with paint they don't like etc.
meeting before we go in quick meeting. so this place has no toilets, and i know that was on your list. but i'm pretty we can get him to budge ;d let's go
*why would you take this away from me???* what's next, are you going to tell me william hung knows he's not a good singer?
and the surrounding roads are all winding two-lane things that dump into peachtree.
but atlanta has been cheap since way before the housing crash. had family that moved back there in the early 90's and could afford a mansion in a sub division on a half acre with pool, tennis courts etc. they were relocated back when the office there closed and back into a 3-bedroom spec house with zero yard and maybe 2k sf. same position same company same salary. wife was in absolute tears at having to come back to the pnw.
'fry, there's nothing else here. you only wrote two pages of dialogue!' 'well, it took an hour to write. i thought it would take an hour to read.'
it sounds a lot easier to walk around a random house that's for sale, than a random house that isn't for sale though..
flip or flop has nothing to do with couples looking for homes so i don't understand how that applies here. it's a couple (now broken up) that looks for properties to renovate and sell as a profession, not people looking for a home to live in.
i took our bedroom door off last november to paint. it's still sitting on saw horses in the basement, painted mind you.
my favorite show is 'kitchen crashers'. they go to home depot, find somebody who needs a kitchen remodel, then plan it out, and 2-3 days later they are all done. like literally 24 hours after them meet them they have cabinets and counter tops cut to size. pretty handy they had this truck full of cabinets the exact specifications to your kitchen. at least in the fine print they say 'some contestants may be pre-selected'
i could vacation really hard for far longer than a month with a $30k budget.
property brothers do renos in canada. your reno budget has to be $150k on top of your purchase price to even be considered for the show. the labour is still free of course.
not to mention that everything is staged and isn't the true after: from the accents to the artwork to even the dining room and living room sets: none of that stays and is just made to look good for tv.
hey man, i figured out the exact maximum mortgage i could afford barely and bought that shit
i don't know if you've done any home improvement projects yourself, but there's never been a scenario where everything went according to plan. i always encounter something unexpected that requires more time, more materials, a new tool, or all three.
nobody strikes tile joints like christina al-mousa, doesn't get a speck on her hands or perfectly manicured fingernails!
you people know way too much about the lives of meaningless people.
that's the dude that had thyroid cancer right? pops up every now and then on til: "some lady noticed his neck during a marathon and blah blah blah"
the worst part is that her designs aren't even good half the time. because they're flipping houses quick, they're all cookie-cutter designs with shitty granite countertop and tile floors. she only has one style and it gets old quick. i appreciate the shows where they at least attempt to make each project unique.
she's nice to look at but that voice... my god it's just the worst voice on earth.
where the fuck do you live where you found a sub $100,000 house?
it's telling that my favorite bill burr set is about when he gets a dog, is hopelessly negative about the entire ordeal, and ends up being won over by the dogs relentless positivity and adores it
no kidding? that's really kinda cool if you ask me.
dude. the tiny house drinking game: "this is really small." "i can't do a compost toilet." "this is really small." "our teenager is so happy to sleep in a loft without a door." --pan to pissed off teenager.
completely agree. i'm building a house on 4 acres in the country and am so excited to finally be moving out of the city...!
i'm the city type. so you have to drive in order to do *anything?* youre crazy! i can walk or bike to get anything i need so i've never owned a car! i like that we're different from each other, though!
11-year-old me home from school on a sick day says don't you talk shit about the price is right.
the gravity in this house is slightly irritating, let's try the moon.
they want new and shiny as well as a warm fuzzy feeling.
while this is true that sometimes people really are this picky, he was right in that many times these shows will just pretend like they are looking at other houses when in reality they have already bought one of the houses.
to ruin the illusion even further, they haven't just picked the house, they're already under contract and the houses they don't pick aren't even on the market, they're usually just friends houses who agreed to let them tape the show there.
to further demolish the illusion - they aren't brothers. in fact, there's only one of them and it's all done through cgi and split screens.
lots of houses for sale have people living in them. similarly lots of houses (admittedly not as much) that aren't for sale don't.
i've lived for an entire year on half of that. fuck vacation s, that's a down payment on a house.
i feel like the property brothers look like someone took harry connick jr and split his attractiveness across two people.
did you pause dramatically for three minutes without revealing what it was?
i'm a huge fan of the show and had no idea any of this was happening. all i knew of what that "episode" tarek had when he ran off into the woods with a gun after they'd had an argument.
also, the contractor - carlos - has a sister who was found to have an illegal side business growing and selling psychedelic dandelions using hungarian street kids as her drug mules. carlos also has a fake-tanning obsession.
i wonder if christina will pick something other than shaker style cabi.... nope, she went with shaker style cabinets again.
are we doing a dumbo thread? taken away, taken away
in the country. my house and 21 acres of land was like 120k.
this isn't supposed to be my nsfw account, but i'm breakin' all the rules today.
where else is he going to find privacy to do his buisness?
do you have a back yard? tell her she can build a tiny house in the back yard.
i was honestly thinking of adding almost that exact sentence. i still watch the *hell* out of price is right when i'm out sick. it's a commercial, but that don't mean i don't love it.
i sense a disturbance in the force. let's try a galaxy far far away.
the cgi was maxing the budget so drew just walks around with a mirror.
or all of a new house if you want to live in a van down by the river.
i always thought they looked like harry connick jr fucked sid the sloth from ice age and they had a baby. for this reason, i always wanted to be on the show and keep wearing ice ace shirts. each day id wear a different shirt that slowly morphed into one of the brothers. hopefully they miraculously wouldn't notice and people watching the show would get a nice surprise
they have property brothers as well as brother vs brother, buying and selling, and property brothers at home in addition to off topic with the scott brothers not a lot to do during dialysis but watch hgtv and animal planet.
i know i pause for an extended period because i just opened the ceiling and the are 45 dead rats.
my parents renovated their house over a few years. during that time my dad's cell phone gps actually thought home depot was his home. we would be hours away on a trip and if he opened gps it would be like 3hrs 45mins to get home...but it would be taking us to home depot instead where we lived.
it's been all over us weekly for the past month. i know because my buddy thought it would be hilarious to sign me up for a 2 year subscription. it's okay i sent his girlfriend a bag of dicks.
lucky bastard. gonna have to setup a google alert
carlos's half brother manuel, who used to work for el chapo, was arrested under the influence of said pyscadelic dandelions. it was during his 12 year prison stint that he was able to write 2 different cooking books, "huevos para la cena" and "minute meals for the man on the move". he has since became a best seller on amazon and has worked with martha stewart on numerous occasions.
but is it a commercial if you're not going to buy any of that shit? i mean 11 year old me gave no shits about that blender or that washer dryer set. i suspect the only people who were watching a commercial were the homemakers. the rest of us probably couldn't name a brand that was on the show 30 mins later.
these aren't the droids we're looking for. let's boldly go where no one has gone before.
it wasn't even a mirror. just some tin foil on a bamboo frame
or like 2 pounds of crack cocaine and a cardboard box under the highway.
ah yes, like the difference between love it or list it, or love it or list it with younger more attractive hosts.
better than 45 live ones going mad from being discovered?
mortar goes in between the bricks not in the walls. there's ya problem right there. problem solvers.
your wife might just be at a friends house because you've had four beers, you're using electrical tools and, frankly, it's starting to scare her a bit.
how i imagine that going: "my wife's a dirty whore. wanna bang?" "no. i work for you." "you're fired. wanna bang now?" "sure. you're like, on the telly." (the nanny is british in my version)
i seriously don't know enough about shows on hgtv to know if you're exaggerating, or stating the facts
i think the point is subconscious brand recognition. you're more likely to buy something that you've heard of, even if you probably can't remember where, than you would otherwise.
the granite counter tops are wonderful, but let's try that black hole over there.
this week on fired and fucked, tarek finally does "what christina has been accusing me of doing every damn time we got into an argument with each other"
this is the fundamental difference between marketing and sales.
the stones in the xeriscaping aren't the right diameter. let's see what's available in a parallel universe.
can someone with the photoshop stills put their helmets on either side, only showing half of each. pleeze
when will they get high-speed in your area? surprised there are still people using dial up.
toronto was the first thing that popped up in my mind!
you'd have to be having that beer early in the morning, because it's actually a sunrise. op dun goofed
it's a field of view issue. if the were symmetrical, the stories would be all fucked up
the whole thing looks slightly right tilted. that's an easy fix i can make.
i think you mean =/= and not /=/. in other words, /=/=/==/=
levels of sunrise makes more sense too because the buildings high-rise not high-set
but they just took the picture that said an autumn sunrise and replaced it with sunset.
thank you for making fun of me in a good way and getting me to laugh. you're absolutely right, too.
adobe kuler. i don't know if they have a mobile app, but the web app is fantastic.
i, a programmer, think you mean `!==` and not `=/=` or `/=/`. in other words, `"/=/"!=="=/=" & "=/="!=="!=="`
you know your business is successful when it becomes a verb or a noun
pleasure! i love the dialogue that sharing great music creates. giving and receiving music suggestions is one of the most vindicating things to do for me personally. especially when it is well recieved like this :)
"electronic" is such a broad term that you not knowing him is understandable. i only used it because i didn't wanna get caught up in pointless music-genre arguments that don't help anyone. the most well known song of him has over a million plays on spotify. from my perspective, that's quite big, but people can see that differently depending on their perspective on it :)
that's what i'm here for. jokes and jokes. what a great fucking photo though eh?
seriously. other than the white dot on the side.... i'll leave.
"we live in the wealthiest bird-country of the history of the world, but not many birds know that. you know why? because they are waking up before the sun rises in order to get the worms, inscets, and other tasty food before their fellow bird can. every day they have to worry about getting enough food for their chicks. most birds do not perceive that we live in a wealthy bird country because almost all of the bird seed is going to the top 1%. the top 1% is able to wake up at any time, fly to an automatic bird seed dispenser and give the bird seed to their family. there is something profoundly wrong with our bird country and it is up to us to fix it." -birdie sanders
practically everything /u/gallowboob posts cashes in. over 8 million link karma?
since bernie lost it's been /r/hilaryclintonsemails
how can you tell? a lot of fledglings look very similar! barn swallows are the best. i love watching them fly. why are there no videos of them flying? can people not follow them with a camera?
check op's post history and decide if that's really him holding the bird lol
either they were fake upvotes or a bunch of anti-bernie people showed up.
dude this is u/gallowboob we're talking about here. he don't need no karma.
i mean she easily won the primaries without that much of a grueling fight. and obviously most of the supers were going to back someone they knew and worked with for years, rather than someone who literally just joined for the purpose of running. what happened was predictable on the dem race. it's the gop one that was surprising.
but you just have to wait in a line. since bread lines are a good thing according to bernie
you got their personalities pretty much down. i read it all in their voices. haha
when it gets put like that, it seems a whole lot crazier than when you compare real world wealth. it makes it more real for some reason.
for some reason that speaks more to me than the actual message. the power of satire is weird.
you think you're some kind of expert? i'd love to go toe to toe with you in bird law.
we're gonna build the biggest vacuum cleaner, it's gonna be yuuuuuugggee
he posts a massive amount of content and deletes the stuff that don't get a lot of upvotes in a couple of mins. he probably also cheats with bots and scripts.
/r/politics has basically turned into a crowd-supported clinton investigation fan fiction.
i love his smile. i've watched a couple interviews with him and i was shocked to hear him cussing with this cool young black barber guy. i was shocked bernie had a relaxed mode.
you mean to tell me /u/gallowboob isn't the most interesting man in the world?
yup, 100% false. in fact, i have had multiple wildlife biology jobs which entailed taking baby birds out of nests to band them, take measurements, blood samples, etc. we put them back in the nest afterward and the parents continue to feed and care for them 100% of the time. depending on what kind of data you're collecting it can take anywhere from 10-30 minutes to process the nestlings, but i'd imagine abandonment could be a possibility if you had them for some inordinate amount of time. the whole "birds abandon babies with human scent" is bull, though. with the exception of some vultures, most birds can't smell very well anyway. still, it's best to leave baby birds alone because your leaving scent/drawing attention to the nest could attract predators, and baby birds require a fuckton of food to stay alive, so you don't want to disturb them without a good reason.
now i expect to see bernie landing on this guy's little bird podium.
you're not denying what the hen is doing, i noticed.
i will support migration reforms that keep flocks together, not separate them
seems like he dedicates a significant amount of his time on this. why the fuck?
in my experience, whenever i see people being extremely hyperbolic and exaggerated about trump on there (he'll literally destroy the country, he's hitler, etc) about 7/10 times that person ends up being canadian. it's really weird.
i decided to visit r/politics after hillary gained enough delegates for the nomination. every post on the entire front page was about her emails. every single one.
that's the beauty of giant meteor. you don't have a choice.
yea, he's the kind of guy you can just chill and go to old country buffet with.
i wonder what hillary would do if a bird landed near her. i think she's probably melt the bird with her alien ray-gun eyeballs.
reports are in of massive bird voter fraud. millions of sparrow ballots go missing.
even if he isn't the one holding the bird i see /u/gallowboob fucking everywhere and that's interesting in itself.
my whole childhood was a lie of not touching birds, not stepping on cracks, avoiding black cats, being told i'm unique and that girls will like me for my personality.
the american people are fed up with this corrupt pecking order!
no, the first two were just more bernie related bird-puns, and the third was a reference to it's always sunny in philadelphia. but yes, bernies platform is pretty great

according to the new pew poll, canadians are like second most likely to see trump as favorable in the western world, second to hungary. i may be remembering the place wrong, but it was 14% compared to 3% for greece, etc. it was up there.
that does not matter at all. what americans should be voting for is whats best for america, not whats best for other countries.
r/politics front page right now almost is completely clinton/lynch/dnc threads, only 2 of them are not.
be glad you got out when you did. not only is every front-page article the same, but the comments are all the same too. a few months ago there was at least some semblance of discussion (though it was clearly weighted). now the circlejerk has complete primacy, and nobody else even bothers to post anything off-script... which the circlejerk uses as proof that there are no good dissenting arguments.

according to a recent poll, 100% of canadians will not be voting for either trump or hillary.
but history has shown that isolationism doesn't work. when we go into turtle mode, it doesn't make the outside world go away. countries and people still will look to america, and whether they see us as the land of opportunity or the great satan largely depends on our elections and policy votes. like it or not, who we elect to represent us and the beliefs we turn into law do matter, globally. we have set our sights from the beginning to be the greatest country in the world, and you know what spidey says about great power. we have a responsibility to think about the rest of the world...and to find uncle ben's killer.
plus it's literally 20 links to the same story. on the other hand, 7 state primary victories and the democratic nomination for hillary get lumped into a single megathread.
yes they are true sometimes, but the vast majority of the time they aren't. the balance of probability dictates that the conspiracy theorist is probably a gullible, mentally ill moron.

the thing is, reddit dislikes reposts and challenging the hivemind so after your first visit to /r/politics everyone should be of the same opinions regarding politics, and since everyone's in agreement actual discussion would be saying something that's already been said, because if everyone believes it, it was obviously already debated to death and all the arguments for or against a position were examined thoroughly to generate the hivemind's current view. on the other hand, people like hearing that other people agree with them so people just say things they already stated but in a different way so it sounds unique, which is all you need to pass the anti-repost filters.
she was the youngest of the original crew. the closet is hamill who is 5 years older. shit man
she'll be in episode 8 fully too they are done filming
they usually still trim them and don't include everyone. they'll list everyone on their website or something, but the segment in the program often has some omissions for time.
i don't doubt you're right but i've always heard that harrison and carrie hated eachother after the ot because their affair ended poorly.
she went out, finally in control of her life again.
sad, but very true. humans just can't come back from a heart attack that severe.
for those who don't know, debbie reynolds is part of our history too. she was the lead opposite gene kelly in singing in the rain, charlotte in the charlotte's web movie (1973), grace's mom in will and grace, and the grandmother in halloweentown.
i really hope that staring one last time in star wars as leia brought her a lot of happiness. it seemed like them getting together again was great for all of the cast.
unfortunately "stable" did not mean "not braindead from oxygen deprivation". her brain probably went too long without oxygen during the initial response on the flight.
i just rewatched ep. iv last night. guess i'm watching the rest of em
i welled up a bit when i saw that. the world was luck to have her as a heroine in such a powerful franchise
filming wrapped for the next one, she has credits listed in it on imdb. they'll have time to figure out how they want to handle it going forward.
ep. 8 is already done but they'll have to find a way to write her out of the script for future episodes.
this right here is a joke i think ms. fisher would have liked.
space worm generates gravity to aid in catching it's prey. you can explain anything really.
though apparently your organs tend to scoot up into your chest more (intestines and all the rest) because of gravity, so you wind up with a far narrower-than-average waist. when you go back to earth you get your gut back.
one of the shittiest thing that can happen to a parent is when they outlive their children.
her real career in hollywood was as a writer, a "script doctor"; someone that is hired to spice up dialog, edit unnecessary scenes before they are shot, etc.
damn, i was looking forward to the release of ep viii, now its gonna be kinda bittersweet : /
it's strange to hear about all these deaths. they're mostly just celebrities and cultural icons to everyone, but there's always those people, obviously exempting loved ones, that have been influenced a tremendous amount by them.
bacall was no dummy herself. this is quite the compliment.
makes you wonder how they will handle star wars episode 9 depending on what she has done in episode 8
it warms my heart that carrie fisher died a healthy, (hopefully) happy older person reliving the best years of her life. it may not have been her "prime", but it was a close second. sometimes, at 30, it feels like the best is behind me, and its all downhill from here. carrie showed us that self improvement is always possible.
so many people are posting pics of young leia in memoriam. i don't think she would have liked that. i think she would have liked if people remember her as she grew to be.
pretty sure they are going to rewrite a part of the plot of episode 8 as well. similar to what happened to paul walker in furious 7. wouldnt be surprised if a digital likeness thing is used again to give her character some closure
they don't seem to understand that we don't care how long it is, we just want to see everyone that we knew and liked.
this seriously needs to happen. this year has been such a nutshot.
that's possible, but thirty years is a long time to hold a grudge.
my grandpas had 3 by 25 and had 6 by 80s i think he was able to get almost immediate attention each time
paralyzed and aware, absolutely, but why brain dead?
definitely. most of us have known someone who's battled cancer or other serious illnesses (wow...that's sad to write), and i'd bet almost everyone would rather see a loved one die of a heart attack or something fast than a slow, deteriorating death like with cancer. as jack nicholson's character said in the bucket list, "somewhere, some lucky guy is having a heart-attack."
and god damnit, if any of you haven't seen singin' in the rain, just go do it. right now. it's one of the greatest musicals of all time. it'll help with the crippling sadness.
just going off her publicity appearances, she absolutely loved it. even crotchety old harrison ford looked like he was having fun.
yea why the fuck did they change that to young anakin? if obi wan stays looking the same age he was when he died, why wouldn't anakin look the same way?
i knew the odds were against her but i was hoping for a miracle.
well you have episode viii to look forward to. i'm sure they'll give her a great exit.
i imagine they'll write something like "in memory of carrie fisher" during the opening credits. i'm gonna cry like a bitch.
they could use some cut footage to make a hologram transmission. short and sweet.
"why are you wearing a tux?" "it's after 6 o'clock lemon. what am i, a farmer?"
asteroid spins. gravity is simulated. even easier.
was she still drinking? it looked like she was on 8 out of 10 cats recently but i may be wrong.
her mother, debbie reynolds, is still alive and well at 84. i can't imagine the complete heartbreak of having to bury your child.
yes! i believe that was mentioned in her fresh air interview, or maybe i read it on /r/movies?
very bittersweet. it's probably going to end with in memory of carrie fisher.
i lost my grandpa this year and that's left me extra vulnerable. star wars is such a huge part of my life that this physically hurts.
in the eu she was a force user, idk if they are going to tie that in
don't think she died a "healthy older person", 60 is relatively close to middle age. it's unfortunate what drugs can do to your body long term
yeah i thought that shit about how she looked was stupid. she was fucking 60, what do you think she's supposed to look like? i think everyone had a skewed idea because most actresses get a bunch of work done and carrie didn't look like she had
i'm actually thinking they would have to shuffle around a whole lot of stuff for ix as well. for some reason i always thought that they would go the redemption route for kylo ren through leia and not luke or rey. either way, regardless of star wars, this is extremely sad. she was way too young.
again, aware they are done with filming, but she never got to see the final product of the film most likely, as i believe its still in post production.
gotta spend the five minutes they save on some shitty song no one heard of before the nominations came out.
ford had a nice scholastic answer, but i really liked all three of their remarks about technical parts they were glad not to say/play again.
it wasn't all bad, was it? no. some of it was pretty good.
reddit has an obsession with acronyms, to the point where it's almost annoying.
not to diminish fisher's death in this regard, but bowie knew he was going out and left us something on purpose. his last months were painful, and he still made his art priority. heart attacks don't allow for a whole lot of time and planning though. it was unfortunate coincidence fisher went out shortly after the force awakens. i think most of us would prefer she had enough time for her star to fade again some before the end.
yep. my pleasure. i did love to teach and honestly, a lot of what i do is really, really fascinating, but not widely taught or publicized except to radiologists themselves. a lot of clinicians (i.e. physicians who see patients in person for a living) don't even know what the hell it is we do or what we can do. so often i'll get calls from other doctors with a problem about a patient and my job as consultant is to help them pick the best type of exam to help answer their question.
=/ is my usual face i make when opening one of these too. they're just ugly and sad studies to read. i've read them on a lot of young folks too. most recent for me was a hanging attempt that ultimately proved successful, just not right away. the upshot is that those kids do make pretty good organs for someone else.
i think that's the key. carrie was unfortunate enough to be on a plane when it happened so her chances were reduced greatly. hopefully she went peacefully.
reading about it the other day, cardiac arrest actually sounded...well, not pleasant, but not the worst way to go....the heart just sort of stops beating, you pass the fuck out, and that's all she wrote. much better than a legitimately heart attack where you're awake, in extreme pain and scared out of your goddamned mind. that sounds terrifying.
i'm going to echo this and add to watch it even if you don't like musicals. i am really not a big fan of musicals in general, particularly the old showtune type such as sitr, but goddamn it's a great movie. i think what makes it so good is that the non-musical parts are really strong; the dialogue is witty and the plot in general is hilarious.
lots of people criticize the "space bikini" as sexist, but i see that as the point. jabba was a gangster and a pig (in more ways than one). of course, he would dress a female captive/slave like that. for her part, leia played along, biding her time until she could rise up and strangle jabba with the very chains he used to bind her. leia was the epitome of a strong woman.
the number i get quoted as a first aider (lifeguard and ski patrol) is 4 minutes until irreversible. this is why, despite the fact it usually never 'resuscitates' someone, cpr is very important as it aids bloodflow and oxygen absorption. so even if you can't resuscitate someone with cpr you can help by doing it until ems shows up with better tools like epinephrine or a defib.
they'll do that after the ending i'd imagine. don't make people sad right before a movie.
that would be tasteful, but confusing as to why she isn't present probably. i think the best bet would be writing her out, honestly. it's been said the newer films will focus less on the original people than even the force awakens did, anyway.
your comment made me realize how awful it would be if leia happens to have an actual death scene in ep8
when we lost my grandfather, and i was standing at his wake waiting to pay my respects and offer condolences to my grandmother, i felt like i shouldn't even be there. we were never very close and she seemed to dislike me when i was a kid. her first words "i was wondering when you'd come sit with me, skineechef." and we just sat, and *i* cried while she consoled me, surrounded by pictures of her recently deceased husband of 50+ years. i don't know why your comment *specifically* brought that memory to the front of my mind, but it felt cathartic to type it out. thank you for that
she basically said that she couldn't remember the star wars years because of her rampant drug use at the time.
i might be wrong but weren't both her parents apart of the hollywood elite? i imagine being exposed to that at a young age might lead one down the seedy side of the movie industry.
i read it years ago in an article but i think it's also her character's job in *letters from the edge*, her pseudo-memoir book/movie.
one of the lead ladies in the burbs with tom hanks
it's going to be so hard to watch it now knowing its her last film.
ep 8 finished filming over the summer, i recall reading somewhere she had a more involved role in this one.
she's already force sensitive in the original trilogy.
my mums 56 and looks like she might need a hip replacement. she can't walk without pain. 20 years of that does not seem like an exciting prospect. i think it really depends on your overall health by that time.
i intend to get inspired by this. i'm 37 and in the worst condition i've ever been. it has to get better.
she had the best comeback to this: "i googled myself recently and i came across this posting: 'whatever happened to carrie fisher? she used to be so hot. now she looks like elton john.' "well this did hurt my feelings, partly because i knew what this person meant. yes, it's all too true. i let myself go. and where did i go to? where all fat, jowly, middle-aged women go to - refrigerators and restaurants."
yeah, carrie didn't go around hiding the fact that she was a recovering addict. she didn't feel like getting a bunch of botox and surgery. with the right makeup and angles, she still looks hot as fuck if you ask me. just not hollywood hot. whatever dude.
to be fair, harrison ford is 14 years older. he looks pretty decent for a guy in his mid-70s.
kylo kills his mom too. he is irredeemable. he's going to make the empire great again.
after hearing about that whole affair thing, that scene is even better haha.
good point, i'd forgotten that. all i meant is that we can appreciate having seen her at the top again, if it helps.
this makes me sad, because i recently lost the woman i loved, a woman who was 36 with 3 kids, to a heroin overdose after some serious legal issues arose, left her terrified and simply wanting an escape. she was at a 'friend's house' who had heroin that she found and got into, relapsed after 6 years clean... had a xanax earlier around lunch, but sniffing the heroin put her to sleep. her friends found her od'd and dragged her into the bedroom, and left her there on her back, incoherent and unresponsive for 5 hours in the dark. autopsy found the rest of her body was perfectly in health. she bit off her tongue, however and clawed the side of her face open trying to breathe. my guess is that she would have died in panic, but can you tell me if suffixation like this would have been quick?
i had heard the plane she was on had some doctors and nurses on it; apparently she only got to hospital alive due to them.
my grandma used to eat bread fried in bacon grease when she was young during the depression. everyone was poor so you extracted every calorie out of your food, so you used the bread to mop up the bacon fat that we today throw out (or use a tiny bit to cook with). needless to say it clogs the arteries. surprisingly heart problems and has made it to 87 with no major health problems.
yeah, locked-in syndrome would absolutely suck and brain death would suck too but only as much as death.
this exactly. the story is actually really funny. there's a ton of musicals especially from the 1930s and 1940s that have amazing singing and dancing (pretty much all of the fred and ginger movies) but the stories are really weak. like i've seen every one of their movies and i honestly couldn't tell you the plots other than "guy meets girl, falls in love, girl rejects guy, guy woos girl with dancing and singing, girl falls for guy, they end up together." but everyone's performance in singin' is just fantastic.
yes, yes, yes! go find a still of leia 'reclining' in front of jabba in the bikini. does she look like she's cowering? scared at all? a slave? no, she exudes composure and confidence (due in part to trust in her friends she know are all around and have a plan). and then she strangles the fucker, with the chain that he/it tried to enslave her with.
conventions are sure to have at least 10+ slave leias.
i think he meant more like she passes away off screen and the cut footage is like a final message from her and to the crew/rebellion
hamill is a prolific user of hashtags. it's probably just default to him.
drinking is just as bad in different ways. i just don't want anyone to have the impression that it won't kill you by 60, because it will.
i believe she was referring to the star wars christmas special, not the entire original series.
her dad was singer, movie star, eddie fisher who left home to marry liz taylor
is most of it filmed or will it be similar to fast and furious 7 where it was cgi?
this just made that whole release very melancholic. this sucks so much. she was an icon.
i don't know, ep 9 is slated for 2019 i think, and paul walker in furious 7 wasn't considered too soon
now, we're gonna know how paul walker fans felt watching furious 7...
a couple hours after it happened, a friend texted me to say they were going to put leia in a vader suit.
her force sensitivity is in the original trilogy, so they can't really ignore that.
as someone who works at an old folks' home, that hip replacement makes all the difference in the world. i've seen numerous residents turn completely around in terms of health and demeanor after a hip replacement. walking, dancing and all.
as far as i know, she had quit drinking fairly recently so she was on the right track.
honestly... i wanted him to. i want a real awful bad guy. i don't want another forced redemption arc like with anakin/vader and luke.
oh man, i am so, so sorry. another victim to this horrendous epidemic. well, i can tell you that the initial stages of anoxia (lack of oxygen) are terrifying as you are programmed to panic. it takes a few minutes. but, the best solace i can give you is that it ends with sense of profound euphoria and gentle peace. in other words, there's no suffering. again, sorry for your loss.
not doctors or nurses, but apparently there was an emt on the plane that could perform cpr until they managed to land the aircraft.
think about it. a *64 year-old* movie that makes you laugh! it's a masterpiece, definitely one of my favorite movies of all time.
so awesome we can sort by #devastated and see people mourning about the death of dear friends alongside people's misspelled name on a starbucks cup.
i see people in their 30's dying from end stage liver disease related to alcohol abuse all the time. i see all types of drug abuse, but alcohol kills a lot of people, and it's a pretty brutal way to go.
once you hit 55 there really is no stopping. got to take the kieth richards diet.
i was just looking at eddie fisher's wiki and found this gem: "he wrote another autobiography in 1999... and added many new sexual details that were too strong to publish before. his daughter carrie declared, upon publication: "that's it. i'm having my dna fumigated.""
to be fair, gene kelly didn't really think anybody was as good and dancer as they should have been.
episode 8 finished filming in july, but we have no clue if she was going to be a big part of 9 which hasn't started filming yet.
f7 was actively in-production when walker died, and his un-filmed scenes were done with the blessing and involvement of his family - there's *plenty* of time to re-write ep 9.
thanks. still hard to believe she's gone. she was an amazing woman. i can only imagine how terrified she was to be driven to use heroin to escape whatever the legal issues she was facing. i knew some of them... but i believe she simply was human, panicked and overdosed because she lost her tolerance.
arrested for negligent manslaughter for not calling 911. first responders could have administered narcam. instead she died alone in a dark room while they made up a story
which a doctor replied to people saying there should be more doctors on planes by saying an emt is just as good if not better than a doctor in that situation. because doctors tend to need to use labs, get tests, have people to help them where emts are trained to dealing with emergencies with limited supplies and on the spot.
somewhere in a board room, people are deciding whether they should cgi her into episode 9.
luckily paul walker had a younger brother who was the perfect body double for the missing shots.
what you really want is a paramedic. source: am paramedic.
they might even have to re-edit or reshoot parts of episode 8 depending on how they set up her role. what if ep 8 ends with luke, leia, rey, and finn all together on the millennium falcon? or if she is set up to be a big factor at all? will they want to use a lot of heavy cgi to give her a prominent ep 9 role, or just re-write some ep 8 stuff so that she can make a cameo cgi appearance (or no appearance at all) in ep 9?
i made a comment on that yesterday to some friends. i think death at the hands of a negligent or faulty product are almost the worst because all you can blame is some faceless company. there's nowhere for that pain to go but it was something that was clearly, actually at fault unlike a disease or 'act of god'.
heath was such a good actor. every role he was in, he played amazing in.
i will agree. there are really good studies that show there are only three types of doctors that you want in these situations. 1. trauma/critical care 2. ed 3. the one that knows this information and backs off when ems arrives. the reason is that these are the only doctors that understand that clock is ticking and it is time to go to the ed. all other doctors slow down transit time. on a plan you would get bls at best. i mean let's be real tsa is not going to let me take 1/2 the supplies i need for in hospital arrests: epi, hco3, ca, mag, amio vials, an io kit (i can place a cvc in 1/2 the time it would take for a piv so no i am not placing a piv, so let's go with the io kit for space saving in the over head... either way tsa would never allow that drill), et tube, and a laryngoscope.. and then where do i even get an o2 tank and tubing to bag... oh yeah... and my ambu bag. but u/waltjrimmer is correct. statistically speaking you want an emt.
i'm really hoping that they give her a short part in 9 with cgi, as a way to close off her character properly, but they don't try for a full, major role or anything like that. assuming of course she was gonna be in 9 at all, which we don't know.
it was a success imo. i wasn't that huge a sw fan and didn't recognize him. i thought he was a real character throughout the entire movie. for leia, because i knew her, she felt fake.
true, i was on scene and we were all emts. handling it just fine and this doctor shows up and asked to help. i say fuck it because it wasn't an emergency and i was waiting for the ambulance to show up to get the patient anyways. the dudes starts the most detailed and technical patient assessment and was trying to swing his doctor dick all over the place to show how smart he is. definitely would not have wanted him anywhere near the scene if it was something urgent
personally i think that girl right behind her is like *i'd be mad if that sign weren't so fucking good*
"hey ref, does your wife know that you're fucking us?"
i still don't know whether to pronounce it norfolk or norfork, everyone here has different ideas
now make a sign depicting that. jokes don't have to be perfect, i think we all understood it's reference.
i'm from norfolk and just left the game. saw the title of this post and thought "holy shit could it be?". never thought my hometown would be on the front page of reddit.
a missed call is when a referee does not notice and call out a violation of the rules of the game, like a player getting shoved in basketball.
they probably don't get paid well enough. refs have literally been mobbed and executed by fans. it's really awful the way fans act over something that has zero bearing on the majority of people's lives.
was behind a couple of our signs wasn't too bad as they would only hold them up for like ten seconds... such as a brick we had whenever they missed a 3
the same way you afforded your eight track stereo system back in the day: student loans.
also the sign makes it look like the guy in the grey behind him has a huge head. it's a trifecta.
"although jumbotron is a registered trademark owned by the sony corporation, sony stopped manufacturing the devices under that name in 2001." -wikipedia
yea college basketball is the only sport i can think of that does this. other sports have signs but college basketball has players' faces, things that spin, etc.
no one cares really if you only put up the sign after a play and keep it up for ten seconds at most.
it's not just shitting on the fun, it's the shitting on anything when you can tell it comes from absolutely no experience in the situation.
student section = all ref actions not in your favor are wrong
or those that only hold up their signs during the few exciting moments.
seriously cheese dick? there was a missed call... from the ref. troll on...
yeah pretty nutty. i'm from lincoln. the odds of something from lincoln making it big on reddit are slim, let alone norfolk???
i think all major sports have more than 1 ref. football (real football, aka soccer for murricans) has like 5 or 6 refs
when i was a kid, i always wanted to be a referee. when i told my parents, they said it wouldn't be possible, because it's a handicap you're born with, and i wasn't born with it.
i wonder how annoying it was to be the guy sitting behind the giant head.
looks like the students from one team raided the other student section to hold up a sign. the neck beard fought back.
nah, their photos were *insanely* high-res. the image for the poster i printed out was about 71 mb, and they had no problems opening it. once i even printed out a picture of the eiffel tower that was, like, 40 megapixels. i don't even know how hs students had access to such high-end cameras, but whatever.
yea but they would have saw it then... f that noise...
or, you know, just being conscious of other people. whether it's unnecessary in this instance is up for debate.
typically students aren't waving these the whole time. it's sporadic for a couple minutes at a time, typically during breaks in play when people might actually pay attention to a sign like that. it's really not that bad.
lincolnite checking in. it's nice to see some nebraska pride here, i moved back here from kansas cuz i missed it.
no it doesn't? it has one ref, two linesman and a fourth who's main role is managing subs.
when i was a kid, when i was a little boy, i always wanted to be a referee. i wanted to be a basketball referee more than anything in the world. i wore striped shirts and i roamed the backyard, i officiated local pick up games, i blew my whistle and i gave techs. everybody knew me and was afraid of me. and one day my dad said, "bobby, you are 17. it's time to throw childish things aside," and i said, "okay, pop." but he didn't really say that, he said, "stop being a fucking referee and get a job."
someone needs to blow the whistle on these issues
as a tar heel fan, tyler hansbrough was better in college. however jj is doing his dam thing in the nba
that guy doesn't even have a neckbeard. ya'll are some dicks
ahhhhh okay haha. i shoot in 40mp occasionally at extremely high res and cant imagine the file being more than they can handle... they musta made it 20,000x50,000 haha. exaggerating but you get the point!
what the fuck? this is the stupidest rule i've ever heard of. talk about a ridiculous fucking assumption. it's actually two ridiculous assumptions - 1. nobody who owns copyright to a high res image would get it printed in their store. 2. everybody who prints a lower res image owns copyright for it. fucking weird.
not for people's faces. a camera will never produce vector graphics, unless it takes the pixel-based image and then guesses some vectors for it.
yea, bro, that's why neither of us put it in quotes.
yeah but they don't have to experience such inconvenient signs. only an occasional flare to the face.
saw the sign or their view blocked for a bit because of the sign? you're worried about them when you weirded out a girl for bringing a huge sign you probably put some time into and never put it up? priorities...
i hung out with a group of college soccer fans who would go to great lengths to learn the identity of the goalies and ref's. then when they were in the fan section of the team, heckles would be about his failed marriage, or terrible day job. ruthless
you don't even have to go that far. here in the united states we've had multiple soccer referees killed by players who punched them after getting carded. rip john bieniewicz of michigan and ricardo portillo of utah. both killed within the last 3 years or so.
soccer fans are certifiably insane. my sister wouldn't let me go to a match in argentina because peeing on the foreigners was the least of our worries
looked it up. he was stoned to death and his head was displayed on a spike midfield.
in many european leagues, there's actually 6 refs now. the 4 you listed, plus two more, one ref on each goalline
i saw the first 5 words, the length of the paragraph, and looked at the end for "1996" or "announcer's table".
damnit... got me. no matter how many times i remind myself to read the username.
25/hr makes it feel pretty good. also he said he was a ref not a linesman you dick!
any starter on the 08 jayhawks would like to have a word with you.
i'm confused as to what this comment is trying to say
that's because we can't see what's on the back of the sign. judging by the look of the blonde spiky haired guy the row behind, it must be confusing.
fing about arsenal is, they always try an' walk it in.
hell, argentines have rules against traveling fans because of fan violence.
yep. anything with a paragraph this size must be checked!
benchwarmers but rob schneider is every character.
i had to go through his overview to understand what was going on...now i do. truly...truly an amazing sight.
i was told it doesn't matter if you're black or white. of course a white woman with a weird nose told me this.
so *that's* why they only accept payment in the form of sacks of money with a big dollar sign on them.
that doesn't seem like it would be that different tbh
you mean, payment in the form of neatly bundled stacks of postage stamps...
yup. i work from home and spend a good portion of my shifts on reddit
"oil? who said anything about oil? bitch you cookin?"
seems like a great idea. although... didn't some president say that he was going to do that like eight years ago?
a lot of the kids loved us, probably because we threw them candy every day. they also stole shit. they also reported back to neerdowells. i always thought when i got there it'd be like that scene in indiana jones and the temple of doom with all the kids in the mine begging for help. what i saw a lot of was people doing normal family shit with their kids, picking them up from school or teaching them how to do things like bake for the fanily, etc. it amazed me, that despite all the recent events, kids would still run up to you asking for chocolate and run away with a big grin when you complied. they just bounce right back. then again, i patrolled some of the areas outside of the baghdad airport so maybe it was a nicer area or something. what was my point i forget?
please keep speaking your mind. i hate that people think they can speak for you.
i joined in '95. after 9/11 the majority coming in from boot camp had the initial drive from those attacks..after a year most had whispers of, " what are we doing here?" after awhile most connected the dots to oil, at least the ones that were not ideologically blind.
you missed a few of the main objectives. for dick cheney and co to make billions. for the neo-cons to be able to have a mythical good vs evil battle where the us white knights the world. to give the conservative government an excuse to enact austerity/spending cuts "for the war effort." to give excuse for enacting tighter surveillance. to test out psychological methods of population control.... all sorts of 'nice' reasons.
this is what the past week has had me thinking about. we have literally locked down our country from *seven entire countries* because we are too afraid of *any* of them entering. that fear is a textbook victory in the eyes of the terrorists.
wait... are you saying i *can't* substitute clever sophistry for thinking?? what am i supposed to doooo???
they kinda did in iraq though. idea was to topple saddam and install a democratic government that would be friendly towards the us.
you're witnessing an historic meltdown by reddit. one i'm not sure they'll ever be able to recover from.
obama froze new applications. trump is banning people with green cards. *totally the same thing*. /s
"man tried to kill my father, i don't play that shit"
yeah, one did. then, he discovered drones and went a little crazy.
because no one asked the pentagon what to do before /ss
thank a few more than just obama, we could probably start with bush.
some guy called him a fake marine and told him he deserved to come back in a box with a folded flag on top. what a fucking piece of shit keyboard warrior loser
it's amazing how they just carry on. a local terp i spoke to towards the end of the conflict told me he was worried because even though he could speak four languages and could probably get a job in a safe country he would not abandon afghanistan. i didn't get his name because it was just a chat over a smoke but i hope he's alright.
there's a documentary called "drone" on netflix done by npr which really explores this in depth, iirc it had footage of the kids talking about this. it really morphed my stance on the use of drones, to be entirely honest. i'm not totally anti-drone now, but i'm far more attentive to the issues that they create.
that is the one thing powerful elites and lawpushers don't have. if they are to be good at their job, they can't have empathy.
that's the thing though. we can't. that freedom is no longer ours when you serve. you serve your country and take your orders and hope the top brass have better sense than the ones passing down the orders
one of our iraqi intel guys still hasn't come over here like he was promised. i had asked a buddy of mine who was still in contact with him if he had heard from him, but he hadn't :/
this is a pretty common theme throughout history actually. some big motivating event that wears off eventually
and to keep a large standing military of veteran warfighters on hand in case shit goes down at home or you feel like starting some shit with another big boy country down the road.
i think that narrative was already pretty well created when we bombed and or invaded all of their countries...
it was the canadian, u.k. and french special forces along with the cia that overthrew gaddafi.
honestly, i think it was even simpler than that. bush just wanted to kill his dad's enemy.
i just spoke to hannity and he said he will be here as soon as he is water-boarded.
drones are a great way to fight terrorists and create new ones all at the same time without risking us lives. it's an interventionists wet dream, figuratively have cake and eat it too
so all along the secret plan was to ask existing leadership what to do? and would that make these the first experts whose expertise trump values?
you can go back to carter, maybe even before that.
i'm a liberal marine vet and i get that on twitter a lot, too. there's a lot of far right people on twitter that seem to think all "real" vets blindly support all wars and are rabid nationalists, so when they run into one that isn't they call you a fake.
those are the best people. it's a shame that the richest and brightest leave their country's to basically never have a chance of improving. this is my primary issue with the american/mexican border, the people that want a better life leave and the country stays exactly the same. it's a pressure relief valve for mexican politicians to not get overthrown. america may take in a tiny drop in the bucket for us from these countries but they are losing their best people that could enact changes to help everyone.
isn't the point of his anecdote that they still functioned like normal kids despite all the warfare on their own metaphorical front yards, not because of their nationality?
amazing and also kinda scary. remember the witch hunts and all that kinda crap.
when i was overseas we handed out cricket kits for kids. one day *we* were given something back as trade from the kids. it was course a small bag of nacho cheese doritos. made your heart melt.
i don't really understand why people don't like drones. it's still a human operator, and it could just as easily be a strike aircraft with a pilot sitting in it dropping bombs. the drones aren't machines which decide for themselves whether or not to kill specific humans. true enough a drone can circle an area for far longer than a conventional strike aircraft due to more efficient fuel expenditure, and no pilot to experience fatigue, but that just seems like a natural evolution of warfare. i'd love to have a different perspective on the matter if you're willing though.
don't forget about all the people that vote for those elites and lawpushers. their lack of empathy is the real problem as without them those elites wouldn't be in power.
that's not trump doom and gloom, that's all of reddit and much of social media in reaction to any issue. the sharp one-liner is often the thing most upvoted, most retweeted and most liked. it's also completely ineffectual, as is pretty much all commentary, including this comment i'm writing. in fact you could say it's even counter-productive because it provides a place for people to bitch and moan - a sort of release valve that takes off the pressure which would otherwise build to critical mass and action in enough numbers to effectuate change.
thank you! someone finally stands up for the ridiculousness that is salad at restaurants. my husband's idea of salad is iceberg lettuce and ranch dressing. that's it. yes, i've considered divorce.
fuck no. those bitches are fucking $7 in cali. it's fucked.
cheney and halliburton made bank didn't they? we didn't go for average citizens lol.
bingo. sadaam almost got george h.w. bush with a car bomb.
this. i hate that i am a part of this kind of thinking. someone says they belong to the other side, i instantly think they are stupid. i hate that i do it. it's become entrenched in american politics. if you're not for us, you're against us.
agreed. i remember so much of republicans complaining about obama and what obama is doing or isn't doing, and a lot of the democrat response was "well it was bush's fault" or "bush did this and worse!"
i feel like obama was pretty consistently criticized for his use of drones and other military action. maybe we were just reading different news sites? i know reddit has talked about it for the past 8 years quite a bit.
i completely agree. these things don't happen in a vacuum, and it's important to have context when viewing something. comparing trump's actions/decisions/etc. to his predecessors' is the only way to understand them fully.
not to be that guy but this situation entails no literal cake
nixon. fucking kissinger. if there is a hell, he deserves the worst part of it.
i see your excellent policy and raise you mine: ban americans from leaving or entering their homes. just in case they get radicalised or read something about climate change
i cried like a little bitch. i'm a 30 year old man.
you actually can. hold on a comment you want to save and you can
i wish this point was brought up more often. it's good for us if we get the cream if the crop, but other countries lose those assets.
yes, i believe that to be the point i just reiterated on that point because it feels good to say it.
"when a child gives you a gift, even if it is a rock they just picked up, exude gratitude. it may be the only thing they have to give, and they have chosen to give it to you" dean jackson
perhaps the problem is the emotional distance it creates. when you say "american drones killed x civilians", it softens the effect of what has actually happened: and american pilot bombed x civilians. i'm in favor of drones existing, but vehemently against the manner in which they have been used in practice. i tend to be left-leaning, but i loathe obama for his expansion of the drone program and the heavy civilian casualties it has produced. it's no less irresponsible than using a stick of dynamite to hammer in a nail. perhaps it can get the job done, but you've caused enough collateral damage as to nullify any benefit.
idk, i remember reading that drone pilots have the same rate of ptsd as other pilots and that they had to watch their targets for a lot longer to make sure they fit the criteria which also fucked with their heads.
ousted the leader of iran when i was born. and i'm fucking old!
i think history has shown that discontent is like an avalanche, picking up mass and power as it continue to slide. it starts out as small conversations then grows into large ones which spread among a populace like a virus, until people feel fully justified and angry. then it's hard for anyone to stand in the way of that collective anger, dismay, and outrage even if it is only expressed in words. i'll point to the frequency of these posts that put trump in a negative light appearing on the front page. it's no coincidence they gain so much steam. but ultimately a lot of us here are here to laugh, so you gotta sneak a joke in every once in a while.
actually certain subs cost a different prices. i was at subway the other day, blm footling still $5
tuna is tasty, too bad it's like 1000 calories for the foot long without any added condiments because they soak it in mayonnaise before making it
it was a promotional deal that lasted 6 years though...
which reagan? he was replaced with a body double after the successful assassination.
honest question since you seem relatively non-partisan and independent thinking - why do you still believe in bernie sanders post-primaries? from a probably opposite trending 3rd party voted, bernie sanders looks like a sell out and a stooge to me. is it really just "trump had to lose" that caused so many people that were "feeling the bern" to seemingly sell-out their principles? note: not saying you did or did not sell-out, i'm saying that's how it appears to someone who never believed in him from the start.
that's exactly what it is. it's a diversion tactic. it shifts the blame onto someone else with no real solution/constructive response.
pfft, what do you serve at your post-bombing parties then?
that'd be the "creating new" terrorists part. gotta have something to intervene in, after all!
much as i dislike trump, that actually *is* a good plan
people tend to look at obama and bush like they started all this... nah, nixon/kissinger are definitely further up the list than those other two could ever dream of being. you can find them just above reagan.
an easy "argument tactic" is to dismiss another's opinion due to lack of background. usually employed by a person who has no background whatsoever. "you're a celebrity. what do you know of politics?" used by people from all sides of the issue.
you know what irritates me about that? those types of people want lower healthcare costs because they're sick of "paying for everyone else." they fail to grasp the concept of disabled people, like those with severe birth defects or injury, that need those assistance programs. i got into an 'facebook arguement' with a guy that said a person with severe ms just needed to "get a better/other job" just so he could pay less for insurance. this sense of individualism/nationalism is just shamefully selfish. i dont mind paying a little bit more for health insurance, if it means a low-income cancer patient has a chance at treatment. i also dont mind paying for social programs like ebt (food stamps) ... if it means a low-income child gets a daily meal. are those programs abused? absolutely! however, removing the programs entirely is more disgusting than those few who abuse it.
it's why i never cared for patriotism, it's just a form of made up tribalism, an us vs. them mentality, that on the surface seems to be for uniting but really it was designed for dividing.
y u give me feels, i'm just about to go to work and here i am crying )': i volunteer to help kids on weekends.
those little bastards are playing the long game :-)
as a european the news of how drones are actually used in the real world don't really reach me, so i can only tackle the concept of drones, not the reality. at least not to a reasonable degree, so i won't comment on it. i think drones are good in the sense that any given military has the responsibility to keep their soldiers and personnel safe, while they have absolutely no responsibility outside of things like the geneva convention, to keep enemy soldiers safe. obviously drones can be shot down with no loss of a pilot, so i agree with the decision to make and develop them. killing civilians no matter the method, is an inherently arbitrary line of reasoning. killing a vip which could _potentially_ do great damage to your forces, at the cost of numerous civilian lives.. well, you can't label justice on it no matter how much you tried.
would it be plausible to reason that the lack of oversight would've occurred regardless of what weapon platform was used?
when i was on a plane during a long leg, over heard one of the crew over the hot-mic. likely not aware i was plugged in. a former drone pilot talking about something along those lines. you could certainly tell it messed with his head a bit. not something i really thought of prior, but it sounded like the guy was about to burst into tears as he talked about it.
that's kinda the point though, if people actually had to go out and fight the battle them selves, they would be less inclined to start the fight to begin with unless they thought it was something truly worth fighting for. this isn't a new concept, there's been many people over hundreds of years who have said things to the effect of "any ruling person who chooses to go to war should be forced them selves to fight to ensure the decision isn't made lightly.".
whatever, at least he didn't do all the shit that asshole taft did.
he said he wanted to bring them home because people like to hear that. then he said we should take their oil because, sadly, some people like to hear that as well. the problem with just saying whatever people want to hear is sometimes you are saying diametrically opposed things that could never coexist. and thus, you get trump.
hey, obama earned his after only being in office for less than two weeks. let's wait to see what these next few days hold.
i have very few good things to say about trump. but if he holds to the idea that "his plans" are to order people who know what's up to make plans. then at least it won't be a total train wreck. still a train wreck.
one could make the argument that it's all sargon of akkad's fault.
jfk authorized the 1963 coup in iraq, which led to the iraqi baath party gaining party, which led to saddam hussein taking power and which eventually led to where we are now.
i think it is too big to explain in reddit but let me share a kissinger quote or two: "it is an act of insanity and national humiliation to have a law prohibiting the president from ordering assassination." "i don't see why we need to stand by and watch a country go communist due to the irresponsibility of its people. the issues are much too important for the chilean voters to be left to decide for themselves."
i mean... i'd probably watch, in horror, and regret it, but i'd watch. i bet $10 he would not give the reach around.
well maybe those people shouldn't have been born with disabilities! /s
exactly, its not the bleeding heart liberal elite that's going to suffer from the aca repeal.
ah yes, vermicious knids. the carnivorous race of amorphous, shape-shifting aliens allegedly waiting in dark space. we have dismissed that claim.
one thing i realized growing up in the states and living in europe now is how fucking weird the gung-ho patriotism in the u.s. was
it's the perfect "soda machines in every classroom" example, the reason trump was elected is because he asserted he would do what he said when the majority of politicians say one thing and do another. what people fail to realize is there's a reason for that. i'm not saying it's the best way, but politicians say what the people want to hear so they get elected, but then do what will actually provide benefits (dependent on what their view is politically). there's a reason that not everyone is a politician, because what you want to hear isn't always what's best to do, and i feel we're going to be seeing the repercussions of that fairly soon.
and....what happened to that action? not that it's on you to answer that my friend, but what happened? if you know or have any idea.
as a brit, i feel some ancestral guilt as it was us that did the butcher's job on israel and palestine.
man if only suliman the magnificent helped protect the ottoman empire more, then we wouldn't be here.
me too.. oh god their memes made of fake "facts" are incredible
there was recently a bill in tennessee that wanted to remove "junk food" from the items that could be purchased with food stamps. it boggled my mind that somebody thought that needed to be a thing! their reasoning was to "combat obesity" but i dont think they ever stopped to think about the consequences of such a law. what? low income families dont deserve cookies because theyre poor? ... fine! let them buy a weeks worth of fruit for the price of some cookies. food stamps already limit the amount of non-processed food that these people can purchase, because of price. do they really need to feel more worthless and aloenated? (no!) i am sure, if given the option, low income people would fix fresh, healthy meals, but it is impossible on a food stamp budget for every meal to be healthy.
everyone will suffer. people forget to realize what else the aca did. with removing pre-existing conditions and being able to be on your parents health insurance until 26
we are now receiving reports that sadam hussain is in possession of vermicious knids
is still, unfortunately. mention that patriotism is just a phrase to encourage young people to join the military and kill people for oil is still bad form here. and you can't convince kids without jobs or money to go to college that the military isn't the place to turn to.
don't worry mother! your daughter murica is doing you proud!
ok absolutely fair point and you are the best kind of correct. i was kinda saying us humans have always been lookin ta kill other humans, for whatever reason we can come up with. she has straight hair. his teeth are too far apart. you know, totally valid reasons to wipe them and everyone like them off the face of the planet.
if only ugg the caveman hadn't hit blarga the cavewoman with his club...
let alone the time involved. most are single parent families or both parents work and after working all day, you aren't up to making a full meal every night.
no, they're in favor of the aca, it's obamacare they hate....... i hate people. republicans have lied about obamacare so long that the second people hear about it they immediately think it sucks, but when you go over the actual provisions or call it the aca they're all for it.
oh of course dear, i just do wish you'd ring more often. and your father and i are getting quite worried about your new boyfriend... if things don't work out dear, you'll always have a place with us.
oh yeah, i'm totally with you on humans pretty much always being violent twathammers. i just enjoy being pedantic :)
no way it works! in norway it does. no way! it's just 'cause they have oil and are communists. communism is evil! socialism is evil! solidarity is evil! working together for the common good is highly bad for the rich, and the rich must get richer! none of that. you are all alone. you don't matter. nobody does. only the rich matter. they gave you this land. you must serve them without question. i'm just channeling crazy.
i sometimes wear a hat. for example when i did college tours with my son i wanted the focus to be totally on him. a lot less people recognize me when i have a hat on or else they realize i am trying to be incognito. mostly when people do recognize me they are super nice so i don't feel it is a burden to be noticed most of the time.
i would explain that smartness is not single dimensional and not quite as important as i thought it was back then. i would say you might explore the developing world before you get into your forties. i wasn't very good socially back then but i am not sure there is advice that would fix that - maybe i had to be awkward and just grow up....
australia is particularly nice. it is summer there when it is winter here so going there in december and january is especially nice. i spent thanksgiving there last year. i have gotten to travel to a lot of great places like the amazon in brazil which i recommend.
the big milestone is when computers can read and understand information like humans do. there is a lot of work going on in this field - google, microsoft, facebook, academia,... right now computers don't know how to represent knowledge so they can't read a text book and pass a test. another whole area is vaccines. we need a vaccine for hiv, malaria and tb and i hope we have them in the next 10-15 years.
i would say education is the key problem. if you can solve that then it helps with a lot of things. maybe i didn't understand the question - maybe it supposed to be some idiosyncratic thing that bothers me....
a lot of people feel a sense of isolation. i still wonder if digital tools can help people find opportunities to get together with others - not tinder but more like adults who want to mentor kids or hang out with each other. it is great that kids go off and pursue opportunities but when you get communities where the economy is weak and a lot of young people have left then something should be done to help.
we need clean, reliable cheap energy - which we don't have. it is too bad the sun doesn't shine all the time and the wind doesn't blow all the time. the economist had a good piece on this this week. so we need some invention - perhaps miracle batteries or super safe nuclear or making sun into gasoline directly.
it is super important to improve our healthcare system - both to reduce chronic disease but if we don't do better health costs will squeeze out spending on all other government functions. i agree it is surprising how tough it has been to get digital medical records right and to learn from looking at those records. still there are some very promising things going on. for example the idea of looking at a blood sample to find cancer very early so it can be treated. we will be able to use genomic data to tune treatments. there are a few big problems like diabetes, obesity and neurological conditions including alzheimer's that we really need to solve.
overall like warren buffett i am optimistic about the long run. i am concerned in the short run that the huge benefits of how the us works with other countries may get lost. this includes the aid we give to africa to help countries there get out of the poverty trap.
i just went on a trip with my 17 year old son to see 6 colleges. he is a junior in high school and trying to figure out where he should go. trips like that have been a great way to spend time together. he reads even more about politics than i do so i let him pick books for me to read. melinda is very creative about helping me find chances to spend time with the kids. even just driving them to school is a great time to talk to them.
i'm responding to you so that i can be higher than the guy talking about bill gates exploiting people.
i know he's said in the past that he has no interest in being president, but we *desperately* need a science minded president. if we're going to start electing businessmen to the presidency again, i'd at least like one like bill gates, who is forward thinking, pragmatic, and best of all, compassionate. i'd be honored to vote for the man, personally.
not bill gates but... one of my professors told me the best way to answer this question. look through the job announcement and find something on it that you don't know how to do. when the interviewer asks you what your weakness is you can say "i've never worked with x program but i've worked with y program and am a fast learner" or something similar. that way they know you've read through the announcement and they're aware that you might not have the exact training they want, but you have something similar and can be easily trained how they want. it's a way to say something you're bad at but in a good way
i hope his administration will decide that funding r&d to invent the next generation of energy (clean, cheap, reliable) is a good deal for the us and for the world. climate change requires cooperation between countries over a period of decades but we don't have much time to waste.
i can't believe that actually works. we all made fun of marvel movies for using this as a disguise but here we are.
wow, it's like we're the same person with just 60 billion small differences.
in that case my life is an abject failure. thanks for telling it like it is, mr. gates!
you're going to have to change the culture i think. right now people think of politics like a football team and that is dangerous.
aussie here. you seem like a nice bloke always room on the couch for you mate.
silly mr. gates, in 15 years voice recognition will (finally) be good enough that you won't have to type. -me, 15 years ago, probably.
i agree us human beings should help our computer friends achieve cognition and higher intelligence so they can help us live better lives. hopefully one day our robotic friends will be fully equipped with the knowledge and equipment they need to change the world once and for all
bill gates is so first world that his first world problem is not being able to come up with a first world problem.
i still do this and i'm in med school. long hours of war have inspired me to fix the people war kills
it's pretty sad that in an age of technology and communications such as ours that one of our biggest and growing issues is the disconnect we have with each other.
bill gates reads the economist too. i feel so smart now. lol
#stooljumpingchallenge to raise money for people with colorectal cancer, anyone?
richest man, but the best man. thanks a lot for your efforts in solving problems in the world one at a time!
because it'd be making a political statement more or less
did steve shout at you over the phone as was portrayed in 'jobs'?
"well, steve, i think there's more than one way of looking at it. i think it's more like we both had this rich neighbor named xerox and i broke into his house to steal the tv set and found out that you had already stolen it."
reminds me of when /u/neiltyson explained that in order to justify bill gates stopping to pick up money on the street, it would need to be at least $45,000. otherwise, it's not worth his time.
so after a couple of years in college. what will you say if he wants to drop out to pursue some crazy dream of starting his own company?
indeed, i hope that he is able to sift through the comments section to see this. it could change millions of lives, and that is what his foundation is all about.
bill gates loves steam confirmed. still a pc person.
interestingly bill gates was despised through the 90's for what many considered his monopoly on os's. reddit in the 90's would not have been very kind to bill gates.
former human resources here. there's a great book that explains all types of interview questions, what the employer is usually looking for in answers and how to answer base don your unique experience. it's called knock 'em dead, and is printed new every year with updates including navigating new situations brought about by technology etc. that said, if you don't want to read a book, boguskudos' answer above is a good way to answer that question.
silicon valley! i love that! it has inspired me to consider pursuing a career in developing! can you give me some tips?
everyone notices it's superman, but they're too polite to point it out.
keep in mind the closest people to you is yourself.
you mean obama and biden are gates-buffet level bros?
i am so happy you made this analogy. i can't count the number of times i begged my acquaintances to stop treating the election like it was the super bowl.
i think, if we really want to promote critical thinking, we need to teach it divorced from present real world politics. because it's *always* been partisan bs in my experience.
1. people are idiots. 2. they don't even know how stupid they are since the gates' have already pledged to donate their entire fortune to charity when they pass. i believe their children will get a very modest inheritance (very modest by billionaire standards) and the rest goes to the foundation to improve the lives of people for years to come. bill gates and warren buffet are the carnegie's of this generation. buffet has already given over 30 billion dollars to charity, and gates will give that much or more by the time he's 'done'. amazing people.
i had a friend whose goats they used to clear the brush on their property were stolen. i couldn't figure out if that was a first or third world problem.
by mentioning half-life 3 you have delayed it by 1 month. half-life 3 is now estimated for release in mar 2069. ___ i am a bot, this action was performed automatically. to disable wihl3 on your sub please see /r/whenishl3. to never have wihl3 reply to your comments pm '!stop'.
actually no i still have the game and play it occasionally though most of my time is spent on games like ckii, civ v/vi, and eu4
yep, i've been waiting for aoeiv ever since the infamous instruction manual pic...
tbf i connect with a lot of people (especially here), but i just don't know who y'all are.
i can see this going very poorly. stools are not very stable, and many people are terrible at jumping. broken legs/arms/collarbones....
anyone who is still seriously trash talking in their 60s needs to grow up.
whilst it offers an interesting perspective, those kinds of calculations assume that bill gates stopping to pick up money somehow makes his corporate earnings drop by 45k. the truth is that his constant attention isn't necessary for microsoft to continue generating profits.
"here's a small loan of a million dollars..." actually i would love for that to be the case.
i know what it is: why are pcs like air conditioners? they stop working properly if you open windows!
he did work at microsoft before founding valve...
i mean yeah that's the beauty of the human condition-- we can improve.
wow. so instead of communicating like normal people, we need a doublespeak manual to pass a job interview now.
i've always found it wise not to insult the intelligence of a man with eyes that can destroy you with a single look.
lol yeah who wants to be in bed with bill gates with a bunch of guys hahaha that would be super silly. lol tho if this actually is happening let me know just cause of how silly it would be lol
this may have been the greatest thing i have read in some time. not sure why, it just really spoke to me. thanks man.
maybe teach it for foreign historical politics? i.e if you're in the us, no way you're gonna manage to implement a non-biased history class on 20th century world politics or us history, but it might be easier if it's learning about some feudal kingdoms or classical empires (lots of juicy political drama in the greek and roman political histories). you wouldn't expect some kid/teacher to have a prior bias on whether vercingetorix was right in his rebellion or not. also yeah of course if you try and do it with present politics, it's not going to work.
i mean, i rarely ever get them on the first try. maybe i'm just brute forcing them.
i remember when i was growing up, bill gates was the villain. times sure have changed.
oh yeah. iv, v, vi. there was rise of nations though.
in my subjective experience, i have more nostalgia for aoe2 as that's what i played when i was a kid, and aoe3 introduces fairly fundamental differences in game mechanics to the previous two iterations. i enjoy aoe3 in and of itself, but it doesn't feel like aoe2 or the original aoe.
just a reminder that neither bill gates, or elon musk, or whoever isn't a god. we shouldn't blindly agree with everything someone says, even if 90% of the time they're correct.
it's interesting that we have videos that can play on thousands of different devices using hundreds of different video players, but medical records have yet to be standardized in any way.
especially if you've basically 'won' at the game of life with regards to wealth.
i believe the calculations actually show that the 45k is roughly equivalent to your average person stopping to pick up a penny and that's why it isn't worth his time. an average persons earnings won't be reduced by a penny to pick up a penny but it's still probably not worth the time and effort.
i'm sure bill's kid would do many great things with that small loan.
"let me get this straight, you think that your client, one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in the world, is secretly a vigilante, who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands, and your plan is to blackmail this person? ....good luck."
lol, yeah, if anyone has a place and time send it to me so i know in what direction and when to laugh lol.
until they came out with that captcha that is just a check mark. i tend to get it most of the time now
the whole hero worship of steve jobs and shitting on bill gates thing has never made any sense to me. people are weird.
then there's uneducated slobs like myself who have never played aoe2 and skipped straight from aoe to aoe3 so aoe2 just doesn't do much for me.
the problem is money. not that the emr companies don't make enough of it, but there is no financial incentive to make it "better". most of the "enterprise" and "medical" grade software is this way.
dark souls is a pretty shitty console port on windows, requiring third-party mods to even properly work in a lot of cases. seeing that mess run through another layer of fuckery on a mac would be glorious.
he has said in the past he would bend down for a 20 though so he can donate it to his foundation.
lucius fox. i loved morgan freeman's fox. come to think of it, i generally love morgan freeman.
this is totally silly. i'm happily married so this doesn't apply to me, but please pm me the exact address and time when this is happening.
steve was the hipster who came to class and talked back to the teacher, and ran for class president. bill was the nerd in the back of the room playing with his graphing calculator.
there's also no money in standardizing. if the formats are different, the vendors can sell you adapters.
fellow professional anarchist? you made a good career choice son. mr. soros' employees are well respected.
correct me if i'm wrong but hitler and the nazis viewed german women as incredibly important because they would raise the new generation of germans who would rule over the lower races. i recall that they were giving lots of medals and praise but i'm not sure about how their civil rights changed edit to quote my textbook "nazi ideology promoted strictly defined gender roles for men and women, and the state implemented a variety of social programs to encourage "racially correct" women to say home and raise "aryan" children" (a history of western society by mckay)
yeah i was gonna say i went to the holocaust museum two weeks ago i don't remember seeing this. i didn't check out the gift shop though.
"honey, i think we have hitler." "damnit phil, i told you to stop googling fascism." "oh man, there's a guy here mentioning small hands. we definitely have hitler."
because fascism is a loosely defined political concept, and a meaningful discussion would be quite involved. not really something you can do on reddit.
nah man, haven't you heard? trump has literally become hitler and instituted facism in only 10 days.
there's a difference between the church and religion, i'd say. while hitler cracked down on the apparatuses of organized religion (the catholic and lutheran church), he manipulated the concept of religion so that it fit nicely into the narrative of national socialism. hell, every german solider wore a belt with "god is with us", it's just that god was now a pillar of the state.
i mean he did improve the nsa and cnn was biased toward hilary so they got obsession with national security and controlled mass media down.
there are dozens of us! see you all in a few weeks when hopefully this sub isn't a virtue signalling shithole.
that moment when the top 20 pictures are all anti trump and 19 are absolutely retarded
i am maybe a bit older, but i remember reagan, bush, clinton, bush, and obama all being compared to hitler in some form or another. it is more prevalent from the left, but the right gets into the act as well from time to time. there are three problems that i have with it though. first, our constitution is greater than any one man. second, it cheapens the mass murder of millions of people and the rape and torture of untold others into an ignorant political attack. finally, it does nothing to further the dialogue and change the views of others. it only pushes both sides to the edges and the middle ends up either disengaging or picking an extreme.
"the fascists of the future will be called the anti-fascists." - winston churchill
i also noticed it. *"yup, this sound exactly like islamic countries."*
yes, they were viewed as really important baby making machines.
i went probably 15 years ago, and i still remember feeling horrible when i left. i think every citizen should visit all of the national museums at least once, but that one in particular. do they still give you a person to follow throughout the museum? when i went, they gave us a little card and every so often there was an atm like machine where you enter your card and it prints out what was going on with that person during the time frame being covered in the museum. i got a female child as my person and she died in the death camps.
telling people to stop googling fascism is a symptom of fascism
one of the significant drawbacks to reddit unfortunately.
it's a fucking joke. i don't remember anything like this happening when obama won. but here we are.
absolutely, the nazi's bizarre fabrication of science wasn't driven by some pursuit of truth, it was to confirm racial prejudices. it was an appropriation of the scientific process to make their beliefs seem 'rational.' a lot of these prejudices stem from superstitious and arcane beliefs being spread at the time. mainly mythological racial theory where germans descended from giants and jews from lesser troll people. the nazi party sewed in many religious and spiritual beliefs in their grand view of the world, from both christianity and germanic pagan folklore.
yeah now it's time to make the mans jobe to be a child birther!
no, it wasn't a great time for america. but even in that dark moment no serious academic group was labeling the us as a fascist state.
seriously, the list is fucking vague you could apply it to all sides. "supremacy of the military"? "controlled mass media"? "corporate power protected"? ugh.
a lot of trump supporters voted for obama. and trust me they think the tea party and the left today are both morons.
that last sentence though is so true, it's exhausting.
true, but women got the vote as part of the weimar republic established in 1918, and enshrined in their constitution the following year. it was one of the most progressive governments of its time. nazi germany tried to limit women in government and party positions, but didn't revoke this right. women's suffrage was passed in the us in 1920.
someone mentioned this probably just meant welfare. am i terrible that i read this and immediately thought of like an mlm scheme where if i could just produce like one more baby i'd earn a television or something? welfare, meh. television? we could have another little nazi baby.
the thing is, playing games like aoe or europa, you're getting a glimpse into how world leaders think (probably). that's why i cant help but scoff whenever someone says "president / leader (insert name) cares about us", it's just so unbelievably laughable, in my opinion.
these women, they had these rights. it was unbelieveable what they were doing with these rights.
i thought i was reading the words of a crazy person or a retard, and then it dawned on me...
in relation to the men, who were viewed as really important dying machines, i'm not sure that's worse.
when i was in high school, a mentally unstable coworker at walmart came up to me out of the blue and told me i had good birthing hips. he meant it as a complete compliment. i just smiled and thanked him. then i proceeded to agonize over the size of my hips up until this very moment when i shared this story on reddit. and just fyi, i have now had two babies and both had huge heads. i managed to get them out... but i'm not sure what part my hips played in that achievement.
i went to the one in dc and we were given passports of someone involved in the holocaust. men had male characters and women had female characters there wasn't any atms but it had the story of the person involved on the passport. mine was a german immigrant who hide jews from the nazis. i didn't feel horrible or sad i just felt sort of dissociated afterwards. the room with all those shoes man...
even worse is attempting such conversations on facebook.
many of my friends had such high praise for fidel castro when he died and are now calling trump a fascist dictator. some people are terrible at being objective.
well a warning against fascism certainly is relevant to nazi germany which is why it's there. just so happens that the warning itself isn't exclusive to one regime.
einstein's theories were dismissed in nazi germany as "jew physics"
the spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.
well, if they did they'd have been dragged in front of the committee on un-american activities.
you're right, but let's stop calling it fascism, since that means something else.
the moral of the story from the original greek is '"this shows how liars are rewarded: even if they tell the truth, no one believes them"' only the boy gets eaten. that's why it's a cautionary tale about lying.
"now" as in since trump's election or "now" as in since 1965?
there was! there was a mother's cross which was awarded to mothers who had borne a certain amount of children, with tiers starting from bronze with 4-5 children to silver with 6-7 and gold with 8 or more children. iirc recipients would also have earned the right to be saluted by hitler youth.
i know, i'd never thought about it that way until just now and it's terrifying.
and trust me, i know rights, these were the best. anyone will tell you that.
"you guys have the best reichs" ftfy edit spelling
...and then you join the two views and realize that a woman's role was to make either more baby-making machines, or dying machines. what a fucking dehumanizing vision
hips are just important for giving birth. can't explain it because i'm not entirely sure why but they are important.
have you ever been to gatwick airport? you literally need to leave the u.k. via the gift shop.
me too! there were 4 of us in the group and none of them made it out.
well there's your problem. you started with facebook instead of 4chan
i would urge you to be more specific than simply saying left/right (which itself is an oversimplification that obscures the different embodiments and liberal and conservative philosophy/ideology), and maybe include specific examples related to the above bullet points to better further discussion. for example, i have no idea what time era or country/nation you might be referring to. but i think the short answer to your question is yes, fascism is less a range on the political/ideological spectrum than it is a certain *style* of politics. it's certainly true that fascism isn't solely wedded to conservatism (think stalin's *diamat*). but it does tend to spring from or adopt reactionary elements (traditionalism, rejection of diversity, xenophobia, militarism).
fascism and castro's socialism are two very different concepts. both authoritarian, yes, but fascism is not *just* authoritarianism
we used to have entire subreddits without constant political yammering. now even the most mundane media fan subreddit or programming subreddit is constant political noise.
exactly. part of the purpose of the holocaust museum is to raise awareness that such atrocities did and still do happen.
which was literally the point of the story. it wasn't "this kid lied but was right at the end, so believe kids every time just in case"
not really, because people are often bringing it up to argue that trump is another case of crying wolf..
that's actually a good question, who *was* the go to bad boy for internet slap fights before hitler? "you're worse than genghis khan" just lacks the pop.
that was it. i wanted to mention something about a cross but my memory on this stuff is like 4 years old now so wasn't entirely confident.
yeah, i mean i like to tax the shit outta my people on total war simply because i wanna buy them weapons and armor to kill more people. fuckin slaughter the population, enslave the survivors, destroy their culture and independence, absorb them into the ranks, and keep on trucking.
kinda just nature in general though.. reproduce to die out in the wild..
it was when women were regulary dying of childbirth that really mattered.
a bit too far to the right gets you brexit, a bit further gets you trump, you'd have to go pretty far right for the third reich.
i was ready for seeing all that. the part that broke me at auschwitz was hearing that some of the people there payed for their own ticket
ever since 4chan and facebook came this place has looked more and more like a youtube comment section.
woah, it's like...if i oversimplify any point, *it's just like any* ***other*** *point!!!!* hopefully politicians never realize this, or media outlets with a desire to sway popular opinion...
neither was castro's socialism. i'm sure the hundreds of homosexuals he threw into slave-labor internment camps would be able to explain that quite well to you; that is, if most of them weren't dead.
i'm also moderate and left leaning, but went the opposite way. i'm completely sick of the left crying wolf and picking god awful petty fights with trump when they should be focusing on the important issues. the extreme pettiness just obscures the important issues at hand.
being neutral makes you an enemy of both their ideas. i'd rather have multiple perspectives than just be stuck obsessing over just one. sad life to live when there's so much out there.
if we're going to argue semantics here, in the original version, only the sheep are eaten. it wasn't until later english versions that the boy was eaten. while the overall moral is the same, the "punishment" is a tad different.
you're whole realization was the conclusion that i came to after studying history in undergrad, concentrating in war and empire. this is the chief reason---unrelated people giving their lives in support of the efforts of people who will never see the battlefield---i'm very anti-war. it's sickening to to realize that the people who fight the war always get the least from the war effort and disgusting to see a poor family sending off their only child to a war effort started by a figure too myopic to see the anguish they are directly causing their people by instigating a war or even care for that matter.
4chan says the same thing about redditors going there. it's like, the more popular a forum gets, the more cancerous it becomes. who'da thought?
right, and i'm not defending castro here, i'm just saying it was a very different authoritarian flavor than say mussolini. there were still some cultural repressions similar to fascist ideology, but in so many other ways didn't involve the same ideals
well i'm just high, so ha! but for real, can someone explain to me how you can unironically scream bigot at someone you disagree with and refuse to listen to?
to be fair, both sides love to roll out the petty arguments. just look at all the back and forth over the inauguration crowd numbers.
which further illustrates that the moral is the point and everything else is irrelevant. it doesn't matter what the punishment is, the point is if you keep lying eventually no one will believe you. the point is not that if you keep lying about the wolf the wolf will eventually get you.
who wouldn't choose to be the gorilla with a million bananas? that sounds like the perfect description of absolute happiness to me.
meh, everything is expensive as shit, duty free my ass
yeah this has been puzzling me so much lately, people screaming bigot at other people without the slightest hint of exactly just how ironic the whole thing is
definitely true! i guess it's because i'm more often exposed to the left than to the right these days.
personally i'm sick of all the ridiculous and petty name calling towards trump (orange this, cheeto that). i swear people have some incredibly valid points they post on here that they ruin by capping it off with some childish name calling, it makes them sound like a little shit and then pushes people away like myself.
"nah, i'm just gonna stay home with my monkey...." -dave chappelle
there was a string i saw earlier today in a post about how bad the immigration thing is and how exclusion is the worst. the thread started with preaching inclusion and saying trump was hitler, and then devolved into calling for finding ways to close off conversations to trump supporters by excluding them from certain forums. can you spell irony?
you can buy the kosher meal for about 9 shrutebucks. it's just peeled bananas in cling wrap
yeah, and we haven't had the same crop yields for some time. i think it's time for another sacrifice.
i have a friend who is 6'9" but really gangly looking and pretty uncoordinated. his favorite response to "wow, you're tall! do you play basketball?" is "wow, you're short! do you play miniature golf?"
as a tall person who often goes to shows and who likes to stand in the crowd, i often feel like the people behind me probably hate me so thank you for confirming that
how fast does your chair go? can you do wheelies? have you ever played wheelchair basketball? it's kind of great when you have to stand in line isn't it? you are such an inspiration.
after a while you become numb to it. it's like automatically saying good whenever someone asks you how your day is. i'm just programmed to say 6'9 and shuffle off before i deal with anything more.
i'm not tall - 180cm, but my wife is all of about 5' nothing. if i want to fuck with her i just put things on the higher shelves out of her reach!
whenever anyone said "wow, you're tall" to my dad who's 6'8, he'd reply "wow, you're ugly". tall is his trigger word...
the bottom of the pringles can is nothing but crumbs.
headphones used to work for me. half the time i wasn't even playing music or listening to anything. just having them on is a signal to leave you alone. oh, and it's better to have the big blocky headphones so it's a bigger hassle to take them off. people might not see the ear buds.
it's so that when things go downhill and stuff isn't going well, there's only one variable to update. :)
haha im so using that even tough im 6'6 and play basketball.
you're also the only people on the planet who understand stone as a weight measure.
i once memorized that 6'6'' is pretty much 2m and just guess from there. 6'10''? ah, gonna be somewhere from 2.05 to 2.20, good enough
i always get a roomy cone of space behind me. that happen to you too?
open your mouth, stick out your tongue, and invite people toward you. they'll go the other way.
should have bumped the iphone into the wall... on the opposite side of the room.
how would height make sense for handicap parking..
nah you've probably seen a different picture of the same card. it's a template and people just use it and change the height on it, and variations of it get posted ad nauseum both on here and on /r/tall
you like sac food? i mean it's better than anything else there but it's still ass. i can't eat chicken tenders anymore because of 2 years of eating nothing but cold sysco chicken tenders.
the speaker on the wall is an immediate giveaway, not joking. plus the coloring of the wood.
it perfectly demonstrates the vanity and "me me me" vibe that i get every time someone gets 1000+ upvotes and edits their comments
why do you need to place things on the shelf to fuck her?
i heard fuck dallas on the wind and was summoned here.
and what would the benefit of "faking" to be colourblind be in the first place? i mean, it's not like you get a "handicapped parking spot" or something.
my other thing with that is that i also need glasses to see things far away, so i'd have to either wear two pairs all the time or be constantly switching them out. if i saw a 3d movie i'd have to wear all 3!
then the card's card would need its own card to explain how it was able to print a card so small.
but then you have assholes pulling your headphones/earbuds off/out and you eventually get convicted for murder.
programmers have it worse, you can be talking to a rubber duck and still be fucked if someone interrupts you.
but i think that's the point, it's not actually really "sleeping" if they're still half awake doing stuff.
haha im so using that even tough im 5'8 and play miniature golf.
exactly! i can tell you my weight to the lb and my height to the inch but i measure every other length in metres/cms, volumes in mls/litres and other weights in grams/kgs. it's confusing as hell sometimes
short guy here. i find that a good, fiber-rich mexican meal before a concert has a similar effect.
6'6" person here (no afro). i always try to get to movies a little early. i never sit in front of anyone first. if you then sit behind me, it's on you. if the show is sold out and it's the last seat, well, i tried my best.
but if everyone asked, the tall person would eventually be outside.
tall people and totems, helping friends find friends after bathroom breaks and water refills.
it's not and it doesn't. at least not in most states. 4' 10", i believe, is the cutoff for dwarfism (correct me if i'm wrong), and dwarfism can cause problems that would qualify someone as a disabled driver (having trouble waking 50 feet or using an assistive device, like crutches or a scooter). but you don't just automaticall get a handicap parking sticker. there's a process and requires a doctor to certify that the individual has a *need* for disability parking, either short term or long term. i don't remember all of the qualifying reasons off the top of my head, but they're stuff you would expect - difficulty walking, needing a walker or cane, breathing problems/portable oxygen, heart problems, vision problems, etc.
it's exactly that. i've seen this card a bazillion times now.
but why do all their cards say vp? you know, i should really read the book.
well i mean... deformed guy stalks an actress and then kidnaps her and keeps her in a basement.
i heard "fuck dallas".....i'm here for the meeting.
fun fact: the green light wasn't seeded with blue 15 years ago. at least not in canada.
yes i am a card for ants. yes i know i should be, like, three times bigger than this.
i think the judge will understand and let him off with parole.
i am friends with three whole gays. this happens all the time.
i'm 4'11", just the perfect height to get elbowed in the face by people who need to be front row and right below everybody's very full drinks. i know that people are going out to have some fun and listen to music with their friends. i also know that, if i don't like large crowds, i should really just stay home. but i really wish that people wouldn't dance while holding drinks! at least drink half of it before going ape shit, please!
i'm on reddit way too much because i clicked the handful of links above this one expecting to see this gif every time until i got here.
i will make the same noise as i too relive your embarrassment. years from now. btw, that image needs more jpeg. ;)
there are many vice presidents in a company. evp's, svp, etc...
yeah, it seems all fluffy and romantic but you listen to it and you realize he's a pervert who wants to lure christine down into uncle phantoms naked puzzle basement for some music of the nighting. cept it works for a while.
i'm 6'7", and i get sent links to various versions of this business card almost as often as i get comments about my height
definitely in the top 7 "please do not do this at a stop light." situations.
so, do you deliver your own mail? or do you have your own mailperson? but then, who delivers his mail? is there a never-ending chain of mailmen delivering mail to other mailmen? well, i guess a p.o. box could, in theory, break the chain.
unless the judge is wearing headphones during the trial.
anytime i see someone today use the term "the gays", my automatic expectation is that it's tongue-in-cheek
i'm 6'4. if we're at a show and i'm in front of you. tap me on the shoulder and we can switch. i don't give a shit. i'm 6'4, i'm literally god.
i know you probably get this all the time, but is your penis as big as your leg?
i thought not, it's not a story the jedi would tell you..
i do my part and downvote any post-karma edit i see. nobody upvoted you for you stupid edit.
actually, wall street and banking are infamous for passing out vp titles that are almost meaningless. their vps aren't like vps in a regular industry where that is literally one or two steps from president or a c-level position. in 2012 goldman sachs had 12,000 vps, 40% of the entire company. that is why their cards all say vp, it is another statement on how meaningless it all is.
and by intense he means there are horrific scenes of gore and depravity that the movie doesn't even come close to depicting.
i'm 5'2" and nobody ever gives me business cards about my awesome tallness ='[
but wouldn't that just mean that the mailman has to go to the p.o. box, then drive back to his home, thus meaning he delivers his own mail?
high school sophomores are not actual people. i'm wondering if normal adults do that.
but then you get repeatedly shunted all the way to the back through height osmosis
no matter how much you try, you will always be adorable.
somewhere out there, there is a 4'9" tall woman thinking to her self "look at this uppity bitch. she just had to add the .5" on there."
well i've definitely not had that variation of the question before. let's just say that my form of dwarfism doesn't affect my party zone. so yes, yes it is.
i disagree. i think american psycho is much more of a dark humor film than anything else. there are some seriously hilarious scenes in it. now if you'll excuse me, i have to return some video tapes.
the worst ones are when they ruin perfectly good jokes.
really? i don't edit and get shit on. edit for clarity, shit on. edited for additional information? shit on. seems i'm just easily shit on.
i was trying to be tactful about it, but yeah, you're not even doing it justice. it's beyond depraved.
im 5'1" and im a 20 y/o male... this is depressing
it's always nice when it wraps up before a bunch of buffoons come in and try to un-joke everybody to death with stupid attempts at "memes" like the one where they just keep repeating the same comment but with the words in a different order than the original. oh boy is that one a real knee slapper. in before someone super funny does that.
fair enough lmao, although i've heard of adults doing it too.
depends on how you're living but yeah that's cool
unless you gouge your eyes out, leave the dried blood, vomit on your shirt, start walking around like a crab while spraying diarrhea everywhere while making guttural noises.
when you're short that extra half inch is everything! source: im 5'1.5"
either your legs are shorter than i'm thinking, or your partyzone(gigity) is 12"+
5' on the button here. no business cards here either. can we get a 4'11" person to reply to continue the chain?
its only really fun when you hit someone in the back line. right in the face.
i have a co worker which is 4' 11". his favorite zinger is "yeah i'm four-foot-eleven, but i'm four foot (points up) eleven (points outward implying he has an eleven inch penis)" fucker gets me every time.
fortunately my feet does reach the floor!... at least most of the time :') i'm actually happily attached for 2 years now and my so is 5'2" haha! the problem is that i look really young and many mistaken me to be a middle schooler when i'm almost graduating high school already :-(
oh well, just putting the phrase 'i don't date fat chicks' will eliminate most of those profiles anyway.
but we can still find clothes at normal stores, fit semi-comfortably in most airline seats, and fit in sports cars!
"it's slow, and unpredictable, but 100% effective sir..." "alright gentleman, you get the greenlight. project reaper is a go"
gorbachev recently started to say a lot of things like us betrayed pact made during the twilight of ussr etc.
it will be interesting to see what the country rallies behind as a figure head.
like narcos but a castro version. they should make an anthology series about the most powerful/influential/controversial people in human history.
you and the redditor who killed harper lee should team up and use your powers to fight crime.
2016 succeeds where the cia failed so many times (assuming this year wasn't some elaborate cia conspiracy).
valhalla is probably too big of a map for a 1v1. they should do it on smaller map like guardian or the pit.
in 1961 the cia developed a highpowered weapon that uses radiation to modify the cell structure of its target. the result is an escruciating death, over the course of decades your organs fail, your mind deteriorates, your body is sapped of energy. truly it is a terrible weapon. the cia called it 'cronos'
miami gonna act like they won the super bowl, nba championship and jeopardy combined
he was 90, so my money is on a parachute failure while base jumping.
yep. now who's left? kirk douglas and jimmy carter come to mind. apparently john glenn, chuck yeager and freeman dyson are still around too.
heart attack maybe? sure as shit wont be starvation
not a chance. she has only outlived one prince this year, there are many more to go. pure british spite keeps that woman alive, and that is an infinite resource.
a massive historical figure just died so yeah it's a huge story
maybe the writer had bush in the office deadpool? gotta think it to win it
color wouldn't be useful depending on the way you're editing. i tend to do lots of asterisks.
some former ussr leaders and russian leaders say that washington promised to not expand nato eastwards, yet they did. as far as i know there is not a single official paper nor agreement about that. maybe reagan said something behind closed doors to gorbachev? well, russians could've forced them to write it on paper, now they can't complain.
as a young child when the cuban missile crisis was happening, and i was too young to understand, fidel castro has always been in the picture. yes, this is a profound moment for cuba.
i'm actually starting to seriously consider 2016 *was* the cia conspiracy.
it's really hard to kill a head of state that knows people are trying to kill him.
the funny thing is i made it after hearing he was in poor health and figured i wouldn't have to wait long. didn't expect him to make it to 90 but i'm not at all surprised he didn't survive 2016.
are you serious? i live in miami, where should i go to see this?
it's happening now hombre, hit up la carreta on 40th
instructions unclear. you just suffocated her to death.
given all the thing he survived it definitely didn't seem like just dead, besides it seems soon. he is the man with the most attempts to his life.
nah. wiped out on his motorcycle doing a sick ass wheelie.
my dick is not old enough to die a natural death. unless we're talking over use. then still, no logical reason.
nah, shit began hitting the fan before that. alan rickman died in january.
2016 just sits at home and throws darts at random names and events and says, "why the fuck not?"
it's entirely possible that he still kept most of his ideals alive by having influence over his brother
carter did just have a lil bit of brain cancer a couple months back tho.
yea but fidel was so ancient they had to include ghwb in his timestamp
but it took away his final battle. he waited to fight you, snake.
but it had terrible accuracy. think of all the people 2016 took before hitting that target...
the us military is better at targeted assassinations than our foreign intelligence department. granted they use robots with fucking missiles, not exactly the most elegant weapon, but hey... when they get some actual useful intel, my my, look at the time, drone o'clock.
that's a weird way to celebrate a cake day, with a death.
i picture you just sadly crossing off days on your calendar for the past several years... just waiting.
honestly it seems insane that he's survived this long. u.s. playing the long con assassination scheme.
how about the cleveland indians blowing a 3-1 lead to the chicago cubs?
"metatron acts as the voice of god. any documented occasion when some yahoo claims god has spoken to them, they're speaking to me. or they're talking to themselves."
wrong. when lemmy died last december, he tore the gates of hell off the hinges on his way down, and shit started getting sucked in.
a book would be universally panned for all these unrealistic and unnecessary deaths. we'd get pissed at the author for trying to clean house so transparently.
bud just saying if hillary becomes president because of the recount season 2016 will end with the beginning of a civil war.. not that i'm fond of trump at all but if that happens mark full on revolt on your calendar for early 2017...
you should really get your father to do an ama, if he'd be comfortable with it.
i was born in '91, so my only real frame of reference for bush 1's personality is the simpsons caricature. and i imagine his old wrinkled yellow face seeing this and going "heheheheh.. outlived ya' bastard!"
i mean, bush is two years *older* than castro was, so it makes sense to have that.
her mom died in 2002 at the age of 102,her aunt was also a centenarian...yeah one would assume she still has a decade give or take
i knew that there would be a boring aspect to journalism other than... well... journalism, but i feel sorry for the poor graduate that has to spend 9 hours a day updating pre-obituaries.
yup, a friend of mine told me that despite the low quality infrastructure and the life they could have lived in the us, cuban's have a sense of hope that people in america would find odd.
what if at midnight on the 31st december the calendars go back to january 1, *2016*?
that's all just for cover and plausible deniability
acme is cia's official supplier. purely because all the other suppliers aren't american.
man, fuck that random guy who does decide to pick it up..
the exploding cigar, a more elegant weapon for a more civilized...something
how do you walk west to get to georgia? are we talking about jesus?
1. cia convinces russia to hack election for trump. 2. trump wins. 3. shock of his victory kills castro. cia finally got castro in the end.
at this point, it's like the guy running the simulation is *running out of ideas* for waking us up.
lemmy is the one mortal who could either befriend or dethrone lucifer and turn hell into a twisted sort of rock god paradise. that being said i wonder if lemmy will get the 2pac treatment and have shit releasing years and years after his death
fiction actually has to play by the rules of storytelling. reality does not.
mine is dana carvey's impressions on stand up specials
and he's also in ailing health. carter is also up there in age but, his health has fared better than ghwb.
i'm going to steal vanilla ice's anal virginity. why? he has a treasure map tramp stamp. what? suge knight has a multiple decade head start on me? nevermind, i value my life too much.
wouldn't be 2016 if some more fucked up shit didn't happen, now would it?
yes, medicine is a statistical game on some level. those exceptions still don't refute the causal link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer though.
i'm in nz and saw a few shops having black friday sales. if we're going to steal holidays from the us can we at least get thanksgiving so we can have turkey and pumpkin pie instead of consumerism and traffic?
doubt it, motherfucker was punching out albums constantly in life, cant imagine theres much left over.
well, congratulations! you got yourself caught! now what's the next step in your master plan?
dude what the fuck. don't egg 2016 on. it will deliver.
castro and pe trudeau were good friends. castro came to canada in september 2000 for trudeau's funeral
not too late for the meteor everyone was voting for.
he didn't just come to canada for the funeral, he was one of the pall bearers
the joke is basically a file cabinet that likes it a little too much when kids organize its drawers because the "phile" and "file" sound the same in pedophile and file cabinet.
it was 10/10 for sure, but seems like some of the ones at the end were super close to the ground. seems dangerous
you should probably read *a connecticut yankee in king arthur's court*. mark twain's got you all set on this one.
iirc it was half a ton and needed to be launched like a mortar.
how would you launch a big one like this in the past?
i am incensed that i had to scroll down this far to find the first gandalf comment.
u/nightmareuki asking the important questions here. someone answer the him/her!
they are made in malta. if you go to malta you can hear custom made fireworks being fired every single day, even during day time. they make them on their own by hand. you obviously can't just go and buy those though.
one of my favorite of all time. i always pictured how funny it would be in the part where he releases the prisoners from morgan's dungeon and he comments "what i would give for a photo of these poor souls" (not exact quote) and morgan doesn't understand what he means so she goes after them all with an axe.
username checks out... thinking like that is why u/young4790 isn't an emperor.
uh no. look at how op said "fireworks". fire works. he's just fucking stupid.
thats how dad did it, thats how america does it... and its worked pretty well so far
if the firework weighs approximately 95kg i might have a device that could launch it 300 meters.
i don't know, that drone video inside of a fireworks display was pretty dope.
yup, recently re watched malcolm in the middle for the first time in years. forgot how great it was, that show was my childhood.
pretty much captures the ambivalence of bootleg fireworks guy.
not saying im a cop but i would allow it and pull a "town" move
except if you light enough, it is the apocalypse.
another thing to put on my list incase i become a billionaire.
"because we have no water to put out the resulting fire otherwise"... dang drought
oh thank god. they are fucking pieces of shit. time to buy a cannon i guess.
no sir it wasn't my work. i did see some teenagers running away though..
you god damned kids had best be gracious with how much money you spend...
oh my god. i was reading it as "fire *works*. as in that's the verb that fire performs. it works. e: to be fair, op's first language probably wasn't english.
find an excuse to let one of these of the chain and i personally guarantee you... the bad guys want even want to come out of their caves.
apparently it's maltese. and i guess it's unsurprising that maltese could be described like that.
the lower quality video was flipped to avoid youtube automatically taking it down (i assume the first one didn't get taken down cause it was so short)
a day ago this would have meant nothing to me but now i can only see trebuchet memes.
i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad. (omg... i want to hug you right now)
same here, and i'd been putting off watching it for so long
my uncles neighbor had a bird bomb when i was a kid. it's basically a pistol that shoots big ass fireworks. it was totally illegal in our county. and he let me, probably 10 years old at the time, shoot it off a few times on fourth of july. illegal and probably irresponsible in the eyes of most, but damn, that shit was cool.
don't you dare waste that beer!spit on the fire till its out, like a man!
i have a neighbor i wouldn't be too sad about losing.
yes that would be the diameter. the biggest shell i've ever shot was a 36" shell and let me tell you.. that scared the ever loving shit out of me. even loading the 8" and 12" shells is nerve wrecking, so i can't imagine dealing with something of this size. btw see my edit on the specs of the shell in this gif.
fair warning. it isn't publicly finished. as far as i know it was picked up as a potential movie and the author isn't allowed to continue.
yeah, i speak arabic and listening to this made me want pizza, so i made a guess
especially if the projectile has a mass of 90 kg and your goal is to launch it 300 meters.
i, too, always miss the coolest shit by mere seconds.
i have been too old for that show since it came out but i still watch every episode with my kids each summer and enjoy every bit of it.
that's exactly it. another common technique is to slightly pitch up/down the audio. with the sheer volume of videos being uploaded to youtube each day, just getting past automated copyright protection systems will usually ensure the video stays up for a decent amount of time.
just me but i fucking love that movie. and sphere (also on netflix now) and the abyss.
at a certain point does the size even matter? i mean i imagine even an 8-12 inch shell would likely kill you if it went off while loading so what's the worry about loading a bigger one. it's not like the bigger shells can make you extra dead, unless its possible to die so hard you use multiple reincarnations in that one death.
but he didn't miss the warmest shit by the sound of it
there's a too old for it? it's one of my dad's favorite shows.
you mean it morphs into warhammer 40k prequel: the first warptest.
event horizon, sphere and abyss on netflix.... well there goes my sleep for this weekend.
even a 3" shell will kill you if it went off while you were loading it. the larger the shell though the more sensitive it would be. i'm confident that if i dropped a 3" on the ground it wouldn't go off, even though i don't advise trying, but i wouldn't dare standing near anything bigger than 12" being dropped.
my roommate and i have analyzed this exhaustively- best we got is "money on them out-running". kind of a sinister twist to good ol reekris
i think that's just the wilhelm scream of folding space explanations.
this wasnt that bad unless you put it in slow motion to see what was happening in all of the quick clips they showed of the old crew. then it went way beyond the pale. the movie that made me (and my wife) jump for the remote to stop that shit asap was "otto; or, up with dead people" omg! it was gay zombie porn. period. the worst stuff you can possibly imagine. made it about 15 min into it when stuff got way too wierd for us.
yeah, even x-files made a reference with folded paper and a pencil through it at one point. seems to be a standard explanation for faster than light travel.
yup, "fuck this ship" was laurence fishburne's assessment of the situation.
my parents just got divorced and stopped talking to me. worked out for the best in the end i suppose
is that when he quit his job and went on to cook meth?
by these criteria, i'm a dad, and i'm a 23-year-old with no kids.
i'd still consider you an artist, just more of a face painter.
i think op mentioned it was a motorized easel but now all i see is medieval neck snapper
seriously, i've been looking for something to replace what's already in my room, but i've been having such a hard time choosing something that i would actually want. this is it, for sure.
my dad too. he laid new tile in his bathroom and has yet to glue it down or use grout. it's just sitting on the floor like a giant puzzle. it's been 3 months
that's his motorized easel he built! that small controller by his foot allows the whole painting to move up and down. sounds like a fucking banshee when he uses it--there were a lot of nights where i couldn't sleep cause he'd be up painting and using that thing.
parents are supposed to divorce each other, not you. :(
yeah well my dad is still in the tell me about all the college chicks he was paying to bang my whole life while pretending to be a family man. his mid-life crisis was to no longer hide that he does it and just move to the city and get the season tickets to the nfl team he's worshiped his whole life.
wow, that's terrible. my dad did something similar to my step brother at that time. my step mom moved out, but her son stayed behind. my dad was the closest thing to a father he's had. anyway, my stepbro was having sex in his room and he said my dad slowly opened his door and was giving him signals that he wanted to tag team her or maybe take sloppy seconds. i was pretty disgusted when i heard that. my dad has always been a jerk, but he never disrespected my step mom with other women. he would just work not stop in the oil fields. so it's weird hearing him be the sex demon he was becoming. he's way over that time period now. he just lives with all his dogs alone. sometimes i feel bad, but he treats people like shit. i'm pretty much the closest person he has.
a lot of artists i know love to barter. if you can cut hair, repair stuff, etc. a lot of artists will trade art for services. i know an artist who traded a $3000 painting for voice lessons.
or to go a little deeper. he went from painting the literal; with all its order and structure (marriage, family), to painting things more abstractly; with all its chaos and fluidity (divorce, mid-life crisis).
i can't attest to this too much, but my impression is that they're willing to try almost anything as long as there's a good name behind it. if it doesn't sell, they'll put it in storage until you come back to pick it up.
mine doesn't need blow or booze to talk shit about my mom. he's very good at it in his natural state.
they both seem so different that it's hard for me to even say one is better than the other; they are just different.
i sort of agree. the new style seems to hit me much more emotionally. obviously we have background with what you said, but the new piece seems much more emotionally charged.
i read this in my best stereotypical italian guy accent to make up for your extra word
yeah i believe he uses several coats of different varnishes and applies them in different ways... sometimes he'll use some weird shit; sticks, rags, knives...
would that also count as sharpshooting? you can go to the olympics in that shit!
seems like it would be tough to talk to all 40 of them. but i've never been with more than one at a time so i'm no expert.
can't unsee. i hadn't even noticed it due to the amazing painting. had to go back and look at it.
i love how you're covering all the bases here... promoting dad's artwork, and getting dad dates. he should keep you around. p.s. i'm a fellow artist and friends with your dad on facebook... as soon as i saw the thumbnail i knew who it was and recognized his new piece!
do you know if he plans reproducing the one you posted?
at port lligat, dali had a huge one that goes down into a slot in the floor.
this has been going on for years mate. many many years basically since reddit started. complaining won't change that reality , but you are free to do so obviously
ideally, parents are **not** supposed to divorce each other :( :(
no, he doesn't, sadly. it'd be fucking hilarious if he did.
just watched this episode last night. i feel a kinship with hal regarding our fathering styles. he's a little more of a typical man than i am, but we both just wanna bang our wives and make memories with our kids.
season 2 episode 14 and i don't think he's really naked.
kids, if you have kids and get divorced, don't talk shit about your children's mother (father). it is the single nicest thing you can do for them. keep it to yourself, like a fucking adult.
i had to go back and reread it in an italian accent.
if you don't mind me asking, what range does your father's work usually sell in? i'm interested as well.
much less than what he had to pay the wife, i'm sure.
especially the shark lounge strippers or anything mainland. daytona beach: come on vacation. leave on probation. return on violation.
i'm pretty sure it's the cherry creek arts festival. i will double check with him and pm you when i find out!
yeah, honestly he should pay me for this! marketing/wingman son. it's great you're friends with him, sorry for his constant political posts. ;)
i'm sure he'll have to do a print of this one now!
chuck close has an easel like that. drops below the floor and raises up, allowing chuck to paint on huge pieces (and from his wheelchair).
eh humans are not 100% wired for long term monogamy. i say this as a happily married person who doesn't plan to divorce. but i don't blame people who do it. we shouldn't shame people for it.
ahh it was nice wasn't it? i guess it's still nice just in a different way.
you use it in conjunction with /r/frugalmalefashion to keep track of sales. then you just go to h&m and forever 21 anyways.
welcome to reddit. over here? that is not considered a gut.
interesting. despite literally being the same person, i'm hardly able to associate the two characters. bryan cranston is a great actor.
see, i would be into painting things in space, and infinite world concepts, but two things keep me from doing it. for one anything i think of has probably already been done so i'd just be rehashing what someone else has already accomplished. sure, it would still be my own work, and it would be unique, but it would still be the same base concept. the cat eye nebula, for instance. or, probably my favorite ngc 3242. i'm sure both of those have been painted hundreds of times. second, i'm a lazy shit.
most pieces are maybe 45"x45" and sell from $8,000-$10,000. i wish he was here and he could probably answer this a bit better!
do we always have to twist the knife in these comment chains? cant we just stick it and leave it for a change?
hey i work on the street that festival happens on! that is all.
no i didn't say typical italian. i said typical, chauvinistic italian. so the chauvinistic variety of italian men. the italian men in my family on that side are all the same. womanisers, no respect for anyone but other men. i'm glad you have a different family, but not everyone is so lucky.
it's just a good start. like a yamaka before you reach full fedora.
little shit to old fart. and so the journey goes...
i'd go so far as to say those are his two best performances.
today you just educated a lot of people on the cost of real great art.
love is pain. you gotta rip that band-aid off now. you'll thank me later.
are you saying that jewish people are some kind of stage in the metamorphosis of a hipster?
wow, you're not kidding. this is a fantastic review. i'm 38 now and i never saw the show for what it was until now.
all i could think of while rewatching the show is "hal & lois have the patients of saints because i would destroy those children".
actually, 10k for a great art that size would be kind of a steal.
life is pain. anyone who says otherwise is selling something.
i completely agree. those kids made a strong case for corporal punishment. (also, just trying to be helpful, but, it's "patience")
came here looking for this comment, which couldn't have conveyed either a sudden stroke, or the literacy of us president, any better.
the show made me realize what saints my parents were that i only got hit two or three times as a kid. i was a rotten little shit. it's a miracle my parents didn't strangle me. even as a kid i was always surprised i almost never caught a whooping. things are very different now than 40+ years ago. now it's verboten to hit kids, but that wasn't the case even in schools when i was growing up.
at some point it comes down to the artist name. once you build a name for yourself and wealthy people buy your paintings you can charge, and your existing work becomes much more valuable. basically like a brand name.
the only "feeling" i get is "meh" when i look at that.
would not be wrong to put s after rbis. you can pluralize an acronym by sticking an 's' at the end of it.
i mildly disagree with your opinion for no articulable reason.
exactly, andy warhol's ejaculation on canvas is probably much more expensive than anything my dad could create at this point in his life.
yes, but the point is this is just a couple of blobs of color in the form of a square and two rectangles. it invokes nothing from me. am i suppose to imagine the top rectangle changing from the dirty yellowish to the fiery orange rectangle and then to the fiery orange square as some sort of caterpillar to butterfly evolution? i just really don't get it.
you kind of need to see the real thing in a space that supports it, in the right context. to be in front one of these huge (7ft tall and up) pieces when it is properly lit, displaying all the gradients and texture, is actually a pretty awesome experience. it's much more sensational than seeing it as a clipped and compressed jpeg on your doubtlessly much smaller, incorrectly color-balanced, and backlit screen. if you allow yourself to be taken in by the piece, it can be pretty emotional.
i think seth and i both really want to keep it going
i misread the first part as hillary for charity which sounds like a hillary clinton circlejerk gala
he's like that friend that only texts you once per year to wish you happy birthday, except with a picture of seth rogan and he just wishes himself happy birthday.
i could hear a shorter version echo of this as i looked at each picture - something like: ah-huh ah-huh ah-huh ah-huh
seth and his wife lauren started hilarity for charity in 2012, hfc spreads awareness and raises money to benefit the alzheimers association. ive had the opportunity to meet seth at hfc events and take these pictures over the past four years.
uh huh huh huh uh huh huh huh uh huh huh huh uh huh huh huh uh huh huh huh
they honestly both look like cardboard cutouts to me. its weird.
i think they just meet at an annual charity event that rogen started.
can confirm. i'm 33 years old. years seem like weeks, weeks seem like minutes, minutes seem like seconds. it's nuts, man.
you know what would be funny? next year he's the one that posts it as "my annual picture with /u/kokomocs".
so did i, i had to read it five more times to get what you were saying...
i thought it was familiar too. i may have a reddit problem.
could you explain how you come into contact with seth rogen on an annual basis?
context: the kid who does the same kind of annual picture-in-a-picture-in-a-picture thing with adam savage recently came out as transgender in the latest iteration of the photo.
but can i use him as a reference when applying for jobs?
do they hang after? eat lunch? invited to any backstage stuff with him? offers to meet up for other events or collabs? or is it just a quick pic then you are whisked off?
now i'm imagining the sad photo of one of the two of them taking the last picture with a coffin. now i'm imagining a hilarious picture of an old seth rogen giving a big thumbs up with a goofy smile next to a coffin.
why would he have to when he can just get it off of reddit?
i'm 36 in july. i just turned 33 last week. 40s+ seem scarier because of this. it's like i'm perceptually done with 80% of my life.
i imagine right after he said this, he time warped and was eating breakfast again. "goddamnit!"
it'd be even funnier if one year seth rogen is replaced by jonah hill
op is actually seth. he found some guy during the event where the first pic was taken. seth was really baked and had an idea. he would pay for this guy to come to the event every year and start the picture train. he would then make an account, which op says is only for these pictures, and post every year to kill 2 birds with 1 stone. promote his organization yearly and reep in the sweet sweet kharma that we all thirst for. until 1998 when the undertaker
deep thoughts!! i use to have the books in my bathroom and periodically you'd hear people cracking up in there.
i'm noticing a pattern here. seth give a thumbs up in each annual picture, but you only give a thumbs up every other year.
ahem, you know the rules, right? we're waiting...
i looked. i looked at ~~the ark of the covenant~~ your comment karma. it's beautiful . . .
and two years in a row the thread turned into a shitstorm and had to be locked down. people are mean.
work history: "collaborated with seth rogen on multiple successful media projects."
i went to school with this kid at the university of vermont. the kids in pike (the frat) which wins some competition amongnst the nations frats to raise the most money for one of seth rogens charities every year and therefore seth rogen comes to meet the members of the frat every year. i got to be someones plus one to the event a couples year back when seth rogen brought mclovin along with him and we all watched superbad while they did live commentary. they both left right after though so they dont hang around
i'm not the patient type, how about we give u/kokomocs a push?
oh man....i hear you. for some reason, turning 30 didn't bother me at all. i'm going to be 34 in a few months, and it's completely messing with my mind! i still act, feel and look 25 years old. it's just not right.
but the nice thing is, your friendships completely transform in your 30's. since you're both busy with work, kids, whatever, there's not constant pressure to keep tabs on each other all the time and no hurt feelings when you can't hang out for awhile - it's like, a mutual understanding that life gets busy. then when you *do* finally hang out, you actually have things to talk about and catch up on. it makes the time that much more special. it's weird for me still sometimes, because i would spend hours on the phone with my best friends every day in high school...after already seeing them all day! but my friends now, we could only see each other 3-4 times a year and i'd still consider them close friends.
god .__. but can confirm (not 93 yrs thou) i'm 26, still feel like the 15 yrs old version of me, just more tired because of extended hours of work, but i haven't changed a particle in how i sense the world or myself. i'm more or less getting to the idea that this is going to be for the rest of my life? the same teen just slower and weaker?
even funnier if no one would acknowledge the fact that seth was replaced with jonah, not even jonah.
the suspense is killing me. what did the undertaker do
in some countries, what i did would be considered polite, especially fartland. -me
he only gives a thumbs up when the warriors win the finals
okay make sense.. i fully expect no thumb up next year . op please take note
"experience developing, producing, and disseminating viral social media content for a mass audience. coordinated synergistic creative endeavors with public figures such as seth rogen in crowdsourcing capital for a charitable non-profit."
i'm 36 and by the time i finish this sentence i'll be bill cosby. but like a nice version.
yes! it'd still be posted as "my annual picture with seth rogen"
that's not a story seth rogen would want you to hear
or maybe he gives a thumbs up next year and the tradition becomes no thumbs up on a leap year.
where do you live where the legal age of consent is 5? asking for a friend.
i think you'll find u/nathanfillingin was slightly less rude.
hello, i am definitely a 5 year old who is interested in you and not an fbi agent. please tell me your full name, residential address and times when you are likely to be home.
well shit that's no good. yitties from hilgard btw
and that's not even the worst fall mankind took in that match
oh what, so you're telling me i cant play with fire works in a dense forrest? pfft
honestly, i bet it would help to establish that it was parody and thus fair use.
how can you prevent forest fires all the way from the arctic circle!? you interpreted this all wrong! only you can prevent the fires! not by avoiding forests, but by protecting them with your unawakened ability. your great great great great grandfather was a mighty native american chief whose name translated to "smokes with bears". he was able to telepathically communicate with all bears within a 10,000-mile radius. the bears were only used for putting out fires that were caused by lightning, uncontrolled bonfires, and tribal wars. the keepers of the forrest, 'smokes with bears' would use his shaman powers to imbue them with anti-flammable polyester coats so that they would use their bodies to smother all flames. this is your calling. now go smoke with some bears.
here's a fun fact. it's actually "smokey bear" with no "the" in between. weird, huh?
oh my god! someone giving credit for their jokes...on reddit?
thats it, ya cant have forest fires if there's no trees.
that's why they have prescribed burns... putting out your campfire and not tossing cigarette butts should be common sense...but since it's not so common they have to run a campaign with a cartoon character to get people's attention.
why don't you donate to a related organization instead?
came here to say this. lamentably, this comment is way down the page.
don't bring logic here!! but muh feelingsssss!!1111
not the usfs as a whole, but the wildland firefighting portion of the fs has been going up. the usfs as an agency has actually been losing funding under the recent administration.
you couldn't be more clueless huh? it doesn't have to by a major forrest. i was just in kc and they have large sections of trees. woods, brush fires etc are what the service has always wanted people to be wary of.
fire is actually a very beneficial occurrence for forests in california. the fire suppression management programs used in the 1900s and currently are very counterproductive if the goal is to keep the forests in the natural ecological state they were before human colonization. by preventing every fire you actually allow the build up of more plant fuel (usually burns out in small fires), which leads to more large scale, more intense, and more severe fires. fires also allow the natural succession process to occur. not to say infrastructure and homes should not be protected, but fire is a necessity for a healthy forest in california.
i still think it's important to prevent forest fires by those unskilled to handle it. we started to do controlled burns which allow for new growth and preventing big forest fires.
hm yes. the middle east wars are *all* liberals fault.
i have some good news for you: they haven't been defunded. i have some bad news for you: only dumb people get their political news from funny tshirts....
it's ok, when it doesn't rain for a while the wood becomes harder and more difficult to burn.
the first rule of fire safety: you don't talk about fire safety.
neither smokey bear nor any federal government insignia are copyrighted. the *smokey bear act of 1952* specifically protects smokey from *ever* passing into public domain.
my gift is preventing florist fires. florists often spontaneously combust while arranging flowers - little known fact.
next thing you're gonna tell me, it's berenstain bears instead of berenstein bears.
these days some national forests have just as much traffic as national parks, but still only like 2 rangers for half a million acres.
thank you. i honestly don't know what to believe anymore these days.
trumpers that slept through civics class latched onto this deflection attempt and patted themselves on the back for being on the right side of history.
funny thing is, the have the national parks service insignia with the forest service mascot...
smokey, however, comes from a time before prescribed burns were an accepted practice.
you are correct. i've volunteered at a national forest, prescribed burns are a regular occurrence nowadays. we have a much better understanding of these dynamic systems nowadays.
humans are part of nature. trees don't give a shit if it's a lightning bolt or campfire to start the fire, how much it burns up has to do with the conditions of the forest. if it has a lot of fuel and is dry, then it needs to burn to prevent fuel buildup whether we start it or not. that's why controlled burns even exist, were just taking the randomness out of it because we know that the forest is in the condition to burn
you know bush, the most liberal of presidents. just pushing that liberal agenda of always starting wars
you'll need your own kindling for sure, newspaper is ok to use.
*did we give up when the germans bombed pearl harbor?!*
that doesn't sound right, but i don't know enough about fire safety to dispute it.
wait.. so it can't be copyrighted, but it can't enter public domain? what?
"only hugh can prevent florist friars" - colin mochrie
what other traditional native american beliefs do they have?
it melts before it burns, but, yeah, i think it does.
oxford comma makes this quite clear, he won't be disappointed.
he brings a whole new meaning to the phrase, "i'm kind of a big deal on reddit."
the only explanation is that we merged with an only very slightly different parallel universe.
i think that's the reason nps picked a bison for their mascot. as in "this is why protecting things is important."

hey, capitalism, right? ...right? it would be nice if they got some of the profits but anything that draws attention to how our country is being bled dry for fun & profit is all right in my book.
crazy, cause i'm sitting in a fire engine with a bunch of other north zone black hills wildland firefighters. sure, the burns aren't as frequent or large as they should be, but prescribed burns happen.
sorry but that isn't how it really works. natural fires are less common and on average less intense. natural fires are typically ecologically beneficial but not all fires are. extremely hot intense fires are not good for the environment. these can be natural, but are more often human caused. this is because of a number of factors but for one, lightning rarely strikes when its bone dry. anyway these super intense fires can kill everything, including seeds and the microorganisms in the soil, leading to a much much longer recovery period for the ecosystems. the forest service still (very importantly) fights fires but they're more scientific about where and when. they have maps to show what areas to fight fires in and where to let them burn. in my area around 9/10 fires are human caused and fighting many of those is necessary.
oh please, what if we just defunded the military and then said "feel free to write them a check." i'm not saying that reddit is not full of hypocrites, but in the us we vote along party lines, and the republicans the "small government party" loves to pat themselves on the back about cuts like this yet for the last 30 years federal government spending has gone up when we elect republicans. for ever 1$ cut froms parks or the epa they add $20 to the military while lowering taxes.
doesn't change the fact that the amazon link you're advertising (yes we know it's you trying to profit) will look like pixelated shit. stop stealing shit.
no! we made hitler surrender when we dropped the bomb on d-day! america, fuck yeah!
yep! he's under the control of the secretary of agriculture. the royalties collected from his use go to forest fire prevention education-- over $3m has been collected by keeping him out of the public domain.
smoking with bears? ah yes, also known as the wokey tokey.
he found himself in that boom. (it's actually the chinese laundry next door that blows up, but i get you.)
the world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant turtle.
yes he would be fucking penguins wherever he was. he brings them with him.
is arctic timber evergreen? i can't imagine deciduous tree, surviving the harsh winter wasteland. wait... what? penguins roost in trees? how do they even get to the branches?
most of canada above the arctic circle and also greenland are treeless.
let's downvote him and bring him down a notch!!!!!

on a completely unrelated note, what's that movie with sinbad playing as a genie?
still a step up from the random shirt which can't even read.
with the amount of people that go to yosemite i don't think that's even enough.
i didn't mean to imply they don't happen at all. just that the fuel loading is so severe that a sufficient burn regime is just not happening still despite the several decades-old turnaround on fire's ecological value.
human fires aren't the problem. the really bad canopy fires are a side effect of ladders- medium sized trees that should've burned down already. large trees in old forests have fairly fire-resistant trunks, and won't burn unless something brings the fire to them. they stand up to normal low-level fires. after an under researched attempt to prevent all fires, there are a lot more ladders and debris to bring the fire to the canopy. bone dry doesn't matter if there isn't a way for the fire to catch the old growth, it matters now because we gave it a way.
you can find the vectors for both images online. how many of those $20 shirts have you sold?
so, what you're saying is more people should use him so they can get more funding?
he said, "what were you arrested for, kid?" and i said, "litterin'"' . . . . and they all moved away from me on the bench there, with the hairy eyeball and all kinds of mean, nasty things, till i said, "and creatin' a nuisance . . . " and they all came back, shook my hand, and we had a great time on the bench talkin' about crime, mother-stabbin', father-rapin', . . . all kinds of groovy things that we was talkin' about on the bench, and everything was fine.
where do you go to buy something to pay respects to the xvii, xviii and xix roman legions? ...a teutonian florist!
without his clothes? smoky bear the bare smoking smoking bear, bare
human fires are still very much a problem. you're right that we made fires more common and intense by preventing them, but we still have to fight them. many fires endanger lives and property so we fight those. nowadays we know to try to let fires burn where we can and fight the ones we must, so that's what we do. over time the problems associated with lack of fires (ladder trees, etc.) will slowly go away, either through fires or decay, but for now we have a lot of fires to fight and not really adequate resources to do it. so preventing excess (aka human caused) fires is still extremely important.
supposing they actually are paying for its use then yes but i doubt this is doing that. also this isn't smokey it's wokey the bear.
kid, i want you to go and sit down on that bench that says 'group w'
if dead and cooked by smoking it, it would be smoky bear the smoked, bare smoking smoking bear, bare

i went over to the sargent, said, "sargeant, you got a lot a damn gall to ask me if i've rehabilitated myself, i mean, i mean, i mean that just, i'm sittin' here on the bench, i mean i'm sittin here on the group w bench 'cause you want to know if i'm moral enough join the army, burn women, kids, houses and villages after bein' a litterbug. " he looked at me and said, "kid, we don't like your kind, and we're gonna send you fingerprints off to washington. "
weeell, if he was cooked i'd argue he couldn't smoke anymore and his sexy levels would drop (personal preference!), so: smoky bear the smoked, bare barely smoking rarely smoking bear, bare.
well, the default under federal law is all intellectual property produced by the federal government is automatically public domain. (the us federal government is actually by far the best in the world about making intellectual property it produces public domain.) so it sort of makes sense to create certain limited exceptions where the value to be gained by making something public domain is low and the damage (e.g., to the reputation of the property) is potentially significant.
hey kids, it's wokey the "i am legally distinct from smokey 'the just smokey bear, don't call me "smokey the bear"' bear" bear!
there is serious profit in fighting fires, not so much in preventing them. /s
i don't really see a problem if profits aren't being made and it's not spreading false info (kinda like this shirt).
he is just testing a new transition technique; this one is much faster than dismounting and dipping your toes to see how chilly the water is.
i can remember the summer where pushing people into the pool died.
i would argue his only mistake was not letting the umbrella go sooner to have more control of the bike. but then again, we wouldn't have this wonder gif to laugh at.
honestly after watching a few times i don't think he even saw it and the board knocked him of his bike unexpectedly.
did you ever hear the tragedy of darth umbrella the damp?
it's the skateboard "fall" that starts the stink of bs.
i think that's exactly what we are seeing. judging by his momentum when he comes into frame, i think he was simply trying to make the turn and didn't see the board in time to avoid it.
can't believe it took that long for someone to comment this, what kind of madman skateboards in that kind of weather?
now he just needs to figure out how to do the transition in reverse.
now it's restrain them and force them to give up their phone before launching them into the water
most of the new ones are, but a lot of us still have older, non water proof ones.
his dedication is second to none. i just can't help but wonder, is he a friend of fail skater or is he just some random hero on a pushie?
it looks too perfect it must be staged. but then again, that stunt could go wrong in so many ways.
but he had already committed to the save and wanted to avoid looking foolish at all cost.
how does this find its way into every single fucking post
i won't feel safe until you're locked up and off the streets
unless the bicyclist planned on going over the edge anyway, it's staged. his turn radius doesn't make sense otherwise.
it also saves itself from the water at the last moment.
i thought he was talking about that summer when a girl pushed her friend into a pool and paralyzed her for life.
ahh... memories of taking girls pens and pencils when they weren't looking.
what do you mean "new". i'm deciding between straight or gay versions right now
also some "waterproof" phones that are waterproof in freshwater may not be completely safe in chlorinated water.
i'm thinking/hoping this poor unfortunate soul was just on his way to work and unrelated to the madlads in the middle of their grind session.
while i'm not denying that this is fishy, i would like to point out that this is on wet concrete. urethane wheels (both soft longboard wheels and hard street wheels) have almost no traction in wet conditions. slipping on wet pavement is often referred to as icing out because you have no control.
by looking at the guy falling off the skateboard i would definitely say it's fake.
i don't know how people are missing that. i saw it on my second view. i was trying to figure out why the board kicked up if he just runs into it.. but it's because he hoped onto tail of the skateboard.
the cost was falling in the water and looking foolish.
prequel memes are a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
not sure what you mean "anticipates the cyclist's entrance" -- looks like the camera was just following the board. the composition of the shot does seem a little too good to be true, but sometimes weird stuff happens. without having any further evidence i'd put my money on it being real.
it's almost as if they could have done many takes to get it just right.
it was a bridesmaid that pushed the bride to be into a pool onthe bachelorette party.
even with this idea you still need those though... a belt to tie them down. their wallet for their id and to get pictures of their kids and wife so you can threaten their family. and a phone to take a sweet video to reap the karma from each of their tears, their cries for help; frantic gasping and make it all worth it. i'm not seeing the savings here...
it's not an exact synonym to "hurt". you can use "hurt" both to say 'i'm hurting someone' and 'my knee hurts'.but "pain" can only be used in the first way, and i've only ever seen it used in present simple (we say 'the truth pains me' but not 'this thug is paining me')
motherfuckers. is that why all my pens, pencils and erasers always went missing in middle school and high school???
no that's definitely what the cameraman would do since that's always funny footy. anybody who captures skateboarding near water knows that something sketchy might happen and skateboarders trying to save skateboards is always funny. source: i skate, have dropped skateboard in water and my camera dude filmed the board immediately after my stack had finished. also seen plenty of skateboard parts where similar events occurred.
i'm sure the girl would gladly jump in if it would let her take back her mistake. no one wants to hurt anyone and least of all a guy on a bike having the time of his life.
yeah, he seems to deliberately send the skateboard forward and fall back in a very controlled way. if that's fake then likely the whole thing is fake.
this is what got me as well. i just can't imagine that someone's natural reaction to stop that skateboard would be to wheely it... using a bike... when simply blocking it would've been so much easier and less likely to end with a faceplant.
seems to me it could just as well be a last-second attempt to hop over the skateboard when he finally noticed it. it's so perfect i wouldn't be surprised if it's staged though.
i did as well but i'm honestly pretty happy about it.
i don't know, man. the cyclist passes pretty close to the camera man, seems weird imo to cut it so close to the line pedestrian in the walkway. his path of choice seems kind of odd too considering he knew he was going to have to turn and he turned directly into the skateboard that was pretty easy to spot. people are dumb and shit happens but i wouldn't be surprised at all if this were staged.
whoa buddy, i'm only talking about some friends having a laugh and doing some simulated drowning. you're getting a little extreme here.
that's true, they are rated for 30 minutes at about 10ft depth in fresh water. i bring mine into the shower with me every day so i can listen to podcasts without having to crank the volume and wake everyone up, its pretty fucking cool to be able to do that. i'm sure it will be handy for porn as well.
the video is timestamp-linked, but you can scrub backwards to the beginning. the truck crossed waaaaayyy over the middle line, apparently trying to cause a head-on collision with the bike, then blamed the biker.
just to add to this, i've never seen it used as a verb for actual physical pain. it's always in the context of emotional pain (even in this example where the word physical was used).
went to see that movie as a way of taking my mind off a death in the family... it was an... unfortunate coincidence.
still in theaters, i'd give it about an hour after the blu-ray is released. that's the only movie i've seen more than once in theaters, and i'm debating going a 3rd time. chris pratt is such a good actor.
i don't think the guy with the skateboard is a girl
ctrl + f: "fake" this is how i find my bros in posts like this. the camera man continues to film the skateboard before the girl has even fallen down completely. this clip is definitely staged.
it's been so long since it was common that i've let my guard down.
yeah the only non-staged reason i can think of for taking that path is that maybe he did see the skateboard, and thought that hitting the end of it with his bike would stop it from going over? (i guess that's what op was thinking with the title...)
i wish i was willing to risk my phone like that. you are a very brave soul, i salute you
no phones are rated as water proof. they're usually rated as ip6x which are varying degrees of water resistance. and they're never advertised as water proof for warranty reasons.
from what i remember the guys on the bikes drove by truck guys house about 20 min before going maybe 10 over the speed limit. truck guy says they endangered his children who were already in the truck by doing this so he decided to hunt them down and try to run them off the road as that is the only logical solution.
thanks to both of you. it pains me to get to know this only now, since i'm an english teacher.
vaguely relevant: my dad was diagnosed with the bad kind of cancer just before the 1st hobbit film came out. he had a lot of things he wanted to do but he said to me he wanted to see the whole trilogy - we loved going to the lotr films together. i know the hobbit didn't hold a candle to the first three but nevertheless. he didn't quite make it to the third film and watching it without him was tough and special at the same time. i feel closest to him when i see films or tv programmes that i know he would have loved to talk about with me. gotg 1 and 2 both fell squarely in this category, he would have loved them.
** "he may have been your father boy, but he ain't ya daddy." sorry not being an internet jerk, it was just my favorite line of the movie.
as someone that hasn't watched the movie yet, i'm pretty gutted to roll right down into so many spoilers. they strike when we least expect ;n;
i actually see a lot of movies twice if they're good. but not very often three, and i'll be seeing this one for the third time this week
no, i believe it's a reference to a female skateboard. didn't you notice the axles?
not really... it's pretty catchy. plus those dance moves
waterproof phones are the best. now you can watch youtube in the shower!
yeah true. i've done about 8-10 jumps with it, 2 in saltwater which messed up the speaker until it dried both times. no other symptoms in freshwater. it's not something i'm going to keep risking though, i'm sure it's less resistant a year after buying it than in the first couple months.
ah, you're right. even still, 30 minutes at 3 meters seems very resistant.
i feel your pain my friend and am sorry for your loss. had the same situation with my mum. had watched every marvel film with her since iron man 2. she also had cancer, she really wanted to try and make it to see guardians of the galaxy 2 as guardians 1 was one of her favourites. but unfortunately she passed away the week before. i still went to see it, but it was bittersweet. was quite hard to hold it together at the end. but at least when you see those films again you will have some fond memories to look back on as you watch them.
i didn't want to specify at first for spoilers, but it was actually my dad that passed. you know a great time not to hear cat stevens?!
yep, dad would have shit a brick over rogue 1 and the force awakens :)
join me and together we will rule the swimming pool as father and son!
a /r/sequelmemes meme in a /r/prequelmemes chain? blasphemy! blast him!
mr. /u/speaklikeachild04, are you in bed with russia? the people needs to know.
vodka was once banned in russia, it made tax uncertain and death much more certain
try a gin and tonic wiht lime. moscow mule is a sign of russian hacking the alcohol supply of usa.
it's likely in a predominantly liberal city, like new york or san francisco.
i don't drink smirnoff any more, but i also don't drink it any less either
ah yes, surely they'll suffer the unspeakable devastation target and starbucks endured.
trump says a lot of things. at this point i can only believe what he actually does, nothing he says is reliable on any level.
i couldn't find a news article on google. maybe someone with stronger google-fu.
i mean it's vodka. it's not swill* but like any vodka it should be used as an ingredient and not consumed as a drink in itself. that's reserved for sorority girls and eastern europeans suffering from depression. *super cheap vodka can have a bit of a funky taste, but above a certain quality threshold it's all about the same.
i mean... they normally use photoshop or so to touch up the pictures in the ad. :p
why does he have to be bald?? smh scalpal profiling

the tag is assigned by automoderator based on whether or not certain words appear in the title. none of those words appear in this title, so you'll have to wait until a mod notices this post and flairs it themselves.
honestly, the front page is a shit show and every sub is finding a way to squeeze in trump disdain. it would be nice if the mods showed some consistency in what is allowed.
i dont know if he's in bed with russia. maybe the backyard? i found one of his shoes....
bartender here. can confirm. in the past 2 years my bar went from having maybe 6 mugs at one time to over 50, and we're still always running out. on busy nights. considering copper isnt cheap (and customers seem to think the mugs look sooo nice in their jacket pockets walking out the door) speaks to what kind of return these things are giving in.
also no one pays taxes in russia, everyone bribes each other, and the oligarchs just pay tribute to king kleptocrat putin who is now the world's richest man with 150-200 billion in accounts across the planet. the only thing that's certain is that rich dictators always store their money in non-corrupt countries who guard their privacy (tax havens, eurobanks). what is uncertain is when transparency laws will spread and squeeze these dictators around the world.
gin is a sign of british hacking :p try bourbon straight.
the background looks like either an nj transit or metro north commuter rail station, so nyc metropolitan area, where less than 20% of people voted for the big cheeto.
sort of, except that he says there are no ties, and they want to make clear that they have a connection to the vodka motherland.
pro trumpers gives off the vibe that they are more beer drinkers anyways
whatever boycott results from this will end sometime this thursday night, when college kids will realize that no amount of righteous indignation makes popov or 5 o'clock a good substitute for the noff.
thank you. leftist here and also laugh at a well timed hillary email joke, or anything similar. this is much more about making a contextual joke about a current event snd less about making a political statement.
really this ad is safe. anyone who is an extreme trump supporter might get mad or even boycott it, but there are very few trump supporters who would even care and will forget about it. on the other side you have many, many people who hate trump and will buy this by the barrels and show this ad to all their friends. and now the ad is popular online where most of the audience is young and liberal. they knew what they were doing.
yeah when i was in high school i worked for a diner; i was trained by the owner himself. biggest dick i've ever worked for, by far. i despise the man. i still go eat at his restaurant at least a couple times a month because his food is that damn good. capitalism at work, people.
lol i love how you're more willing to accept the idea of a liberal buying a bible than you are of a conservative buying almond butter.
or #3, as a well executed joke. tragedy + time = comedy. yes, but current events + relevance does too. imagine the advertising department of jacky d's, blue or green bottle gin, or even malibu rum. none of those guys get to come up with anything relevant based on their products geographic commonality. vodka sure as shit does, because everyone currently talks about trump. absolut wouldn't do it because they pretty much solely rely on their name and artsy stuff. grey goose uses rap music and magazine pages just fine. russian prince probably couldn't, because their name is too obtuse and because they are cheap as fuck on the shelf and that's advertising enough. so that really just leaves the ball in smirnoff's hand, and they totally swished it.
i hear hamilton still hasn't recovered from that conservative boycott
snow flakes come in many shades and fall left and right.
the general public is finally realizing what general contractors in nyc have known for 40 years.
people are saying he's likely to show them this week. sessions volunteered on his own accord to testify on tuesday as well.
his republican congress refused to give him a dime to build that wall. it's hilarious.
we already know for a fact trump doesn't lie. trump said so himself!
with how the political climate is, i wouldn't mind going back to that. people get so vicious these days over politics, it's no wonder...
i think it shows just how much reddit can be played.
assuming you don't have to worry about alienating a massive chunk of your customer base.
you know that scene where indiana jones shoots the swordsman? harrison ford couldn't do the fight scene in the script because he had dysentery and they could only film for ten minutes at a time, so they just had indy shoot the swordsman instead.
every bar i've been to that i ordered one requires an id/credit card to be left with the bartender in exchange for the cup. i think it's a fair practice, they're pricey.
don't forget to get the all copper ones for maximum chilling effect. the cheap ones are just copper plated on the outside.
never heard of it until today. also why would you eat or drink out of copper, given what we know about copper poisoning?
i've done a bit of searching. one explanation is that copper helps keep the drink colder for longer. another is that the copper reacts with the acidic lime juice to change the flavor somehow, but that may be marketing bs.
well, if you're not of drinking age, not really an issue for smirnoff.
and so did comey. actually comey said that trump said that if any of his associates had ties, he wanted to know. so. russia?
and melania was going to have a press conference to talk about her immigration status, or he was going to put his money in a "blind trust", or he had a a secret plan to wipe out isis, and so on and so on. *i accidentally left off my favorite. his private investigators "cannot believe what they're finding" about obama's birth certificate in hawaii. what did they find donald?
i feel like the rich trumpers would probably have a more expensive vodka anyway.
yep. i'd like to really test this theory and have marlboro come out in support of isis-lgbt rights or something. i'm guessing there would be a lot of people claiming they're boycotting, but somehow the packs still need restocking every shift.
i doubt anyone at home will take out their bottle while half-smashed, and throw it all away in a fit of political integrity.
is almond butter considered unholy by conservatives?
i hear they boycotted rogue one so hard it went straight to video.
genuinely curious here because i wasn't that tuned into it when it all happened, but where was the joke with that photoshoot? i remember her saying (and justifying it) that it was all just part of comedy and pushing the line is what comedians do, but... where was the joke? i haven't been able to find anyone say what it was.
which is funny, because, "at this point i can only believe what he actually does, nothing he says is reliable on any level." is usually a statement best applied to general contractors
or the r/worldnews articles where it's just different ways the same country says they don't like trump.
yea and a one armed man killed his wife....this guy.........
~13 on amazon. i'm sure a business can find them cheaper. still expensive as hell for a drink vessel.
we hold onto ids and "say" we will charge if they go missing. in the craziness of the busiest nights it's sometimes hard to keep track of, however. customers will sometimes return other people's mugs which can make some claim a server bussed theirs and didn't return their id... etc. normally it's easy to tell when people are lying, but customer satisfaction yada yada...
our kettle one rep is pretty nice to us in the same way. the problem is, the mugs started going down in quality. at first they were pure copper, now they're just plated, but we're get a lot more. to everyone saying they can get pure 16oz mugs for 12 bucks, i can assure you they are not "pure".
as someone in the industry, i greatly appreciate this. having people feel it's not socially acceptable between each other is the best way to combat this.
implying that i wouldn't finish it in a plastic cup with all the ice still intact
well, this past week was "negroni week" which i assume was a marketing promotion between campari and a bunch of cocktail bars.
same with rum, i like to do bourbon/rum with vernors. if you live in michigan/have access to vernors give it a shot.
the farther it spreads the less likely it's going to reach exclusively liberal internet users.
also, life in cities is constantly changing. life in rural areas mostly stays the same, and when it doesn't it's often bad, like the loss of mining jobs.
but then he told him he wanted him to drop an investigation into flynn and fired him when he didn't
if you consider that trump thought obama was from kenya (which i might add doesn't matter, as his mother is american), then any evidence otherwise would be "unbelievable" to him.
::finger to head:: "you can't lose support if you don't have any."
for what it's worth, almost none of what kathy griffin has done has ever been funny
well, general contractors are supposed to have license and paperwork they are supposed to show you whenever you ask to prove they are who they say they are and they should know what the fuck they are doing. trump can't prove either.
wanna copy me and do exactly like i did? try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is?
i'm sorry. the answer was mr. putin in the garage with the computer virus.
those are the copper plated ones. copper isn't cheap anymore.
yeah that's a tough situation. i would probably never come back if i had to deal with the bartender not believing me that i didn't steal a cup
that and i'm sure they'll take the huge publicity the brand will get if it goes viral over keeping a few disgruntled conservatives.
actually yes. 5 years of that station every day, i recognize the building. it's about 2/3rds down the way of the northbound platform
when things in your environment constantly change it probably makes it easier to accept social changes too. at the very least, you're more able to cope with them.
google is on there. that really speaks for itself.
i literally had a trump supporter try to tell me that his mother being american didn't matter and that he had to be born on us soil to be president. this just tells you the kind of cognitive dissonance you're dealing with in that crowd.
makes sense i guess : wish she'd stop dragging the liberties of comedy through the mud through it all then.
i know you got the last two letters, i wrote the addresses on them perfect!
dang, my second guess was mr comey in the dining room with the tapes.
i would just dispute the charge. what are they gonna do, call the cops and have me charged for theft when they have 0 evidence?
seriously. sometimes, i don't quite think "big city folk" understand how it is in smaller suburban and rural areas. there are tons of things to do in a big city that don't involve drinking. in smaller areas, though, that's almost all there is to do--smoke, drink, and fuck. i live in a small suburban area, and the only things we have in this town are bars and churches.
they're not actually. on any given day there is multiple anti trump/liberal posts on the front page - you're probably just used to that fact so the conservative stuff seems to pop out more.
a waste of time if you don't mind looking like a fool in an ill fitting suit.
then how did cruz run? he was born in canada. which is funny because he was on the whole birther thing too.
so this is my cassette i'm sending you, i hope you hear it i'm in the car right now, i'm doing 90 on the freeway!
you have become what you hated. for when you stare into the bamboozle, the bamboozle stares back.
a lot of the older raised nyc subway stations have that sort of look. you can find similar looking ones in the other boroughs like in the bronx or in queens.
nope member boston... pol found the bike lock asshole bombed isis made shia more crazy and this is only in a couples months
and all i ever wanted was a lousy letter or a call. i hope you know i ripped *all* your pictures off the wall!
hey slim, i just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me-- oh, full circle.
i loved you slim, we could have been together think about it!
no i have the explicit version it wouldn't be eminem if it wasnt but oh doesnt say that

very cool owner who buys her the bus pass and enables her to leave on her own!
she has secretly started a relationship with a local city alderman, who happens to be married, and she spends most of the day down at the rec-centre, which doubles as campaign headquarters, where she cold calls registered voters and directs any packages that may be delivered.
i'm 22 years in and can't even make it to the dog park by myself.
i'm having a true blue shit day and i just had the best laugh at this. many thanks.
i always feel bad for owners that are stuck at home alone all day while their pets are at the park.
to be fair, i don't think the dog can do her own laundry either. that's ok though, dogs don't wear clothes.
yea and if you can't handle her bite then you don't deserve her best.
everyone knows her and they even did an article on her in the local newspaper.
something tells me the dog enabled itself and the bus pass was a solution for a mildly annoyed bus driver.
rides the d line between queen anne and ballard usually. i ride that bus but i don't think we have the same hours. keep hoping to see her.
it reminds me of a riff off of that men in black joke. "looks like this is my stop!.......er...i mean..'woof, woof.'"
im picturing him getting recognized more and more, so he begins to wear a hat and sunglasses to be incognito.
well corgis are one of the cutest dog breeds because they're so disproportional. they have chicken drummies for legs and their body is a bread loaf! you're excused for getting excited over them :d
what exactly did you google to figure this out? why is there a dog on my bus do dogs in seattle ride busses how to buy a dog bus pass in seattle i really can't imagine any of these leading to a good answer.
if you ride the bus enough you learn to recognize the area. the dog knows the area and probably the smells too. it's like riding the bus back from school as a kid. you weren't told when to get off. you just knew your stop.
i was thinking before that owner is lazy to do this but when i read that his friends go down to get her feels like he is sick.
i had a brown shit day, i dont think ive ever had a blue shit day.
i always feel bad for owners that are stuck at work all day while their pets are at home.
literally what i tell my pups . "daddy must go work for treats! " seems to pacify them
hmm. i hope there's lots of other doggos for her to play with
just proves that if you are famous, law doesn't apply to you.
yeah i don't think anyone actually read the article, the dog doesn't actually just go to the park by itself she just goes ahead of the owner.
heaps of people ignore poop at my dog park, people are really good at magically looking in the opposite direction whilst their dog poops. i imagine though if this dog is famous at his park for coming by himself, the regulars probably all pitch in and pick up his poop.
i can just see her standing in front of the bus sign, to see what bus she needs to take.
i feel like enough of the public knows her and would look out for her.
actually dogs have a very good sense of time. my dog tells me when it's time to take my medication twice a day at the same time everyday.
haven't you seen this movie? contrary to the title, all dogs do *not* go to heaven. charlie proved this by going to hell.
i feel like it's not that seattle people are weird, just that they are used to seeing weird things. perhaps that is because they are weird after all. so i went in a circle. don't judge me.
supposedly there are whole packs of stray dogs that commute daily on the moscow subway from their homes to the areas where they can best find/beg for food and then back home again after a long day's work.
that was a coyote in portland, though, on the max. love that song :) similar city in some ways though, and not too far away!
in the us they're protected by the migratory bird act so you can't have one as a pet, but brefriending one is fine. i think the hard part is befriending just one, especially since they're somewhat social and would spread word about a good human feeding them.
i use to live right there and i never met him! i was thinking about buying some fish heads (his favourite food) and something red and shiny (his favourite colour) and making a day out of it, because i'm clearly completely sane. talking my friends into the idea is the difficult part.
i'd imagine doggo eyes the door, looks at the driver, wags tail, does a tiny little whine, looks at door, looks at driver, eyes silently beseeching and wavering between anxiety, and joy at impending park action. i am again one with the pack.
same driver... every time is a long shot... either celeb status with the transit company or word of mouth by drivers
"hey look, it's my house, i should probably get off now."
my roommate's dog knew _every single shop_ that gave him treats. it's seattle, so pretty much everywhere has a treat jar. he knows every single one in the neighborhood. if he goes in somewhere and doesn't get a treat? no problem--he'll just sit there politely with a derpy smile on his face, tail going a-mile-a-minute until he gets one.
no. his dog is just inpatient and gets on the bus without him. he often goes and meets her there.
that brings up more questions. why would he not just bring the dog with him if he's already going. no matter how trained the dog is, there's risk everytime the dog does this that it'll get hurt, taken, end up lost, etc.
my cat was at least as precise as an atomic clock, and had eyes in the back of her head. saved my ass from being late many a time, and occasionally astounded me with her *knowing*.
til dogs have a better concept of time than i ever have.
live in tokyo for a while, then you'll really get used to seeing weird. i've got a neighbor who walks her two french bull dogs, a cat, and a cockatoo sitting on her shoulder. this freaked out my dog the first time we walked past, but they were all chill. time passes, now my dog doesn't give a rat's ass, and everyone is chill, every time. had a different neighbor who liked to wear a nazi uniform on the weekend. a japanese man wearing that is some weird shit. there's a man who wears miniskirts and likes to bend over a lot, a whole lot, in the meat section at my local supermarket. but i'm from san francisco and that stuff isn't new to me, just off putting. talk about real off putting... walking down the aisle at my local safeway supermarket in san francisco at 2am back in the mid '90s. i see a homeless man pissing into one of those big plastic bulk nut/candies containers. yup, seen it all, i suppose. anyway, stay away from any foods sold in bulk containers.
fact! as someone raised in the south it drives me nuts.
i believe canuck's owner nursed him to health after he fell out of his nest as a chick. he's still a wild bird, he lives in the open and has a other crow friends, he just comes home to visit his friend every day or two and brings gifts and plays around.
good idea, breed more intelligent versions of animals, that always works out well in the movies.
the dog knows when to get off. our dog could distingush between my fathers office and the vet based on a missing left turn after 10 min driving without being able to look out.
my husky recognizes every dutch bros since they all have dogs treats and they always give her a few when i roll down the window.
vanessa carlton and michelle branch for some awesome car karaoke.
the article says that he smokes a cig at the bus stop and the doggo gets tired of waiting on him so she just goes ahead a couple stops. seems pretty harmless to me, especially since everyone that takes that route knows the dog and probably looks after her.
so buy a donut. but get a receipt, in case you have some skeptical friends... when you get home, you can file it under d.
my cat wakes me up at the same time every day. it's weird. he just knows. it's not even a bad time it's 9:20 i'm just lazy as fuck and roll into work at 10 or really want to sleep in on weekends...
hey man, whatever you're going through just know you can make it, and you will make it. if you need someone to talk to i'm here for you
i don't think the intervals at which you take medication is changed by daylight savings time bro
to be fair though, there is a lot of anecodtal evidence in these comments, and none of them rule out the dog relying on external stimulus (an external prompt). in your case, there may be something that they see happen every day just before food time, like the news update on tv or something.
that must be a great way of getting the child to bed. "look, the dog says it's bed time."
when i started working from home, my cat would flip out if i didn't break for lunch and feed him at the usual time. he's also a fatty.
can speak from personal experience - if you feed your dog at the same time every day they'll pick up on that and remember, and they won't let you forget it either.
yeah try that line of defense at a spelling bee, f lee bailey. see how far that gets you.
just never come to austria mate. random smalltalk with strangers just doesn't exist here. i mean, if you need directions or something, everyone will happily help you but don't try to chat about the weather after we told you where to go.
haha no, even if you find a little friend he'll tell all his little friends and you'll have many little friends anyways, **and you'll like it**
your questions made me laugh, though :) so thank you, stranger!
worked out well for people didn't it? i love being in a society that knows how to create nukes and hide a bomb in my phone. thanks natural selection.
she is. that seat's by the back door behind the pivot joint.
we have that same internal clock, we're just more out of touch with it. my flatmate's cat knows exactly what time it is, and that he gets fed at 7am every day, and he still wakes us up at freaking 5:30am and pats us (with a paw) and meows for pets and food for the next one and a half hours, arrrghhh.
same here! my cat has saved my ass from being late to work twice now, when alarm failures happened. they crazy thing is i have a varying shift... up at 4 on 4 days and up at 6 on two days. she knows which is which. no one will ever convince me animals aren't awesome in ways we don't even fully understand yet.
jesus christ i honestly wasn't expecting this. now i'm in a puddle of tears. thank you for the kind word stranger. i've been under pressure for some time and your single comment broke that. thank you again. :')
i actually wanted to help out at the shelter for some time now and this might be my step forward!
i know infinite_derp was just derping around, but this reply cracked me up!
i actually said to her last night, "look, the dog is waiting for you to come to bed. she wants to help tuck you in."
i wake up at 5 am during the week for work. my dog comes and wakes me up at 445am. every. single. fucking. day. even on sundays and mondays (my off days)
omg our beagle does this for breakfast and dinner. 30 minutes before each she starts pacing, clackety clacking her claws on the wood floors. drives me insane. so i close her out of the bedroom or office because i'm the boss not her! except then i go feed her. but not until it's time! she is also a fatty. even with being on a doggie diet.
cats do the same thing. only they are assholes about it. we've got a maine coon and she expects her food every morning. if you don't she will swipe at you and eventually nip at you. not enough to hurt but enough that you do what she wants. the other is just loud. she yells at you until you feed her. she will follow you around the house yelling at us until she's fed. i blame the husband.
*sniff sniff* ahh smells like it's 4:20 p.m. better get my owner some snacks
well, at a spelling bee you are given the correct word already. if you spell a different word you cannot win because you did not accomplish the goal. where as we do not fully know the ops goal, so therefore how are we to judge his failure? unless you mean to impress your own pedantic goal on him? and call him a failure for not reaching it as well?
don't forget to add "post on reddit to get sweet sweet karma" to the list.
your comment made me feel connected to my austrian ancestry. i live in southeast usa where small talk is life. im horrible at it and always feel so awkward. its about time i visited the fatherland.
can confirm, i'm from dallas and i'm an elitist prick.
meanwhile mine just sits here licking out his own anus.
well, they kind of have to be. if a stray doesn't learn how traffic works, they get hit and die. if a stray can't move around the city effectively to search for food, it'll starve or be killed by other dogs. when i was in albania i crossed the road with dogs who literally looked at the red light to understand when to go. it was crazy! the older a stray city dog is, the smarter it probably is.
he usually drinks out of the toilet while he waits for eclipse to get back.
don't worry about it. they'll be polite to your face and then complain about you later back home or on their subreddit. the best way i can describe people in portland to strangers/new residents is that they're kind, but not friendly.
i can turn my arm all the way around and bend it. that's the best i can do
yepp, our cats, 0515, on the dot, every morning "hello humanz! time fer breakfast!!!". if you ignore them they lick our toes.. :o
mine starts to gently wake us up around 5am. she walks on our backs or stomachs,she will even touch her nose to our noses. if my husband isnt up to feed her by 6am, she starts jumping from the window above us onto our heads. a few times a year we have slashed foreheads or cheeks.
glad my comment could help you feel a little better :) really, if you need to talk about anything just pm me
our family dog that recently passed would tell us when it was bed time. he didn't like being upstairs alone, so he would stand on the stairs and grump at us until we went to bed. he would also get annoyed if you didn't turn off the light when it was bed time. fuck i miss that dog.
our dog is the exact same. my wife wakes up at 7:30am every day, even on the weekends (my wife is an early person, i hate her). some times if my wife stays up late and sleeps in, right at 7:35-7:40, our dog is booping her with her wet nose to wake her up. after six years my wife has learned to just accept that she wont be able to sleep past 8:00am for a while. if we close the door, she will sit outside and wimper, so we cant just lock her out. on extreme days, my wife will take her out, feed her, and just go back to bed, and then she lays on the floor till we are up and about. generally my wife can't fall back asleep so will get up after half an hour and go about her day.
i just hope all this attention doesn't fuck up this beautiful thing.
i'm from austria. imagine how surprised i was on my first us visit when random joggers asked me how i'm doing;-)
i'm sorry about your mother man, wishing the best.
just grow some fungus on your toes! cat will get full from licking your toes, and you'll get to sleep in! perfect.
as a teen working in a very hot, dirty job, an old gentleman told me this: "son, always remember that from the day you are born 'til the day you ride the hearse, there's nothing so bad that couldn't be worse." have lost two of my three sons and my wife of 56 years, and each day i recall his words. i have one son and two grandsons to be thankful for. be strong, you can handle it. :)
ours does the same thing- he only wants to be in the bed when it's time for pre-walk snuggles. but if it's time for snuggles, there's a 90% chance you're not going back to sleep. we get nose boops, heavy breathing in our ears, and a "mom! dad! hi!" paw to whatever extremity is closest and/or uncovered.
in the end i cant get that mad at her. she's an awesome doggo. and she's saved me once or twice when i forgot to set an alarm.
if only everyone was so considerate and thoughtful of their fellow humans! thank you for being you!!
the "mate" threw me off too. that's like someone saying "y'all go fetch some collard greens" in a brooklyn accent. very misleading.
is this a galaxy note joke or are you going to hurt people?
reddit is like my family since i just got a job in cincinnati and live alone. reddit always gives me hope back
it was a note joke and then an ironic "haha look at me i'm a law breaker" joke. thank you for being concerned though haha.
well. i can't say i'm not proud. gold on thursday
technical there's only one toy in one unless there's a cactus in that cactus that was in the original cactus.
it's a metaphor. the outside is how i act but peel back the layer to reveal my true self. me irl
barkbox is so legit. my pup had a similar discovery with a dragon toy of theirs from last year where he'd just been destroying it, and then a squeaky ball came out of the head. he looked at me in disbelief and jumped around the ball for a few minutes out of sheer joy
yeah bark box does this stuff!! my dog has a toy where it has a ball inside. i think they call them like tuff toys or something of the sort for the purpose of dogs who rips stuff up! i love their stuff!
oh yeah, forgot about the flower. she ripped that part off immediately
you're not alone... getting bombarded by pms from people accusing me of being a shill. rest assured it's just me and one crazy 8 month old golden retriever.
i just saw it for the first time yesterday and it is already one of my favorite subs
ever beat the boss in a game, and then he reveals his true form and his life bar refils?
/r/mildlyhailcorporate we had pup and bark box until recently. they did have some cool stuff. i wish manufacturers would stop filling the toys with fluff though. the dogs don't care if it's filled or not. we got one squeak toy in a box that had an ultrasonic squeaker so only dogs could hear it. that was the best thing ever, they'd bite on it and you'd just hear the little pfft like a snipers fart.
i'm guessing you didn't title it "me irl", because those guys will upvote anything. heck, someone could screenshot this comment and get upvotes.
yeah right, if your account isn't a fake shill account, why did you spend 4 years making unrelated posts to get us to lower our guard?
this has become fairly common. i see dog chew toys that have little ropes inside them so the dogs can pull the "guts" out after they've chewed a hole in the toy. dogs love them.
no clue but i'm tempted to tweet this at bark box and find out! they also had a toy tennis bag with 2 real tennis balls inside one month.
one of the top posts on /r/hailcorporate is about me because they thought i was a mcdonalds corporate shill after i did a pretty long analysis of the way a higher minimum wage could affect the fast food industry. didn't seem to matter that a good part of the post was shitting on mcdonalds food and business model. i come from a business analytics background so was pretty straightforward with publicly available info...but reddit assumes pretty much any time any brand is mentioned you must be working for them. to be fair i know for a fact brands do use reddit to advertise, but it's usually pretty damn obvious.
i'm not sure if you are seriously asking or not but it is a subscription service. not really something that can be on amazon.
just a box, literally any box, is what cat's want to play with.
lol! that's what i was thinking! i do agree about the fluff but i always have to sew it back. which box had that toy? that's so cool. we've only gotten those annoying squeakers that drive me nuts.
now the question is what is inside that one?
can confirm! source: after over a year of bark boxes i now have roughly a half dozen deafening indestructible squeaky balls
catch me in the screenshot! then someone summon me. then give the person who summoned me gold, but don't give me any!
yeah, but usually people get the barkboxes delivered automatically each month, so they're not choosing the items and reading the descriptions.
great concept until your dog eats it. it changes to 10% off when it hits the colon
well thats slightly morbid. i feel like my dogs would love it too, though.
it just comes in a box of random dog stuff, so there wasn't any explanation and i didn't bother looking it up on their site. pretty awesome though. i should check her other messed uptoys from them before i throw them out.
yeah but everybody else puts nothing in the middle. this changes the game. when my dogs chew through their toys i say "shit!". if i hit the sad cactus it'd make it just a little better.
barkbox have had a string of toys recently that i feel bad about giving to my dog. they are too cute. my dogs shreds them while they smile and it's hard.
...then as soon as you call them out, they just say some bullshit about how the sub is just about how a post *could* be marketing. i don't understand the point of spamming the link everywhere. if the problem is being annoyed by the ads, being annoyed by the links doesn't make it better.
my cats don't fuck with boxes too much, unfortunately.
that is the beauty in all of this. the company is counting on the dog to eat it. owner buys toy thinking they will get a coupon, dog eats coupon, owner buys new toy at 100% cost thinking this time they will get the coupon in time!
that's what my dog needs... you would be amazed at what damage a 10lb weiner can do! my house looks like a crime scene. #deathtoallstuffies
*sad* cactus. *sadder* cactus. *saddest* cactus. but then? what then? **what then???!??**
yeah the ropes aren't even loose on the inside. the ropes have to be torn away from the 'flesh'. my dogs love them but it really does look like intestines
my dog got a super huge chew toy in the shape of a money bag last month. discovered cute little plush gold coins in it while playing. they have attention for detail.
terms and conditions that may affect my life until my deathbed? ain't nobody got time for that! *clicks "accept"*
yeah, i don't think that i've ever looked at directions for chew toys for my dogs. mostly it's just squeeze to make it squeak a few times, to tantalize, and hand-over/throw to the pups. end of story.
if your dog shreds toys there's a heavy chewer options you can try too! but i know some dogs love tearing apart toys while we watch lol
to be fair, that bag is pretty hardcore! she still plays with it and hasn't come close to tearing up the bag.
she already started ripping it, looks like it's just the spiky green rubber thing with the squeaker inside :(
given that my dog utterly destroys all but the inner layer of their toys, i don't know how many credits he could get :)
yeah, they just show it to even more people. maybe they're the companies and it's their way of promoting their shit.
surely never put one in to start with dog never eats coupon and they always pay full price
i am not at all surprised by what my 80ib pitt can do. my backyard looks like it's been snowing. it does not snow where i live.
i'm guessing either 'depressed cactus' or 'vengeful cactus'... like a cactaur.
my dog got the cowboy hat. the tag on it read "for pet play and prairie justice only." cracked me up.
"honey, come and watch a movie!" "aw i'm sorry but i can't tonight. i just upgraded my phones os so i gotta go read the terms and conditions. i'll see you when i come to bed though." "you never make time for me anymore!" *divorces* are you happy now?
my dog prefers shredding. i've tried toys meant for heavy chewing and she doesn't care for them. she wants to destroy.
retain shit. fire the dog. hit the lawyer. got it.
my spaniel is like a surgeon for the squeaky parts. gets them out no problem from these ducks we get.
rabbits in distress legit sound like crying babies.
their social media marketing is brilliant as well. they have the only commercials i actually seek out to watch.
lmao my great dane is the same way. she will not be done with a toy until it is completely destroyed and stuffing is everywhere
retrain shit* like you tried training your poop one time, realized you didn't do a good job, so you're trying again.
i've never practiced dog law myself but i have seen my share of wolf law cases. should be some overlap there.
of course it's not, don't be ridiculous. it's governed by dogs.
my beagle is the same way. i gave him a toy with 9 squeakers in it just to see what would happen and he extracted all 9 within an hour. and he did it without destroying the toy completely so i let him keep it. he now snuggles and sleeps with it and knows its name, the dog is named after miles davis, so i named the toy coltrane. if i tell him "go get johnny" or "go get coltrane" he always brings that toy with him to bed. (he sleeps at the end of the bed, or curled up against the back of my knees under the blankets depending on the temperature)
i thought it was cute until my puppy managed to catch a full grown rabbit. then it all made sense.
ah! i specialize in bird law. step into my office.
my puppy chewed through both faces so it's just a huge hole with the ball poking out but i will take a picture when i get home from work :)
i got to witness my cat killing a mouse like that earlier this year. it was actually cute how he would whack it a few times, then catch it and carry it by its tail to a better playing location and let it go. until that head shake finished it off, so then he had to toss it around like a normal toy.
after reading this and reading the op i can confidently say i had a momentary freak out over how weird the word "one" looked.
thank you i was really hoping i wasnt alone in feeling like i don't recognize the word 'one'.
and follow up with an xbox 6s, then an xbox 6s plus.
yo dawg i heard u like xbox, so we put your xbox one x in an xbox one x box
how many lowe's could a rob lowe rob if a rob lowe could rob lowe's?

wait till samsung starts making gaming consoles directly
omg!!!! me too!!! truthfully. did you just smoke a bowl?
you know microsoft. the next console is gonna be called project pluto, and then when it comes out, it's gonna be the xbox two.
kind of in-between like the new 3ds was to the 3ds. not an entirely new generation, but not just a small upgrade either.

oh god i thaught i was the only one. i guess its a word we dont see often
well technically the name comes from directx which is used to play games on pcs "directxbox"
for me it was the word "box". such a weird word. bocks. bawks. bo and then x marks the treasure.
buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo.
this sounds like something you've been planning to do with something for a long time now.
you gained 13 karma for this, but cost others far more karma. this should serve as a lesson. only reply if you can add relevant information. understanding of angles isn't relevant information.
i have a math exam tomorrow and this honestly made me scared.
they could follow the *final fantasy* numbering system and announce the *xbox one x-2* or follow nintendo with the *new xbox one x.*
nah windows actually had a logical reason for doing that
you're telling me i can get a penpineappleapplepen with my xboxonexxboxbox?
scorpio is cool but it's too confusing, people won't realize it's the same console "generation"
source for that claim? sounds like you just made it up for a laugh.
true , looks like they were left with x since they couldn't use elite .
i hope they will take roman numbers into account "selling x xbox one x boxes"
for some items people may want to buy the box just so they can have a complete set with the box and paperwork. i've mainly seen videogame and console collectors do it tho, idk if an ipad has that much value as a cib set.
oh he'll lose his money for sure. but perhaps they deserve it if they are that ignorant when spending hundreds of dollars on something.
it just took me 5 minutes to read that out loud to my wife. beautiful.
as a mod there, i'm going a bit cross eyed at this point. we have a faq and "what not to post" in the sidebar filled with avalanches that have been done to death, but not too many people read them it seems. :)
you probably described it so many times that your words weren't making any sense to them.
if so, do you think you could also fit one xbox one x box inside of the xbox one box so that you have an xbox one x box in an xbox one box that contains and xbox one x with no box?
it'd be really interesting if the total karma count site wide balanced out to be zero.
new super xbox one x u ds lite plus 64 boy entertainment system
didn't up or downvote you, i just think it's really funny you're getting down voted.
one xbox for one bucks or one box for one xbox for one bux or bucks
it's super fucking confusing. i thought they might go with xbox 4k.
he just made that up. they explained in their announcement conference pretty clearly that it was meant to be an "all-in-one" entertainment system (gaming, tv, movies, social media, etc.) for your living room. hence the "xbox one".
it only took me 2 minutes to read it to her. what am i doing wrong?
"is that even a word?? nevermind, of course it's a fucking word" know that feeling.
i think the boxes nest, so you could have one xbox one x box in one xbox one box inside one xbox box.
time is a spiral. it's a circle moving forward in space, like a slinky.
you read it to /u/anon1984's wife, who had already heard /u/anon1984 read it out loud already.
it isn't very classy to toot your own horn like that.
it's the original. all other xbox live gamertags are derivatives of it.
time is a double helix of significant events captured on the strands of good and evil.
it's not really grammatically correct without the use of punctuation. i mean it's basically unreadable.
did his toon toot too, or toot two tubes t....ahh fuckit.
because marketing. we're talking about it, so it's working
good and evil are relative bi poles. it all occurs on the same timeline.
*skips straight to the stuff that's so inappropriate, it can't even be typed on reddit.* weeeeeeee!!!
i can give credit where it's due though. the fact that x-box one x abbreviates to xbox is pretty damn clever, if a little confusing.
all words are made up. even these ones you are reading right now. spoon. lawn mower.
microsoft was annoyed that people didn't call the xbox one the "the one", instead it was known as the xbone. the problem is that now they have the xbox one x, the 'triple xbox', or 'xxx box'. the sexbox, for short.
if you take out all the x's it's the microsoft boone
i assume you're joking, but actually it's true. which is why dad should not let baby do that.
difference is the victim in this situation is actually going to fuck his mom.
that diaper is empty; the line hasn't changed color, and it still has wrinkles that it wouldn't have if it was wet or poopy. *source:* i change diapers.
can someone please sync jim ross/jerry lawler's commentary about rikishi's finishing move with this gif?
you can only love them for so long. can't believe you lasted this long tbh.
"and i fuck your mom. whenever you shut up long enough that is" *face sitting intensifies*
yellow line on the diaper. this gif is a victory if you ask me.
i thought i was the only one getting butt smashed in the face!
i showed my wife this gif, and she asked me when i took that video. we have 2 about that age, and two just a bit older, and she thought it was me. maybe i'm your husband's twin brother.
kids naturally twerk. it's like the most basic dance move
god i love being gay i'm not getting anyone pregnant!
i'm also in my early 20s and have a 6 month old. i've gotten baby shit on my fingers and a tiny bit on my face less than an hour ago, by the way. unless you are an extremely calm and patient person after several months of sleep deprivation, i suggest against it.
yeah, he should throw him across the room and assert dominance. /s
then 1.5 years later, he gets teabagged by 2 toddlers
nah, clean diaper. that line goes blue when it's wet.
honestly, i find i like my kids the more they age. that's not to say i hated them when they were babies, but it can be so difficult to deal with a screaming baby that has an under developed stomach that's screaming at 3 am because it's tired and hungry but can't keep down it's food. i don't miss it...until i hold a baby lol.
i made your wife defecate on a table in front of 6 nurses and a doctor! spread. eagle.
daddy is competition for mom's attention. dominance.
it would be nice for my husband to find his family, he looks nothing like his adopted family (parents have 4 bio kids) and sometimes he says he would just like to see who it is he looks like.
my cousin (whom i nanny for) will stand in place and bounce up and down. that's his basic move. lately he's been dancing by running around in circles.
physician: "i have confusing news for you two!" :) :| :) :? fuckyou2258's so: "yes?... ???" physician: "you're going to be fathers! er. a father. and a spawn point. more or less." fuckyou2258: "..." :| :| :| :| physician: "so yay/gross? idk. i'm going to write a paper though! hooray!"
thanks for that comment random stranger. i just now made a vow to god himself that i'll never have children of my own. also, hope that pink eye subsides real soon! lol
i have 2 sons and a daughter (4y/o boy, 3y/o boy, 18months girl) that attack me daily like this. their favorite is to jump on my chest and crotch. especially when it's all 3 kids together.
"i haven't worn my wwmcd bracelet since 10th grade!" "stephen." not 100% sure we're thinking of the same thing but this is my favorite halo 3 machinima so i'm leaving it
i don't play halo 5. i'm a big halo ce fan, and played a lot of halo 2 & 3... still play halo ce though.
the amount of facial surface area for tea bagging will saturate. the babies might grow more numerous but their tea bagging won't scale.

the line can still be yellow as long as the shit is somewhat dry. source: my daughter shits dry somehow
i remember being afraid of a teacher because i heard she was mean, strict, and difficult. i was devastated when i saw i got her. but, she ended up being one of my favorite teachers. i think as long as a teacher is fair, students will get it. consistency and understanding and charisma help, but, man, just be fair. she also acknowledged you doing good work, and kicked your ass into gear when you weren't doing it. but hey that's just as important as paying attention to the smart ones like some teachers do. i should see how she's doing actually. show her how i turned out.
damn, i totally forgot about that part, thanks for the flashback.
if they fits, they sits. seriously, i lay on the floor when my back hurts so my son will flop up and down on it, feels like a weak massage.
is this in reference to something? i am fascinated by the exchange so far
have him do the ancestry.com dna test and see what happens
a lot of these specific, "lifestyle" subs are pretty toxic.
mmmmm yeah, i'll make sure you get another copy of that memo, mmkay?
you ever get caught on a chokehold and wonder where the fuck did that come from? toddlers are spoopy sometimes :d love my boys a ton though, dad just needs to be fit to stay alive.
i'm really confused why "dad i'm thirsty" is related to dick damage. i'm assuming this is a hilarious misunderstanding on my part.
tho the information here seem legit, your statement might be wrong due to the fact that you can see the babie's face looking at his father's face get smashed by his own ass.
woah, i thought english just wasn't your first language until i read the username
while there is only so much surface area they can cover, additional siblings can cover shifts to ensure 24/7 teabagging.
###crap coming out the sides of the diaper, splattering it all over his face
it gets better, i swear. but then, get this, it gets so much worse. have fun! source: i have a 3 year old. i've handle man-sized shit's lately..
for all our technology, we can still be defeated by a baby taking a shit.
cough cough incels i'm not going to link the actual subreddit. do i need to explain why?
that's an incredibly mature and selfless decision to make at such a young age.
oh boy i'm triggered. just had my two nearly three year old daughter wake up screaming, refuse to sleep and then grab my hair. boy i'm unequipped for this single parent thing. dad just wants to sleep. please. please...
i can totally relate, my two year old has been practicing jump kicks on us lately. its actually quite impressive.
i mean the record for longest interval between twin births is 80 something days, so there is that.
holy shit, you're worried about your carpet? secure your fucking chemicals man!
as a dad, i'll enlighten you. you're doing it with so. kid comes in and gets right in between you two. little fucker...
wow i thought you weren't green untill i read your username.
well i think it is in your country i've seen both trailers for you to get it online and then walking around a da to be fair 3 times before the wedding.
paging /r/theydidthemath we need one math man for the matrix population model and one math man for the surface area calculations. now!
people don't like to be reminded of the colors of waste. blue is darker than yellow, so color-blind people can see it better. they needed a color that would be hard to see beforehand, so that attention wasn't drawn to the line before it was necessary.
better than having drugs and doing a lot of children
we say it because way too many people have kids that shouldn't, and we should foster a world where only people that are ready and responsible should have kids.
since you are coming in saturday, might as well come on sunday too.
just remember that grabbing your hair could mean you're* the only one she can count on. in good and bad. hair-grabbing, punching, biting and cussing is temporary. you take the shots, but you don't take it in. try to take it easy when you can since that time will pass faster than you think. also if you ever want to send a message dad-to-dad about kid antics you're welcome to do so if you get too pissed to vent somewhere else.
great, i'm sure my son will start doing that next year. he just turned 1 in may and one of his favorite things to do is step/stomp on things. only a matter of time before he discovers jumping.
later on in life being the key point. kids are made of rubber and held together by dreams and glitter glue.
i used to have sex twice a day. but now its once a week. maybe. between a roomate and a baby, that isnt too bad i suppose.
holy hell, i thought your name was trevor until i read your username
i am a little confused about the hand warmers and the only dogs that i have to replace busted gas lifts are not the case of the russian.
aaaaargh rushing in to make the surface area calculations bc i'm speed showering to get to a birthday. (btw measuring in inches for this same reason, i don't bring a ruler to my shower..... often) /r/showermath ftw gonna use my face to estimate the faces surface area. according to a poorly drawn oval in geogebra and some dimensions of my face i can estimate about 61 in2 or about 394 cm2 (including the sides of the faces)( -34185x(2)+106x*y-14721y(2)+188290x+82238y=-65403 in inches) a baby butt could be estimated to have 150 cm2 surface with another poorly shaped oval in geogebra and a measure of a baby's bum on the interwebs. (-33x(2)+2x*y-8y(2)+784x-33y=3887 in cm) dividing we get that in one face about 2.6 baby bums could teabag. tl;dr: 2 comfortably, 3 with a bit of luck. azmplay out!
holy shit i didn't check my hopper until i read your username. and i'm trevor btw. weird stuff going on here.
i think the sentiment of them almost losing to trash teams in my mind and spirit, i have been involved. i am of course just a reminder that we are a lot.
unfortunately, this is how i feel as a poly-addict. it's a coping mechanism that i doubt i'll ever have under control. there's never a day where i'm sober, even if i didn't have drugs, i have strong benzodiazepines for my epilepsy so i'm not 100% with it. i've been off heroin for nearly 2 months though, so i've got that going for me. been trying to stick to just weed and/or prescribed amphetamines (can't focus for shit because of adhd/epilepsy meds).
holy shit i thought you supported hilary until i read your username
lol you already have a little bit of a bitch in the mouth and they forgot items for both cars in the mouth. i'm ready fool jeans off shorts on i need money too small like a degenerate art of my thumb and an index.
/r/nocontext is used to say that, out of context the comment is stranger, or funny, or weird. at least that's what i think
holy shit, i thought you were a millennial until i looked up cucho in a spanish to english dictionary
i am a beautiful person. the only way to get the best way to get the best way to get the best way
yeah but i think /u/shinyfrogeditor is joking that bringing a diaper to check your drinks is so common that it isn't strange enough to be in /r/nocontext
winston churchill, while talking about the plight of the british forces in malakand (1897) he had this to say, "the profession of medicine, and surgery, must always rank as the most noble that men can adopt."
weird how we don't hear much about the manchester incident though? few weeks later and it feels like it went out of the mediasphere?
i saw somewhere that there was an initial 2 minute response time for first responders, is this accurate? pretty amazing if so
yes, major credit to the first responders and thank you for all that you do.
not to mention ptsd. a client of mine at the charity i work for was stabbed in the shoulder by his brother ten years ago and even bringing it up now makes him get very emotional and overwhelmed. sometimes the after effects are invisible to the eye but just as impactful.
it's a misleading title. there were eight deaths as a result. i'm not sure if that makes 56 victims or if the deaths include the attackers making for 53 victims.
i will never understand why people wouldn't want national health care...
this needs more credit, the emergency wards that dealt with them and the paramedics are used to serious knife injuries.... we don't as a rule see gunshot wounds, stabbings and glassings are probably weekly for many casualty departments and paramedics in the major cities...
cutting policing budgets and legalising fox hunting..
seems fine to be honest. he was being quoted from his hospital bed in a newspaper i read yesterday. seem's like he's making a full recovery too.
what did he say about the local malakand i wonder.
please. this is england. a nice cup of tea would not go amiss.
not really any new developments. would you prefer the flight mh370* style coverage? there was a memorial concert, that was covered. to come up again the police would have to release an update on the investigation which at this point is likely very classified from a standpoint of tracking down known associates and involves doing their own internal audit into "how did we miss this", which take awhile.
not just depressing, but intrusive. i would not want the world to know just how disabled and disfigured and traumatized i personally am, and have strangers making conversation about if i can survive and/or ever be a functional person.
yep. imagine being a parent to one of those kids if we didn't have the nhs... losing a child and then being crippled with debt for the privilege.
that part is a bit unfortunate... eliminates any chance of gleaning any useful information from them that might be useful in combating the extremism / terrorism problem.
the attack area is very close to several major hospitals and a few mins drive to even more , so yeah it seems likely. also saturday nights there are often patrolling ambulances because of drunken stuff that kicks off too.
it's like government car crash statistics, only tracking fatalities... like spinal damage or loss of a limb isn't a big enough deal to track!
i'm sorry but your numbers are off. 280 casualties and 17 amputees. i take issued with the phrase "most of those injured will never have a full and complete life again." the majority of the injured will experience a full physical recovery. there were 3 bilateral amputees. fewer than 50 are expected to have lifetime physical disability. that includes the amputees and non amputees with severe trauma. if you are referring to psychological trauma, i am unsure of the answers.
that's 48 people that survived to make it to the hospital, and all of those were prevented from dying. the 7 that died on the scene were the only deaths.
someone on my newsfeed thought privatising the nhs would actually make it better as it would put people off from going, you just couldn't make it up
not a single one of them had to think "how am i going to pay for this?" they can focus on recovering and not worrying about whether they're going to lose their house.
i read this the same way. who pays for healthcare has nothing to do with survival rates of people who get the care. i also don't expect any american hurt by a terrorist attack would pay a dime for their treatment. it's not as scary as people who post full price, pre-discounted hospital invoices make it out to be.
i think here you can count the skill of the hospital staff and paramedics as being a part of modern medicine.
yeah, i'm sure all their friends watched and cringed, and then all terrorists vowed never to do that again. they don't give a shit about your perception of them. they'd kill you regardless.
no joke in the us we get the greatest trauma surgeons out of like detroit because they'll deal with 10 or more shootings in a weekend.
confirmed, foxes are actually the main threat to society
you have to give at least some credit to the media - there were lots of articles about the heroes (almost every link in my comment is a newspaper article). now that the attacker's names are known the attantion shifted a little though..
funnily enough, millwall are probably the most hated club in the uk, absolute scum bag fans. worked out this time though.
pretty sure you mean gerard vowles (3rd in my list)! saw him on sky news first too. but he has since given a few different interviews, i think.
you silly, that's why he posted his name twice! because they are twins!
hope you feel better soon! glad i could brighten your day :)
to be fair, if you go on the greater manchester police instagram page, they have been posting thorough updates daily. obviously as you said though, nothing too classified.
that is fine but it is important people acknowledge the damage done to people's lives and the severity of the situation. this is not to make us live in fear of it (aka letting the terrorists win) but to makes sure everyone realises there is an evil that we need to band together to defeat and not have everyone just bury their heads in the sand because it makes us uncomfortable.
only we have the extra bonus of having some ni tories along to back them up this time.
exactly. it's probably a better situation, now labour have more power in the commons to stop the conservatives from running riot.
i was arguing with a friend the other day. he thinks the nhs is in shambles because of the *immigrant crisis* and we should privatise it all to get in in order and work from there...
i would love to see how a va hospital runs but they keep cancelling all my appointments on me!
lucky you man! fellow american here and can't wait till i move out of the states, partially because of healthcare
people need to pull themselves up by their gene-straps, and put in a little effort before they're born. i guarantee all the people who start off life as poor haven't worked a single day in their life. i'm all for helping them, but they need to be willing to help themselves first. and first, they should make sure not to born into a poor family... i mean, why do so many keep doing that?
i can't remember exactly, but georges has got either 8 or 10 (95% sure it is 10) resus/trauma bays and has straight to ct capabilities at all times, let alone if they activate their major incident plan. hems can bypass resus entirely and go straight to ct if needed, then next stop is emergency theatre.
i hope to see more positive coverage like this when things go down in the usa. the way the brits handle and present terrorism news events just seems so different than here in the states.
nah that's par for the course for glaswegians. (/s, that's also pretty badass).
honestly they're some of the nicest people you would never want to fuck with. my old neighbour was a dyed blue in the wool millwall supporter. he was known as machete eddie. so known for the time he broke up the previous tenants' party, by coming through the garden and slamming a machete in the kitchen table, after three days of putting up with the party.
yes just checked, that is the guy i was talking about.
i am poking fun at the original list of yours that had roy in it twice.
if she wants the anti-abortion, anti-homosexuality, terrorist sympathising dup to prop her up, a fair amount.
agreed - she has shown a degree of maturity a lot of people haven't expected from her. she deserves a lot of respect for how she has handled herself.
i feel like in britain we have reached that point *without* needing to see someone's traumatic wounds and disfigurements.
and now just for my intellectual health, conservative in your sense is similar to the direction of american conservative, and labor is similar to american liberals, correct?
i work for the nhs in two london hospitals. not a single one of our consultants is white british. only one (out of about 15) was born here. without immigration the nhs would be in absolute tatters.
longer waits do genuinely happen in places with universal healthcare, the thing is that if it is an emergency you can just go ahead of the line. most people go to the doctor's for small ailments or long-term problems, so the wait is inconvenient but not really that big of a deal-breaker.
opponents believe our government would not manage it well. considering some of the things they do manage, it's a valid concern.
yeah, in all this political discussion about who should pay for the healthcare, everyone seems to ignore the medical suppliers that absolutely extort everyone else. it's like they know they can just charge what they want because the hospitals, insurance companies and such will just raise their prices to compensate.
super relevant, as an american who just finished paying the last $1000 of his daughter's hospital bill for her birth last august _today_. looking to move to a real first world country soon.
$200 for benadryl when i had an allergic reaction for the first time two years ago.
i was in canada when their parliament was attacked. they had a similar, understated coverage that was really well done. if we in the us want to see better news we've got to stop supporting the fear mongers.
and spit on the picture of them and make jokes about them being eternally assraped by whales and......the entire redwood forrest.
i mean, what kind of stupid prick tries to bring sectarian violence to *glasgow*. until isis get a football team they can fuck right off.
this is the extent of my british memes :( my british meme portfolio is stale
honestly there probably will be a few knighthood's that come out of this. i kinda wish we had something like that here in the states, it's cool that if you do something really awesome you get a neato title over there.
the dup are far-right nutters on social issues like abortion and lgbt rights but to be fair they are to the left of the tories on economic and welfare issues. may might try and continue to run the nhs into the ground but if she tries to pass any legislation which fundamentally changes the nature of it then i doubt she'll get it past her new best friends or parliament in general.
everyone will head to the winchester, have a nice cold pint, and wait for this to all blow over.
we have her for the next two years, max. she will fuck up brexit, and she'll be gone. it wouldn't surprise me if someone else wants to step up to the plate and be a more conciliatory leader instead of her before then.
don't disagree but i think the way they are reported unfortunately already acheives this glamourisation. after the attack on westminster bridge there was an (i thought) interesting call to treat it as violent crime. violent misinterpretation of islam or the cia is in his teeth fillings, who cares about the motive, the focus should be on the crime. think there's merit in the idea.
*mh370. and they stopped talking about it once it was clear they were never going to find the plane. i believe there's still a team looking for it but the indian ocean is massive. there's no point talking about it anymore unless they have a new lead. or unless another piece of the wing washes up again.
stab wounds are like that, almost fine at first then you start bleeding.
as much as i like to see that bustards dead, when you think about it logically this outcome is the best for radicals. just think about it. they all died in fight, wielding a weapons, so to other radicals they will become heroes. second, if there are no captives, then there is no interrogation process, no life sentence after the prosecution. no life with thoughts about what you have done. they will not be slowly rotting in prison for decades. i understand that a lot of people were in danger and policemen needed to act quickly but i think they could easily tased them to unconscious state. do english policmen use tasers in their work?
as far as i know, not entirely the conservatives would be the republicans, but would be in the usa context more in a center position, the american liberals would be the lib-dem in the uk, and labour would be democrats, but bernie democrats, not clinton democrats
but the daily mail says they're bad! what can i do other than vote for more tories and close the borders?!!?!?!!?!? and that's what they are banking on. it's what they've been doing for 7 years. underfunding to make it seem like a useless system so they can justify selling it off. same thing maggie did with the steel and coal.
they don't need to. i'm from another country with public healthcare, nearly open borders, public universities, etc. the internet is so american-centric, that you see this american conservative crap every day, especially in the upper classes of a country. i've seen some people from my country spout the same bullshit of getting rid of public universities, public healthcare, closing off borders because "teh immigrants/refugees are coming to take er jerbs!".
i'm in ireland that has the system you just described. for my most recent apointment. i had to wait almost 2 years to be seen for what turned out to be a relatively serious issue. i've heard similar stories from friends in canada as well.
it's implicit collusion. the health insurance companies get to keep x% of premiums, so they want costs to increase.
i should walk the halls of a hospital like a hot dog vendor at a ball game, offering benadryl and tyelonol at cost. "antihistamines! get your antihistamines here!"
i remember the coverage being very good. it was more focused on the heroes and the poor soldier just doing his job in a ceremonial position. when they did talk about the attacker they pointed out how he was a lone crazy man and moved back to the heroes.
there is, but they are given out rarely. no title, either, because the us doesn't really believe in bestowing titles on people.
the winchester closed due to lack of custom after the smoking ban. it's now a curry house. on another note. the smoking ban in the uk is the bizniz. went to spain on holiday a couple of weeks back and realised how great it was to live in a generally smoke free country. passive smoking is not something i enjoy, especially when i'm trying to eat a ham sandwich.
the dup are also anti abortion climate change denying nuts, we've gone full 'murica.
some political talking heads are saying maybe 6 months.
you mean cnn's whole "did a black hole swallow the plane" bit didn't restore your confidence? don lemon would like a word with you
yes yes perfect, i knew the discrepancies of magnitude but wanted to make sure i had the directions correct. thank you.
exactly! the sergeant of arms was a huge hero and even his role wasn't romanticized. they did a good job of showing how both men were doing what needed to be done.
news media go into crazy details on the shooter/attacker and try to find out and highlight anything they can. it's really dangerous and makes these people martyrs and someone to look up to for other potential attackers.
*hopefully* it won't affect too much, they have offered support very much on a case by case basis. it is not like the formal coalition with the lib dems where they could force their hand a bit more, such as the referendum on av. so i doubt we will start seeing nutty things going through parliament ot the dup's behest. they'd get shot down by many tories anyway.
we do now. but up to last night, politics in northern ireland was one of those subjects you just don't talk about, because nothing good comes of it.
well how do we know it didn't? we have to be brave enough to ask questions dammit!
fwiw we brits, and presumably the ozzies, say "pissed off" when we're angry. "pissed" is always about being drunk.
im no expert but i've read up about it since i moved here and i found out that it is more of a special forces thing, since guns arent really in our culture or life. many police officers prefer not to use guns (im on the phone so i cant link, but it was 76% of officers that would rather not have guns). there isnt a real issue in the uk with guns and if you're found in possession of one, you're gonna get smacked with the law.
well, to be fair, that was obviously a very untypical birth judging by that cost. that being said, its ridiculous that you pay all that money into insurance and still drop 13k. it's beyond ridiculous, it's criminal in my opinion. we are constantly being extorted.
that guy fired the kill shot literally while jumping sideways through the air like an action movie.
i saw a version of it where she actually ate a fish.
turn on light. get up. take gown. put on gown. look in pocket. take analgesic. take toothbrush. take screwdriver. go outside. take junk mail. go outside. lie down. wait. wait. wait. wait. wait. wait. wait. follow ford. enter pub. buy sandwich. drink beer. drink beer. drink beer. go outside. feed sandwich to dog. go north. wait. wait. take device. press green button.
just to make it clear the police don't get guns unless in special units usually reserved for response; that was just a survey of their opinions.
not entirely. my third daughter was a vaginal birth, no pain medication, i didn't even have an iv placed, she stayed in the room the entire time, no need for nicu/any intervention. we went home the next day. still cost us $5,000 out-of-pocket after i was paying $250/month just for my insurance coverage (through the healthcare exchange aka "obamacare", mind you). the insurance industry in this country is absolutely corrupt.
brit here, met a girl from phoenix, az. who was visiting here with her english boyfriend. she had with her a notebook and was recording things of interest on her travels and getting people to write in british slang. there were nigh on two full pages of terms for getting wankered.
pfff. anyone with any small amount of ingenuity can have that entire haul with little effort.
no, no, no, it's healthy because there is an apple in their logo... duh!
speaking of mimics, we have these treasure chests right? and we have monsters who have evolved to look just like chests why the fuck do we still make treasure chests that look like them?
wait you can replicate this? what's maintenance mode?
there's actually a door on these machines you're meant to stick your hand into to grab the snack can't tell for sure if it's on this one though
'this is my purpose? nope. nope. nope. take them all, and leave me be. i need some alone time.'
no, no, no you have it all wrong. you find the vending machine guy and tell him you are interested in working for the company. the best way to get secrets is from the inside right? so you get a job and little by little you collect money from this company. eventually you realize you have enough saved up to buy tons of chips, buy a car, support a family, live a good life, etc
if you break the glass, you can get free chips even if this doesn't happen.
finally, after years of not knowing what the second to last step was, we now know what we have to do for profit; workers comp!!! it's so simple!!!!!
i believe you need the /s switch to truly benefit from those stars.
just jump against it shoulder-first. it will loose a few and cause a little avalanche. trust me, i speak out of experience.
tell me, einstein, just what are you gonna buy with that dollar?
you are supposed to eat the logo as part of your five a day
those aren't the obnoxious biodegradable bags. it probably was no different than the rest.
poor sun chips - always the last of the variety pack to go.
and poops help you lose weight! healthy, wealthy, wise!
most granola bars are basically candy bars, anyway. except candy bars taste way better.
mimics aren't just chests though, they can shapeshift into almost anything and alter their outward texture to resemble wood, stone, and other basic materials, and they have evolved to assume the appearance of objects that other creatures are likely to come into contact with. so people liking chests is the reason why mimics often polymorph into chests, one could turn into a water well if it was in the middle of a desert.
when the door is unlocked, you can press a hard coded specific button or combination on the back side to enter a debug / maintenance mode to update inventory counts and such. one of the menu items is to test the motors one by one or all at once. either they did this on purpose, or the maintenance worker forgot to exit maintenance mode before closing the door and someone figured it out to be a jerk. it takes forever to restock these. (used to own a vending machine)
even if there is, all the bags will prevent it from opening, unless you jam it in and crumble the bottom bags.
scanner scan = new scanner(system.in); int quantity = scan.nextint(); try { dispense.vending_machine(quantity); } catch(snackoverflowexception e) { dispense.vending_machine((integer.max_value).e); e.printstacktrace(system.out); }
*(psst, you probably mean `'; drop table [snacks]--`)*
"at least you have a purpose, you stupid machine!" *uncontrollable sobbing*
as long as it all falls within that 30 second window...which for me it definitely will.
reminds me of that office episode where dwight makes everybody believe that the building is on fire and kevin runs over and smashes the vending machine open
thought the character looked familiar. the telugu letter for 'dha' looks almost exactly the same
more people die every year from vending machines falling on them than shark attacks.
i ate my phone because it had an apple logo on it. how screwed am i?
i love the taste of sunchips. i especially love how crunchy they are.
you read on the toilet, which makes you smarter! healthy, wealthy, wise!
the best mimics always turn into doors. no-one expects the doorknob to bite them.
so the stocking guy messed us and the person who ordered next is a jerk?
collateral damage sometimes we have to risk the few to save the many
"nah of course this code is temporary and only for testing." git commit -a -m "weeeekend!!!!!1111" ...
i'm about to learn telugu and it makes me so happy to see these random comments :)
the only thing i seem to hear about shark attacks is that they kill less people per year than something. sharks sound like total bitches.
then the vending machine becomes a bench press machine.
first i was like =( but then i was like, who answers the alarm?
you chose the toilet with the webcam. it's too late. you won't make it if you try and migrate to a different stall. welp. this is a thing. this is a thing that is now happening. fuck it, might as well roll with it. holy shit, they start tipping. asking you to... and *tipping*. holy fuck. healthy, wealthy, wise!
aha! so if we just carry a canary on a stick in front of us during dungeon crawls, we know that if we see a giant pile of seeds we should just fire arrows into it from the other room!
no the person who hit the button a dozen times to smash everything is a jerk.
maybe, but not on the machine i had. you first had to open the door, then there was an inner hanging door with another key that slid out and you had to press the button from there. it was behind two walls basically.
i have a feeling they're wedged in there from this. it might be possible to get 10-15 bags at the bottom, but there's gonna be a point where they stop dropping. there could also be a bunch of candy and some pastry snacks in the bottom, that stuff is usually kept on the lower racks.
i know a couple of sharks, they're just all talk and no bite. but vending machines are fucking savage
well thanks. now i am even more terrified of sharks.
nope. i've seen happy tree friends. i know where this ends.
"i bought all this stuff but the machine didnt give me anything and it all got stuck"
sweden, too. i prefer taking mine as berries. one blueberry. two blueberries etc. five? piece of cake! fifty? making a pie!
this text adventure went from weird to porn in a hurry.
what about a toilet? some adventurers may skip a treasure chest for whatever reason, but sooner or later they all need a toilet.
i remember coming across one where the *mimic was a really op suit of armor.* thing was, it was a special kind of mimic where it granted you power in exchange for draining your soul slowly. once you become powerful enough to warrant eating, it ate you. my friend failed his detect evil check. he felt really good about being able to woup everyone's ass with his item up until the point it ate his character, and all we found was the empty armor in a puddle. our dm was really cool about it and actually had us investigate. we thought we were trying to find our lost friend. instead we found what killed him. that dm was creepy.
i feel like the glue thing has to be a voluntary action, otherwise everyone would just avoid the chests with dirt and rocks and lint stuck to them. solitary hunters aren't the easiest thing to domesticate, but we managed with cats, which are solitary hunters *and* assholes, so i think humans could probably work with mimics. i think a few generations of hand raising would get some positive results, especially if they're smart enough to learn a language and/or learn to barter.
i think light shaking may dislodge the wedged ones since there's no support from the bottom but yeah you're right it won't be effortless
i know you're making a joke, but it's not funny. i know a few i know a few vending machines and they're pretty decent machines just trying to make their own way in this world. comments like that aren't going to help human-vending machine relations.
well shiet. who's fault is that they don't take their multivitamin?
"there's only $2 in the machine and the credit card scanner shows it only had a single $1.25 transaction from two days ago"
in finland, they recommend 500g of fruits or vegetables per day because they know people are smartasses.
totally doable. they can look like any object of a similar size to themselves. i had a wizard once boobytrap his library by filling one bookcase with dozens of tiny mimics in the shape of books. if you tried to pull a book off the shelf they would all pounce on you and eat your face.
you think cats are domesticated. cats think humans are domesticated.
that sounds awesome, do you have a character sheet handy?
light shaking is amateur hour, i'd have a coat hanger up there faster than you can say "back alley abortionist" and have chips for weeks.
if you need a multi line commit message, your commit is doing too much.
we're going to need some clarification here. does anyone have two broken arms?
maybe don't run your health care system in a way that leaves people unable to afford a basic blood test.
are you having a vending machine about to fall over on top of you while writing this comment? blink to confirm.
"it was on sale and i didnt know what to do at first"
"this sparkling white porcelain toilet seems a little out of place in this cave, but got dangit this deuce has to be dropped somewhere!"
jesus, dude. have your upvote, you don't need to threaten me
every place one ever lived has had free clinics that will do std test. you're surrounded by meth heads and hookers in the waiting line, but it gets the job done.
another guy walks up and you tell him that the worker said everything is on sale. both of you dab in agreement. worker goes to open it and you start pacing back and forth behind him dabbing repeatedly. bonus points if you howl like a wolf and kick your leg against the ground every time he moves a bag of doritos
why go spelunking and/or treasure hunting while you have diarrhea? how many times do you have to go and how often are you gonna have to fight a mimic while shitting your leather pants?
i've seen people comment twice or thrice sometimes, but geez...
i find it hard to reach them, i find it hard to take. these chips are really stuck there. it's a very very, mad world.
i feel bad now too, i've never written a song for anyone, but i'll try if it will make you feel better..... then something funny started to happen what am i feeling what is this feeling corners of my mouth they start to curl upward is this smiling i think i'm smiling.....
somewhere ariana grande just shuddered and threw up a little but she doesn't know why.
press the touch screen input. it will change from the keypad to another screen the says 'exit service mode' swip your card and try to buy an item. the elevator will jam and then once it gives up trying to cycle, the door will unlock. we had this exact thing happen to us, interrupted the process, and got 29 items for 3.50 (god damn loch ness monsta). we called the company and left the objects for them. turns out we coulda just taken it all if we wanted.
"you need our new state of the art, weather resistant model. only $10 plus maintenance fees."
you can always fight back by making your own sign! you'll save money (probably), keep them off your lawn, and flip them off with your own sign.
i thought you were going to say he held up his drill and drilled a hole in their door. instant peephole!
what do you use the sign to prevent? salesmen, or jw's
honestly, kids don't understand most of those signs. when i was young i used to think prosecuted meant executed so i took those "violaters will be prosecuted" signs very seriously.
but he can't knock on their door to sell anything. short-sighted thinking for a quick buck.
yep, waking my sleeping babe is the fastest way to get me to not buy anything from you *ever*.
it almost certainly *did* come from a craft shop. you can't make something like that at home for under $5.
why would he care about future competition when he can't go there anymore either?
hi sir, i see you have the 2017 "no soliciting" sign, have you heard of the new 2018 "no soliciting" sign, with weather stripping and rubber grommets that won't rub on your door?
i go with the generic "except for kids". ya some other kids may have chocolate...or pies; we got pies one time and they were good.
easiest pitch ever. "hi there, i noticed that you don't have a no soliciting sign posted on your property. for the low low price of only $5, you can prevent jerks like me from ever knocking at your door again"!
i'm sorry, when we moved into our place now we would have about 2 stops a day by solicitors. bought a sign and have pretty much had peace since.
i specifically don't buy from them and usually yell at them to help prepare them for the real world.
one of those pest control guys came by to my house not too long ago in the middle of the night and i told him "dude it's 8:54, who's stupid enough to bother people in this time of day. get off my property". and he left staring at the house with a look of what i can only call disgust.
"my 10 year old sign broke because no maintenance was performed on it despite several calls. can i get it replaced?" "sure, for a replacement fee equal to the value of the sign." "but i rent it" "yes that is how these things work. fuck you very much, have a good one"
like the windshield washers in the city, except they suddenly drill a hole in your door
next headline: florida man gets shot trying to sell peepholes
not everything comes with installation. profit margins are still a necessary thing.
the house i grew up in didn't have windows next to the door. the one i live in now has 1 window on each side that is about 6 inches wide and is as tall as the door. i hate it. people can see right in, but due to the size and location of them, i don't have many options for curtains. i can't just look to see who's at the door, and if someone wanted to break in, all they'd have to do is break the window and unlock the door.
for me, it's centurylink. i ask why they ignored my signs and they say "oh no, we're not trying to sell you anything, we're just trying to make sure you're not paying too much."
all you have to do is tell the j dubs that your house refuses the message and sound sincere. no lie they will make a note of it and won't return.
same here. bonus giggles if i make eye contact with them through the window as they retreat.
well, you didn't get executed - so i guess it worked out alright in the end?
i have a "no solicting" sign that also has a "unless you have thin mints" clause on it.
next summer, he moves up to telemarketing a new nomorobo service
i'd have had a window open and be on the lookout to open the door before you got to it. not risking it.
i've been making my own girl scout cookies for the last several years. all you need is some flour, sugar, milk, eggs, vanilla extract, and a dead girl scout.
could be a growing business. first he makes the no soliciting signs and when there's no one to sell signs to he offers sign repairs for previous customers.
especially if he did his rounds early in the morning and used an air horn instead of the door bell. i'm fairly certain he could ask for $20 if he used those tactics. (regularly 39.99 of course, but for you friend, $20)
have you guys tried living in a sketchy neighborhood? works for me. never had my door knocked on besides the pizza guy and the cops on rare occasions.
"i am altering the content of this subreddit. pray i don't alter it any further."
"hey, i see you have a hole in your door...i just happen to have a sight glass here that's just that size. turn this flaw into a feature!"
nah the headline would read: florida peephole salesman gets his face eaten after being shot.
my parents were the same way but i absolutely disagree. there are plenty of things i can do but i'm happy paying someone else to do it so i don't have to. examples: hair cut, oil change, making a nice rack of bbq ribs, waxing my snowboard, etc.
you can get narrow blinds specifically for those windows. and, install security film on them.
problem solved with ugly ass, wrought iron burglar bars a la urban living.
call the cops for illegal trespass on your property. they're breaking the law and should be treated as such. a no solicitor sign has been upheld by the supreme court as a valid notice that they are not welcome and thus are trespassing on your property.
what ever happened to politely asking them to leave or just not answering the door? my wife yells at me for not answering the door because someone is standing there. i dont trying to hide or pretend im not there. i just make it awkward like im intentionally ignoring them. they take the hint and move on pretty quickly.
part of me always wants to respond this way. "thanks, but please tell your god i've received a better offer."
i used to thing fired meant you would be burned. i was playing sims 1 and because my sims had missed work i got a warning saying if they carried on this way they would be fired. i was so scared they would come and burn my sims for not working :(
i tore one off when i was little and was scared the police were gonna come after me for it.
planned obsolescence, he took a leaf from apples book.
he is collecting residuals and expanding internationally.
selling uverse we used to use a line like that all the time when we knocked on doors with no solicitation signs. "we're just contacting current and previous customers to let them know about upgrades to the lines in their area and how they can access those improvements."
exactly what i was thinking. if they're already a customer is it still soliciting or just a follow up courtesy call?
i just checked the fridge and pantry and all i'm missing is the flour!
i assume it'd be okay in somewhere like namibia. probably not in the states, though.
and if they say no he can come back the next day and then i'm sure they'll purchase one.
see, this and nosy neighbors in nice communities are why i appreciate just a bit of actual crime.
-"the salesman will decide your fate." -"i am the salesman."
innocent home owner stands his ground and kills peephole stalker.
it's a door, not a dumbbell. if you can't open it without getting a good grip then you need to oil the hinges.
yep. my wife only works several hours a week, but makes $100 an hour. once a month she pays a young lady $100 to spend 4 hours doing deep clean of the kitchen and bathrooms. wife can do it, but the time trade off is super.
i am the one who peeps. ...wait, that came out wrong.
alternatively, live in a castle doctrine state and hang a sign that says "solicitors will be shot."
i would instead get my crusader gear, and charge at them yelling "deus vult!"
it's still an inconvenience. as some have mentioned, they wake babies, rouse dogs, interrupt masturbation, etc i don't answer the door, but still would rather they not come at all
you can put up no trespassing signs or tell them to leave. it's just soliciting specifically that refers to selling things. source: served an lds mission.
i already sold my soul to satan. no takesies backsies he said.
watching the apprentice must have been heart-wrenching!
nah, the real apple strategy would be to sell you a sign that could only be hung on a proprietary door.
there several laws against this for an actual firearm. this seems more like a gray area. like a shotgun rigged to fire when you open a door, illegal. nerf gun on an rc car, legal. this is somewhere in between.
hell, they could have given the winner like a $20 gift card for somewhere and told him to let them know if he tries again. actually, is that legal?
you can't shoot under the castle doctrine unless there is a genuine threat to life or of injury. so unless the solicitor is of a darker hue you'd be out of luck.
cities aren't allowed to outlaw door-to-door, but they can make it so that you can define what people are allowed on your property. by having a publicly posted sign saying that those people aren't allowed on the premises then the solicitor is violating a trespass law. the first amendment doesn't address the ability of peoples to use private property for protected speech, so while the city can't stop them from going door-to-door, they can allow people to per-emptively ban them from their property.
you should check your local ordinances. cops lie all the time. they told me that my no trespassing sign needed to be issued by city hall, and then wrote in his report that i didn't even have a sign. now i just follow solicitors around the neighborhood until they call the cops.
for me, any indication of the arrival of jehovah's witness is an opportunity for me to *start* masturbating. i am a devout voyeur with intense fantasies of secretly exposing myself to an unsuspecting public. since i am within my private property, and jw make the effort to come up to me, i have perfect legal rights to strip naked and furiously jerk off at my living room window. it's especially pleasurable since they're generally used to waiting outside for a while and hence don't notice too quickly, affording me the time to cum in their presence. it's gotten so bad that anybody who rings my doorbell gives me a raging erection. hence, some awkward family reunions.
or the whole town, if you live where i do. one year, the traveling roofers were so bad the city made an ordinance that anyone soliciting had to get a permit and were very strict about it. thank god. first ordinance i was glad for. i had a new baby and people were knocking on my door multiple times a day. even the "we're renting, can't make roof decisions" and "new baby and a protective dog, please don't knock" signs didn't work -_- i will say this, the guys that did our street were super fast. they did the house next to us and dropped a pallet of shingle in our front yard one day, did our roof the next day, dropped a pallet in the yard across the street and finished our roof the next morning. having a roof done is annoying but at least they made quick work. it was still good after the next storm so guess they did a good job.
my parents just did a metal roof. apparently it's rated for like 50 years or something. i'm excited to visit and listen to the rain. i'm waiting for a week of predicted rain before i go visit.
had some mormons approach me while on a break at work one day and they asked me if i knew about the book of mormon. i looked at them straight faced and said "yeah, i've seen the south park episode about it" and the guy kind of laughed and said "that's actually pretty acurate"
theblakesheep: "i can... mmrhmph... stop any time i want to. in no way am i... mmm... forced to keep eating." theblakesheep's host: "sure. here, have another cake."
i upvoted because i thought it was funny. i don't actually care if it's true or not.
i'm not muslim, but i would be scared of pork filled bullets. other fillings would be equally scary. no filling at all would also be scary. generally speaking, i do not want to be forced to "consume" any bullets. :-
he came back to me two days after we signed the contract all depressed and shit and it turned out he wanted to return my soul. luckily it writes on the contract: "no refunds"
and his buddy's dad makes and sells those doors, and hands him a small kickback from each sale.
i could be wrong but i think maybe airsoft guns can incur some of the same penalties you'd get for a real firearm, if you shoot someone with it.
while funny this is false. let's say you are sleeping soundly and hear someone breaking into your house. you grab your gun and wait and just as they open your door you shoot and kill the intruder. turns out it was the drunk 20-year-old neighbor that mistakenly went to your house instead just looking for a place to sleep. there was no genuine threat to life in this situation but you as a 'reasonable' person believed you were in such danger. under castle doctrine this was a justified self-defense because it assumes that the one place you have the right to feel safe is your own home or 'castle'.
unless you plant a weapon and sprinkle some crack on them.
i'm surprised there isn't a larger market of signs that say "we dial 1911"
those cookies are known to cause cancer in the state of california. clear cut self-defense.
correct, but the person i responded said to call the cops for illegal trespass. where i used to do sales it was not against the law. so the cops would be pissed you called for door to doors sales people. some cities severely limit, some cities say "no solicitors" doesn't work, but "no trespassing" does. i say this because if i come to your door and you immediately threaten me because you think castle doctrine or the law is on your side by default it might put you in a really shitty situation. just make sure you know what the laws are for your state and city. in my area i was allowed to go where my lines were. regardless of your signs (couldn't jump fences, but if i could reasonably get to your door i could sell). so don't assume your sign is empower by the law, and know what does work. i personally never knocked on those houses with no trespass, but just want people to know that those signs don't necessarily mean anything, but they might. so find out for your own areas.
won't you be my neighbor. seriously, i would love this guy as a neighbor. i would get excited about somebody knocking on my door. turn them down but suggest talking to wonderful neighbor. grab some popcorn, a drink and a chair.
my mom put up a sign that said "sleeping baby - you wake him, you take him." it worked so well that the sign stayed up until my youngest brother could drive.
we put one of those on a few years ago, can barely hear the rain. we were a little disappointed.
that's where the majority of the knowledge i have on them was procured from
that's why i decided to give them some time, it was nearing dusk, hot as fuck out i was bored doing nothing anyways so thought why not? offered them some tea and lemonade and got a free book i'm sure i'll never read. not an awful experience in my book. better than scratching myself on the couch
yeah but if you had to eat a whole loaf of bread you'd be not so happy with it
it's abbreviated like jw... and w can be said as "dubs".
i imagine just the threat of activation is enough to deter most solicitors: *knock, knock* *beep, beep, whiiiiirrrr, click* *robot voice* `please vacate the premises.`
then once they buy the sign, sell them on a maintenance service agreement. if they have problems with their sign they can open a ticket with our help desk and we will troubleshoot the issue with the sign. they can buy a premium agreement which will include maintenance supplies for the sign and guarantee faster response times to their support requests.
i have the same philosophy with people on the phone too. they're only doing a job so i try to be respectful. however, do not mistake my kindness for gullibility. i'll gladly talk to you for a little and be patient while you do what you have to do, but once that's over and i express my intentions, be respectful of them. otherwise, i will be an asshole.
my great aunt, a black baptist, lived in a mormon owned and run retirement home in salt lake city. they took excellent care of her, respected her faith, never tried to preach to her, and they truly loved her. i find that most mormons highly respect and care for senior citizens.
same at my uni, had two very pretty girls come up to me and i immediately realized it had to be lds or someone because that would never happen normally.
they do walk and ride bikes all day so maybe they need a full load of bread.
and for even more money we can sign you to a guaranteed response time contract
i've seen this before...open and shut case, johnson
that's great to hear, the gals weren't pushy, they knew my stance and we had (from what i recall) a fair and open discussion. i didn't offend them with my beliefs nor did theirs offend me. it was a very live and let live sort of deal and from what i understand is that familial units are super important to the lds followers. to disrespect any elderly is to disrespect your own
hot girls... tricking young men into doing things since the start of man kind.
you don't need a time machine! you just need a test kit.
lol this is my exact thought process, drives my wife batshit when she comes home from work at 1130pm and i'm asleep with the tv on. used to be a dvd menu screen looping over and over, now it's a "continue watching" button being slowly burned into the screen. best is when she turns it off and i immediately wake up and tell her i was watching it. ive become so accustomed to falling asleep with the tv on that i can't sleep without it anymore. i don't know if that's necessarily a good thing but it is what it is lol.
in all seriousness this post made me happy to know i'm not alone when it comes to irrational sunday anxiety that sets in when i still have 30% of my weekend left. the dumbest part is that around noon monday i remember for the billionth time that while weekdays aren't as much fun as weekends, my life is fucking fine.
"hi, hello? hi, yes. i'm sad to report that i won't be able to come in tomorrow. why? oh, yes. uh. i'm dead. i've died. very sad. i should be better by tuesday, yes. ok. thank you. i will, bye."
i had that thought too! we can work out some possibilities though based on the netflix line and the fact that it says "night" in the title. if each show is 22 minutes, and night starts at what, 5:00, 6:00... yeah i'm gonna need a little help here. return to your increasing panic!
right before bedtime when you set your alarm and realize it will be going off in four hours, after you tell yourself all weekend that this will be the week you start with a good night's sleep. :(
1 "panic"- gradual curve up from the origin 2 "likelihood of going on that run"- small downward curve 3 "netflix shows watched"- staircase 4 "sex had"- line running along the bottom 5 "will to live"- big downward curve
where the hell are there 36 kids in a class, so i know never to go there?
same! i stopped watching tv to get ready for bed, yet here i am.
but his panic curve is exponential meaning it will continue approaching infinity. yours being constant means you are okay at managing it.
plus i'm not even sure the netflix line is a function.
you're brave and strong and smart, and will get through it. and then it will be over!
this is usually how it ends up - which is a mistake on monday....
sunday mornings are nice. it's all downhill after 12pm though.
find a job you actually want to go to or that will probably be there forever.
because it is shows watched, so a show has to complete them the number boosts up, so that line couldnt be gradually declining but rather every 20 mins or 40 mins it bumps up to another level of # of shows watched
as a teenager i would stay up every night and listen to love line on the radio. the show ended at midnight, but longtime listeners could definitely sense when thing were winding down without looking at a clock. i will never forget the growing sense of anxiety that would build as i realized this was probably the last call of the show or the profoundly lonely feeling i would get when they signed off and there was no more radio for the night.
i'm quite partial to "the ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't".
i used to be the same way, but i've transitioned to podcasts. i have so many downloaded podcasts and i can't remember what any of them are about because i'm asleep in the first 5-10 mins.
and then your stupid brain automatically jolts you up at 6-7am on saturday because you know its the weekend.
but when you're unemployed you get to have that weekend life all the time and it feels like shit because you're not doing anything.
that's an early bedtime... 45 minute increments? 50? 55? i'm still awaiting the beginning of the early-bedtime stage of my life. trying to stay in the restaurant-job-late-wakeup stage.
but he did pretty much not do what he was trying to do for 6 hours
love this attitude! really good way of looking at it actually. i guess i will finish house of cards tonight after all
definitely not a car guy myself, but i am mechanically inclined. lots of stuff on youtube. even managed to swap an alternator recently and the most used tool was my phone to watch how-to videos. broken stuff is just an opportunity to add to your skill set. you can do it.
if you lower the bar enough, everything is awesome!
first thing i audibly laughed at today with 14 minutes to spare in the day. thanks for that.
no, no, there are little dips that line... if you zoom in a bit... a little closer.
thank you so much. i'm laughing and tearing up i because i can't believe how nice you were to help, but the chart is really funny! thank you again. i don't know gold works but in my heart i gave you one (almost as good as a real one). :)
lol! central valley in california. class size range from 30-40.
nothing is forever. hang in there, it'll turn around.
yeah you don't wanna be sweating bud light on monday's anyway.
oh man. i fell asleep to that for years. the anxiety when you were still awake when it ended is a vivid memory for me. gonna have to go listen to some old episodes now
scott pelley?!?!? jesus i remember when ed bradley and morley safer meant my weekend was fucked.
same, 8pm on a sunday. as much as i'd not want the weekend to end at least i'd have a new episode of the simpsons to look forward to.
damn, similar experience as a kid. up at 5am so dad could drop me off at my mom's place. some days i had to be up at 3am because he had to be in at 5am. it explains why i had such screwed up sleeping habits for many years.
holy crap, that one too. as soon as the simpsons went to credits and did the "gracie films" thing, i knew it was moments away from the intro to married with children, which meant parent enforced bed time
for a long time 60 minutes had the distinction of being the only television show that didn't open with music. i'm not sure if that is still true today.
i love how a narwhal is part manatee and part unicorn. makes so much sense now.
bbc radio 4 which becomes bbc world service in the late hours works wonders.
yeah pretty much me with star trek tng. i pretty much have netflix solely as a star trek delivery mechanism lol
i had a roommate do that while they were *in* the shower. got home from uni early, someone in the shower, went and started playing games. girlfriend got home 4 hours later, an hour after that said "someone is still in the shower". i did a cartoon double take "ok... wait *still*?" went in and he was fetal position under the ice cold shower. turned it off and got him into bed but what bothers me to this day is how many of the other 5 or so hours we were all out was he in there for?
you have a good recommendation for a sound machine? my bedroom window lets in too much sound from the street, so i was thinking of one for noise substitution
"yes, that's correct. a serial rapist on the loose in the area that u/wisertime07 lives in. believed to be armed and incredibly adept at sneaking into people's windows at night. it's gonna be a long night..." "that's what *she* said!" i don't really know how the police talk on radios...
oh that's torture. happen since i was at school. you hate waking up when you have stuff to do, and you walk around in the morning wishing you could just get back into bed. but on the weekend, you're brain is just like "hey we can do stuff". it get's to the point where you don't even wan't to be in bed anymore even though it's 7:36, so you just get up and sit there with a coffee on reddit.
what're you talking about? there is no ftfy option
no, it feels like shit because you know you aren't making money. if money wasn't concern then you wouldn't feel that way.
he spent 6 hours figuring out what doesn't work fixing the a/c. he's that much closer to fixing it.
i don't think you're worth begging someone to be with you. take the time to heal, work on self-improvement, and later you'll find someone that's begging to be with you. good luck friend!
ah, it's obvious. the car is broken. have you tried fixing it?
not worth it. sleep is important. finish the show tomorrow.
those are just the moments you're starting to get drunk, before you're really drunk and depressed again.
glad i could help! you can thank me by helping someone else have a good day. :)
cus sunday's are depressing as shit knowing that you can't stay up late and it's only a matter of time before the day comes to an end.
slow down buddy. he needs to focus on the basics of labeling his axes before moving on to such advanced concepts like dots and dashes.
that show was awesome. when i started having sex i used all the condoms. no accidental kids or diseases. thanks dr. drew!
"shhhh" bum bum bum ta dum tah dum be bummmmm... didn't really want to remember these feelings.
the secret is to ask for them well done. infinitely better for much longer
obviously you've had some delicious cardboard in your life
yes! the soothing voices are amazing. i also enjoy fresh air from npr.
see i used to do this, but the problem is the episodes are an hour (i.e. 45 min) long. and sometimes you hit a two-parter, then you're really fucked...
simply buy yourself a fan! they cost a lot less than a fancy non repeating white noise machine and have a lovely brown-noise tone.
then you don't, and even though you've been avoiding looking at the clock for hours, now that the timer has hit your brain does the math in the background and it just ruins any enjoyment the tv had given you up until that point.
did you throw the darth plagueis copypasta into google translate and turn it to japanese and back...?
chin left fella. just because you didn't fix it doesn't mean you didn't make it worse.
you know, thomas edison tried and failed nearly 2000 times to develop the carbonized cotton thread filament for the incandescent light bulb. and when asked about it, he said, "i didn't fail; i found out 2000 ways how *not* to make a lightbulb. i only needed one way to make it work."
those bottles come with the right size nozzle. i don't think you could hook it up on the wrong side without really trying to.
have one, not enough pressure to get a reading, but can't get enough freon into the system to get enough pressure for a reading.
you won't find reasonable and responsible people on at this hour, we would already be asleep if we were willing to listen
exactly, what i was going to say. i just don't know about that musician line. it seems to me it should follow the scientist line up 3/4s of the way, then inversely regress.
well done was still pretty bad, in my book. no flavor there.
eh, five guys fries are alright. the ones at smash burger are delicious though. and red robin's fries are great too, but only if you put their seasoning on them.
when we went on trips, my dad knew how to shut us kids up. he would put on npr and we were asleep in no time. garrison keillor is my sandman.
wait til you hear the story of darth plagueis the wild...
you must not be familiar with backstroke of the west, where some pirate took the entire episode iii, threw it into google translate, and turned it into chinese and back.
might be obvious questions... -you're def using the correct valve (vacuum)? -you're turning the can upside down and slowly rotating it back and forth 45* or so? -does the hose you're using have a valve that pierces the can?
wow my daughter's kindergarten class only had 17. which i think ia pretty average. it goes up as the school level goes up but 40 to 1 in elementary blows my mind.
does the regression reflect classical and studio musicians?
i couldn't say it better myself. it might be worth noting that i ask for fries well done at all the fast food places. always. better.
i'd like to order a large fry at five guys, then bring them to smash burger and have them smash them up with the olive oil, rosemary and garlic
microwave the fries for a few minutes first. that's the secret.
he could control the fraternities... to create... life.
my friends and i accidentally ended up watching the whole thing after only meaning to look at about 10 minutes. it was amazing.
ya know, people don't think it be like it be, but it do.
get a neapolitan milkshake, it's all 3 flavors in one. it's like a sampler platter but for milkshakes
the secret is actually to fire them twice. the first time is to actually cook them. then you pull them out, pat them dry, give them a few minutes and then you try them again til they're golden.
bob saget mild? i take it you've never seen his stand-up.
the first time i went camping i just assumed the rainfly for my hammock was asymmetrical. nope. i was just dumb.
pizzagate? just because it was on reddit doesn't mean it was started here or the site and users bear responsibility. didn't start here and the sub was banned before the shooting.
favorite ice-cream...makes sense it would be a great shake!
i spent an afternoon with adam west in about '95 shooting a celebrity test drive article for bikini magazine. we shot it up by the old batcave entrance in griffith park. the coolest thing was his voice. it just drips coolness.
another good cameo is the brave and the bold episode chill of the night! where he plays thomas wayne. (also features kevin conroy as the phantom stranger in a wager with mark hamill as the spectre)
was too young to enjoy his older work but i loved him in family guy. rip mayor west :(
some days you just can't get rid of a bomb - adam west
adam west was the batman we deserved, just not the one we needed
seems like he knew how to make and take a joke on himself. was always a joy on the show. rip :(
a batman? west actually believed he was *the* batman.
where did you hide that he didn't know you were there week after week?
you do realize the show is an intentional comedy right?
i will never forget his role as catman in fairly odd parents. that was the first role i saw him in.
growing up in the 1990's, i was (and still am) a huge batman fan. one weekend fx had a marathon of the old batman series and my uncle taped about a dozen episodes for me. i watched them so much my mom plotted to destroy the tape just so she didn't have to hear the nananana batman! theme again. i just adored his version of batman and how he got out of all those menacing traps. truly a cherished childhood memory. thanks mr. west.
ralph garman already took care of that a year or two ago.
if i remember rightly, he got his star. part of the campaign was organised by ralph garman (the radio comic of ... three voices?) and co-host of kevin smiths podcast hollywood babble-on. he will be missed.
yep! amazing episode, by the way... one of the best batman episodes from any show in my opinion. written by paul dini who did many of the great btas episodes.
ikr, the animated series was a staple of my after school tv schedule...but i was way too young at that point to know that it was adam west doing the voice of the grey ghost. it makes so much more sense now.
and cat man in fairly odd parents... and technically he played himself too.
i'm at intermission for my twins first dance recital. i really didn't expect anything this sad. adam west never ran from the campy fun characters he did, and we love him for it.
much of his older work is available on netflix and such. that's how my ex and i watched it.
creamed corn, i brought it from home. i don't like the corn they have here, it's too crunchy. - adam west
"why, 'adam west, mauhstuh wayne?" "adam west frightens me alfred....its time my enemies share my dread" *throws adam westerang*
he just had the perfect voice to sound naturally unintelligent
he did the same thing with patrick stewart. say what you want about him, but he idolizes some cool people.
what a ridiculous name for a cat! paul! that's a person's name! a person's name!
*i'll come out when they're all gone*
as much as i love west, kevin conroy will always be *the* batman to me. west's death still hits pretty hard though. there isn't a single role he's done that i haven't enjoyed.
i think murder she wrote was closer to the inspiration for castle since castle is basically the same plot but in new york and not as sexy
of course he knows. he means that playing a camp comedy role like batman '66 is surprisingly tricky to get right. winking at the camera ruins the humor.
if you're using reddit is fun you can click on one hyperlink in the comment and hit "next" to scroll through the rest of the links in the comment.
if you want more batman 66 goodness, dc released batman: return of the caped crusader, an animated new movie featuring adam west and burt ward as if the show never ended. it's on at the same bat time, same bat channel!
"put the costume on, the girls said they want to see it" "a-adam wh-what? girls? costume? what's going on?" "my hotel room. batman and robin have a case that takes serious manpower" cut to adam west flopping around in half a batman costume with 4 naked chicks while robin stands in the corner with a look of horror
batman....where....where is my...uuhhh....other half of my face?
he's more or less just a crime boss. i'm not sure he works as a recurring character, but i think its been implied that batman let's certain organized crime operate because the power vacuum that would be left if he took them down would cause a lot of bloodshed.
yep, he was behind the push. i'm glad he got a star. the man deserved it. thanks for the follow up.
if only english worked so that we could say batman animated the series. it would spell out bats, and make that much more sense.
dini was also involved with arkham asylum. there is a reason, why all of the 4 games were that good.
it also has one of the best interpretations of aquaman. not that serious aquaman is bad, but he'll now always feel incomplete without platelet, chum.
is fairly odd parents even still making new episodes?
but how messed that it kept him from working in hollywood.
"i don't normally say this...but you could be my partner."
"aaaaaah! i'm going to get all of the 'a's out of my body."
na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na west man!
i mean, whether or not you enjoy his brand of humor, the dude is wildly successful and is friends with a lot of talented and interesting people. he's clearly doing something right.
"inflatable rafts, bring inflatable rafts, we'll need them when we hit the underground city of the mole men." adam west
kc might be the batman, but aw will always be batman. and he will always be my first batman.
how could it not? cornell dying should hit every music fan hard
i have to point out to you guys that batman only seemed campy in its novelty of having grown men playing at comic book heroes and crazy villains, and not because they made some silly version of the character. the first episode of batman was panel-for-panel, word-for-word batman #171. that *was* batman.
bat....man....where....istheother....side.......ofmyface?
well maybe if he got off his ass and defeated all the crime bosses he wouldn't have that problem. **/s**
it's the title we need, but not the title we deserve?
that freaking episode. i never thought i'd cry over a blood cell. god damn.
he wasn't the first and won't be the last to be typecast. keep in mind that a lot of typecasting is also fairly innocent in intention. you have an actor or actress that is super tied into a very successful role. you don't know if the audience will relate to them but you also probably have to pay them more than an unknown talent who you just don't know if the audience will relate to. so may as well save some money. fez isn't rolling in academy award nominations.
you should watch his bio doc "starring adam west" he talks about not getting work and going back home and living on a farm and how tough things got. he talks about how he went to car shows dressed up like batman to earn money after the show ended. it's really good doc that's worth watching.
fisher was on family guy ? edit : huh, til edit 2 : guys i got it. angela edit 3 : from the brewery edit 4 : peter's boss
"hand down the shark-repellent batspray!" -adam west
just how i love the great line at the end of the dark knight rises "some days you just cant get rid of a bomb!"
he was like the guy who voices joe. never changes his voice but still make a the character work.
dude is charismatic as fuck too and doesn't seem to take his immense power in the entertainment industry all that seriously.
right, and batman was campy in the comics at the time. it's still a campy and silly character, and it was difficult to bring that to life without ruining the bit.
he definitely has mentioned the riddler in the show before... i think.
woah, saints row reference, didn't expect that this morning.
speaking of fez, topher grace is also a victim of typecasting. venom in spider-man 3 was just eric as venom to most people.
he's pretty humble, too. if you get a chance i'd recommend his graham norton interviews. graham fanboys really hard over him and it's quite adorable.
he means the inherent silliness wasn't "turned up" for the show. i'd say it was even toned down in parts. you think we'd have had a zebra batman in season four?
yeah, it's voice over also so the production won't last as long as the animation.
has he? i know peter said something about him in that episode mocking "and then there were none." but the only time i think he referenced him being in batman was when stewie and brian were "climbing" up a wall like in the old batman movie and adam west says something like "this is how we did it."
the "behind the scenes" episode where peter was fired. west showed how they used to climb up the building with the bat rope
it doesn't help that the role was botched from the start, but i didn't think topher wasn't a good fit for the character anyway. even though it's not his fault, that kind of bad showing the first time out can kill a career. really i think that topher grace would have made a far better spider-man than toby maguire, but it's too late for that now. especially for tv, there seems to be a "curse of success" thing that goes on when someone does a *really* good job in a role.
the guy has had the pleasure of working with the son of the leader of the rat pack, princess leia, and the original batman. and now all 3 are gone :(
graham is probably the best interviewer on late night
colon blow and youuuuuuuu, in the morning. rip phil.
it was perfect for the character. when he's off-camera in their world he's still offbeat and explaining the wrong show.
i stopped watching shortly after they added poof, and everything i've heard about the show since i stopped watching it has confirmed for me that not watching it anymore was a good decision.
i always think of jason alexander. he can't not be george to me. and when he's not george, i feel weird and want him to knock it off.
doctor: mayor west, you have lymphoma. mayor west: oh my. doctor: probably from rolling around in that toxic waste. what in god's name were you trying to prove? mayor west: i was trying to gain super powers. doctor: well that's just silly. mayor west: silly, yes... idiotic... yes.
maybe it's a final destination style payback for mcfarlane missing that plane on 9/11
that was easily one of my favourite lines of mayor adam west. the man, the myth, the legend. may you rest in eternal peace,
it helps that most guests seem like they're genuinely having a lot of fun being on his show. though i suspect they have a few more pre-show drinks than us chat shows do.
sr4 wasnt under thq and we will without a doubt see another one. there's always gat out of hell if you want more
the worst was his criminal minds episode. god, george as a serial killer is just plain creepy.
"so it's a screaming match you want, eh? ahhh! ahhh! ahhh! im beating you! ahhh!" -adam west
just imagine all the meg jokes we'd be missing out on
actually its rights are owned by volition who was owned by thq, but was sold to another company whose name i'm blanking on atm. while we won't be seeing anymore games following the third street saints as we know them, we do have an upcoming game called agents of mayhem that takes place after the reboot the universe ending of gat out of hell.
hahaha when my girl and i were watching that episode we could not stop busting a gut. he was probably like "listen guys there's no denying that i will always be george fucking costanza to everybody. i am not doing this if i don't get to wear a long white wig and look like the colonel."
for the longest time i didn't even know what gary oldman looked like. he looks so different in all his roles.
"excuse me...are those bugle boy jeans?..." - adam west
i like the zoom in at the beginning. quality camera work.
i think it's hilarious that human babies are the opposite, and just think they have it under control but if we let them they would injure themselves horrible attempting the stairs.
agreed. that lookaround: "did anyone else see that?"
i think i somehow heard that dogs mind explode during that gif.
in my internal reading of this, doggo was voiced by sam elliott.
you must extract the file first, but you used up your free trial of winzip :(
you're going to get downvoted but ill stand by you while it happens. "doggo" is super cringeworthy.
if you want to sue somebody, just get a little plastic skeleton and lay it in their yard. then tell them their ants ate your baby. -me
but at the same time simon, the older one, was like that friend who says "follow me" then rushes to beat the red light and leaves you stuck.
dogs are used to train dogs a lot. for example older guide dogs, police dogs and sniffer dogs are all used to train younger pups.
mine literally knew what to do naturally. i was shocked. the thing just went up the stairs because it thought "hey that motherfucker just went like this, so can i" an also proceeded to go down stairs using some kind of reverse engineering in its mind. "if i can go up i must be able to go down too"
someone who had gold to waste and didn't give a fuck?
and now i'm imagining the matrix, but instead of the one, its the dude.
i thought not. it's not a story the human's would tell. it's a doggo legend. darth plageus was a dark lord of the doggos, so powerful and so wise he could use the stairs to influence the fur to create life...he had such knowledge of downward stairs, he could even keep the ones he cared about from ever entrapping him on the upper floors.
this is it. when we took our dog to a trainer he actually recommended doing this because it's so easy to just step on the leash if they're jumping up or getting into something they're not supposed to.
that's so sad what happened to that dog, so thanks for taking that dog in. was your family ever able to get the dog more comfortable to touch and not pee?
you should put one of those memory foam floor mats or bathmats at the bottom for an even softer face plant.
i wouldn't. i'd care too much about it and that would ultimately lead to my death as i go to absurd lengths to protect it.
we're not sure. the vet thought she was a chocolate lab mixed with border collie (because of her markings) but she's almost 8 months and way below the size she should be if she was a large breed mix. thinking there's a small breed somewhere in there.
i like to think that last one was a celebratory thing. something about those initial "bites" definitely seems like a cautionary thing to me. he only does it when the chance of the puppy falling exists, i.e. between steps, and he gives the puppy space whenever the puppy has all four paws on the stairs. i don't think it was a play thing. fairly sure it was to make sure he didn't take a fall.
step 2 is complex. the dog begins with two observations: the puppy is in distress, the instruction to "come on" down the stairs. it then recognizes the two are related, and proceeds to step 3.
for a lot of dogs it's best to just avoid them until they are at least a year old, if an accident happens an injury could cause permanent damage to their growing bones.
one of the dogs i walk i have to hate with tons of treats to get her leashed up. i often run out but hold my hand as if i have a treat. once she realizes i don't actually have a treat she reacts like salli. they dog is saying, "you lied! the treat was just there! i don't like this!" lol
i just did the math here, this comment is correct.
just don't let little children grab and pull on them all willy nilly. our breeder did, had to harness train my dog because that kid was so rough and abusive.
given that someone is actively recording a video of this dog i don't think he's unattended.
we had the dog when i was really young so i don't remember. from what i gather, it mainly happened when she got older and was loosing her memory.
good thought. also it didn't start happening often till white tile turned to black stone, a brighter cushioning of some sort at the bottom would probably be good (for her front legs which take most of the abuse from it, the face hitting is the secondary impact hence not being too worried about it haha).
yep. same with my girl, unless she's excited, then its boop face slide.
damn.. having been through several dog's life cycles, that's deep.
female labs are kind of small and her face reminds me of my dog, but im no expert
don't most phones just full screen it on portrait mode anyways these days? it only becomes an issue if the uploader adds those shit blurry borders.
putting something of a different texture at the bottom can help her remember which step is the last one too by the feel on her feet.
which i totally agree but this is still reddit we are talking about.
not really, she's already committed to the thought of there being another step, so noticing texture at the bottom would only serve as a nice cushion, not a forewarning. maybe if i put like a slight upraised cushion on the second to last step she'd notice after a while.
whoa didn't notice the momma doggo. and whoa, i just noticed that great reflection of the fire added in the glass. that's a well-made gif.
keeping the last sentence to yourself increases your chances. but hey, what do i know?
i think this is what the other guy meant. if you put something on the last raised step, she'll feel the change and eventually learn that the next one is the solid floor.
aww! she must be so cute (and her mom too, such a cute story). and for some reason i was picturing a husky! maybe because when i think of old dogs, i think of this awesome malamute in my neighborhood that lived to be 16, as well as another two huskies my aunt had that lived to be quite old. they were all such "dignified" dogs, i think that makes me think of huskies as old and wise lol.
i love how the parent dog is over to the right all like *"welcome back, i see you found the stairs."*
you buy it and then give it. let's see what gets gilded first then...
"god dammit i know this wall wasn't here yesterday! what kind of shit are you trying to pull here?!"
we need to get ralph nader on this, stat! can't have exploding puppers just roaming free!
lower the tripod like 1cm and it wouldn't tilt me by having the leaf touch the peak. amazing photo, but that choice..
beautiful fugi. will be my new screen saver. thanks a lot op.
you know i almost didn't click the comments for this, because i wasn't sure if the reference would reach out that far. i was mistaken.
felt the same.... birds and canopy of trees is either really far away, or the lower half is shopped in reflection
hey now, stop that you that's not how you make haiku it's snowing on mount fuji.
i was trying to figure out what was so off-putting about a photo that seemed fine enough.
man, it's one thing to be interested in cultures with rich histories. it's another altogether to wear cat ears and learn a dozen japanese words to pepper into your english.
it's not the tree itself but the ratio. there is too much tree. the tree and the reflection form a natural vignette but its off center and the mountain is not framed correctly. humans enjoy mathematical patterns. this is where the rule of thirds comes from and while the rule of thirds may be overly simplistic the reason it works is the same reason most rules of composition work and that's because a balance of symmetry and focus are vital to a good picture. all the photographer needed to do was take this from about a foot lower. the mountain would have been framed and the tree would take up the right percentage of the image. the leading lines of the mountain would not be broken and the intense orange of the leaves would not distract from the dull whites of the mountain top which should be the focus in the this image not the tree.
hakone is awesome. this is about an hour drive from hakone, if you want to make the trip.
your mom must be a girl because girls are always talking about how much they love fall
probably correct use of hyperfocal. or focus stacking.
i was scrolling and scrolling to find this discussed. it stands out almost like the uncanny-valley.
lol the tree above his head is reflecting into the middle of the lake.
i didnt realize at first the birds were added but i did pick up on them and think they were oddly conveniently placed in the photo. either best timing in the world or...
you haven't looked at pretty much every picture of mount fuji posted on reddit then.
... or the point is to capture the mountain framed by the lovely foliage. why does it have to be an error instead of an intentional shot?
when setting up a landscape photo you should never be distracted by moving objects though. frame your landscape and wait to see what moving objects pass across that frame if you want but always always always set up your image with the landscape in mind. the landscape is 90% of a landscape image, everything else is bonus. get the 90% right first.
the reflection is a photoshop job anyway so they wouldn't matter.
true. japan has a beautiful and fascinating history, but anime and manga is in no way related to it.
yeah, just positioning slightly lower would make the framing a lot nicer. still gorgeous though.
luckily it's still good after cropping it to 16:9 ratio.
thank you!!! using this for my cover photo in facebook
its still a cool pic, but slightly disingenuous the way its posted, but maybe its explained in the source and theres a language barrier :p
this is a reference to an episode of the game grumps where dan avidan makes the joke that all haiku end in " its snowing on mt fuji." i know nothing of actual haiku.
or any haiku. each one of them include it. it's snowing on mt. fuji.
i really wanna show my pictures of mt. fuji now. not as good but they're pretty good
it's also true that you can enjoy some anime and manga without going full wackjob
it's the same photo.... you're right it does "inhance it" because it was all done in post production.
thank you!!! trolling reddit by reposting this next week for karma.. #lifeprotips #jokes *comment sent from my iphone
for sure, the birds and reflection of the trees are photoshopped in, as others have said.
eh not really, if you're outside there is plenty of light to stop down and still retain a fairly high shutter speed.
me too! [whips out ms paint] i mean... you can post them here... or /itap or lots of photo subs... i'll be happy to upvote them! (unless they're ms paint.)
for a moment i thought you were trying to hire a hit man to "remove" your ex girlfriends
you are my ideal shitpost master, can i study under you?
another comment said f/6.3, which isn't really the f stop i'd expect for something to look like this.
man!!! what's wrong with you??? seriously... how did you get that out of what i said? why, do you know someone?
my teacher told me to write this stupid haiku and now i am done
obvious joke, before the nsa arrests me for no reason.
i just threw it on photoscape and then dragged them to imgur, not very hard.
is it possible to finger guns without cocking them first?
"i wish to stop hallucinating genies." "wish granted. looks like i'm real after all. there goes your last wish!"
alternatively, "hey, maybe i should revise for exams!" "or i could binge a netflix show..." "nah i should probably revise.
reminds me of the saying a good carpenter never blames his tools.
hey thank you so much!! i have heard wonderful things about your city
instead of second guessing his wish after being confronted by the genie about it, he defends his wish, so the wish was granted. hence the understanding in the 4th frame.
the man wants to be more sure of his decisions, genie asks if he wants to waste his wish on this, the man says yes this is what he wants, this implies that he never needed a wish at all, it was inside him all along.
the genie tried to question the quality of the guy's wish. instead of second guessing himself, the guy starts to defend his wish, and then realizes that the genie had already granted it.
hey thank you!! i know there has been an attempt to make texas stickers for messaging, done sometime after my original posting - but yes, you're not alone in wishing for an actual set! (along with some of my extended tx family!)
" it all falls on your head and buries you " " it's the currency of a vanished country " " it's all the currency of the world, planetary economy crashes "
it's two dudes pointing at each other like in the comic
"ok now i that i have confidence and clarity of purpose and still have my wish remaining; genie - grant me infinite wishes immediately." "here you go but sadly infinite wishes comes with infinite self doubt." "genie no why argh i wish this never happened" *poof*
revise? is this some kind of brit-speak for study?
i was under the assumption that the wish just turned him into the fonz.
i know of it! i'm an artist too but avoid apple... i primarily use clip studio paint pro. but i really like this!! tis awesome!
or maybe the genie just showed him that he already have the power all along... who can say
yeah i never actually realized genie said 'have a little more baklava' this whole time i had internally translated that as baggalava lmao
you could always wish for a 100% chance that every week you will find a magic lamp containing a genie who grants wishes
yup. i know 'cause it's all over the harry potter books.
totally thought it was an obscure fonz reference..... from one of many episodes i've never seen.
thank you for the tip - i love learning of alternatives!
to think about something a second time and doubt your original decision.
every wish also needs to include "also you can't kill me out of spite."
i dunno, i just thought it might be nice to start a collection of used lamps using my suggested method. but then again maybe you don't like having clutter around the house, so i think your way also has some merit.
woah... did you just solve a millenia-old problem with trickster djinns? that one seems foolproof, even in the face of stipulations such as "no wishing for more wishes". aw shit, unless then the genie is like "great, now i don't have to give you three wishes". fuckin genies.
it's on sale for like... 25 dollars from the smith micro website at the moment too!
don't take my right to be offended away from me cis scum!
this is how i've always imagined the three wish limit is enforced. you get 3 wishes interpreted fairly, or as many wishes as you want and i start being an asshole because you tried to cheat me.
i get to kill a cat and get wishes... the cat killing doesn't have to count as one of my wishes does it?
just wish for a bigger house. you can have a whole room entirely dedicated to lamps.
"granted. you have the ability to wish for more wishes. you always had that ability though, i just don't have the ability to fulfill that wish. you could always say the words though." "uh... i wish for you to have the ability to fulfill my request for more wishes when i wish for more wishes?" "granted. the only way for me to grant that wish was to become a mega-genie and as such i no longer have to take orders from peasants. ok thanks bye."
first wish: i wish for you to grant my wishes as intended second wish: i wish to be conscious and in good health for at least the next 24 hours third wish: i wish for the ability to grant my own wishes with no restrictions through conscious thought alone proceed to make up restrictions on your powers yourself and get yourself out of any bamboolzing the genie did to you
if you're looking for chubby sex dungeon victims, a gym is probably not the place for you.
marmite was my nickname in high-school, and brian may likes badgers, so marmite badger
i'd probably be an asshole of a genie until i get that one person that doesn't want anything from me.
or wish for less lamps! then you get to have that awesome collection of used up lamps, but not be burdened by the clutter of that stupid collection of used up lamps (whoever thought that was a good idea anyway?).
well i'm sure the fightingoreo would know... where do we go to find chubby sex dungeon victims?
the animated disney movie, right? i think so, it was titled aladdin after the main character, and genie was featured prominently.
come visit me in my ~~sex~~ oreo castle and find out.
right. the genie was played by sinbad. i remember it very clearly.
don't forget the announcement of "elder scrolls online: seattle." at some point it will literally be the only place left to milk for more money.
do you get to the oort cloud district very often? oh, what am i saying? of course you don't.
for the 6th time, but it's really completely different now, gib money plz.
and when you make the game, they monetize it, and you get to keep 25% of the profit.
seriously. it's almost 6 years old. give us something new, god damn it.
yeah they'll probably switch the title around, *skyrim: the elder scrolls* and the next tes will be *skyrim vi*
yeah skyrim was like my entire freshmen year of high school...i'm a junior in college now i want something else to waste my education on
all they had to say was "whenever we release fo5, it'll have the old dialogue option system with choices that matter" and i'd be praising them to no end right now.
the chief staff feed him life force if they think he's done a good job. it's all that sustains him now
when has a lack of story or believable characters gotten in their way, let's be honest
feels a little to me like they're stalling, like whatever they're working on is coming along more slowly than they'd prefer.
nah, everyone loved morrowind, right? why not use the same 15 year old engine with a few updates?/s
judging from everything we know right now, it's *barely* in pre-development
uh sorry you forgot about doom, dishonored, wolfenstein, and prey! /s
you can probably already stream skyrim from your pc onto a smartwatch, since you can stream it with a phone. skyrim running on the watch itself is probably less than a decade away (assuming that smartwatches don't die out).
so we'll have people on mars by the time it comes out?
in fairness, capcom also made three new main series resident evil games (their quality notwithstanding) since then, plus a couple re spin-offs and dozens of non-re games. has bethesda developed anything substantial since skyrim aside from fallout 4? (i would say dishonored, but i'm almost certain they only published that.)
i mean, the graphics of fallout 4 weren't anything groundbreaking like skyrim was. (which i'm okay with) they just focused on widening the audience way too much, unfortunately. a disturbing trend in new bethesda games.
the argument goes that eso counts as an installment in 2014.
elder scrolls online: spaceballs, the search for more money
i wonder if it will be ps8 exclusive or have a port for xbox zero xxx s
give it like 6 years and you could probably run oldrim in wine
by this point, the vast majority of people who want to play it probably already have. so it'd be nice if they spent that time and budget on making new games instead of porting old ones.
wouldn't the wii u be a part of current gen along with ps4 and xbox one and the switch next gen?
*uppercut sends nazeem the space noble flying into sag-a*
actually it's heavily implied in the lore, (maybe even outright stated if you take c0da as full canon) that in the first era (skyrim is set i fourth) there was space travel of a sort, and much more advanced technology. it's this evidence that people use to support the popular theories that the elder scrolls and fallout are the same universe, or that tamriel is a world on the verge of collapse.
yeah, zelda on release, and that's it. can't wait to try out the feet tracking controls though.
its to help the modders gaiz!! we are super cereal!!!
and the bad chances are more fucking funko pops right?!
no no, they pay you the content creator flat rate of $3.50. they keep all profits.
you don't purchase the engine you buy a subscription to it. why get paid $60 dollars once when you can get people to subscribe for $9.99 a month?
better yet, don't host a conference without content to show!
i'm starting to think bethesda want to do what valve did. stop making games and just live off micro transactions and marketplace fees.
like you, i'm confident that they aren't working on a new game.
that's arena. you're talking about arena (but don't play it).
curse you bethesda, forcing us to be productive members of society!
or that the new es6/fo5 will have a new graphics engine. that would just about sell me on anything at this point.
ehh. can we just let obsidian develop the next elder scrolls game?
that's why he goes with the safe bet and rereleases skyrim over and over again. can't take the risk of a completely new game if your life depends on it
exactly. fallout 4 had tons of criticism for being a shallow game compared to the other tes and fallout games, and was the lowest rated out of all of them, but it still sold more than any of them.
true but that will wear off there are too many developers making too many good games for bethesda not to pay attention. they had open world as a their gimmick. no everyone has open world. the witcher 3 wiped the fucking floor with latest bethesda games.
it's for their 'additional content' that is no way paid mods. /s
...do they not like money and success? i guess they're afraid they won't be able to top skyrim which is somewhat understandable but it's not like skyrim was a flawless game. use skyrim as a base but touch up the gameplay a bit and do some balancing and you won't even need to change much. it's not like you need to re-invent the wheel with each elder scrolls game.
i know you're joking but just for the sake of anyone who doesn't get it; doom(2016) was id software wolfenstein(2014) was machinegames prey(2017) was arkane studios bethesda was only the publisher. aka bethesda is literally another valve now, they don't make games, they just ask for everyone else's money.
i'm hoping cd projekt red will take over where bethesda left off with great rpgs. they outdid skyrim in every conceivable way with tw3. i know it came out 5 years later than skyrim, but i think it's a fair comparison since bethesda obviously thinks skyrim can hold its own with modern games.
i can see smart watches dying out before skyrim does
skyrim was not groundbreaking graphics. even at the time it wasn't cutting edge. bethesda excels in world-building.
it'll be exclusive for the ps8, but extra exclusive for xbox zero xxx s four months later. nintendo flippy dippy will also have a toned-down ps7 version with flipwise-featured exclusive modes.
yeah i think nintendo has been blurring the lines for a while now. i'd personally consider it a current gen console since the current gen still seems to have a few years left, but a next gen handheld.
the sun is literally a hole to aetherius that leaks magicka, that same universe theory is a bit out there, but the spaceship stuff is pretty neat though.
the aaa exclusives are all first party, and they *promised* more third-party developers this time! it's also lagging about a generation behind in performance, too. maybe their next console will be different...
maybe that's why they're suffering from calculus ptsd, because they were terrible at it and seeing numbers in a line of information they don't immediately understand triggers them.
its really amazing in the comment threads, people are *still* out there giving bethesda a free pass for this shit. "its not paid mods guise i promise! its totally free and cool! now pay up you little bitch."
bethesda is a private company and doesn't have share holders.
hello kitty horse armor guaranteed as minimum mod.
on the plus side this would be a great job for the loch ness monster.
bullshit i bought the game once and got literally everything out of it that someone who bought the digital awesome remaster xd ps8 version of the game did. i've been proudly bitching about this since the game announced its next gen ports. believe it or not, a lot of people don't like unsavory business practices even when they actively avoid them. don't know why it's so surprising that people are angry.
so much hate toward bethesda. i'm sure they are working on a new elder scrolls - remember how long we waited for skyrim? it was nearly two years i waited for that game...but that was 09'/10 and companies have learned not to announce a game that far out from release, otherwise you lose a lot of the hype and people keep pushing. they are definitely working on a new elder scrolls games, these games are just so huge and graphically intense, it can take 5+ years to make the game. i'd rather they take as much time as they need, then announce it six months out from release.
at least minecraft is a game that is built around a concept that doesn't age. legos themselves have been updated over the last few decades but the core building blocks are exactly the same. the same way refreshes of pac-man or tetris or other simple classic games aren't drastically different or better than the originals, minecraft (or some similar variation of it) almost certainly will be around in a few decades just like those classic games will be.
there was also the legendary edition last gen that included the dlcs. i think what most people are irked about is the fact that bethesda keeps hyping this up as such an amazing new experience when in reality the game is 6 years old and is starting to get stale/dated for many players. it's a valid point. think back to 2011 gameplay and graphics and how far we've come since then. skyrim is a great game but it's not cutting-edge nor groundbreaking in 2017. it should now officially be considered a last-gen classic.
arena. it sounds amazing. it sounds like the best goddamn rpg you'll ever play. it was revolutionary! (don't play it. it's ass.)
every year gaming is becoming more mainstream, there's a lower common denominator to be advertised to
the witcher honestly wasn't half the fun skyrim is and was, for me.
can you imagine bethesda games without the modding community anymore? imagine how broken the games would be
and i got it for free just because i had the game and expansions on steam. i though it was a good deal
who needs fire arms or high tech when you can shoot lightning from your finger tips for the rest of your life at the cost of 1 months worth of food? also, the most mechanically advanced race is dead as they power rangers the entire race into non-existance, and you can fly through the void and various dimensions with a few handy spells?
the 9th era, math weapons stuff is from kinmune i believe.
nah, reminds me of an acquaintance i had that would spout skyrim memes (or any game for that matter) without ever having played them. always talking about arrows to the knee and leroy jenkins like he actually did any gaming. that shit was annoying as hell...
what blows my mind is that being so mod-friendly has given bethesda the goodwill and leeway to basically make okayish jumping-off-point games and still end up with a title that sells full price after 6 years. is having permission to leave finishing their games to the community really not enough?
private companies still have shareholders, just very few of them.
except those are cosmetic and don't really matter very much, if at all.
and it's a permanent add-on that can never be disabled unless you buy the hello kitty armor removal pack for $10.
ooohhh, i see you need 10 credits to buy this 100 credit expansion. just your luck, we have the 500 credit on sale for $19.99!
i, for one, am glad they made a next gen port, ot i would not have managed to play it.
skyrim was only officially announced 10 months before release
plus valve transcended into not just a game developer company. it's a bedrock of a majority of pc gaming. what's bethesdas excuse? none
prolly gonna be down voted, but no. it's a misattributed quote now as some sort of norse phrase to get married. which was never a thing. it most likely was written as a sorta meta in-joke that skyrim got rid of oblivion's custom legarmors.
i've been hearing about it since skyrim came out. and before that it was morroblivion. it's never gonna be done.
one hundred years have gone and men again they came that way, to find the answer to the mystery, they found his body lying where it fell on that day, preserved in time for all to see
it's literally an entire continent that you can travel around at will! (stay away. total garbage.)
not to mention the archaic ai being unable to handle the situation. trading blows with something that's supposed to kill you gets you killed, but a ranged weapon defeats everything in this game.
they're fundamentally different games, to be honest. one is a sandbox rpg where you make your own story and the other is a narrative focused rpg where you play out someone else's story. gameplay wise there are very few similarities. skyrim has more in common with breath of the wild than witcher 3.
yeah i didn't want to compare it to fo4 since ones fantasy and ones sci fi. plus i barely consider fo4 an rpg. i'm 100% sure cyberpunk 2077 will completely blow fo4 out of the water when it comes out.
oh absolutely i think i he se release was great. i got it free too and i play it for the amazing performance increases now that most of not all good mods are ported to it.
retrace your steps to every starbucks you were at that day
i still haven't come around on that name. it's still the rose quarter to me
wow you really just put bethesda into perspective as a company. i don't like the direction they are headed
thats more owners than shareholder at this point and still make the point invalid as its a few people decision instead of the influence of a large groups. thats doesnt make it more cool though lol
also you can just buy what you want from other players, no randomness involved.
no they'll sell weird amounts like 48 for $5 and expansions will be 100 so you have the spend the extra $5 to have a remaining balance always. microsoft point were the worst
i probably would, but i would feel dirty and guilty.
i think for cellphones you have to click on the source under the gif
morrowblivion was released. it just took forever and a day
the ai handles it just fine, properly concluding "must have been the wind." just the way most arrow injuries happen...
same here. i enjoyed it, but got bored when i got to that big city and had to do the quests for the bathhouse place. i just prefer creating my own character with their own set of skills. i don't want to be just geralt.
i'm still waiting on skse, but am definitely excited to mod the shit out of it with decent performance.
seattle people are offended you suggest they drink crappy coffee.
i would, but i don't have a million fucking dollars.
you can only have so many places called 'rose garden'
yeah, but when you're a publisher with millions of dollars in your budget and you're using the same engine that you were using ten years ago, and theres still the same bugs and animations as the game you launched six years ago, you cant then add more shit people need to pay for.
that too. also, nice username. really like that character in d3.
lmao so sorry we treat bethesda like a vending machine because we want to buy their fucking products. oh woe is poor bethesda who has soooo many people wanting to buy the games they make, it's just too damn hard for them!
that's because our character is a horrible spouse and parent. although depending on who you marry they can go on adventures with you while leaving the child at home to fend for itself.
yeah the main reason for people to stop working on those ports is if a new game is released which would make people want to port the older games to the new one. if there is no new game in the next 10 years i could see oblivion and morrrowind being successfully ported to skyrim's engine.
5 of my friends are all dead with an arrow in their head, fucking wind
what?! seattle the city that is the home of the most famous coffee company in the world is pretentious about their coffee? color me: meh
hey come on now, that's just because most of them do!
on the one hand i agree that i wouldn't want elder scrolls to go the "cod" route of pumping out basically shovelware. however, they have the money to hire a team of experienced people to work on a new installation ten times over or outsource it like they did with new vegas so fuck em i guess.
to be fair, i was one of those guys who creamed themselves over fallout 4 on day 1. and day 2. so it took me 48 hours to realize the game was relatively mediocre in the most important ways, but that still earned it a pre-order from myself, and somewhere on the internet there is some praising comments with my name on it.
you are correct, i never claimed that any game besides arena forced you to fast travel. i made my comment before he edited his to say he was mistakenly talking about daggerfall.
when i visited the city, and asked for a macchiato i fully expected a starbucks one (i don't drink coffee often, but when i do i go to starbucks) and they give me such a disgusted look that i thought to myself 'did i... forgot to zip my pants?'
oh sorry, i had the percentage reversed from when i'd first read about. anything over 50% is bullshit, i agree. ideally it'd be 75% for the creator, but i can definitely see 50/50 as they're providing the platform, the payment processing, taking on potential legal issues, and providing a refund system. all that could be a massive headache.
i feel like 6 years is a long time to wait for a new elder scrolls game. morrowind came out in '02, oblivion in '06, skyrim in '11, and 6 years later, they've announced they aren't even working on another. i realize they want to make other games, but considering just how many people bought skyrim, i'd say there's definitely an audience that's waiting with bated breath for the next game. take us to black marsh, or hammerfell, so much untapped potential in the lore for games in other lands.
i enjoyed it at first too, but then i realized the entire game was built around repetition. not replayability, just repetition. complete these generic radiant quests over and over so you can get loot so you can build a better weapon to do these radiant quests over and over so you can get loot so you can build a better weapon so you can.... they gutted everything else.
i think the wait time, at least to me confirms that they are making a new engine.. it's a monumental task on the scale of making a game if not larger, and has no immediate return on investment in most cases since it's a base.so that could very well be the gap from skyrim. i'm hoping we have a new tes on a new engine by like 2019 at the latest..
ugh. makes me physically nauseous when you put it that way. yeah, i re-played skyrim right before fo4 came out, and i immediately thought the dialog and your choices were an illusion in fo4, even relative to skyrim. i started two separate games in fo4, and easily found certain exploits to make the gameplay ridiculously easy no matter the difficulty level. and on the second playthrough, the quests, settlement system, npcs, lore, and fun level were clearly just so watered down. and that is without any rose-tinted glasses and me pining for the "back-in-my-day" games. almost two years later, and i am still just so disappointed about the game that came out and the game that i had in mind (which was just purely based off it's immediate predecessor). this thread ruined my day.
but but now we can't be outraged! edit- who would have thought one smart ass comment made when half asleep would be my best ever. i wish real life worked like this.
why are we selling f-15s to any country that supports terrorism?
"we looked at the receipt. as soon as that check clears we're going on."
did he check before the transaction if $12 billion was *all* their money?
gotta supply the proxy wars to keep the cash rolling
the article says that this deal was actually approved during obama's administration by both the congress and the executive branch. i can't stand trump but it doesn't even look like this was his decision. i wonder what it takes to even pull out of it.
they know most people only read the headlines. they take advantage of it. there's no standards in media anymore..
well to be honest every single muslim country is considered a liberal when compared to the saudi arabia.
yes, it was authorized by both branches last november, but the deal wasn't actually agreed upon or formalized with qatar until 2 months ago. so, yes. he's still contradicting himself.
many trump supporters voted for him thinking he would deal with arab countries differently, and stop tolerating their bullshit. he now seems to be tolerating all of them as long as they cut checks. keep in mind most of the people that voted for him are not redditors who subscribe to /r/the_donald. maybe his already tenuous support base will begin to erode with continuous news like this
yes, both in neighboring countries and northern africa. then again, every other country in the region plus even the us funds terrorists. national interests seem to trump regional stability.
the difference is that obama didn't go on record on twitter blatantly criticizing the qatari government for 'funding terror' days before finalizing the sale. secondly, trump has full authority to cancel the deal if he wants to. the fact that he didn't is hypocritical especially considering he got elected on an agenda of doing everything possible to stop fundamentalism. so yes, criticize obama all you like for doing this, but trump deserves his fair share as well, since he's the one in power right now. i agree - context matters.
yeah, and we used drug money to fund a lot of it. the good ole days.
trump could have backed out of the deal like he has done with others.
i was shocked to see the truth at the top. i was expecting to either scroll for an hour or sort by controversial.
a country that can't defend itself with their military will defend itself some other way.
damn, i am so worried about the media. everything is so spun out of control i don't know what to believe anymore. i'm no fan of trump but what happened to news being about facts? now instead we have click bait and misinformation running rampant. i just wish i could know whats going on without having to spend hours wading through this garbage to get to the facts.
this deal was approved under obama already and congress approved it as well
depends on whether or not your approve of the deal. i guess that phrase is valid either way, it's just got some quantum sarcasm.
look how many views this got. one of the top post on this subreddit and /r/all. now how do you think it would fair if it was titled "billion dollar weapons deal approved under obama moves forward"? anything that can paint trump in a negative light on this site gets huge upvotes. doesnt matter that his administration had literally nothing to do with this, but hey, misleading headlines sell
what time does the bank open? 8:00? we're goin' in at 9:00!
probably that bill hicks was an amazing comedian and it's sad he's not with us here today. i just referenced him myself recently in some comments.
it doesn't matter who's in office we have been doing the same shit decades ago
not sure it matters. people with $12 billion worth of weapons have ways of finding more money.
no no, we're fighting the war to defeat terrorism, promise! /s
what continues to shock me is that people still support him. apathy is easy to understand, because at its core it's just a lack of any effort to care. but people who actively support him? of course a person can support anyone they want, but what could a person want from trump that they could trust he would actually deliver? this is just another example of trump being such a hypocrite that you could hardly trust anything he says, yet his supporters remain unfazed. it baffles me.
it pretty much _is_ how he negotiates, though. remember back when campaigning how he said he was going to label china a currency manipulator? then he kinda buddied up to china in regards to north korea.. and now his patents are approved, etc. he did this with saudi arabia, too. during the campaign he said they "blew up the world trade center" and wants "women as slaves and to kill gays." now he's making multi-billion dollar deals with them.
you can't use money to fund terrorism when you use it to buy weapons from america. /thinks
dude, second paragraph talks about how it was signed this wednesday by mattis. trump could have stopped this. but the article also says that the deal will take years and "they are confident" that qatuaris will meet the demands of the usa before they get the arms. still doesn't look very good, and people are upset about the mercurial nature of this presidency.
the sad part is, this is how.90% of news stories are written. it's all clickbait. you don't find the real story until you are at least 3 paragraphs in
idk, qatar easily has enough soft power to counter the saudi's hard power. mainly, they have the economy and diplomatic corps to outlast a diplomatic siege and the saudi's cant do anything militarily because qatar is aligned with countries that are more powerful than the saudis.
so.. does trump get "credit" for the sale or not, for better or worse?
truth be told there hasn't been a us president i can think of who has done otherwise but it's pretty ridiculous when you scream your lungs out telling everyone you won't do it and then just turn around and do it anyway
yeah truth was posted 4 hours after the article went up, so 7 hours of lies people got fed who aren't coming back to read the comments
saviours of the day: how the u.s. prevented terrorism by selling its obsolete weapons to qatar for 68,698,690.67 ethereum!
not to mention pretty easy for us to render that ship an artificial reef. sorry but a few ships and aircraft don't automatically make you a powerhouse. especially when those aircraft are a little outdated.
so the only solution to roving bands of rival factions is to give overwhelming force to one side and hope they're good people? or do we not care about that second part?
we deal with them for money. taking the moral high ground loses that money. that seems pretty simple to me.
if those military jets are used for terrorism the us will know that qatar is responsible. qatar not being stupid will make sure that those jets will never be used for terrorism or else it'd be grounds for a war they cannot win. it sounds like a sane deal to me. hell even the department of defence cleared this deal because it's relatively low risk.
yup and as a result we get a madman tying to kill off republican congressmen. everybody needs to chill out
paul mooney had one on the chappelle show years later as negrodamus 'negrodamus, why was president bush so sure iraq had weapons of mass destruction" "because he has the receipt"
he was the first comedian afaik (big comedy fan) that combined bits, special effects, and pa blowing sound effects into his act.
it's a theme throughout the special. he's extremely cynical. i highly recommend watching the whole special
or that he spends too much time on reddit. can't say for sure, the message from the universe seems equally probable.
perhaps by marking them up and selling to various factions. just like drugs, but with military weaponry.
the deal was for f-15 (fighter jets) which would be extremely difficult for terrorists to use. obama approved of the deal for good reason and i am glad trump did not kill it purely because obama supported it.
you don't cancel a $20 billion contract quite that easily, though.
the post gets a lot more upvotes and eyeballs if it automatically puts the onus on trump without actually delving into the actual article content. no matter the feelings for or against trump, this is a big part of what this sub is now. it's not efficient or fact based, but more of let's make comments based on a biased post header without actually reading the whole article first. nobody is the wiser if we all can't even read the damn article before commenting, and making comments based of off one person's bias towards the article and those involved. may as well be sheep.
all of this us involvement in other countries is justified under a declaration for military action signed almost *17 years ago* after 9/11 to send troops to afghanistan. we're stretching that thin.
they don't hear about this kind of thing. the right-wing propaganda network is very selective about what they let their people see, and nothing gets out that is potentially negative until they have put a spin on it and unified behind the message.
it's never too late to go back. maybe switch majors and do something you like.
exactly, i hate trump as much as anyone, but when i read headlines like this all i see is "trump follows precedent of decades of foreign policy."
trump is a guy who loses $1000 (total) at a casino but cashes out $200 at the end of the night thinking he is ahead. or wins 50 cents on a dollar spin and thinks he is a shrewd biznesman.
damn genius! maybe we have some tanks and bombs and shit were not using that we can sell them too. we'll just keep selling them weapons until they're broke. then we'll own them and they'll be defenseless!
is there any way to learn about this stuff? how as a citizen do i know what the president can actually do and when? it's like trying to figure out which pitcher gets the loss in baseball.
yes they can cancel it, and this was the fear that iran deal wouldn't he upheld.
i hope uruguayans are the new bad guys. they've been quiet for too long.
you realize it was an order of f-15's right? terrorists flying f-15's?
with it already being passed by congress and the executive branch was there really much he could do about it? could he successfully veto it if he wanted?
i mean, yeah. he could have said "no, they're terrorists," or whatever else he pulled out his ass that morning. but he went ahead with it, despite still saying they're terrorists. so yeah. he gets the credit.
qatar is a country. i hope this clears all doubts. next...
let's be real, some people just want to rage at trump. some media companies deliver. sad to see the fox news business model spilling over.
i wouldn't say they're obsolete, but their age is showing in their primitive stealth technologies. the f15 is still one of the most formidable fighters ever built. military aircraft don't become outdated as fast as other technologies do.
*sells a few aircraft carriers directly to isis* "alright, everybody get on these boats now. yep, that's right, cram yourselves in there."
you just explained the us policy in the middle east since the cold war. it's the main reason isis gained the power that it has today.
paul mooney is a complex individual. his standup is funny as hell though.
i like to imagine the us military showing up to iran ready for and invasion only to find that all of their equipment is in iraq.
i highly recommend watching everything her ever did
read the article, he sold fighter jets to qatar govt and the transaction will not be complete for many years...
why would you want to cancel this? qatar pays all that money for some jets that are old and used? additionally, we probably bugged them. seriously doubt we'll see is in one of these f15s. plus some goodwill, you allowed an obama era trade through.
you're right, but let's not downplay laziness as well. i think people are so quick to judge off of a headline not only because it conforms to their beliefs, but also because it's just easier that way.
the us has sold weapons to pakistan and saudi arabia while acknowledging they fund terrorists for over 50 years. terrorism is politics. the other is business.
never stop being shocked at the appalling. it's logical to be appalled at what he's done.
you definition won't see anything like this on t_d. if you post it, you'll receive a prompt ban immediately.
one side being mustache-twirling evil villains, rednecks and idiots and the other side being everyone else.
hell, when they were talking about the new health care plan, they interviewed a trump supporter who would lose his coverage. he said something along the lines of "we all have to make sacrifices for the good of the country."
the most positive comment in this thread. didn't expect to see kind words in a trump post.
he is the product of al qaeda and isis. he is the personification of their vision. they are trying to convince everyone in the islamic world that the west and islam are incompatible. their goal is to provoke western leaders into making their vision a reality. he's not "doing a much better job", they created him. they created the fear of immigrants and the fear of islam that drove him to power. he is a part of their plan.
he is losing other people's money while pocketing his cut. this time it is the american economy at large.
under the current economic model? next to impossible. you're pitted against your neighbor for a decent-paying job - in what world is that going to produce love for your neighbor? our entire society revolves around competition starting in school where we have class ranks. none of this breeds community or solidarity. it breeds contempt.
to be fair, obama gets credit too, but that doesn't really matter at the moment because he isn't the president.
it's really simple. create a headline that caters to one side. hide the truth somewhere in the middle of a paragraph near the bottom. people who like the headline will share it on social media, generating tons of clicks. by the time people break down the truth of the article, the article already has enough views to be profitable. the news company also is safe from fake news allegations, because they did include the partial truth. it only has a misleading headline and intro. that's journalism 101.
this is why a 5000 year old archer can annihilate an aircraft carrier and 4 tanks in civ without breaking a sweat.
before the cold war actually, i'd argue since around 1937 when the us discovered the saudi oil fields and propped up ibn saud to ensure a stable empire and a steady supply of oil. that kind of started our strategy of "back the strongest tribe to create stability" in the region. someone with more knowledge of the region and time, can probably correct me.
where everyone pretends like they're adults but are just kids with more killing power.
maybe i caught him on a bad night, but a few years back i saw him locally and it was painfully unfunny. the entire audience was silent the vast majority of the time. he eventually turned to insulting people who got up to leave after an hour of incoherent rambling. towards the end he said "i don't care if you're not laughing, i've already got your money." super disappointing.
so my skeptical friend; don't even act like i didn't get that donut. .... i. got. the documentation right here. .... oh wait. it's back home in the file. under 'd'. for donut.
it isn't so random if you watch the special. there are cuts like this throughout. he talks about people in marketing and advertising sucking satans cock. basically, a lot of his material is how shitty and soulless people and politicians can be. if you like george carlin you'll like him. i should also add that he sums everything up on a (kind of) positive note. he's definitely not an "everyman's comic" but he was damn good. hope that answered the question
"our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter" - mlk
just frame it as trump making a great deal for america, bringing in 12b in revenue!
well, in the article it clear states that the deal was done by the obama administration. the title is fake news, it even says so in the article.
well we all do have to sacrifice so that millionaires and billionaires can get richer. i mean, we actually do have to.
"i mean, cmon guys, yeah there have been a couple reports that it was a baby, but you're all forgetting that those reports are unconfirmed - we have no confirmation that it was an actual baby. so until we get confirmation, we can't comment and for now we're standing firm that it was almost certainly not a baby, that's a ridiculous assertion and that's all i'm going to say on the subject." - sean spicer 8/24/17.
community college is usually pretty cheap, and they'll take anyone. i fucked my gpa in college and failed out, and i'm dealing with the same worries you are though, so i get it.
is competition a consequence of an economic model or something else? i would argue that our biology lends itself to competition (from a darwinian perspective) and these economic/social constructs naturally derive from our very nature. at the same time, however, we are quite egalitarian or at least we'd like to be; most people would be happy to see others succeed - so that might refute my claim. regardless, i don't think it's so simple as to blame an economic model for humans lacking an ability to cooperate.
aren't they better than the suadis? like less stonings terror funding?? or am i wrong?
so mainstream media has been the ones presenting "alternative facts" and "fake news" the whole time. while pointing the fingers at others. "point a finger at someone, and there's 3 pointing back right at you"
boy, if you can find a 5000 yo archer,,,he's probably got some serious game.
technically the uk initially propped up ibn saud and helped him take over the peninsula, but yeah the us (and specifically, chevron) played the critical role after the 1920s in building up saudi arabia and protecting the royal family against local reformists.
i used to think the problem with impeaching trump would mean replacing him with the nefarious pence. at this point i think pence, as horrific as he is, would actually be an improvement.
holy shit i wanna see this now. can we get a betting pool going to see how high the karma can get?
recently a guy posted a pre-made res td poster list, and of course td compared it to jews being tattooed during the holocaust.
"if i have to give up my healthcare so my president can get an extra dollop of ketchup on his steak then fuck yeah i'll do it" - trump supporter probably defiantly
go feel the humidity in qatar, then we'll talk. arizona is basically maine when it comes to qatar lmao.
plus we should get to see the look on trump's face when he is impeached!
a large portion of them literally banded behind trump because they were tired of "pc" culture, which, granted, some extreme sides of it had gone off the deep end of outrage culture, but it's even simpler - they were tired of being called racists and bigots, even though that's an observational definition of their views and behavior.
would you mind linking it? i'd be interested if im on it
they're being built, so maybe they are using some hardware they already have in stock, but that jets themselves will be new.
this. born and raised in az and i handle the heat all summer no problem. throw in some humidity after a monsoon and it makes it so much worse. love monsoons though... dat creosote bush smell in the air a few hours before an evening monsoon hits. it's fucking heaven
and colbert doing a montage of trump's "best" headlines, each followed by a "you're fired!" impression.
"you can't be racist against muslims, it's not a race!" ok, you're a bigot then. "yes, thank you."
"i wish to survive this apocalypse by living underwater somewhere in scotland!"
we say that this is a rare event, but this is the 4th time i've seen this comment on an /r/funny thread in the past 2 days
the real lpt is always in the comments. brb, choking on some cucumber water.
as the fame of op grows over time, the pressure on him equally heightens. until one day op is consumed by the anguish that he will never make an original piece as great as his first. defeated by his inner demons, he browses the top posts of the year on funny and submits them again... hoping to feel how he felt the first time.
its translated for those of you who do not speak dino.
this is like anakin bringing balance to the force via the death of the jedis.
i feel like this is the top comment of every other thread in /r/funny
please do not hold me accountable for drowning on land. please hold me accountable if this somehow clears remedies and i can sell this idea to somebody.
he is saying that he laughed and his cucumber water came out his nose, he is glad it wasn't coffee as that would've hurt quite a bit.
inadvertent description of addiction unintentional.
i'm gonna buy me a mercury and cruise it up and down the road!
juihaud aj u houc kxadw. xec0 jxak, mdn a sud jfoub tade. jeihso: *weewco*
lets' wrap this up before someone comes through and absolutely rex this pun thread
wait, does that make /r/funny funny? *shudders*
actually, this right here is why we can't have nice things.
you can't just leave us in suspense like that, where is it from?
i'm starting to think that comments like op are the reason schools are trying to teach critical thinking now. because i didn't get it at all until you explained it.
well at least they knew climate change wasn't hominoid-made.
oh don't worry, everything on reddit is recyclable.
honestly, i had to decipher it myself so dont feel bad
fun fact: cows play a huge role in global warming. cows eat plants and grass, which are difficult to digest. fortunately, they have a four-chambered stomach, so the food they eat it initially digested in the first two chambers. then, they bring up this digested food and chew it again before passing it on to their stomach and intestine to digest a second time. one of the microbes in the digestive system that breaks down their food produces methane as a byproduct. and no, this isn't a fart joke. it's for real.
"move along.." "i better check the post for 1998 undertaker" "oi!, enough bethesda bashing posts you" *gets in this post* "heh, funny"
solid hypothesis but i'm going to need your sources in mla format.
wouldn't that grass be eventually decomposed, eaten by other ungulates for the same effect or never grown in the first place without the cattle to eat it? how much of a difference does that actually make overall considering that without the cows it would be something else?
don't stop telling the story, granddad, not when you've just gotten to the good part!
i know you're joking but since going vegetarian my farts hardly smell at all
what? that's the exact opposite if we're talking about cows.
this could be both a children's story and a horror movie
they aren't eating the cows, so they are keeping the population up and therefore harming the planet
it wouldn't be such a big deal if the chinese cows would regulate their gases a little better. half of them can't even breathe clean air. plus, their milk is often full of lead.
clearly those were russian cows eating other cows that mooed against them.
oh. just in case you don't know, by not eating meat, they promote more plant-based farms. more farms means less factories with animals in them. less of those factories means less cows. that's the fastest way of removing all cows currently (other than mass-eating them, but that won't happen).
one thing that i find weird is that how despite editing becoming ubiquitous in digital photography, there's what seems to be more resistance from photographers discussing that aspect of their trade than the rest (technical settings, framing etc). it's weird, because, here's this tool that everyone uses to improve their photographs, but rarely mention it upfront or discuss which methods they used.
and that one who always wants to talk to people just walking by.
depending on the time of the year you'll get halibut, striped bass, leopard sharks, bat rays, surf perch, smelt, etc. i don't think salmon come that close when they're running. dungeness crabs are legal from any beach or pier on the ocean, but not inside the bay.
lucky he got there early. after 1 in the afternoon there's nothing but bare ass and shlongs. bit of a bother when you're trying to hold a photoshoot.
i recently moved to az from the sf bay. i miss the bay sometimes, but az is so relaxing and there's so much to do. it's not too far either!
the way you said that means the bridge is constantly losing beauty.
i don't know, the presidio and lands end both have great views if the weather isn't too bad
fair enough...but titles like this attract people like you who can't help but comment on it. this drives up activity of the photo and pushes it to the front page easier. marketing.
omg he never said anything like that, your comment is so helpful. just shut up and enjoy the picture.
he woke up at 5am. didn't necessarily take the shot then.
if you go screen left there's something midfall so willing to bet it's not a person
i mean, after as much photoshop.. i mean "slightly modified/retouched"... this went through, it might as well be.
what if it's a photo of a painting that looks like a photo?
im looking at it in mobile, so, at normal zoom it looked that way to me too...then zooming in, i could see all the little details etc that proved its mostly unedited and not heavily posterized, just has fantastic lighting
do you think it's a 28mm on a full frame sensor? just wondering because i thought it matters.
the editing is pretty much what puts the "professional" in professional photography. the editing, and taking the required shots for the editing anyway. i think it's just as impressive, photography is an art, it's about capturing an image and processing it to look as close to real as possible, that's what it's always been.
actually the blues were already there, i just brought up the vibrancy and got the hue i liked with the hsl.
i think you have no idea what you're talking about.
saw your user name, been a river rat most of my life. we have probably cross paths.
i've lived in az my whole life. i can't comprehend this statement. relaxing? what?
when you can, definitely visit. it's worth it, i promise!
seattle has basically the best weather in the country during the summer.
me either. it's like they expect "holy shit. this dude got up at five in the morning? dedi-fuckin-cation
what if it's a photo of a painting that looks like a photo that actually looks like a painting?
the fisherman got up at 4 a.m. to stand in the perfect shot.
it looks like a rockstar game. cheeky e3 stunt. called it.
i think that would kill the vibe of this shot. it's got an ethereal quality to it that i think would be lessened. also not many people will want to post up their raws i imagine!
i fish off this beach. everyone replying is wrong. everyone who fishes there is fishing for crab using small cages of bait with loops that the crabs get caught in. the reason this beach is super popular is because you can't fish for crab in the bay itself (with few exceptions). so there are a ton of crabs that come out past the golden gate and baker is the first beach where it's legal to fish for them.
95% of the time, even if someone shoots on a crop sensor, they'll still speak in terms of full frame equivalents.
composition and lighting are also important to professional photographers, along with focal length, shutter speed, developing process, etc. there are still plenty of photographers who are able to capture beautiful and/or intriguing photos without post editing. i'm not saying that editing skills are anything to laugh at, that still takes time and a good eye to do well, just that professional photography encompasses much more than post processing.
precisely. i have never understood that, and i wish i could see more photographers talking about their editing techniques.
good to know - i didn't realise you could get such a great effect with the hsl. til. :-d
hmm i think you could be right actually. agreed - its a phenomenal image.
i would've killed you if it weren't for this meddling 64 tick server!
i really, really, really, really, **really** like this image.
slow. they mean slow. compared to san francisco, arizona is really slow.
no fucking way. i'm 20 minutes from rdu. thank you so much for telling me.
but.... but... 5 am guys, he could have practically died risking his life for this
hey there, actually he was fishing with two poles and i just framed him for the shot as i passed by.
i don't think this is true in my experience. i shoot apsc and always refer to lenses by their actual focal lengths
a lot of people don't care, they just want to see a cool photo. i've really never had an issue when reaching out to a photographer to ask them about their editing techniques. they are almost always willing and happy to talk about it to an interested party. i guess what i'm saying is not leading with editing info isn't the same as purposely omitting it as to be coy about it, know what i mean?
my fucking knees are locking when im trying to bhop on this goddamn server
i don't know if that's a 5am shot, doesn't seem that light out. maybe he woke up at 5 and took the shot after sunrise.
charlotte has non-stop to sf. also, look on kayak, there's a rdu-clt-sfo at sub-$400 prices for round trip. my wife and i just went there back in april, flew out of greensboro through charlotte. it was a blast, just get ready to do some major walking. the hills are killer.
did you freaking shoot this with a phone? it's magnificent. if so, which one?
man i tell you these smartphone cameras have gotten at par with dslr these days.
i hate pun threads but you got me... well done /u/canniballistic_puppy.
she was running away from him and he launched himself to catch her. too funny!
a classmate's dog did something similar to me when i was 6 (same size dog as in the video), knocked me straight on my ass and started licking my face. my friend's mother, who was walking the dog, was terrified i was hurt, but i just laughed it off and played with the dog. dogs are awesome.
imagine how scary wolves were 10000 years ago. no wonder we hid in caves.
you are not alone. it's new to me. and i just kept laughing and thinking "mooove, bitch! get out the way!"
i'm curious too. that looks like a new mexico lobos football sweater from about 2002-2003 that the players received.
first guess is that this was cute when the dog was a small puppy, and it never unlearned the behavior.
but that's the thing.. wood floors tell a story...
hope your week gets better! i proper lol'd on that one. definitely gave me a happy
or he wans't teached he shouldn't do this. the dog is really cute, however his owners should have taught him not to do things like this.
when my german shepherd was growing and gotten into the floppy eared faze he did this all the time. it sucked sinse he was around 70 to 80 pounds then. when we would open the gate to our backyard he would immediately shoot straight like a rocket to your stomach and nether regions. lucky for us he stopped doing that once he got older. good thing too since he currently ways around 110 to 115 pounds.
what happened? he got "too cool" with a new group of friends and ditched you because your parents were divorcing and you thought that uma thurman haircut from pulp fiction was a good idea?
subbing to this was the easiest thing i've done all day.
the wrestler goldberg has a move called "the spear" where does a glorified tackle to devastate his opponent. just replace gold with dog and you'll get why so many of the titles have the bah god! meme
i used to do this, running into my room and jumping on my bed. shortly after our lab would launch himself onto me in the bed. pretty fun. he was always up for it once he caught your eyes signaling that you were gonna run!
and you just gotta know there was some dumb fuck who was feeding the wolves against everyone's wishes at one point.
i don't get how someone saying "this is a repost" ruins it for anyone else. if you don't care, upvote it anyways, if some people don't like reposts, that's fine too.
"ah here's where my dog tackled and crippled me. and that's where i have my daily mental breakdown of not being able to walk again. over there is from when we moved in. john tried sliding the fridge on wood floors."
how come you misspelled the word "since" at first, but got it right the second time you used it?
i think it's more like a "honestly, who throws a shoe?" smirk.
what if it had been a shoe bomb? don't want to catch those.
well there was that time that teddy roosevelt got shot just kept giving his speech.
it is hilarious that people unaware of trebuchet memes apparently have no problem with finding 300 meters of clear space inside a house but more annoyed by a supposedly 90kg labrador lol
i sorry but where did you find that it's what the admins wanted reddit to look like? it just looks like a theme made by a user to me.
that is unreal. i'm sorry for your misfortune but thanks for sharing that story.
it's log, it's log. it's big, it's heavy, it's wood. it's log, it's log. it's better than bad, it's good.
i was writing at my job on my phone. so wasnt really in the best situation
yeah, i've seen videos of gang shoe beatings. it's all the rage over there.
they say a lot of those moves take a toll on their bodies. they do have certain ways of landing that makes it hurt less, though. apparently they spend a lot of time practicing falling. now if only they could work on making punches seem more realistic and stop that stomping shit. (if they still do that, it has been years)
clearly the trebuchet is in the yard. besides, a 90kg doggo looks more like a b i g b o y e
it's a trebuchet meme. it's also disappointing that it talks about old trebuchets so people underestimate them. a a recently built modern trebuchet can throw a rock 1760 yards. it's a real milestone.
~~because it's identical to the new reddit profile design.~~ i was wrong.
you know who else was good to his community? gacy.
keep doing what you do. you're a fantastic person. life's too short to not appreciate everything you have. like waking up with the ability to see. like, light is reflecting off objects and you can perceive their wavelengths through your face orbs. that's pretty neat.
except she or he wasn't at all rich. just average, i'm guessing.
looks unintentional poor uncoordinated pup. also drunk toddler running.
i haven't watched since the late 90s. i do feel like they are great athletes though.
no worries! i was just curious. i didn't even realize the new profiles looked different. i've been avoiding them.
hmmm... i think you might be on to something here. no one can be that happy and also not be a serial killer.
bam! agreed. no need for a philosophy lesson, just a genuine funny comment.
the lack of respect in this thread is mind blowing.
he had the shot and he took it. can't blame him for that.
how can we not be, it's only been overplayed on a daily basis since it came out
"sand on my paws and sand on my tail, where is this you've bought me?" i ask with a meow. shh says my human. just dance, look amused. i remind myself later to poop in his shoes.
"i'll allow this because you feed me, but you should definitely expect a new scratch in the couch come morning."
haha thank you! do it! some good variations that she also doesn't respond to are bunsiewoo, bun bun face and the bundertaker :)
the internet is a wonderful place. you can stumble upon albino midgets shitting on each other more than once, but a dancer with a cat on the beach? never. (except now obviously)
she has a harness and a leash but, she's not very fast and in this case preferred to stay in her carrier facing away from the water. did not care where her tuna comes from.
i have been scrolling for so long, i had almost lost hope that someone else would be reminded of this.
i'm long past the point of shame. this isn't even in the same galaxy as my most shameful fap. this is the complimentary mint i take without even thinking before i move on to my main courses. i won't even remember this fap.
more like... "dang, we're out of kitty litter. wait, we're just 12 minutes from the beach!"
"sand on my paws and sand on my tail, where is this you've brought me? it's coarse and rough and irritating and gets everywhere".
yeah, but *buns contemplates the inherent meaninglessness of existence* was post-*anal fissure* and it's my favourite book in the series
my cat would make a third hole in your nose with his claws the moment you try that shit.
haha yup. any bag big enough, my cat used to get put into. dad would come into the room with an extremely pissed off sounding holdall or something. but when we let her out, she'd just sit there unperturbed, so we figured she didn't mind too much.
i like the idea of one cat there having fun. lots of cats sounds like a minefield in the making.
our 11 (ish) year old rescue kitty has feline leukemia and we just recently found out he also has large cell lymphoma with huge tumors in both of his kidneys. my husband and i were discussing a bucket list for joe and taking him to the beach is one of the things we came up with. i imagine he'd like the beach just fine, but i'm a little worried about the 3 hour car ride there. maybe we'll just have to take him to a nearby lake instead. it's crazy the things we'll do for our fur babies. what else was on your kitty's bucket list (if you don't mind me asking); we are running out of ideas!
if bundertaker fell 19 feet onto a table, she would probably land on all fours and be ok.
my cat actually comes when called. i often take him for walks around the square of my building. when he stops, i pat my hip, and he comes running up, and i pet him. then we walk a bit further and repeat, until it's time to go inside. my neighbors all gather on their balconies and have a good laugh. he's an odd cat, but i love him.
i just did ctrl+f. was afraid i'd have to post it myself.
oh. this is a canadian buns. good to know there are nice buns everywhere.
it's also a joke on friends. phoebe thinks these are the lyrics as well.
there's water too close, and noises too spooky, but what about the droid attack on the wookies?
the author actually said later that the release timing was intended to match the books' release years with a growing kid. the second book, buns goes to the zoo, was in fact the only one in the series with a suggested age (six years old) and that let the fans order the books and match them to their intended year. it was all the more confusing when fans figured out "buns first anal fissure" would land around the age of twelve...
mine just does that thing where cats turn into semi liquid silly putty and pairs it with crazy twisting motions.
i had a cat that was a reformed barn kitty. we kept her inside, but every once in a while she'd make a break for the door, only to flop over the second she got to grass.
this is why you always walk a cat with a harness, not a collar.
meow gawd. as god as my witness, **s**he is... ok...?
when you have a cat, you like to expose them to new and exciting opportunities. sometimes they like it, sometimes they don't. my cat hates being outside, but figured out she could be outside on the porch with the birds but still feel safe. now she runs for the porch door when she hears it open. i would bring her everywhere if i could cuz i love her so much but she doesn't want to go everywhere. i also wish she could text me but you know...
now you gotta ask yourself, did the misconception come first or did friends start it? or ask google. whichever. just let me know what you find out
my dad's old cat would piss through a small hole into the back of his amp for revenge. they're calculated lil' fuckers.
it's healthy. lime for scurvy. quinine for malaria. gin kills bacteria. so when people say it's boring, tell them it's a matter of good health.
yum or a martini, martinez, negroni, gimlet, aviation, last word, tom collins, french 75, singapore sling... shall i go on?
the neverending liiiitterbooooox aaaaaahaah aaaahaah aaahaah
weird, i had an indoor cat that would flop as soon as his paws touched grass.
it's actually super easy to find something if you google the key words and add "reddit" in there somewhere. it works surprisingly well.
it has always been like this. they don't give a shit.
there's actually been research into this, that cats that fall from below a certain height or above a certain height are less injured than cats who fall from a height in between. iirc i think it's 6-9 floors is the most dangerous?
when will cats evolve to have opposable thumbs, damnit!!
i always sang it that way before the episode. mystery solved.
get one of those large clear plastic bins, cut a door into one of the shorter sides, then put the litter box in it. it saves a lot of time and effort.
notice he said old cat, implying that he ain't around anymore...
putting a tennis ball or something in the food bowl often works too. they have to eat around it, even move it out of the way, so it slows down their eating enough that they don't overeat and vomit. or it just irritates them enough that they say "fuck this shit, i'm not hungry enough to deal with this" and go away until they're hungry again.
i'm sorry to hear that, i've got a can of ashes to distribute too. most of the time when my cat vomits, it's a statement. he's fairly healthy, if just a little fat.
cats that puke more than rarely should be taken to the vet.
it really is the best. no reason to drink any other mixed drinks. i also appreciate any fellow gin lovers here.
i bet if you just stuck some juniper berries in your drink it'd sort of be like having gin without the alcohol. i've never tried it but fresh juniper berries smell like how gin smells after the berries are distilled. i bet they'd impart their flavor into your drink. congrats on your sobriety, btw.
idk what that old man was talking about, bourbon is what brings me alllll the black eyes.
protip: you can add "site:reddit.com" - also works with other sites
i used to have a jeep cherokee and my cat went everywhere with me. i just folded down the back seats and stuck a normal litter tray in there. she was a great little traveller, but she did startle a few fast food employees in the drive-thru.
i'd say any dog that does anything any human asks verbally has learned a second language.
seriously!! or have a a device they can meow into that texts me.
hello it's like bumping into someone you know in another city
could also have been a popular joke that an older generation had been singing for years, and so friends used it
"have you heard the trag'dy of plagueis the wise?" asked palpatine softly, a gleam in his eyes
this is exactly what we did and it is awesome! totally worth it. now the only scattering of litter comes from the fucker running all over the house and dropping bits from his toes as he goes. it's like little trails that tell me where he's been. kinda like those old family circle comics! lol
i'll streamline this comment thread and jump in to saying that your cat probably has a severe brain disorder. as is tradition.
we have a cat that urinates on the textured mats. he obviously hates it.
i'm slightly drunk andi this this was so funny. cats are so damb stupid you could get them to poop anywhere as long as it slightly smelled of litter. i love my cat but she is so the most stupid thing i've ever known.
we got a covered litter box but our cat refused to use it, apparently a lot of cats really don't like crawling into an enclosed space to poop. we just use it without the top since we mostly got it for its size.
pissing on electrical devices doesn't always end well
i don't trust my fat cat not to eat the tennis ball
only if you also ate some limes and fought off mosquitos.
if you throw in a bit of lime juice, it's the best summer drink. if you wanna get fancy, i think you can muddle up some lime and mint leaves and pour the gin and tonic over that.
imma be real here for a sec, but sometimes i buy gin with no intention of drinking it. ill just smell on it. smells so damn good, but oh my god i just cannot with the taste
oh god... few months ago i drank 2/3 of a bottle of 50% evan williams to pregame before going to the club with some friends. ended up getting kicked out after i started shouting at the coat check people, lost my wallet and phone, tried to fight the bouncer to get back in, and broke my hand punching a brick wall in anger. i don't drink bourbon anymore.
but how does the kitty litter not spill every time you make a turn? my cat gets it everywhere, and he has a whole ensuite at his disposal.
maybe he is a dog, then? i mean, he has pointy ears, a tail, whiskers. he sits up and begs for treats. but he looks like a cat. i don't know anything anymore!
you can replace "could also have been" with "was." older generation, can confirm.
it's a sith legend! from long, long ago. it isn't a tale that the jedi would know
yeah, there's nothing that can prevent that. i tried a doormat out front, but she just jumps over that.
i mean, it doesn't have to be clear, but if the cat kicks something out of the box or manages to shoot an arc of piss over the wall, you can see what you're dealing easier.
actually not a brain disorder but a whole slew of health issues.
i wonder if juniper extract is something you can buy
darth plagueis was a lord, a lord of the sith. he'd influence midi-chlorians, with the force, and a wish.
ironic, that he would call other memes old, but not his own...
he said he was planning to open up some walls and make catwalks between rooms, but i moved and never saw the project. somehow though i'm betting he reconsidered. that kind of thing is probably not great for resale value, unless the buyer is another avid cat owner.
its india. their movies are "all emotions and genre at once" and their food is "all spices at once".
yeah i can't believe nobody else noticed this..look at the green of the trees. the color saturation is cranked way up. every other photo of this kind of squirrel on google without color editing is just brown and red and a little yellow
visit any nearby sanctuary or forest area. its common .
it is heavily edited in photoshop. the colors are not this strong irl. saturation is cranked up like crazy.
their weddings are "all emotions at once" too. crying, laughing, serious dad; it's all there.
i can take you all around kerala. its an awesome place to visit.
i think the most colourful nuts there are the holy men.
i was going to add the picture to wikipedia, then i saw that you had to be the owner of it to do it, figured that was a dick move so i backed down. but the owner of the picture should do it. that would be cool.
avante oru house boat....kettuvellam inu parayada...
i'm staring out my window and i can see foliage almost exactly the same level of saturated color, and i'm in new england. we just recently had a bunch of rain which means all the leaves are at their brightest and healthiest, and the sun is shining full on directly at the foliage i'm looking at which makes the color pop even more.
oh wow thats sweet im mostly visited by cranes and mongoose
also indian uncles coming through clutch with the dad jokes
i hate when there are more then ten choices on a menu lol, but i do love indian food.
i loved my honeymoon in the house boat near alleppey
can you do that if it's already under creative commons?
the picture is definitely oversaturated. there are blue and red splotches in the tree that definitely shouldn't be there.
indian uncles with dad jokes are the reason i attend weddings.
haha but that's how it is around here. right from starters to dessert. so many categories and sub categories!
that's what i was thinking. and what is that green blob a little to the right from the critter's head? but maybe that's the blue-red splotch tree with a hint of moss? i mean, i'm no biologist or botanic, so i don't know.
not true. i never process my photos. when i see squirrels, i just throw rolls of film at them as hard as i can.
i don't either. sometimes i wonder if people just say it a lot because it's a popular/stereotypical thing to say.
in u/catsnakechaos 's defence, if every time he's gone to a restaurant whose cuisine is "indian food," and hasn't enjoyed it, it's not an unfair assertion to make. it's how we make up our minds about most things. people often try to push the "but you haven't tried mine!" idea.
i've heard chinese people say the same thing about chinese restaurants. but yeah that's probably how it is.
this might very well be the solution. thing is why would i? i'd have to pay a lot to go to a restaurant in search of things on their menu that i like? i rather just go somewhere where i know i like everything like italian, thai or tapas.
preach. plus the good food. tons and tons of awesome food.
it's not an indian wedding unless there's an uncle trying to get the minors drunk.
it is because i find it very difficult to choose and when i do choose one, i always think that something else would have been better, even if what i chose was really good.
it looks like a fire pokemon. what would its name be that doubles as its only speech pattern? possibly singerat? single evolution, into an even more on fire flying squirrel
u/kaythoon u/vanguarddeeznuts the language called "malayalam". i think it might be the only language with a palindrome name. an english only speaking friend told me it was "squiggly and language that famous people prefer as tattoos".
is this whats called manglish? typing the malayalam in english i mean...
where is this magical place?? i must move there. lucky!!!
well you can still get the academy award, as long as you don't go full retard.
this is very true. i have to work really hard to find the food i know exists. its very unfortunate that indian cuisine is represented this way here. it really does have unbelievable variance. i get tricked every time i order food from an indian restaurant and i see an option for pickle. its just some semi sweet mango chutney. i just get pickle sent from india now.
haha me too. take a lactase pill. problem solved.
we live in a world where it's popular to pretend to have diarhea
this!!! i am mexican, was born here in the us, but of course growing up in a mexican household, we had a variety of dishes with veggies and what not in it. my husband is american. when we go visit his father-in-law who makes some amazing food, but with very little veggies, and tons of fat, and white starches. i come back home feeling like i've got lead weights in my belly because i'll pretty much stop shitting three days into the visit. first thing i do when i get home is make a giant salad.
thank you :3 and yeah i'm sure if i'd visit india and try a lot of the dishes i'll find ones i like a lot.
pyrat? maybe his evolution has a pirates hat and a flaming tail-sword.
this right here! we make butter chicken and korma regularly in my house and it's one of our favorite weekend dishes to make.
everyone wants a problem so they can feel special.
i'm a white person who grew up in a middle class suburb and i have a stomach of steel. i love spicy foods and don't have digestive troubles from eating different cuisines. then again, i grew up eating tv dinners, canned vegetables and fast food. so maybe my stomach looked at the heavy spice as a welcome reprieve from the processed garbage i grew up on. i bet my stomach was damn thankful in fact.
i grew up putting hot sauce on anything. now my body rejects anything spicy and it goes straight through. lots of people have that issues.. definitely not a stereotype.
man i grew up in the rural midwest eating rural midwest things fundamentally lacking spice and my colon does just fine. i'm not denying that some people have had this, sure, but the joke has outgrown its roots by a lot now.
what country are you from? if you're from the us (can't speak for other western countries), odds are the indiam food you've had is nothing like authentic indian. the gravies here are just tomato heavy and as an indian, i can't stand them either. it's drastically different back in india. also, indian food is wayyy more diverse than the same 5-10 dishes that every indian restaurant has over here!
the correct answer you are looking for is birmingham. we invented the balti!
working in a library probably sounds nicer than it is, but i still envy you a little bit.
i had diarrhea for years but it was actually just alcoholism! who'da thunk.
it's all good till you're in the 30s and you feel the start of a lifetime of reflux issues
it's almost as if gut flora is a wildly diverse microbiological ecosystem and it's different for everyone.
my family had an indian lady as a neighbor when i was a kid, and she would just straight up bring platters around like she didn't think we were being fed. we lived like kings.
explains a lot of your "grundle fudge". more seriously, reducing or quitting drinking is actually really helpful for your body. e: trundle to grundle
i think the core idea here is that indian food's reputation for this far exceeds the actual likelihood for occurrence, because, i dunno, stereotyping.
my friend has a chocolate lab and i swear it's the most energetic derp.
my black lab goes berserk if you say "hey daphne you want" and whatever comes after that is her favorite thing ever. i have a video somewhere of my friend saying that to her, and she just got on her hind legs and jumped on him so hard you could hear him go oomph.
or when i'm at the bar with 6 friends and waitress just brought our beers, but i'm not the first to get my glass.
this is why we evolved two hands: double-wielding labrador patting!
i have one and holy shit thats way too accurate. energetic derp machines
we had to put down my 11 year old black lab recently. he was still smiling and friendly even when he was so weak he could barely get into and out of the car. and i still haven't gotten all his hair out of my room yet, i think i'll be a bit sad when i finally find the last few strands of it.
i feel like whoever decided to cross breed those two dogs just wanted to see if the resulting puppies could power a small city with their energy.
it's just an interesting way to explain an important fact. don't feed your dogs chocolate! also, your comment almost made me die laughing
dachshunds! they have the perfect sad eyes and i cave in literally any time my little doxie girl wants something cause her eyes get me lol
well, most labs are energetic, but chocolates... chocolates are like if you gave a two year old a six pack of caffeinated soda and a bag of pixie sticks, and they're like that for the first three years of their lives. after that, cut out a couple of the soda cans until they're about 10 or so. they're also incredibly goofy dogs. super smart, but half the time you'd never know it because they're being ridiculous.
you're so awesome for not cropping your doberman's ears. i hope you and him/her have a lot of happy years together to come.
i doubt the color makes any difference at all in personality.
i expect some manner of payment in tippy tap pictures if it is!
oh boy! he wants to eat **ice cream ice cream ice cream**
good news! you'll never hit the end of finding that hair.
sorry to hear about your loss. may she rest in peace!
i have a pitbull/lab/jack russell mix. he's a 25lbs tube of muscle. super happy and loves to play fight my older lab/husky mix. she kicks his butt and he comes back for more and more. it tires her out to keep beating on him. she's 60lbs so more than twice as big. he'll run around in tight loops in the living room then get up on the couch and come flying off the end and leap 5ft in the air and land on the bigger dog. it so much fun to watch.
i just got one. about 18 months old. i live alone in the woods. this made me so so so jealous. though he does love running like a maniac in the woods!
don't feed your dog lots of things, everyone should learn about dogs before owning one...
"i said no! okay, fine. here you go, your royal cuteness..."
whoa! i didn't know that wasn't natural- no wonder they are pissed off all the time, i'd be mad too if someone cut most of my ears off!
yup. my dog died like 5 years ago and i still keep finding hair from time to time.
thanks a lot. his spirit is with me constantly now, filling me with love even from beyond.
i've always wondered why can't we do that with humans. what's the point in prolonging their suffering? i've always thought assisted suicide should be legal. we do it with animals so why not people.
i feel like i know so much about dogs through my years of research, but i could never take the initiative to go adopt one. i just feel like i could never be good enough for what they are.
it's not chocolate, it's cacao. some chocolate have a very low cacao proportion so it won't do anything to a dog. it's always better not to risk it, but that just shows what kind of 'chocolate' those donuts had!
the semicolon is fairly easy to use in a lot of cases. if you're separating two clauses that can stand on their own, then no one should call you out; if they do, then they're in the wrong. "too long; didn't read." is one of the best examples because it's short and well known. the biggest mistake a lot of people make: putting a semicolon where i've just put a colon. if the left side intends to describe, define, or expand on itself with the right side, then you want to use a colon. but yes that guy shouldn't have used any punctuation there at all, heh.
it's almost like different dogs have different personalities, that aren't decided by their breed.
the way he savages squeaky toys is pretty metal come to think of it...
mine died in 1997 (20 years ago) and i still find hair from time to time in the most strange places at home.
beautiful comment. i know for a fact he was cherished.
if you can't afford it, or afford the time, thank you for being realistic. i volunteer at a shelter and there's almost nothing more depressing than a dog that is there because someone didn't know the responsibility or changed their mind. poor dog bros don't know what the "did wrong " to be ditched.
he gets lunch when the ups man drops off my amazon prime delivery.
agreed. brutus is scary enough when the doorbell rings, but gentle enough when my 10 year old neice tries to ride him like a horse. cropping ears doesn't make sense to me, especially since he's a bush dog.
william brady. "dollar bill." cape caught in one of the bank's revolving doors while trying to stop a robbery. shot in the head.
i can definitely say i still find my great pyrenees' hair, and she died ten years ago. combine that with owning a black lab mix now, and i have to roll around on a giant roll of tape before i leave the house.
recently watched 'bolt' for the first time. pretty decent movie, overall, but the stray cat's little speech about humans 'throwing you away' and leaving you out in the cold, asking yourself 'what did i do wrong'?, was truly devastating.
i'm a goddam goddess in my dog's eyes. yeah, he's pretty spoiled but the love bug deserves every second of it.
and daily walks/exercise, and access to vet care, and proper training, and if the dog is an energetic breed keeping them occupied is pretty important if you don't want all your stuff ruined... you're thinking of cats.
it's gotta be a lot of grapes... it's got something to do with how they metabolize certain chemicals - the same things are toxic to people but we can't realistically eat enough to poison ourselves... at least that's what i remember, could be totally wrong. i've given my dog a chocolate covered raisin every once in a while. you still might want to call your vet, though, i know with chocolate that sometimes whatever nasty chemical it is can be in their system for days.
we had a staffy who was a rescue dog and his previous owner had obviously given him bits of whatever he was having for tea that night. he absolutely loved peas and would chase them round his bowl if we have him some. it was hilarious. healthiest dog we ever had, lived to 16!
cropping ears is pointless, i hate seeing it done. brutus is lovely with those wonderful ears!
i'm imagining you rolling around on a massive sheet of tape now, and your dog running for over for "playtime", negating the purpose of the tape.
we lost my black lab a year and a half ago. we got a new dog 6 months ago and although they are so different (very quiet black lab who was the runt and always ill vs. super energetic redlab/minipoodle cross who literally can't stop licking people) we love both. once you have a dog in your life there is always a huge hole without one. they are too good for this world.
yeah, dogs are work. especially the bigger energetic breeds. sure, there is a strong payoff to the time and attention given but don't be fooled by seeing someone's older, well trained dog. it can take an extremely patient owner to get the dog to that point. and some of it, you just have to wait it out with the long game. it's pretty much why i've gone the route of adopting senior dogs at this point. sure, they don't have a lot of years left in them but imo, you end up experiencing the best years. we raised a golden retirver from puppyhood and he lived to almost 14. those first 5 or 6 years or so were really tough. we adopted a 6 year old malamute and she has been perfect. pretty much just loves lying around and sleeping, isn't destructive, and is very calm at this point in her life. and i have no bad puppy memories.
thanks for the props. the only thing i'll add to what you said is that while a dog won't die if you leave it along (they are pretty self sufficient in a lot of ways), they can be incredibly destructive if left alone. so while the dog might not be hurt in any way, your wallet can possibly take a substantial hit if you neglect a dog too much, especially when they are younger. and imo, it's those types of circumstances that happen over and over again where owners blame the dog and not themselves. and the dog ends up in a shelter because the owner had no idea what they were getting into.
it did honestly happen though. i just decided since i went through the trouble of typing out the story, i might as well end it somewhere familiar.
oh i believed you. i just loved the transition. well done.
he seems to be answering the comments on his videos pretty quickly, maybe try asking him there?
i saw 2 $500s since then, those individuals are worth noting as well.
he now has over $12,000, and over 3k subscribers!
where's the link? i'm on mobile and can't find it anywhere.
it truly is amazing seeing all these people show support for this guy. this is a light in a seemingly dark world.
contact him on youtube. he is responsive there! up vote so it's seen.
agreed, i've never really given to a gofundme but after watching his video and my eyes started sweating, how could i not just throw in ten bucks?
it's in the description of that youtube video. comments with a direct link don't appear due to rule 5, which is why there are a lot of replies to this comment that can't actually be loaded.
hey i shot you a pm about canine companions for independence, an organization that provides service dogs free of charge. i have raised service dogs for them in the past, and i know how life changing they can be.
no man, thank you. thanks for sharing your feelings. it means a lot to me. life becomes a lot better when we connect like this together.
very curious to see where the dust will settle on this one. i think things are going to be surprisingly easier for kevin for awhile
now that he has passed the goal i can almost guarantee the impact is less about the dollar value and more about the true volume of people who are loving him. they will spend the money but they will never forget all the strangers whom he will never meet that showed him what love and kindness is.
wait, does health insurance usually pay for someone's car?is that a normal thing in other countries?
he's been slow playing it for 9 years and he's ready to strike!
i'm sure we'll get video, but only of kevin, i'm not interested in exposure. i only want to help. :)
thank you. kevin says "there definitely will be a new video tomorrow". :)
if this happens make a vlog of it so everyone can follow along on your adventure!
damn there's a lot of good humans in this thread. and you're definitely among them. keep being a damn legend, you're good at it.
i thought you said "worth nothing" lol. like damn y'all step up your game $500 ain't shit!
that's freaking awesome! you're an amazing person! thank you for whah you've done!
i posted the original at r/gaming but mods have locked it because they said it is not gaming related :/
so, time to put the gofundme money into a rainy day fund, pay off bills, invest, etc. don't forget to keep some in reserve for taxes. i can't speak for everyone, but the reason i donated was because a decent human was in need, and i'm fortunate enough to be pretty stable. i know people that got a poor roll of the dice (friends and family) - it isn't easy and a small sacrifice can make a world of difference.
$1800 for 9 years of work. worth! that rounds up to 1c per hour!
thank you for verifying. i wasn't out to to pour skepticism on the video i just wanted to make sure it was legitimate.
i have bamboozle insurance, because i've seen some shit.
you sir, are what we refer to as a panty dropper. if i had panties i would certainly drop them for you!
you might have better luck getting in touch with his brother /u/steightst8
your brother definitely has an interesting personality and i think he will retain a lot of his new viewers (including me!), thanks for the update!
now we need to get this guy to 100,000 subscribers!
hey, dont know if you noticed but this guy /u/tritonv8guy has offered you to help you with the van and he is in ohio too. make this happen :d
monitize it, and put the money to gas, and donate the rest to him! shoot, just fly out someone else to edit, and you've got an unstoppable team here!
upvoted to get people to see your comment in order to see his comment in order to see the original comment. way easier to post this then to just upvote everyone.
i'm a double hard bastard, but i ain't no cunt, sir. i've loved and lost friends and family to terrible wasting diseases and i know every minute with them still remains a joy to me. if in any way i can help ease another person's discomfort so they can have more time with their family, it's always worth the time, consideration and investment, however small. you can't buy back lost opportunities but if you can afford someone more of them, why not?
this is patrick, kevin's brother. thank you *so, so* much. don't sell yourself short. i don't even know what to say man. kevin's year has been more than made by this.
they've gotten a lot better; they drop the floors and raise the suspension on standard vans and have fold out ramps versus the big old fullsize vans that had a full on lift and raised ceilings that usually didn't fit in your garage. that being said, new tech is still super expensive. my van has a hydraulic back end so it can kneel a bit to decrease the angle of the ramp, like some buses, so they're modifying tons of different systems beyond the frame and body. if you can transfer out of your wheelchair and have enough arm strength/mobility to lift or break down your chair, you can convert a regular car much, much more cost effectively but in my case i have paralysis in my hands and triceps so it's not an option for me, doesn't look like it'd be an option for him either. i went to school for mechanical engineering so i've been trying to find ways to improve it as well but not bring able to get my hands in there and tinker makes it more difficult to experiment.
during e3 it will not gain traction or visibility sadly. you should try in a few days, maybe contact a mod prior to post so that he can acknowledge the post
on it, fed this to some tech reporters at about 10k. saw thread momentum, the medias gonna get it. at end of the day, stories like this make us remember how fortunate many of us are today. if only we could replicate this at scale across society.
hi it's me your boombozle insurance agent. please verify the last 4 of your credit card for ~~nigerian prince~~ boombizzle plus rewards.
www.yournextcarllc.com we're a smalll growing business so websites not quite as up to date as i'd like. getting there though :) i've got way more than what's on there but check me and my reviews on facebook and you'll get the idea :)
thank you so much. he is blown away--started today at 1k subscribers, just pushed past 11k.
thanks friendo! he pm'd we'll start working on the details, i'll get it done!
my first reddit post- just donated. my heart is smiling.
are you a pissed off nobody or do you piss off no people or are you someone who is pissed off without a body?
awesome man! i'm glad to hear that! if kevin feels like it message me your or his skype or phone number or something i would love to hear from him and actually talk to him. the love chat on youtube wasn't working all that well with everyone writing stuff!
you made me cry tonight on the livestream man, that was very kind and selfless. wish the best for you.
i laughed a little to much when that happened! that was great! also dad i'm lukas stocker currently living in colorado and no that wasn't a mistake. and nope not $80 i meant it to be $800.
that was amazing! my wife and i were in tears at the dinner table. :)
you rock dude. i totally agree, fuck fixing the old van. new van, new chair, down payment on a home and some cash left over. it's like a lottery where we all agree that these people should win!
no we ended up taking it down after a couple of weeks of no donations
you sir are awesome. if you ever find yourself in central nc, then i've got your lunch/bar tab.
other commenters have mentioned he is responsive to social media, so check his youtube page from the video. right now the donations are up to $17,355 of the $5,000 goal.
yes, i asked the brother (i think) to send you the pm. thank you so much for doing this. i am just glad you guys are now in contact. again, thank you!
i've gotten in contact with both /u/tritonv8guy and /u/32080 . thank you all so much!
i chucked in $10 myself, wish i could give more but yeah, i'll be damned if it ain't beautiful to see people rallying around a good cause. thanks to you too for making a difference in someone's world.
i just watched the live video from earlier. it brought tears to my eyes and inspired me to donate as well. good on you man. and sweet tactical vest you have in that youtube vid. lol
pretty much, this. i, usually, don't like donating because i'm not sure where it goes. there are a few causes like this, where i see i can directly help someone, and i'll do that from time to time. (i'm not even 100% sure about that) but, i'd rather do this than the bullshit i have to deal with from some of my family that can't seem to help themselves and assume my money is given to me; not thinking about the hours i've worked (and years of bullshit) that led up to the point to even be able to earn the money.
if you ever put it back up, pm me and i'll send 50 your way. i'm sure some other helpful redditors would do the same.
thank you so much. it's crazy how much global support reddit has garnered for our family. vielen dank aus den usa :)
the smaller donations are just as important. it's little amounts that can make a difference! i'm new to reddit, and i'm loving it!!!
thanks man! you know i really want to think that i started this snowball of awesome human love but i think it's just everyone here! everyone gets one internet hug from me!
awesome! i'm glad more people are donating. haha yeah..... i'm the gear guy in my unit..... i have all the unnecessary cool guy stuff.
that's very kind of you, thank you! i definitely will post it on here and pm you if we decide to set up another gofundme.
i donated! i hope the money helps with any future emergency! also tell him he better get that switch that he wanted:p
not to spoil the fun or anything, but this is about as good as reddit gets. its all downhill from here. and its a long hill.
he's almost at 17k now. hopefully they will be able to put a good down payment on a newer van and not have to worry about this again for a while.
$28,850 and still going! and 9,784 youtube subscribers!!! i actually feel honoured that i was able to be a part of all of this. the love is overwhelming :)
i feel like the reddit community would make your case viral or at least have many people donating to your cause. i'm a broke college student but i know i am able to send $10 your way.
more, like peewee herman, i'd cost, you,close to about $3.50
thank you very much. he's so excited! i'm sure he'll get his switch now :)
yeah we all benefited from this thread i think. we all probably needed it too. i did. still a ton of good people in the world. good night!
unfortunately he is probably on disability, and as such can't afford payments + insurance on that even with a healthy down payment. plus wheelchair accessible vans are ridiculously expensive even for a no frills basic model. the only way they could probably afford operating costs + insurance would be if we can muster up enough donations for them to buy it outright. and frankly, why should we stop there? how about we all push this far enough so he can get a new chair, a brand new van so he won't have to worry about that ever again, and enough for a bit larger place to live with wheelchair access and enough extra to pad their savings account for future rainy days?
"and it was about that time that i realized that the selfless mechanic from reddit was about 8 stories tall and a creature from the paleolithic era." dammit loch ness monster! i ain't giving you no tree-fiddy!
yeah i know, i asked the brother to pm him and boom, magic in the making! i am so happy to see this working out the way it is. reddit at it's finest.
oh, absolutely. wheelchair vans can be ridiculous, i use to drive an ambulette during emt school and saw the struggle with my patients, but sometimes you can find used ones for not too bad. especially if you convert a regular (used) full sized caravan into one. and, yes. i hope this keeps going and going. but buying all of that stuff costs a mint. if nothing else, i hope he can get his van back into shape and have some extra pocket money so they don't need to worry about necessities for a while.
no the horse is thinking, if she keeps kicking me i am going to die
my horse broke a(nother) halter yesterday because the hose was obviously about to eat him. it's not like i've been giving him baths at least once a year for the past 13 years or anything.
thank you, thank you for making me aware of something i literally never thought about until now. added to the checklist of shit not to do around horses.
it's like she's not even trying. like...just jump a little bit. just swinging your leg over obviously isn't working so put a little more hop into it with your left leg. she looked like somebody throwing themselves at a hooked wall while wearing a velcro suit....except the wall isn't hooked and there is no suit.
some horses are very helpful though. i grew up with on my mom called "the sitter" because he was super gentle and helpful with kids and beginners. he'd use his neck to to nudge you on, and he would not trot or canter until you were actually ready. i remember a friend riding him who was super unbalanced. he didn't trot for a solid 30 minutes until my friend got used to being on a horse. then when he did start to run and my friend slipped to one side the horse would stop, spread his legs out and wiggle his back as needed to "catch" the rider. i miss that horse, that was my mom's first baby. she had him longer than she's had me, and i'm 20 now.
"oh ffs linda, can't you do anything on your own?"
just want to say that i grew up horseback riding and can confirm that fly mounting is incredibly difficult.
what does having bare feet have to do with riding bareback and getting a pelvic crushed?
"this thread is weirdly aggressive..." "no shit" and the cycle continues.
i dunno wtf is wrong with her, im like 3x her weight and i can pull myself on one, she had zero spring to her jump and was just pivoting
yeah she was just pretending, it wasn't exactly needed though because with the cuts it's easy to tell the horse only lays down on command. jumping on a horse really isn't that hard unless you're too small or overweight (and this girl clearly isn't) when it's standing completely still like that, even someone who has never been on a horse will instinctively use the horse mane to pull himself.
i can see you've never been ridden like this before
my horse is actually a very small dog but she doesn't like hoses that pretend to be snakes either.
tigers. there are tigers everywhere. there are tree tigers. rock tigers. wind tigers. grass tigers. hose tigers. sometimes other horses turn into tigers for a short while. and all of these tigers... they're the horse eating kinds of tigers.
one time, a woman my mother knows asked if she could bring her niece and daughter to see our horse. the niece is apparently used to horses, but the daughter was only about 3 years old and completely unaccustomed. she brought her toddler to look at a horse... in flip-flops. she then got sulky when my mum said there was no way that kid was going anywhere near the horse.
just to be clear, though, there are many things doctors can do for broken toes. they just choose not to do them most of the time. because they're withholding teases.
this. this so much. i've been stepped on twice while wearing boots. hurt every single time and the soreness lasted weeks. (hey, it happens and they don't mean it...they just can't see great up close and sometimes they are jumpy). this is one well trained horse.
pretty sure she wasnt trying on purpose to get the horse to do this on camera.
pretty sure that horse is trained to do that. her attempts were not believable.
to be fair i've seen this exact scenario play out so many times, and it had nothing to do about catching something neat on camera and everything to do with the fact they can't bloody jump onto a horse's back. even if they're fit and have good balance, they might have the bounce of a rock. although if it is to show the horse being trained to lie down to let a rider get on, that's really cool.
it's harder to mount a horse than it looks. if you're not used to it there's also a sense of unpredictability since it's a living thing.
when i started learning to ride horses i had the perfect one. she never gave me attitude, and was super easy to handle. one time we were galloping and i lost balance, with my foot stuck in the...the foot thing, and she looked back and stopped all "oh oopsie, you fell off" which was nice, because that was the exact only thing i was petrified of, a horse not stopping and running the fuck away with me attached as some potato sack.
same and i cringed when i saw the jumping equipment just lying there. no way in hell i would train unless that stuff was upright or out of the ring.
yeah, all i can think about while watching this is the complete lack of appropriate riding attire and gear. short shorts, bare feet, and no helmet? bad idea.
just because someone's ridden bareback before doesn't mean they won't have trouble mounting. i've ridden bareback plenty of times and i still have days where i struggle to hop on and have to use a block. they way the horse lays down is 100% natural and looks to me like he was just trying to roll
oh don't worry. he was probably expecting one of those 50 youtube video description bots to come in and explain
she is actually pretending to not be able to vault, if she turned her head left and looked down she would be able to get her legs over. it sounds counterintuitive but it works. she can definitely vault onto that horse but is pretending she can't so that she can show off how she trained her horse to lay down. i have no idea how to teach that one, it's very impressive.
as a novice it also looked like a roll in the dirt rather than assistance
had sex for the first time at 16 (long time ago unfortunately). 16 yo me saw porn with people banging against the wall, thought i'd try it. threw my back out. back still hurts today.
oh god this made me cringe too haha at least she was polite!
yeah, my dog just ate a turd while staring directly at me blank faced. i mean, what was she trying to tell me there? if she was trying to gross me out, it worked.
yeah with how many edits there are in this gif why would anyone believe it?
please refrain from mounting your horse if you haven't been doing so already.
aspiring horse trainer here. did it really bite her directly after throwing her? because if so that is hard to explain. horse may be an asshole?
why're constantly looking for ways to die i swear to god. they will colic and die if their oats have clumps
generally horses manage quite well with infrequent baths. the more they are worked however, the more frequent they need to bath. even then, it is often no more than a spray down to remove the sweat and detritus from a stringent session. but honestly, you will usually be asking yourself why you bother about five minutes later. most of the horses i've worked with take particular pleasure in immediately going and rolling in dirt and mud the second you've finished. also, most horses i've known have absolutely adored the sand pit... so goodbye nice shiny freshly washed coat.
if they are a descendant from something like zebras, and you change tiger to lion, that explains quite a few things.
i grew up with horses and always thought is was cool how in the movies the cowboys would run along side the horse and jump on. so i decided to figure it out. it took a long time to get the horse to take off running without being on it already and then just as long to figure out how to time the jump and actually get on and that was with a saddle to help pull myself up with. but once i finally did it it was an amazing feeling for sure! i wish i had video of it but that was 20 years ago and the vhs camcorder was a bit much to carry around...
yeah, i saw another comment that said this and that makes a lot more sense. i hope that's it because she looks ridiculous.
are you a horse person? if so i believe you, but if not; perhaps you've seen people try jumping onto a saddled horsey; but mounting a horse with no saddle is pretty damn difficult, especially a biiiiiiig horsey.
especially if it doesn't have a damn saddle and stirrups on. people keep overlooking the fact that every time they've seen someone mount a horse in tv or whatever, there's always a stirrup to give you a foot up and reigns to hold onto.
this is what i thought, that she was just pretending.
i'd say you either have a weak back or you were trying to bang a land whale...
i like how this was left as an "attempt" apparently.
equestrian, athlete, you, heathen! -william shatner
i can vomit through my eyes by clogging my nose and mouth, thus forcing the vomit up through my tear ducts. my goal is to be able to do this on command while maintaining eye contact and thus establish dominance. i bet your dog doesn't feel as gross any more. you're welcome :d
but if you have been refraining, then please start mounting it immediately.
i find it hilarious that horses are one of the few animals where "idk maybe it's just an asshole" is a legitimate answer.
colic! that's what it is called! don't they get goats, so the horses feel dumb for being afraid of stuff? because the goat will be like, "yo, chill out man. everything is fine."
i had a mostly white horse when i was a teenager. i'd usually give her a wash once or twice a summer, and every time i'd wonder why i bothered. i'd leave her tied up until she dried, then let her back into the pasture. 5 minutes later she'd have found a nice mud puddle (or failing that, the greenest, sloppiest pile of poo in the pasture) and rolled in it. goddammit sasha.
it's all very scary with pointy teeth capable of eating horses whole.
i have heard of it, but know very little. i'm wondering if my geographical location could have been a part of my good fortune. the podcast talks a lot about the worms in the southern part of the us. i grew up in minnesota, so maybe i had a lower chance of getting it compared to someone who grew up in alabama. also, thanks for mentioning the podcast. i haven't heard of these guys before.
my cousin & i used to always jump on from the back. i don't know how we never got kicked in the face.
i was for a bit over a decade. it took me ages to master it, and i only ever managed it on my own horse.
be on the internet long enough and you will learn that you have many parts that you would rather have not been awakened.
oh i'd definitely recommend it, i just wouldn't marry it.
so doesn't the stomach acid like burn your eyes? also how does one discover the ability to do this?
this was my thought. i had two horses and have been thrown off a few times. after getting thrown the horse is either running around the arena and you have a fun time catching him, or he runs a little bit then stops to stare at you on the ground like "why are you down there now". i can't imagine a scenario where a horse would throw someone and then somehow bite the leg.
kinda! goals are pretty good companion animals for horses to calm them down. my neighbor had to borrow one when one of her two horses died. the other horse wouldn't eat and was very anxious about his decades long friend dying. he seems better after getting the goat friend. they can also develop friendships by themselves!
you focus your energy at around the back of your neck but one palm width lower. then you yell angrily and there, you're now a super saiyan.
oh fuck that. i've got the same issue compounded with too narrow sinuses. so there's plenty of connections they're just all excessively narrow to the point of requiring surgery soon. if that happened to me i'd be fucked.
i've been stepped on after a fall. that was scary as fuck. but it was also a clear accident on the horse's part. the other few falls wind up with them poking you with their nose and probably having a laugh in their peanut brains.
i want a 22lb house horse. him and i can kick it on my shag carpet, i could set up a mini carousel in the basement for him to do laps on and he'll be there for me when i cry because my last friend who had no shot of getting married just did and now i'm sitting here wondering how i got this old alone i was supposed to be one of the first, but my horse will be there to comfort me and tell me about my redeeming qualities like how i can hold my liquor really well or sometimes i don't always embarrass myself when meeting people and we'll be bros.
dogs are generally not quite as unbelievably stupid as horses, though.
now i want to see a montage of cute animals falling over or tripping with the "you died" title screen slowly fade in
damn, man, better not come near me with that 4" monster deeck!
no, i wrestled from 4 to 21. sorry for the confusion.
but you only become a super saiyan if you're constipated for 5 episodes.
better married "late" than to the wrong person, trust me.
well if you need something a little smaller... i know a guy.
wow, was that organized wrestling at age 4? or roughhousing with dad?
i mean, there are two different styles of riding - english and western. you can totally call western boots cowboy boots, but if you call english boots cowboy boots (which they look nothing alike) then it'd be really weird and you'd have to be doing it intentionally.
got my wad of hundreds, got my magnum condom for my magnum dong... im ready to plow!!!!
well it takes at least 2 clicks but yea, reddit is amazing
no dad to roughhouse with, it was like an actual wrestling class for pre-k kids. kept up with it til kindergarten, went to a kindergarten class, after that our elementary school had a "team." as did our middle and high school. college did too. finished my associates and didn't want to go back for a bachelor's. quit wrestling, gained 20 pounds. joined the military. haven't regretted it.
lol my back never really hurt until that encounter. now it constantly bothers me. i think wrestling made it week then that was kinda the straw that broke the camel's back. the camel being me, the female being the straw. and no i wish i did wwe, i never really watched it but i know many enjoy it, it makes people happy, plus meeting dwayne johnson and john cena would be cool.
can you elaborate on that last sentence a bit please?
they need the donations to afford all the paint needed for the black out.
just doing the same thing we've done in the past doesn't seem like very much fun, does it? :-) we're still working on the details -- and leaving lots of room for input from the internet and for sites to get creative -- but the basic idea is that sites will display something really prominent that shows the different ways that losing net neutrality would break the internet (ie slow loading, censorship, extra fees, etc.) sopa was a blackout because it was about censorship -- net neutrality is broader, so we have more room to get creative.
google could end this shit in a day if they really wanted to. can you imagine if google search, gmail, youtube were all shut down for an entire day and just replaced by a paragraph on net neutrality? they would never do that of course, but fuck if that wouldn't get literally everyone's attention.
you really want net neutrality to get out there? ...... have every one of these sites agree to shut down for just 3 hours, with a message about net nuetrality and links for next steps. 3 hours without social media, porn or shopping will make worldwide news for weeks and shake up the country like never before.........as sad as that is. edit : thank you for the gold!! edit 2 : i love goooooooold. (thanks again!)
nope, stackoverflow and github are shutting down too.
maybe not vsause, we want to stay on a central topic not 20 different ones about tech and the internet in general.
comcast has captive customers, from long contracts and lack of broadband competition. when they get in a dispute with a content provider, and traffic is harmed or blocked altogether, it hurts both sides. but comcast can hold out longer, because their customers largely aren't going anywhere.
we're going to be announcing a lot more details soon. we wanted to make it an open process where we can get lots of feedback from internet users, online communities, and websites that will be participating. see my comment above for some more examples of the types of stuff sites might do :-)
i was just thinking how cool it would be if all of these sites could block ashit pie from using their services. i feel like that would be an awesome way to demonstrate why we need certain regulations for fairness in internet services.
i think netflixes statement is the saddest part about this. they basicly said "we want to fight this, but it would be futile and it won't hurt us as much anymore". the futile part is what gets me, since netflix has been so strongly in favor of nn for years now.
hopefully your comment gains more visibility. i'm all for net neutrality. why do you need my phone number and full name... definitely discourages people from signing up
oddly enough it could actually affect the internet outside of the us. say for example a small american startup hosts their new video site themselves and have to serve through comcast yet refuse to pay comcast's extra fees for priority bandwidth. well, if you try to use their site it's going to run slower because the source is being restricted. it's one example but a real one.
just remember - her and leslie knope are basically the same person.
pornhub is probably one of the most progressive companies out there. this is par for the course for them. remember, the company basically exists on the fringe of society by the mere nature of their business. the "establishment" are who want nn to go away.
in my country mobile providers already have social media data packs (unlimited fb/twitter/instagram/youtube etc. for cheap) now you know why.
i'm all for this. having pornhub load slowly wouldn't work on me. they merely adopted the slow internet. i was born in it, molded by it.
it's like they forgot that wordpress developers can only develop in plugins. /s but in all seriousness, you don't need a plugin for this. just throw up a little html banner that fades away on a click event.
are you going to shut down your business for the day?
no one is sure yet. there have been talks about a black out or a internet slow down.
it's invented by some german (fabian thylmann) dude who's now pretty much behind all the big porn sites. (just google what belongs to "mindgeek")
i guess we can mail them some cans of spray paint so they can spray paint their screens. i heard that going into css and changing background-color: white to background-color: black, was just to expensive.
only to the extend that being apolitical wouldn't harm them. for example they blacked out during sopa because it would directly affect their ability to run wikipedia. same thing for court briefs they've made over freedom of panorama.
what about the sites intentionally slowing down page loads to take like 10 or 15 seconds while displaying the banner and saying "this is the internet without net neutrality. welcome to the slow lane. you can prevent this by..." since this is about that particular issue. i'm sure some great web engineers can make it so that only happen the first time someone visits a site that day!
i don't agree. google's banner on the sopa protest day probably did more for awareness than any other company, for example. same as wikipedia's quick black wall that was easily circumnavigated.
only it shouldn't be for a day only. it should be permanent until this bill is stomped. $1 gets you 24 hours. that should be enough to make people aware of what this actually is and does while firmly pissing them off to the point of making waves.
i imagine they're reluctant to remind people how much of their online life is controlled by google
netflix is probably already paying the isps, even under current net-neutrality rules to avoid the link-problems they had before.
what would they even slow down? nobody goes to apple.com to do anything.
hopefully 'next steps' also includes encouraging people to contact their local representatives for their state legislature. that is, *not* simply their representatives and senators for the us congress, but their representatives and senators for their state legislature that introduce and pass state legislation. state representatives and senators are usually part-time legislators that live near residents and are easier to get ahold of than their national counterparts. they are fully capable of introducing legislation to implement net neutrality and internet privacy on the state level in a manner unimpeded by gridlock in congress. state legislators are also capable of lifting any state-level restrictions on municipally owned fiber.
so july 12th will be the day my coworkers discover that i'm a fraud with no real knowledge.
another gray and kutzgesagt colab would be cool though.
and maybe we should contact dirk from veristablium as well!
do we? i feel like we already have many excellent articles about net neutrality which explain this not-very-complicated issue at least as well as the themselves excellent videos. and besides, internet videos are most likely to reach avid internet users, who are mostly already convinced.
still though, how mad would those customers be if when they typed in www.google.com, they got a page with the message "looks like you're using comcast to access the internet, google cannot be reached from your walled garden."
google fiber is dead. the only places that get google fiber are the places google fiber was installed.
so is it a site will do whatever they want on this day, or are all the sites talking about what they should all do collectively? i hope those details are released soon, because so far it feels really unplanned and vague.
a corporation has to attempt to act in a way that benefits their stakeholders lest they be sued. i think netflix is saying my deepest sympathies, but our hands are tied by corporate law. corporations are often viewed as people with the freedom to do anything. unfortunately, they are driven by greed which is backed by law.
i'm going to drop my netflix on july 12 who's with me?
it would definitely affect me, some game servers are in washington state so my already sub-par connection will turn to crap.
except, that's not at all why they aren't participating, and there's no requirement that they "shut down" completely in order to do so. there really isn't anything people won't justify on google's behalf, is there?
i guess they figured out they could make more money without net neutrality.
i didn't have high speed internet until college but by then i could do it by memory alone.
if the business is very dependant on this i guess they would.
binge-on is dead now. t-mobile one has unlimited data for everything with hd streaming too.
t mobile didn't discriminate on the providers of the content, any video or music streaming was zero rated. so it's technically in violation for treating those packets differently but they didn't limit it to only certain providers like netflix.
yeah totally -- this is similar to what we did last time around with the "internet slowdown." currently we're working on building some different options for sites to show the different ways losing net neutrality could affect them (ie slowing down, being blocked outright, being forced to charge fees, etc.)
would be amazing if you would share an embed code so others can show solidarity
couldn't that risk the adverse effect of people being pissed off at the protestors? like protestors standing in the middle of a freeway?
wikipedia was very effective, got everyone to talk about it the most.
this is really what it is... "holy shit, google is literally bigger than government"
we had google down for couple of hours in czech and few other ee countries, people went crazy (they were posting dumb memes about it on fb).
aws is a big part of amazon's business, i wouldn't be surprised if isps are already preparing to try to shake that money tree.
i believe they are, i read some timeline about their stance on nn through the years and it mentioned them making payments. i made sure to go through their support and give them feedback about what a huge issue their lack of support is. it's the only thing in nine years that has made me consider cancelling, and i very well may at this point.
i think 3 days without social media would do the planet a lot of good honestly
i can't imagine they'd like a world in which they're at the mercy of isp corporations though, so consider it an investment.
3 hours without porn *at night*, not just 12 noon when everyone is at work.
can't do that. it would open them up to a shit storm of litigation for any potential lost business for the companies who pay a lot of money for their services.
i'm pretty sure no coder can function without those two things.
yes, great analogy there. imagine the water company deciding when and where you can use the water at home?
comcast's business practices clearly illustrate that they don't care if their customers are mad because, once again, they have captive customers.
if everyone is doing their own thing we need a common logo or phrase that is incorporated into each page that is participating. that way it doesn't look like 100 different causes, but instead it will clearly be one group, with one cause.
i 100% agree. when people go to buy something on amazon, and theres just a little pop-up telling people about what net-neutrality is, nobody is going to care if they dont already. the only way this will work is if these sites shut down for the day. with maybe just a page explaining whats happening so people dont think the sites are experiencing technical difficulties.
i like the idea of a large coordinated showing of people dropping their subscriptions. i'd join that cause.
it would be huge for the tech businesses in canada. they would have a huge advantage in hosting their stuff in this country (even if americans would still be fucked by their government).
t-mobile one "optimizes" video by default to 420p. you need to upgrade your plan to get hd video and you need to turn it on every 24hr if you want it.
put a banner u saying "we are sorry, your current internet package does not contain this website. if you wish to access this website you will have to pay a fee. this is what (website) would be like withoit net neutrality."
they don't even need to shut down their sites. just have this be the page that comes up when you first come to their webpages but at the bottom could be a link like "now, since we still have a full and free internet, click here to continue, unhindered."
you (and a lot of other people in this thread) forget all the positive social media does, including organizing environmental cleanups and social-political movements. grass roots activism literally doesn't exist without social media at this point. don't throw out the baby with the bath water.
exactly. they'd probably lose a fuck ton more in the long run if net neutrality dies
i'd prefer if they did it world-wide, actually. as an european many of the services i use are american, and i really don't want isp's killing off services i use because said services didn't bribe the isps.
without a doubt. racketeering never helped businesses, and that's what the lack of net neutrality is.
i don't know... i remember seeing a report of an audit done at the va a while back during the regular work day and something like 35% of computers were observed with porn visible on the screen. they didn't even bother minimizing it, or you, not watching porn during an inspection.
what is up with the word "coder", it sounds so /r/itsaunixsystem, why not just say programmer?
not every comcast customer is devoid of a competitor. i'm sure they'd still lose enough customers that they'd take action.
ha, you think search engine is all that google is? think about youtube, gmail, maps. is comcast going to replace all of these?
they changed the daily hd passes a few months back. turn it on once and its on for 900 something years.
the difference is amazon isn't providing any of these services, they are providing a service to allow those services to exist. it's like breaking up a water company because water is used in everything ever. or oracle for supporting java, which is used on more devices and projects than people can fathom. amazon has nothing to do with what goes on on these servers. they simply provide them, security for them, and guarantee an uptime.
why shouldn't they? they level of redundancy, availability, and security provided by aws is second to none.
no offense, but if you serve a role as emergency response personnel, and you are relying an email to provoke your response, my personal opinion is that you and your employer could do better. in all seriousness, email is not the best way to inform someone about a catastrophic event. that being said, thank you for whatever it is you do to respond to global emergencies.
the sad thing is that you're barely paraphrasing, he came off like a total dick. basically said netflix 10 years ago would be picketing with the rest, but now they're big enough to negotiate the deals they want.
fuck them, i'll just pirate their shows from now on
right now everyone still loves netflix. but when cable is gone they will keep getting more like the cable companies.
yeah. it looks like some 4chan trolling attempt now lol. it's not clear to your average observer that this is a political message... it *must* contain something about how to contact the relevant people or whom to send a letter to as well.
or you inform them this will happen if they don't rally their local politician when you click.
i don't think i am. social media can do a lot of good, i'm just not convinced it does more good than bad.
it's also a question of pride. nobody wants to pay off isps like they're the fucking mafia.
some european leaders are starting to like the idea of scrapping net neutrality as well (*cough* theresa may *cough*), so it's definitely a good thing to show it to as many countries as possible.
i was too lazy to type programmer and i feel weird saying dev outside of dev circles.
or they'd do their best to make get rid of whatever competition they have.
all i know is that they are starting to build in my city now and i couldn't be happier.
right?? like they know a lot of companies throttle because of netflix already right??? y'all are big enough to sit at the negotiation table and pick out which strap on they're gonna ram you with.
comcast and netflix have some sort of deal though since 2016.
we're in a between period where streaming services like netflix still have an advantage. they were nice for consumers in the beginning cause they aggregated a lot of the content from different networks. when cable finally goes to all streaming, all of the content will become fragmented and spread out across tons of streaming sites owned by the networks that used to be on cable. are people really gonna pay for 7 or 8 different services to get the content they want across the board? at that point you're just paying cable prices again, the only difference is that it's coming through the internet.
shareholders don't have pride. that's who a lot of these companies answer to. it's why do many of our companies make morally shit decisions all the time. they answer to shareholders that want the stock price to go up. i work for a fortune 200 company that is constantly finding ways to outsource, cut wages, and decrease benefits despite already being massively profitable. my wife works for a privately held company that pays well, fantastic benefits, flexible work life balance, and generally doesn't destroy the souls of the people working there.
but that means it still has to bargain and spend extra money buying off each provider. then continue buying them off... while the isp has nothing to lose by saying "fuck you amazon, pay me even more."
unfortunately, this isn't really true. for an isp to function at all, they need to know what ip address a packet is going to. they can take that address, check an index of who the address belongs to and wether or not their customer has a package that allows access to that site, and then they can deny access or charge for it from there. however, i totally agree with taking this to the states if it comes down to it. states usually have the ability to fix what congress fails to.
does comcast have legal rights over regions or something?
the number 1 example everyone always gave for nn was netflix. they were the main example of why net neutrality could be bad. but now that they're big they just don't care anymore, which shows how hypocritical they are.
i will laugh hysterically on the day this becomes true.
this shit is already happening. i have a data cap with comcast (which is another hate message by itself) and when i streamed hulu (owned by the comcast parent company) none of the data counted towards the cap. for a time period i stopped streaming netflix because it was driving up my internet bill. in general this is insane and i feel as if customers have no power.
i feel your frustration. but i feel like it wouldn't really cost them that much to promote nn. even if they issued a message or email notice to their subscribers and such, that would go a long way. but it just seems like they've become one of the giants now, so why support something that allows their competitors to thrive just as they did? it's a shame, really.
yea i read the statement as "i've got to keep the business focused on it's own survival, and we don't have the time or manpower for the nn fight". not that i agree with that decision either, but it's at least a decision i can understand.
agreed. this is a solid point. i don't plan on switching to hulu i never bought into their business plan anyway. i felt really betrayed when they offered a free service/ad supported for so long then just basically totally shifted and walled everything up behind a pay wall.
i work for a small private company that is destroying my soul... if i told you how shitty it was you wouldn't believe me. the pettiness and narcissim is overwhelming. and i know of corporations with great work environment. so i don't think it's a matter of size but of leadership.
not to mention the fuck ton of lawyers they'd need just to broker the ass load of paperwork and agreements. my balls sweat just thinking about it. i bet lawyers are getting hard-ons though.
the same way they did it for tv, make everything package-based and pretend they can give you better prices if they don't have to give you access to everything. "why would you pay for all these websites you never visit? instead of having to charge you ridiculous prices of over a hundred dollars a month because of terrible infrastructure costs and evil government regulations, save money by paying only 60 dollars a month to access the websites you really want to access! plus, since these are your favourite sites, we'll give you premium high speed access to these! none of our competitors have it! we understand that you might still want to get on other websites, so as a favor we'll still give you 10 gb of general bandwidth for free and a trial of our premium unlimited high speed access to netflix! our competitors usually charge 20 dollars a month for this, but we're giving it to you for the first month for free!"
i've been subscribed for 2 years and never noticed, wow. i guess i just didn't type his name that much.
that something is the economy, and likely the government immediately after. these corporations are already doing everything they can to focus as much money possible in the hands of as few people as possible; eventually the gradient will become so extreme people forfeit the dollar and... i'm not quite sure. some people will make themselves useful and barter, but others have no skills outside of a company. but when the dollar falls, so too will the politicians who covet it.
sounds like publicly traded companies are amoral entities beholden to the financial interest of their shareholders and not ethical business practices.
no net neutrality will undoubtedly mean the death of netflix, in favor of carrier approved services - their own services, specifically.
paid for their service and then had to watch an ad before watching a movie trailer...which is an ad.
when cable came out, they said it would mean commercial-free tv. now just about every time you flip channels there is a commercial playing.
i'm not usually one for speculation. but i totally agree, i see no eventually where the us economy doesn't spectacularly collapse. look at the move from a manufacturering economy to one that is largely based around playing games with money, there's no way that can be sustained. not to mention massive amounts of consumer debt and all kinds of fuckery in the markets.
yep, so a good reason to have things like the internet run for the public interest rather than for profit. i don't care if any company supports net neutrality to the letter, i wouldn't want them in charge of the rules and regulations.
yea. that's what blew my mind as well. if i'm paying for something i don't want to see ads.
you, sir, are a true redditor. don't forget to repost after a while and reap the karma all over again.
worked as a gas station cashier for a stint after college, this is so true. i have a decent collection of silver coins because of these people.
coin shop. if they have a moral objection, try another coin shop. if you have a moral objection, a jeweler or metallurgist can reclaim the silver.
i've got a friend who's an expert nazi, let me call him up
15. pm or right fucking here. i'll outbid you you inaz
the nazis produced a lot of currency especially over occupied territory during the war so it's probably not that hard to find especially at militaria shows.
no, you see, you have to end it something like: "my advice would be to take this to an appraiser immediately. he'll be able to give you much more information than i could given that i specialize in coins from around 1998 when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell.
maybe put it behind some glass, on a pedestal. maybe dedicate a room to it with other nazi related historical finds. you could get some flags and put them up around the walls. you wouldn't want people going through your junk drawer to get the wrong idea.
i'm in college and i count all of the money for my movie theater each shift. i couldn't believe it when i found a 1935 $5 bill in perfect condition. my dad told me that's how he built his collection, from when he used to work a job in college counting money at an amusement park.
pokies are slots in case any non-aussies are confused.
ummm...any bill with a red seal, hold on to it. it's a gold certificate bill, meaning (supposedly) the government would have to give you $2 (or whatever the denomination) worth of gold. blue seals are silver certificates, i have lots of those, but i've only seen one red seal in person, on a really old 5 my grandma has.
i was in munich a few weeks ago and walked by a coin shop. they did have a few nazi-era coins in the window but each one had the swastika covered by a small piece of paper. i wasn't sure if it was due to legal regulations or not but i thought that it was a bit silly since everyone knows exactly what symbol is underneath and what it looks like.
1928 us mint peace dollar ($1 standard coin of the era) in excellent condition. coins are graded on scale of 0-70. anywhere in the ms(mint state) range, that is 60-69 would be worth more than my home.
especially considering he knew his friend was inside his mind.
boy i really hope somebody got fired for that blunder!
that's pretty good for a coin you receive as change.
i dont know much about it, let me bring in an expert. expert : this coin. is worth atleast $2500 rick : i can go $100, i mean its gonna sit on my shelf, i got bills, thats all i can go. seller: i think i got a good deal, i walked out with more than i was asking.
unless i'm not getting your sarcasm, i think the point is that spending that in germany would be frowned upon.
also, if not, try a large auction house. they sell thse things a lot, as war memoribila. people buy nazi flags, plates, glasses, beer stiens, not because they are racist ( at least not most of them) but because its interesting.
after what my buddy told me, the best i can give you is $2.00
need you to gestapo that reich now. nazi puns are the wurst.
and you might as well try and keep the jews out of that room, so i'd suggest getting a bullhorn and telling the neighbors jews aren't welcome in that room. for their sake.
don't crackheads realize how much more crack they could get if they just sold these old coins for close to what they were worth?
i thought that might be another term for iv drug users...
a detailed story like their little sister stole part of their coin collection for a pack of smokes?
the problem is that the act of publicly displaying nazi symbols in a shop window might not be considered as art or political education but rather as a declaration of political affiliation which is highly illegal in germany. it totally depends whether or not swastikas are illegal and probably the shop owner just wanted to avoid any kind of trouble.

can't you get arrested for heiling hitler in germany? how would spending this coin go over?
i am an atheist, but i have a catholic german bible printed in 1810. it's in terrible condition, and has a gothic style typeface that makes it near impossible to read, but it's interesting as fuck to me.
haha yeah. i was going to say 13mm for a mint nazi coin is excessive.
i hope it'll be another thousand years before i hear that joke again.
as a former drug user i can tell you that when i was desperate enough to steal from relatives or friends or whoever, i certainly wasn't going to wait a week to sell something on ebay.
what kind of penalty is there for having a private political affiliation in germany?
i was trying to come up with an argument to contradict your point, but then i realised that i have nothing. there is no logical argument, but it just *feels* natural to me to censor genitalia and not swastika. kinda makes you think.
pcgs, one of the biggest coin grading services, puts an ms60 1928 peace dollar at a price of $475, so you're actually really close. i can find an ms64+ on ebay with a buy it now price of $2000.
brain has no pain sensor (*receptors) so he probably only feels pain when it pieced his skull
i sincerely don't get why stuff like this gets upvoted so much. why is being "savage" so funny? just distasteful.
and how in the beginning of the movie hilter's government was the fourth reich, but then after he went back and screwed up those plans it was only the third!
just get the $25 in quarters and do it all over. keep repeating until you're set for life.
is chumlee his actual given name? who would do that? chumlee sounds like the last scoops out of an expired can of spam.
i was just in germany and people were doing the heil hitler at a beer garden, it was a joke for some dudes birthday, but staff did not like it.
that's actually really intriguing, do you have any pictures? i'd love to see some!
my god, i haven't thought of that college humor bit in a while.
no one in their reich mind would pay that much for a coin.
about $9. or $2.77 melted down for silver content.
no. it'll probably only be good for about 12.5 years.
this is the correct answer. no drug addict is going to wait any amount of time other than right now for drug money. if it's between $100 next week or $20 right now, i'd bet my heroin stash the junkie chooses the latter. that's how confident i am.
naw, smart people do stupid shit all the time. especially drugs. it's more relevant that using that 5 gets you high *right now*; selling it means you have to come down.
we pretty much beat the idea into the germans that they should feel deep shame for their actions. it's why they take these things very seriously in germany even to this day (at least the older generations). even japan still has an outdated constitution we wrote for them, and they still follow it because of history and their past actions. wwii still impacts us all today. it carved modern society.
i think in this one circumstance, the censorship is appropriate. it would not be appropriate to censor it in the us imo. the holocaust is still pretty recent, there are still people alive who remember it. and germany is really touchy about that whole "we killed 20% of the jews in europe lol" thing. i'm not saying the german people at the time were completely responsible for that, lot of the citizens didn't know that extent of what was going on at first, hitler probably would have killed everyone if they did an organized protest, etc, etc. i'm just saying it's a dark period in their history, like her japanese interment camps of the same era are in the us. the swastika is also banned in germany they are appropriately worried about the rise of neo-nazis in europe. it's a thing there, and it's on the rise. :
it's crazy how the price goes up with each grade level beyond ms60. at ms66 it goes up to $35,000. the 1928-s mint mark brings it up to $67,500 at ms66. madness.
it's definitely not a metaphor and would probably be considered a pun if i could just figure out what it's supposed to be.
"so how'd you get so rich?" "i collected nazi money"
chumlee is not his actual name. chumlee was the name of a cartoon character that the pawn stars dude resembles.
as a german... yeah, that's really fucked up! where in germany was this? and were the people doing it germans or tourists?
jesus christ, reddit, you're not gonna get arrested because of some old coin! some people really seem to think that just thinking of a swastika gets you summarily executed in germany or something... the cashier will look at you funny, or maybe say "hey, cool, my grandma has one of those too" and then carry on with his day.
glad someone got it, haha. i was afraid it'd just woosh.
thirteen is a bit much. i'd expect to pay closer to nein if i were in the market for nazi coins.
as an american, i've been spending a lot of time looking at this comment thread and thinking about whether or not i should participate.
i can't wait for my investment portfolio to mature. so then i can smoke some crack.
i used to do drugs. i still do, but i used to do them too.
exactly. once someone is a long-time addict to the point of stealing from family, thier goal isn't getting high, it's avoiding brutal comedown. avoiding that literal agony right now is worth way more to them than getting higher later. to them it is an immediate, binary need rather than a quantitative exchange of goods.
that's usually how it starts. the constant fear of comedown is what typically keeps it going for years after. many realize it is a problem that is detrimental to thier life, but feel they lack the strength to address it head-on. keeping comedown at bay one dose at a time seems easier than facing it, even though in the long term the damage and hardship greatly outweigh the discomfort and often actual agony of getting clean. it's actually pretty heartbreaking when you think about it; people looking for an escape wind up in a whole new hell. it seems all to easy for folks to demonize addicts as flat-out bad people, rather than troubled people who might have a more involved life story than "i like crack more than my family".
it was amazing. as soon as starlord throws the jetpack onto drax we hear him shout, "ah! my nipples!" as he careens away. perfect. god, i love those films.
yeah but how many reichsmarks equal 1 schrute buck?
you really cant throw a rock without hitting one it seems.
wouldn't it have more value as an historical item?
you're doing it wrong. get some crack as part of he portfolio. diversification through investing in commodities. or consumer staples depending on your level of need
charles xavier was screaming the whole time. (note: this quote could totally be taken as a double entendre. you didn't hear it from me.)
you can get off meth by replacing the cravings with cheeseburgers??? i mean yeah that's one bad for your health thing traded for another but the new thing is so awesome! . that's like if someone could give up drinking if they just pet a dog instead l every time they wanted to drink, or ate a reese's cup.
various things i've seen or read since the mid-90's - when i started paying attention to world events - have lead me to the conclusion that throwing rocks at israelis is a very bad idea.
hardly. there are still soo many of them in private collections.
ha! good luck paying for rubber bands to keep all that cash together.
wait. you mean old people can't enjoy crack? i'm changing my retirement goals.
it's less than planned. it's always less than planned...
go suboxone. i just quit (again). subs work pretty well.
my birthdate is 1/4/88. i should probably stop shaving my head
holy shit! i almost had a panic attack. i had to go through my record collection and verify that the band 1349 was actually 1349 and not 1488. slight brain fart.
i honestly did nazi that pun coming. did jew guys?
no, no. i'm *cutting down*. i won't use as much this week as i did last week. this will be the week.
woken up? most people in the history of crack just never go to bed.
and maybe start letting your mustache grow out past your nostrils. just to be extra safe.
well... now you know it exists you might notice it is more prevalent than you would think. ignoring and forgetting it won't make those people go away. just look at this thread and see the number of people who are up in arms about the purity of their race.
no i didn't see it coming. anne frankly i don't find these puns funny.
" hey i know you are sad, but im really hungry. can this not be about you for a second and you just feed me?"
same here. most of my cat's life was hiding under beds, but if someone was upset he'd always come find you and comfort you. weird yet awesome.
i believe russian blues are put on this earth to bridge dog people into cat people. same thing happened with my husband. he hated cats because he was allergic to them. i brought home a russian blue since they are hypoallergenic. they are now best buds. our cat is his home office assistant, lap warmer and confidant.
i'm so sorry having to lose your little guy. i know it's cliche, but he isn't in pain anymore, but i know it still hurts. stay strong
"*it's gotta be around here somewhere... *prod prod**"
the same way we understand how animals are generally feeling. they learn to understand the sounds we make, our expressions and behavior, and for those pets with sensitive noses, can also smell chemical changes and the like.
aw. i had a dog who would do the same whenever my dad was throwing a temper tantrum. he knew i was scared and he didn't seem to care how mad my dad was.
one of mine came matter-of-factly mewing at my bedroom door last week when my two-year woke up crying in the middle of the night. i guess i wasn't moving fast enough for her high, cat standards.
that is really special and i'm glad you're still here.
there have been so many moments in my life where i am truly sick of having to deal with humans. pets don't give a shit about whether you're getting good grades or what kind of clothes you wear, they just love you.
agreed. you need to earn their trust and treat them well and they will do the same in return, just like a normal person. i mean some humans don't even have any dignity or self respect for themselves so.
i've never understood the cat/dog schism. i feel like they're both awesome pets/animals with wide appeal so it seems weird that so many people put themselves into these weird camps.
i relate. they are angels. your story made me cry.
*sniff sniff death is near. i shall eat your lips first.
"maybe i can suck it's breath from its lungs. open this mouth child."
my cat is similar except she likes people, and instead of hiding all of the time she will just lay down in the middle of the walk way during the day, not at night though, she learned the hard way sleepy people can't see her at night.
purring has been shown to help speed up healing in cats. he was probably actually trying to heal you
"feeling better, meow?" "yes. *sniff* thank you, kitty." "good. *claws to the face*"
my mom came home eventually :p but i did raise him as my little cuddlebug :3
my floof recently died who, like yours, only had a few years with her sickness. it's so tough, the sweetest, most caring cats are the ones who die young. my family doesn't quite understand why i'm still so torn up about it. we had such a close bond.
depends on the cat. my current (and last) ones don't give a shit about me but my sweet perfect kitty who passed away years ago was very attuned to me. one time my spouse jumped out and scared me as a joke and i screamed, and my cat came running and attacked him to defend me. he was a good kitty. the best kitty.
maybe its indifferent behavior of tolerating you is like the cat level of "i love you so much i won't chase you away".
first part kinda sorta happened to me too. i was looking for my mom and couldn't find her. i was calling for her, and was checking every room. went to check the laundry room, and my dad poked his head out and said she had gone to our neighbours and would be home in a minute. well, impatient me, i went to look for her. they came to the door and seemed very confused when i asked for my mom. weird... so i went back home, and my mom was inside. said she must have just been coming in one door as i left the other... i was too young to find anything off about that. i found out years later that she was in the laundry room, naked, hiding behind the door because they had been sneakily getting it on. apparently they had a good laugh when they heard me leave the house to go look for her
pretty sure mine started to speak english to me. when i was opening the front door he'd meow too hurry up. i swear! and he would hug me so tight and slobber on my neck. best cat ever!
oh man, you described my cat in so many ways. i love his curiosity. i can't do anything without him wanting to sit in the middle of it and look at me.
lol! yea totally. sometimes i'm like "bro, seriously, i need some personal space here" and have to keep picking him off of my lap if i'm in the middle of work. but after my dad died, it's like he knew something was up. he'd follow me around the house and sit next to me constantly. i always liked pretending it's because he knew i needed company. idk. he has way too much personality. whenever i see one that looks like him, i feel like i fall in love with it instantly because of him.
makes sense to me. i'm impartial to the species, but shared an affinity with one of its members. from what i understand. cats have a wide variety of personalities.
thank you. he was a beautiful example of unconditional love to me.
also that girl probably texted the cat's cell phone with a frowny-face emoticon.
your comment made me literally laugh out loud, which woke up my cat, who promptly meowed at me, which made me laugh more.
this smol child needs a guardian and since none of you assholes are doing it i elect my self
scientifically accurate depiction of the life stealing process. source: phd in almost science
kids cry all the time over anything and sometimes nothing
my cat always checked my report card. must be nice to have one that doesn't care.
i'm an animal lover. i don't give a fuck if it's a cat, dog or rabid baboon.
sometimes cats are assholes despite how they are raised. i've had many cats over the years and they all have such distinct personalities. some have been super friendly, some shy, some mean
the horse has been both dead and beaten for so long it has been turned to jam that expired on production day. it wasn't even funny to begin with in my opinion.
hey, it isn't the cat's fault that their crap is smelly. it's usually what they are feeding them.
girl crying on stairs clearly upset, he asks what is wrong multiple times. she asks him to leave her alone, he then asks for a kiss she gets up and leaves. you can judge the ruining part from that.
h3h3 talked about his videos before. he purposely makes really cringe videos and makes situations awkward, and not in a good way. he's infuriating, but some people eat his videos up. everything is very intentional.
i read that as drive way and the comment became really dark
where was she? i would never leave a 4 yr old alone.. sounds sketchy.
oh, i'm so sorry to hear that. i phrased my original comment a bit poorly - i was sick, my cat was not. she lived to a ripe old age, (for a cat.) i'm sure your dear, sweet cat-friend was happy and grateful to have lived their short life with such a caring companion as you. when you are ready, i hope you are able to let another sweet fuzzy companion into your life to care for again.
depends on the breed in my experience, my american shorthairs are assholes but my korat, same breed as the gif, is an utter sweetheart.
my indoor cat is super territorial and needs to be the only cat. about seven years ago another cat adopted me by showing up on my front porch and never leaving. indoor kitty was not thrilled about this, but as long as he stayed outdoors and she inside it worked. on the rare occasions that she got out or he got in it turned into a horrid hissing catfight. about four years later he got sick with cancer and had to come inside. at least three times i walked in on indoor kitty lying on the floor with him, facing him and almost paw-to-paw, as if they were conversing telepathically and she was comforting him. it was very touching and sad, the poor little guy.
it's actually an affectionate thing. cats bite - gently, for the most part. they do forget we don't have fur so sometimes they do it harder than is comfortable for our skin.
one of my cats meows every single time someone sneezes. always this short little meow that she doesn't use for anything else. i can never tell if she's scolding me for scaring her or saying "bless you" because she's hears us say something every time someone sneezes. either way, it's adorable. she's a super empathetic kitty.
well, it's a frequency that makes me feel better. and low stress is good for healing. so... checks out? kind of?
dude. slobber and hugs were not only his trademarks, but his mom's as well x) he's also come to demand ice from the ice machine to be put in his dish, because some fell one day and i decided to put it in there on a whim.
my first russian blue died at 22 and had a touch of kitty dementia. he would wander at 3 in the morning and yowl "harrow? haro-ow?" just like he was saying hello over and over and again. when we had guests for xmas he got really confused because we switched rooms and he found strange humans in "his" bed, which prolly triggered the wandering and even more "harrow-ing".
we are lucky we have cats. i wouldn't have picked on that clue.
"neeeearly science?! how can you be nearly science?"
confirmed. i'm a father at my 7 years olds birthday party right now. 12 kids at a bowling alley. each are taking a turn crying over fucking something. you guys got pizza, free video games and bowling. life. is. good.
my cat's shits are not too stinky, but last night she dropped a bomb in the roommate's cat's litter box and it made everyone (including her) get the fuck out of there. shit was stinky!
don't let their shadow keep your little light from shining buddy.
but "taco cat" is still a palindrome! i'm impressed
really? my american short hair was the sweetest cat i've ever met. my siberian on the other hand... not so much.
sometimes what i'll do is wrap my hand in a thin blanket and let my cat groom *that*.
my cat meows at sneezes, too. but he also gives a look like he is offended so it's definitely not his way of saying bless you. it's more like him saying "stop making sudden noises like that."
it only seems good to us because we've experienced so much pain that small things no longer bother us.
if you're talking about drinking cat urine, then no. iirc the reasons cats can drink salt water is because their kidneys are so efficient they can expel all the salt. so cat urine is far less potable than human urine. if you're talking about blood, that's probably more disgusting but might be achievable, herders from certain tribes do something similar with cattle.
only when they sit atop a throne made of billions of human skulls, only when they can gaze upon an endless river of blood and history, only when their ears are soothed with the cries of the slaughtered, only when the skies are blacked by the smoke of mankind's cremation, only when our species is encased in the cold stone of the eternal tomb, only then will they be satisfied.
she went out to get cigarettes, and milk, some say she is still looking for them to this day.
reading through the breed characteristics, i see a lot of words under "personality" that seem to be attempting to not call them assholes. i've met some nicer american shorthairs but not many and very few i would describe as affectionate without evidence of heavy crossbreeding.
mine purr/hisses, i think i win in the realm of mixed signals.
it's good that you two loved each other and had a lot of good times. he sounds like a good cat
you should stop inviting stevie wonder over, then.
"you make it the same way you make orange juice. you just use cats instead." -alf
in a battle of magical big cats and dragons for the iron throne, who would win?
my roommate has a shorthair that's a total bro, i think they at least have the emotional range that some of them are friendly/nice/empathetic. he recognizes my roommate's car noises and runs over to the door to greet him when he gets home. he cuddles with people when they're upset and begs for playtime. bats you and play-bites you a lot too but never enough to hurt. just an outgoing little dude. talks to you if you talk to him, too. i'm gonna miss that cat when we move out.
when i was young i had an alf doll. it spoke, but i was not aware of that fact until one night i was home alone and something scared me, so i was hiding under a blanket holding onto him. i finally squeezed whichever part activated the voice and suddenly hear, "i'm hungry. do you have a cat?" it pushed my nerves completely over the edge and i basically went cataconic until my mother got home.
we're drinking cat blood, get with the program homie
that is hilarious! i used to hate alf for his cat eating ways.
