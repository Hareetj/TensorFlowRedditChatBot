What's your secret to staying so young, looking so good, and having so much fun? TELL US PLEASE!  
Sir Patrick, I've read that you were born in Mirfield. As a fellow Yorkshireman, does your old accent ever pop out by mistake sometimes? Or has it completely disappeared after so many years away from God's Own Country?  
I was sad to hear of Roger Rees’s death in July. I know you worked with him many years ago in the RSC (and in Robin Hood: Men in Tights, of course!) Could you share your favorite memory of him?   
What would you advise to Daniel Radcliffe who'd like to play Shakespeare in theatre?

First off, let me say that I really admire your work-you were so flawless as Professor Xavier and Picard, and so wholly charismatic and thoughtful in your acting.  My question is whether you have done/would consider narrating audiobooks? I'm an audiobook junkie, and absolutely adore your voice.   Thanks for the AMA! :-)

How difficult was it to film [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg_cwI1Xj4M) with Ricky Gervais for Extras without the two of you dying of laughter? Also have you ever thought of venturing into more comedic roles?  
Sir Patrick Stewart, I must say it’s an honor to get the chance to speak with you. I was raised on The Next Generation, and I’d like to think the show imparted upon me a grand sense of imagination and wisdom. It’s often stated that “The Inner Light” or the “Caymen” episode, is one of your favorites. I was hoping you could briefly describe your feelings about that episode and what about it resonated with you? For the rest of my life, I’ll distinctly remember the scene where you hug the recorder after Riker leaves the room. Thank you for inspiring me, for teaching me so much through Jean-luc.   
What do you think of Leeds United?  
What do you consider to be the most fun you have had in your acting career?  Also, you are fantastic.  
Hello Sir Patrick!  I am a young actor who is currently engaged as Henry V, having developed a love for Shakespeare in the last few years.  As a man who has had a long career as a film and stage performer, do you have any advice on making the transition between film and stage?  Thank you so much for the wonderful entertainment over the years!  
I missed a performance you did with Judy Dench in 2002 in London.  Showed up and it was sold out.  One of my biggest regrets.  Are you in any productions now?  When is the next time someone can see you on stage?  
What's your favorite cocktail, sir?  
Sup Sir Patrick!!  What are some things on your bucket list?  
Hi Patrick! Im a huge fan of yours and I grew up watching the X-Men Films. What is the best thing about playing the role of Professor X?  
Sir Patrick,  My husband and I are huge fans. He doesn’t have a Reddit account, so I’m asking questions on behalf of both of us:  * What is your drink of choice?  * What is one of your favorite books you have read in the past year?  * What is the best worst thing that has happened to you? (i.e. a blessing in disguise)  * When is your next BFF date around NYC with Ian McKellen?   Thank you so much for sharing your talent and humor with the world!   Edit: My husband wanted me to say that his absolute favorite scene in Star Trek was when you played the Inner Light. He loved it so much that all he wanted for Christmas two years ago was a replica of the tin whistle. It inspired him to learn how to play music by ear, so he wanted me to tell you thank you.  
Hi Sir Patrick,  Thank you for doing this AMA, I’m a huge fan!  I have three questions:  1.	Which Captain did you have more fun playing – Captain Ahab or Captain Picard?  2.	Due to your fame – is it hard for you to enjoy most activities that some people take for granted?  For example – can you and Sir Ian McKellen go down to the pub for a pint of beer without being harassed by fans?  3.	Finally – what was going through your mind at [this moment](http://i.imgur.com/14FEj.jpg) during this photo op?  Thanks again!   
Is it fun to voice-act with Seth MacFarlane?   
Hi, Sir Patrick! I have eagerly awaited your AMA - thank you for doing it!  First, please allow me to say **thank you.** At a young and critical age when I had very few positive male role models in my life, you beautifully rendered in Captain Picard a powerful but temperate man worthy of emulation: externally rational but internally passionate, proud but grounded, diplomatic but resolute, shrewd but decisive. Your work as Picard as an immensely positive presence, and I believe seeing him as an alternative helped me break more fully away from the influence of an angry, embittered, abusive father. As I learned ever more about your childhood experiences and your positions on domestic violence and PTSD, I saw that the good man on-screen was occupied by a good man off-screen. So, at length: **thank you.**  My question:  What’s your favorite story about a Next Generation co-star behind-the-scenes that we may not know about?  P.S. You also helped me go bald with grace.  EDIT: Came back from a day of meetings to dozens of great comments - thanks everyone! Can't say I'm not disappointed that Sir Patrick didn't respond, but I got my first gilding, so that's pretty great. Thank you, gilder!  EDIT 2: Just realized I was gilded twice! That's a hell of a first time. Thanks, second gilder!  EDIT 3: Thrice! Thank you! Seems like this comment really struck a nerve.  
Hi Patrick,  Can you get decent Yorkshire pudding in the US? I absolutely love a Sunday roast with lots of Yorkshire pudding. Best thing about the UK.  
Do you have an actual manservant IRL? I can't figure out how you can fit so much awesome into your daily routine.  
Mon Capitaine,  What would be the first thing you would do if you were granted the powers of Q?  
How do you feel about the Worf Star Trek Series that Michael Dorn keep pitching?  
When will we see you on Tabletop with Wil Wheaton?? We really just want to hear you say "shut up Wesley" because we know how much he looooves that. Seriously though...when? :)  
Hi Sir Patrick,  I was wondering, what has been the craziest thing a fan has asked you to do for them?  Incidentally, 5 years ago I was getting married and wrote to you saying that your were one of my wife's favourite actors, and if you could possibly write me a little message to give to her on the day at the reception during the speeches. Which you very kindly did, sending best wishes to us both (went down very well indeed, especially the Make it So!).  I just wanted to let you know that we both very much appreciate your kindness in taking the time to do that, so thank you very much indeed.    
Some day there will be a space ship, or a star ship. It will have a bridge, it will have a Captain much like you represented, commanding a bridge crew, and travelling the stars. In all likelihood, that ship will be called Enterprise.  Was there ever a time when you were on the bridge set of TNG, that you had that same realisation? Was it at all apparent at the time how impactful the show would be on future inventions, on people's choices  of career, and on our looking to the stars?  
Will we ever see you as Jean Luc Picard again?  
Sir Patrick, I'm an English Lit teacher, and we're using your film version of the RSC Hamlet with David Tennant to supplement our reading of the text. As someone who's studied the part, what sort of backstory do you imagine for Claudius? How long has his affair with Gertrude been going on? It would be amazing to share any insight you have with my class...  
How many lights are there?  
Sir Patrick,  It seems every time the rumours that the current Doctor in Doctor Who wants to leave, your name is brought up to be the new Doctor.  My question is: if you were offered that role, would you consider taking it?  
Mr.Stewart, did it ever bother you that a French Born character named Picard has an English accent, was that ever brought up to the writers?     
What were some of your favorite off-camera moments on the set of The Next Generation?  Would you ever consider returning for another Star Trek film, such as one of the reboot movies or a fan-made film?  Thank you so much for doing The Next Generation. I started watching the show a few years back during adolescence, and I was amazed by its powerful messages and characters. It taught me a lot about myself and the world around me, and it’s still my favorite Trek series today.  
Hi. What's your favourite TNG episode?  
If Michael Dorn put together a new, modern Star Trek centered on the character Worf, what is the likelihood of you appearing on it as a regular or special guest?  If we were in a Fahrenheit 451 world and you had to memorize works to save them, which two plays, musicals, movies, or TV shows would you be the keeper of?    
Thanks for coming out to Reddit!  Do you have any stories about working with David Lynch on Dune?  
Have you seen the MEME of yourself( http://imgur.com/A0Rw1Rj )that is frequently posted here on Reddit, and what do you think of them?
