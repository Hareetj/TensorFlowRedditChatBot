Not only blood, but these centers need water bottles and snacks as well for the large influx of people donating blood. If you can't donate blood, think about donating food and drinks. 
Thank you for this. My sister is a critical care nurse at ormc and she lives only a few miles from Pulse. The day they worked today was long and the days to come will be too. My sister just wants everyone to know that ormc is a level one trauma center for a reason, and they were prepared for handling tragedy like this, and she is glad for it. Hearing from her about surgeries in hallways gave me chills. I'm glad I'm not the only one thinking of them. Also tijuana flats gave them all dinner so they've got that going for them, which is nice.
That must have been incredibly tragic. I hope you're doing well. 
I'm so sorry please let us know when you hear something 
Correct, I believe he will speak at 1:30 eastern time. 
Yes! Not only blood, but these centers need water bottles and snacks as well for the large influx of people donating blood. Random acts of pizza is an amazing thing to do right now if you can't donate blood. 
Donation centers are at capacity for the day, but they're asking everyone to donate as the week goes on. 
I'm glad your brother is okay. 
I live right down the street from the club myself, absolutely crazy, I'm glad your friend is safe.
It's now officially the worst shooting in US history. :(
Merci
An off-duty officer was working in the club, exchanged gunfire with the suspect when he began shooting on the main floor at approx 2 AM. Two additional officers responded, initiating the hostage-taking and subsequent standoff. 
you made perfect sense, thank you.
The shooter's father has apparently said that he had become angry after seeing two guys kiss in Miami.  So yeah, seems like he hates gays and this was a hate killing.  
He was a U.S born citizen wasn't he?
If he is actually a member of ISIS, then the bastard gets what he wants. The greater the divide between ordinary Muslims and the West, the better for ISIS.If he is just some moronic idiot who hated gays, then yes he is just some incompetent evil idiot.
Honestly, 60% of the comments are about /r/news. Let's get more discussions about the actual situation.
Pride month has always been a bleak reminder (Stonewall), but I do agree, so many years later to have this time punctuated by this event is heartbreaking.   
Probably is. How many times has he had to make the same speech during his presidency? Gotta get disheartening 
While your statement is correct, this is the deadliest mass shooting in the U.S., ever.
On r/news? Mos def.
Facebook has a cool safety check feature that can tell you if your friends have marked themselves "safe". It might be worth checking out if you have people you haven't heard from. 
I got banned for mentioning that the shooter is Muslim.
What did they do?
That is a *great* recommendation that I never would have thought of. 
I hope he comes out alright. Wish you the best
Always look for the helpers.  - Mr Rogers
Same thing happened at The Bataclan.
Also the same thing described by firefighters at the KISS nightclub fire in Santa Maria, Brazil, where about 240 people died.
18th time he will have done this during his presidency. Shame. 
Cookies come to mind. And if you're in the area, you can make those! My thoughts go out to everyone impacted by this.
Target donated liked 500 cases of water, and the publix in South Downtown did the same. 
I live in Orlando, have AB positive, regularly donate plasma at the same center and I called in asking if they wanted me to come in.  They set an appointment with me for tomorrow.  Don't go down to one today as they are overwhelmed at the moment.  Call and set an appointment for later in the week.
For real. I was talking to a Sikh guy in my area once, and he told me that Sikhs wear turbans and keep small knives (kirpans) as an indicator to those around them that the Sikhs are there to help those in need.
I'm glad you're safe.  Something like this, happening in my own neighborhood... I couldn't even imagine.
Hey neighbor. You're lucky you weren't here. It was terrifying
People will say "you can't blame them." But I am totally blaming them. 
Him and the other 20 people densely packed in that alley, had the shooter found them they would have had no chance. It was an awful, awful thing but nobody knows what they would really do in a situation like that.
I'm so going to hear about this at school tomorrow.  Like Paris all over again. 
It really, really sucks.As someone who has personally lost friends (both muslim and non-muslim) to extremists, to see so many people blame our entire population hurts a lot.
Thank you for that. Feels sometimes like everyone hates all of us, even though we're also horrified at these acts.
For some reason, that I can't even explain, when I heard that the Orlando Mayor declared a State of Emergency it really sunk in. It's terrible, but you have to give all of the rescue works/police extreme credit. From the things I read the shooter had no plans on letting anyone in the club live. It's something that just makes you feel numb and sad. Thoughts are with all the people affected by this tragedy. 
I wouldn't be surprised if r/news loses default status over this. They are censoring discussion of a serious tragedy because of their political views. Though it doesn't matter *why* they're doing it, the fact is that THE default news subreddit is not allowing discussion of the absolutely most newsworthy event right now. I suspect the admins will do something in response.
Fuck killing people, it's stupid.
Bizarre that it can found here in an askreddit thread - unbelievable 
Sadly, we know too well what you're going through. 
Awesome work from the off duty officer, even though he didn't get him, I'm assuming some people were able to escape during their firefight. Just hope he doesn't feel at fault for not being able to stop him. 
Officers rescued at least 30 individuals in the club. 
To be fair hindsight is 20-20 and the police might not have had all the info on what was happening on the inside, I'm sure it was very chaotic and they didn't want to charge in and make a mistake
I've lived in Orlando off and on my whole life, five years solid I've lived here now, this is by far the most tragic thing I've ever witnessed. Maybe because I'm older now and I can relate better, but the more the reports are finalized and the numbers sure up it's just horrifying to imagine these poor people. He didn't strike until 2 am and bars close at 3 so all of these people are trapped and likely totally inebriated by then. The DJ posted on FB that there was a gunman in the bar for everyone to run and get out of Pulse. I can't imagine the confusion as 300 people try to flee. 
Thanks for your kindness.  we need to stick together. 
Ah you made me smile ! Thanks for that. 
You know what it's still unreal to me sometimes. You forget it happened. And some morning it hits you and you're in hell. So so strange. Thanks for the kinds words. 
Angry about two guys kissing in Miami? You may as well get angry about the sun shining in Miami. What a fucking stupid crazy evil sonofabitch. 
His own parents said they believe the motivation was anti-gay.
You're mentally stable 
His parents weren't. Media likes controversy, don't forget. Next week is going to be really shitty for me -.-
i love how the character in the graphic is standing there awkwardly like 'so....yeah'
Agreed. It could be a really great resource if the images were simplified a little. 
Too many colors and shapes. I can't tell what's supposed to be what. 
If r/news isn't going to do its job, it's up to the most popular subreddits (like this one) to pick it up so the most people possible will be aware. Thanks for doing the right thing.
/r/news is currently losing 250 subscribers a minute
My girlfriends parents (Seniors) heard about this before I saw it on Reddit. 
Longest post lasted 5 minutes with hundreds of points.
What happened?
Reddit says its the front page of the internet. The fact we have to get info from non news subs makes me question that. This is how you piss off users, both acounted and casusal readers. Makes me think ill go somewhere else for the next big news story. 
Before he got into the pressroom they said this was the 15th time he has had to make a statement about a mass shooting.
CAN SOMEONE GET MOS DEF ON THE PHONE? I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HE MAKES OF ALL THIS
What the fuck is wrong with /r/news and is there anything we can do about that mod on a power trip
Thank you, anything helps! I think a lot of blood centers have reached capacity and recommends making an appointment for later this week. But they could definitely use the food and water. 
That is wildly specific! But true!
Mr. Rogers went to Rollins College, just 15 minutes from PULSE. 
Can you recommend any good alternatives? 
What happened this morning with the mods?
It's visible how much he has aged mentally and physically throughout his presidency.
We could always order stuff from Amazon Prime Now for them. Get them what they need.
It was pretty amazing, we got offered so many bottles of water and umbrellas while we waited!  
I dunno how their badass hats are gonna help but the thought is appreciated. 
I've heard gunshots before and I've gotten used to the routine. Close your curtain, turn off your lights, and stay away from the windows. But I remember the first time it happened, I was like 6 or 7 and it's absolutely terrifying. I can't imagine what it would be like to live your whole life only relatively peacefully only for a massacre to happen around the corner
I'm not even trying to be insensitive. As a gay man, this is terrifying to me. It's going to make me think twice about being open about my orientation to anyone who isn't a very close friend.
According to the edit, the alleyway was already filled with people piling on top of each other to get out a hole in the fence. I'm choosing to believe that guy barricaded the door to save the lives of the people he was witnessing, clamoring to get out of a fence.
I don't know about you but I'm blaming the guy with a gun
I mean, most victims of Islamic extremism are Muslims.  That's a fact that frequently gets overlooked or ignored.
A mass terrorist shooting in Orlando is a nightmare scenario, since it has so many theme parks. 
That'sounds because the mods of /r/news are pedantic, priggish, insulting, controlling ninnies.Remove /r/news from the front page!
Unsubbed /r/news . May I request everyone to please do the same and teach those biased mods a lesson. Throw their subreddit into the garbage.
I just realized I'm in /r/askreddit and not /r/news.
Tragedy strengthens our bond, and through that bond we find strength.
It depends. If it's an active shooter, they charge in ASAP. If it's a hostage situation, they try to negotiate. It seems like this was one masquerading as the other. They followed protocols for hostage-situation when the shooter had no intention to keep survivors. 
It's damned if you do and damned if you don't. If the police had charged in immediately and the guy had, for example, blown himself up and killed another 50 people... they'd be blamed for going in too fast. 
As another Frenchman here. Stay strong. We stand with you. I can barely imagine the dread and anger you must be feeling.I have only sadness and compassion for you guys.
FBI seems to be indicating there were ties to terrorism as well, so it may have been a planned attack
I'd imagine it's more "possible terrorism attack" and hate crime.
I work closely with a bunch of Muslims in the military.  I'm lucky that I live in a very international town that is friendly to everyone because I imagine they'd have a bad time in most of the country.  Stay safe.
>Comfort'So... you remember the time when you were shot in the head and died after five minutes of awkward conversation with a random stranger on a bar? That was pretty fun, wasn't it?'
>  250 subscribers a minuteDeservedly.   I just unsubscribed.  What we need is to channel all those former subscribers into a sub that does what r/news and others are supposed to do, but for some reason won't:  treat the news as more important than locking threads that try to discuss said news.
Goodbye /r/news
But the second Price died they were all up on it. This is one of the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil and what the fuck? 
Mods started nuking everything once FBI confirmed he was Muslim.
100% they've fucked it
WHERE IS JA?!?
UNSUBSCRIBE FROM /r/news !!
Every other sub. r/askreddit at this point. Why subscribe to something that isn't gonna do its job anyway?
either the mods or automods have been deleting most comments. said is was because people were doxing the shooters family, but they're even deleting posts with info on giving blood
I worked in the mortgage division of a bank at the time and about 3 or so of our applicants died on 9/11.  Normal protocol is to send a letter for withdrawal due to inactivity but I couldn't do it. Their spouses and family members didn't need to see another reminder of lives cut short.  I made a copy of the letter for their files and tossed the originals.  RIP
I hadn't thought of the impact those noises would have on the surviving firefighters. They absolutely would have known what that noise was and would have done anything to help them.
So I'll go ahead and say it. What was he doing for 3 hours? In 3 hours an incredible amount of fire can be put down, way more than what is needed for 103 dead and wounded. Do we know if he was out of ammo? 3 hours is just such a long time in a firefight
Our thoughts and hopes are with you, friend. Reading your comment gave me a different perspective. Previously this was a tragedy that happened hundreds of miles and an ocean away from me so there was a natural separation for me. Seeing the fear and hope in your words has truly brought this closer to me. I'm not properly explaining myself, but I hope you are ok and I hope your friend is safe. 
Can you imagine him being woken up at 4 o'clock this morning and what must have been going through his head. I mean when I get woken up in the middle of the night and it's bad news there's a limited amount of things that I think it might be. But as president of the United States oh my God could be anything.
Amazon should engineer a disaster relief button on their app where organizations like Red Cross and Blood Donation centers can create a wish list for anyone to buy and send to them. 
The turban is worn to show that the person wearing it is a Sikh. So that everyone who see can see that said person is a Skih. 
I'm not sure it was the shooter's intent, but that's literally the definition of terrorism.
Thanks for the clarification...That sounds a lot better than one guy closing and barricading the door behind him....Sucks to hear either way for sure...God what a terrible tragedy. My thoughts are very much with all the victims and families for sure...Today my heart aches.
Homophobia is shit.
I will unsub from /r/news but are there any better news subs? 
I can see they're actively removing threads for it...
The gas was a good idea but the execution of the whole event was awful. They didn't have enough medication to treat everyone affected by the gas and they let people choke to death unconscious. 
I strongly suspect this is an ISIS-fan terrorism attack. He probably had no actual ties to ISIS, just wanted to do "his part" to ... uhh what is it they want to do? Well killing gay people probably looked like a good way to help the global effort to this guy. 
Just...just keep your br- keep your brain in your head, man...it'll be alright...dude.
Well we wouldn't want to offend anyone by criticizing Islam would we? Better to censor all discussion about the ~~greatest~~ largest mass shooting in U.S. history. edit - a word because some people don't know that great doesn't always imply good
Help me Ja Rule! 
And tell the mods to fuck themselves
Actually though, shout out to the /r/askreddit mods because this was a better thread than the ones at /r/news.
There were a lot of things I did not want to ask. This was definitely on that list. It was hard enough having to know what was happening, I didn't want to know the details. I didn't want to know what people were having to do with their loved ones' posessions. I didn't want to know a goddamn thing about how hard the human tragedy was hitting everyone around me, because I was 19 and was not prepared in any way to deal with something like that.
I'm sure you have to become somewhat desensitized. You see a lot of shit in 8 years as Prez, at this point it's probably a sigh and an audible "fuck"
That is actually a genius idea. You should submit it to them. No joke.The only thing about amazon is that it takes a while for delivery. But I'm sure something could be worked out for situations like this. 
Unfortunately, a lot of people think the turban is a Muslim thing. 
It probably was his intent to some degree. He obviously wanted to scare/hurt the gay community, and force them out of the public eye.Screw that though. We as a nation and world need to make sure not to give creepy crazy people like this too much power.It is fully within their rights to think being gay is evil, and it is fully in their rights to express that verbally. Just as it is within my rights to think they are idiots. But when someone on any side crosses the line into violence people from every side need to band together to defend and protect the victims.
who was the shooter? What was so significant about him?
I guess that explains why this is in AskReddit
Unfortunately there are *dozens* of other news subreddits, none of which have the same subscribership as /r/news. This will fragment reddit's readership across all those subreddits. Maybe, in time, readers will migrate and settle down in one or two but, for a while, we'll have to probably browse several news-related subreddits to get a full range of facts and thoughts.This was a colossally bad move on the part of /r/news. I hope this is the end of that subreddit; it's the least they deserve.
Throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Gays, guns, Muslims, terror, we have pretty much everything contentious topic in this country in one event, of course it's going to be a shit storm. 
I remember watching a fascinating documentary about it. They had one of the Spetsnaz soldiers talking about why it went so badly - the emergency personnel just left the unconscious people on their backs on the pavement once the raid had been carried out. The Spetsnaz guys were dashing like madmen trying to put people on their sides in recovery positions and were furious the people they had just saved were dying needlessly.
nope
They don't need direct contact in fact they prefer not to risk it. They just put out tons of information about who, what, where and how to carry out attacks and recently told people to step up attacks for Ramadan.
Isnt that CNN's motto?
Well, to be fair, that's not too hard to do...Heck, even the_donald had more objective information about the event than /r/news
I heard it on the *fucking radio* before I found it on Reddit./r/news mods should be ashamed. 
I agree 100% r/news is now dead. Worst censorship scandal ever. 
He honestly seems really upset every time there is an attack like this. It's something I really admire about him. Especially when he spoke about Sandy Hook, I felt like he was speaking as a father, not just as a president.  
"Honestly, if I were two-faced, would I be showing you this one?"- Abraham Lincoln in response to an accusation by Stephen Douglas 
Yea I can agree with that, the most striking issues though are his hairline being insane and the forehead creases.
I think i will. Prime Now can deliver in 2 hours. Even if some sort of disaster extends that delivery window to much longer, it can still be pretty valuable. Amazon has massive wearhouses full of emergency essentials. This can also help to thwart misuse of funds a little if we are sending the necessary items directly.
I didn't yet but i will now.  What email address did you send to? Or did you just use the contact us link?
Probably because they'll be either Sikhs or Gurkhas. Both ideal company in faecal-impact-related turbine failures.
Yeah, I was talking about this with a friend earlier. One of the victims in Norway died a few days after the attack. It's definitely a possibility here, though hopefully they all pull through.
And someone higher up stated it was Hispanic night at the club.. So you can add another contentious aspect to your list. 
I don't understand. Why are the mods censoring? Like, what are they gaining from it? Thanks 
Subbed to them.  I'm also giving /r/USANews and /r/Full_News a chance as well.  
I think it's because he feels so powerless. This is one of those things that despite being the most powerful politician in the country no matter how much he wants change to happen and how hard he tries it simply won't happen. He has to make a speech anytime something like this happens and talk about how awful it is, all while knowing it will happen again and again. He knows why it's happening and how to stop it but he can't.
People think that our current presidential candidates say childish things to each other during debates.  When Lincoln and Douglas were debating everything was free game including the families of them both.
Hairline looks the same in both to me, just the first he has a comb-over masking that forehead puff.
I'm sure Amazon could kick in the accelerated delivery charge if people are buying disaster relief goods from their site... this is a really good idea
They even have power transmission towers shaped like Mickey Mouse.
My guess is that they delete any comment mentioning Islam. Only a guess, though. Can't imagine any other reason they'd delete so many comments.
I don't even think it's a matter of "could" as much as I bet they "would". I can't describe how much I love this idea. 
How do you claim your ISIS mega-reward when you're dead?
They were deleting comments of people telling others to donate blood in the area as well.
Usually they designate a family member or something like that. It's just like what Sadam did for Palestinian suicide bombers in the 90s. They go boom, he paI'd the family
Adams covering Foundation would be true magic.
Jesus, Christ- that's brilliant. Some kind of literacy push. I'll wait until the discussion rounds out some more, see what kind of things people are fiending for, and then if try and take a step forward with it.

That which is dead for millenia tends to stay dead; only by unholy machinations of a macabre nature could something be resurrected beyond its time.  It was in this way that John Hammond, entrepreneur, dabbler in necromancy, and generally respected man in society sought to play with life and death for personal gain.But that which sleeps beneath the earth yearns only to be surrounded by death.

Martians and humans both lived on giant dirt balls that spun and spun and ran circles around a giant fire ball. Humans sustained themselves by pushing calories wrapped in useless garbage through holes in their faces into squishy organs that converted the useless garbage into useful fertilizer and gave the calories to the rest of the body through a wildly elaborate freeway system in a sticky gooey fluid that some joker named after the same stuff that made up the giant fire ball: Plasma. Martians sustained themselves by stealing plasma from humans. So it goes.

I think I'm imagining a really rich ensemble cast of supernatural beings in India whose complex species politics (the vampires' internal strife amongst various covens, their united war against the werewolves, their shaky on-again-off-again alliance with ghosts, etc.) are a larger allegory for the difficult transition from colonial oppression to postcolonial self-fulfillment.Is that about what you're imagining?

The opening scene would have Bilbo Chinaski plastered to high hell in his derelict tree house while he starts *The Hobbit.* Frodo, not giving a Balrog's ass that Gandalf was coming to town, would be banging Rosie in the Green Dragon while Sam was out cutting the verge. I think, with no uncertainty, that Gimli would be the only character that wouldn't have to be rewritten.

No no, you're correct, or at least as far as I remember too. I meant it more, Pullman kills (lets God die) him in the book.

Margaret Atwood wrote a parallel perspective kind of work to Homer's Odyssey called the Peneloppiad, and it's fascinating. Would highly recommend.Also just cause I've never found anywhere else to put this on reddit, she came to my university to give a talk a couple years ago, and she was fucking hysterical the entire time. People left with their chests hurting from laughing so hard, it was amazing. That woman deserves so much respect.

Same thing with the sparkly skin. The idea that vampires avoid sunlight for some reason *other than it hurts them* is a pretty cool idea. I wouldn't have gone with glittering diamond skin, but it's still a fun thought. Every other story I've read either has vampires hurt by the sun, or it doesn't affect them at all.The premise -and even the worldbuilding- had so much potential, but it wasn't very well executed in the end.
The Spy Who Came in from Ankh Morpork/ DiscWorld is Not Enough, if you will.
I recall Terry telling a story from a signing. Someone brought a book to him and said "look. I've worked it out. Ponder Stibbons, glasses, awkward boy who goes to a magical school. This is based on Harry Potter isn't it?" Terry turned to the front of the book and pointed out the 1992 publishing date. Equal Rites was also written a decade before Potter.

Nah. They'd be forced to wander the desert to search for something they can't find, and once they find it, they can go home to the promised land. Only to find that what they were searching for is a mystic form of death itself. In doing so, making them quasi immortal because it takes so long to find it and they can't die until they do.
The first third is like that but it gets easier to read further in.

Roald Dahl regularly had articles published in Playboy. Few people know because the magazine is better known for its photo journalism.
Holden Caulfield is teenage depression in writing
Stick to the stuff he actually wrote. After a while he got famous enough that he began "collaborating" with other authors. They write the books, using his characters and world building, and Clancy puts his name in big letters on the front of the book. The quality suffered immensely. Try Red Storm Rising to start. It's a stand alone work about war between NATO and the USSR set mostly in the north Atlantic and Europe.

As a 25 year old dude who's embarrassed to admit I kind of enjoyed aspects of Twilight - both books and films - I'm glad you mentioned the world building. Say what you will about Meyer's writing. The dialogue isn't great, the plot elements aren't great, etc etc. But one thing she nailed was building the world Bella lived in - a small town in the Pacific Northwest. She did a good job making you feel like you were in Forks, I think. I really loved the setting.

Seconded for Red Storm Rising. It's his second book after Hunt for Red October. I don't think he'd really planned on making Jack Ryan a franchise at the time. I think he was just writing books. Anyway, Red Storm Rising is a fantastic look at what modern day WWIII would look like using conventional Cold War weapons. I read this when I was in the Navy. No spoilers, but IIRC, the ship I was on was in the book at one point.

Quite a few apparently, I've seen several posts purporting to be from blind people. Using text to speech and brail keyboards is the most common method 
Are you dating a blind man?
I'm pretty sure it's a cultural trope that most people (men and women, gay and straight) prefer to close their eyes while kissing and turn the lights down (or even off) during sex. We might think we're all about visuals, but actually when it comes down to it, there's a lot more going on that we often don't think about.
TIL I might be gay
For real, are you blind and gay? Because if so we want a more substantive answer. 
But how do you know you wouldn't like a girl's dong in your ass?
I mean... It's kind of the same as asking how blind people could be attracted to women. Because they can't see doesn't mean they don't have a sex drive.
Or how gay straight blinds know they are people
Woah buddy c'mon now, one question at a time and I believe OP asked first.
No it would have hurt it.  Here's why.  The sample size this pertains to it ridiculously small,  Gay, Blind, and on Reddit I think 5 of them would be a high estimate.  So a serious tag gets a lot less comments and a lot less attention if its this specialized so with a bunch of pricks goofing around you're liable to head toward the front page, where it might be found by one of the five.  
A non-trivial percentage of people have accessibility issues but still use the internet! They rely on things like screenreaders to read the text for them, and accessibility-forward design like high contrast colors, big fonts, etc.Source: I work for a company that cares a lot about accessibility in our apps.
I also remember seeing an AskReddit about how blind people know they're done wiping. My favorite answer was, "when it stops feeling greasy". I can never not think that now. 
>not blind, buteeeeevery time
That's what happens when Gay is used as an umbrella term for both gays and lesbians.

I'm sure many youthful men were as enchanted by the smell of your desirable muffin wafting on that same summer breeze.
Up close, sure, it's delicious. But if you can smell it "from afar", there's something wrong with it. 
I can usually sense the sex of people close to me if we're close enough, even if i can't see them.  I dunno if it's smell specifically though, i think we're kinda wired to be cued in to the differences.  Animals always seem to know.
I don't see the humor in your comment.

Assisted reading devices/programs. Basically software that reads a page out loud for you.
I think Reddit fuzzes subscribers and online sub's in a similar fashion to the way in which the fuzz votes. I once created a completely random sub, and within one second (literally immediately after creating it) there were like 13 subs and 70-odd online. Obviously that was complete BS. So my guess is *fuzzing*. I could be completely wrong though.

That's really depressing.  I'm going to make a point to share his story with the "being gay is a choice " crowd. This guy's case is yet another example of where "choosing" to be gay has literally no benefits and leads to a sadder life. No way he "chose" to be gay. Thanks for the response. 
Tone of voice, volume, flirtatious phrasing, the sharing of laughter -- all of these are strong non-visual indicators of interest that blind and seeing alike can share... (besides, of course, permissable touch). I don't think they should be dismissed as less important than eye-contact.
I think they call them sculptures?

It seems like most of the straight guys I know are always trying to make fun of each other or out-wit each other, crack jokes, or talk about sports.--I don't like small talk, and I'm not into sports very much.  I like deeper, conversation-type questions and...conversations.  I hope that makes sense.  So, unfortunately, it's really, really hard for me to make new friends.
I mean this in the most encouraging way.  If you want this, work on yourself; focus on yourself.  When you get frustrated with your significant other, practice a thirst for finding how you could be wrong (and then, admitting it). It starts out painful and ends up addicting!
*wipes away a tear* I know. It was beautiful.
This is truly an eye opening comment for me. 
What is: "Marty what year is it?" ?
I tried to stifle a laugh while pooping and hurt my butthole.
You're wonderful! 
Did the blind gay person even know about Undertaker throwing Makind from Hell in a Cell in the first place?
Thank you to leading me to this glorious person. This is like reading poetry written by a particularly raunchy poet.
True, but I suppose, if it aint broke, don't fix it, haha. My screen reader reads the button perfectly fine at least.
Do you smell like doritos?
WHY DO YOU SAY THIS!!!
Now I wonder why I'm not into bestiality.
I thought it was a guy sucking a dick. I mean it was what the thread was about, so we were already there.
I would enthusiastically suck a dick for $2500 too. Spend $100 on liquor and roofies afterwards then you just wake up with $2400 in your pocket and no idea how it got there. 
Username checks out.
Weather's nice
Ferrets don't have sweat glands, so...
My search history now contains the question "can ferrets sweat".
Dude. I got you.For people who don't want to click, this is a sub about putting your dick in your own ass. They say it's the best thing ever but it looks really uncomfortable.Apparently the goal is to put your balls in there too, what a world!Also I am triggered and literally shaking because of these shitlords who have big enough dicks that they can *fuck themselves*. Mine doesn't even reach past the gentleman vegetables. 
I think you mean RIP her guy's outbox.
What're you, a frog?
Nah, just sucked the wrong dick.
Alot of straight guys like a finger in the ass as they get a BJ.
This joke was so bad you need to frieze all further efforts at humor
use Reddit Is Fun next time lol, it lets you see the link before you go on the website :)
that would be so epic
One of my favourite subs
This seems like it would be easy to play off as a joke though. I'm guessing you didn't think of that in the moment though.
I think you missed your target with that quoted word.
Sounds like we *ALL* won... ;)
My straight-guy friendships go through stages. Surface interactions around sports/jokes/events/girls, into deeper chats about politics, etc., and then into insights into their relationships, their feelings and goals and fears, etc.At each stage you lose a lot, until at the end I have just a few core friends that I'm so open with, and they're open in return. But it's worth it, and it definitely happens with men. If you want it to.
Being poly just seems so exhausting, on top of the jealousy it would surely cause in me. I only have time for one woman. I have video games to play! 
Thanks man!  I know.  But sometimes I think being torn between two genders is a damn curse when everyone around you is so sure about themselves.
Easy there friend! Gentle unto that sweet butthole, you only get issued the one.
Oh stop it you!
It's not a story a Jedi would tell you. 
I've been duped by Vargas a number of times. Never disappoints.
More like chipotle.
#STOP SAYING THAT!
Can't help you there, ask a Welshman. 
>I thought it was a guy sucking a dickYou ever take one of them Rorschach tests? Freud would like a word with you...
Woah.....   omg.....  I'm also too high for this.... but I think I just witnessed an amazing joke....a super mega dark joke
No you have reading. 
Did you see that ludicrous display last night?
I have no interest in clicking, but I'm curious about the logistics. I assuming these guy are tucking their dicks under and between their legs to insert into their butthole. Impressive lengths aside, surely this can't be done when the dick is hard? But if it's soft, how could they possibly get it in? So many questions, so little desire to be scarred for life!
Jesus dude. You start small, you don't bring out the Giant Black Horse Banger the first time you peg a guy. 
Ok I sucked a different dick. The good news is I got my job back. The bad news is now I have a reputation to uphold.
It was a bust.
not even on mobile
I'm seriously amazed at the content on that sub. The post are so believable as an episode. 
Depends on if you're normally a dick like that though. I know I am so I could easily do it, but if you never joke?
>like why he never had a girlfriend but had plenty of guy 'friends'.Is that better?
So say we all! ;)
Me too!
You're not being torn dawg. You just get to enjoy the best of both worlds 
Yeah. There are certainly some cases where it will be a shitpost that you don't realize it's a shitpost until the end, the 3.50 sea monster for example. Overall though, I find shitposts funny, so it doesn't bother me personally.
Now I'm just wondering how many times Microsoft Sam has spoken these words.
Duped? No, you have had the pleasure of basking in the wonder and glory that is a /u/_vargas_ post. Consider yourself among the lucky ones, the vast majority of humanity to this point has been in the dark, not knowing they were missing the majesty ofhis beautiful prose.
We sure solved that one. This must be what Scooby and the Gang feel like when they rip the monster mask off the villain guy. 
WHAT? I CANT HEAR YOU ABOVE THE SOUND OF ALL THIS SHOUTING.
I feel this is a rare chance to respond to a comment simply because I'm Welsh on Reddit. But in doing so would imply I'm into beastiality....Argh well, I'm replying anyway.I'm here for any questions
Yeah because even with the small sample size he's technically gay unless he plays with some more dicks. 
That'll be 3 shmeckles please. 
And don't call me Comprehension Problems.
Now, because of the logistics, I think I will have an interesting shower filled with science, self discovery, and disgust. 
Well that answers some questions I had...
That's not all you have to uphold, eh eh?(I'm talking about balls)
Its a marble you could come up with that joke.
> Depends on if you're normally a dick like that though. I know I amOh thank god you knew. I didn't wanna be the one to have to tell you!
Yes sir.
I'm in a successful straight relationship of 6 years.  She was the first person I really opened up to about it.  The bonus is, I guess you could say the relationship is "open" and I get to explore who "me" is.I think if I was expected to be either gay or straight and didn't have an understanding partner, I'd go nuts.
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know...
A surprise, to be sure. 
Because of how stoned Shaggy always was?
SHOOTING* ftfy
It's said the welsh invented the condom, thousands of years ago, from the intestines of a sheep. Later, an Englishman realized you could remove them from the sheep first!
You're doing it correctly then.
Well, he's enjoyed 72.72% (repeating oc) of the genetalia he's played with. 12.5% of those he enjoyed were dicks.
Needs to really cradle the shaft if he wants a *raise*. 
That joke broke the mold. 
I never understood why there are people who get upset if their partner is bi. It's not like they're going to cheat on you BECAUSE they're bi, and if it's before or after you, why does it matter? Love and let love. 
What do you think Scooby Snacks are?
The first I've heard of this. Blaspheme 
Like half melted marshmallow.Some of the clingy ones, but due to the Sheer numbers (don't know if sheer counts as a slight pun... I'll take it) they know what's going on. They get around just as much as we do. This is also applicable for the 3rd question.
If you're gonna twist the numbers I can do that too. 100% of the genitalia he did not enjoy were female. Also, we don't have enough information to prove your numbers are correct. You're just guessing.

That's because you didn't pair it with your finest milk steak.

Use chocolate cake.

You delightful weirdo
I could imagine sticky rice wrapped around a hot dog and lightly fried until the rice is crispy would be quite tasty
Implying that there is a right cereal to be rice-d.
You should make a site doing nothing but this.I know I'd go to it.
Bacon and rice is pretty good tho
Alright that sounds good. will try.

Fair enough, genuinely wasn't expecting that.

You could burn the rice considerably. That would make it pretty bad.

This is seriously so awesome of you. My dad has cancer and my mom has trouble taking care of him and our big yard. Our neighbors who we rarely talk to have started mowing our yard when they mow theirs. It means so much to just have someone help. Way to go! 
I would love that, but I'm just chronically depressed and anxious. Don't want you to be taken advantage of. 
My sister has this.  She's doing a lot better than when she was first diagnosed but it was rough the first couple of years.  That is very nice of you to offer your support for those struggling with similar diseases. 
Take him anyway, even if the kid is in a carrier.  Let your Dad talk to him and tell him about fishing and show him things.  Record it with your phone and save a copy to your computer and keep it for when the kid gets older. Learning those things from a Grandfather is just absolutely awesome, even if it is years after that time it actually happens.  Also, watching your Dad talk to your kid will be something special for you as well.
It's good to accept it, with some things that's all you can do. My mother also has severe cirrhosis of the liver and probably has a year or two left. 
This is a great idea! I'll look into the the 501(c)(3) requirements to create one. Anyone know what the best way to be visibility on this is?
Try and explain it to us on reddit. 
I'm a mod at /r/redsox, I'll keep you in mind as sometimes last minute tickets show up on the sub. Do you live close to Fenway for short notice games or would you require some more advanced notice? Weekday vs. weekend games?
That's why you should always dress nicely. You never know when you'll die unexpectedly and be stuck with that as your ghost outfit forever.
Tattoos are hard work, that's very generous of you.
It depends. If it's old school chemo yeah it can be ugly. But there a lot better treatments now. They can analyze the cancer mutations and find the best chemo. If your cancer has a known mutation then targeted chemo can knock it out, or at least buy you a lot more time with possibly fewer side effects. More and more cancers are being treated this way everyday.So at the very least, ask. Even get the biopsy/genetics done. Then the doc can tell you more.
Am ill. Send moni. Brother
I need something from you.I need you to continue to be a good person. I need you to be kindness in a world that drowns out all the good and hope with the thunderous sound of artillery fire. I need you to be a beacon of solidarity, and to give something back to the world. We all know the planet is fucked as it is, but I need you to make it a better place. We all need to make it a better place.I sincerely hope that you get out of this rough spot you mentioned. If there's anything I can do for you, even if it's just a quick chat, I'm only a PM away. Let me know.ITT: me getting emotional
Don't think that's needed mate, from the comments here I can safely say Reddit isn't that bad.
No, that means we're too late!
The Christmas tree is making me cry. Thank you for taking such loving care of your elder kitty.
Thanks. I've been journalling the past months for each of them and just basically rambling and telling stories. I've thought about the birthday cards idea as well, but haven't done it yet. Great thoughts about the video hike! I'll definitely add that things to do for them!
Please do! Your post today likely changed a lot of lives (from the comments I've read), so thanks!
I have been fortunate enough to know 8 of my grandparents and great grandparents. Some have passed and I know how much little things like not having the yard mowed can get to someone. Also it's one less thing that the family had to do. Hopefully they spend an extra hour with their grandma. 
Again you go unnoticed.
You're a real bro for writing that. So if he loses, he can just say he was trolling. 
and throw a coin in the fishes mouth 
Dear u/KEM10 ,I think "skip the Irish bar" is good advice, regardless of where in the world you are.Sincerely, Ireland
I'm working on getting that information together. Thank you so much!
Wow, great to see someone from Manchester reaching out considering what you guys have just been through.Props to you my friend! 
Hmm, my mother is getting toward the end of her own journey. I'll ask her if she'd like some mailbox pick-me-ups. Thanks for the idea!
Your awsome.. hope others tell you from time to time.
this a million times!  My dad passed away 2 weeks ago from pancreatic cancer and the night before he passed away I took his hand in mine and told him everything that was in my heart. That I forgive him, I apologized if I ever was too harsh on him at times and that one day we'll be riding rollercoasters together again be it in this life or the next. He was a pilot in his younger days and loved anything that had to do with adrenaline.  He passed away the next morning and as painful as it was, I was happy I talked to him.  Sending you internet hugs
We're in Twin Cities area.Thanks for responding! Maybe there's someone near us who'd be willing to share their bus for a few hours. I'm just not sure how to even look for something like that.
If you drive through Arizona, I'm in Tucson and would also be happy to host. I have one cat. 
That winky face makes me want to hit you up when I go to DC!
My mom died of cancer when I was little and I so wish she had done this. I hear stories about it a lot and it always makes me  sad that my mom didn't leave me anything to remember her by, like a letter or even just pictures. Please consider this! Best of luck to you and your family! 
> and only have had one health issue that's popped up a few times (spontaneous pneumothorax).Imma guess you're a tall thin male?
Call her, my mom passed away recently. And I would give everything and anything to see her, even hear her voice or cough again. You never really know how much you truly need that person till they are gone.
You are an awesome person. Thank you. I already bought that expansion for him as a Father's Day gift, but thank you for the suggestion!
No, please keep it! He won't be able to keep it for long, so it's better kept by you. THANK YOU for the offer, though 
I think I understand your comment and if it's what I think it is, than thank you so much. What an awesome gesture!!!
LOL thats no big deal. snacks cant tell the difference. lol
I'm glad to hear your sister is doing much better! The first years are the hardest and a series of trial and error till you find what routine works for your body. I hope she keeps kicking butt!
Totally agree...i missed an opportunity for my son to meet his great grandmother before she died. Even if he never remembers it, having a picture or video of that fishing trip would be priceless.
I was in 3d animation and design for a long time. Wanna do a video together? I'll handle the visual aspect.
Are you allowed to go on the bone marrow registry? Where I live they don't want my blood because I grew up in the UK but I have registered to donate bone marrow.
Nah, just the whole if i wanna end on my terms or not and how in the back of the head.
My mom had hep c for most of her life and was getting bad cirrhosis. She got approved after trying for a long time to get Harvoni, she went through it and is since completely clear of hep c and her liver is going back to normal. If you can get your insurance to approve it, it really does work.
I've got a chest freezer and questionable morals would be a good writing prompt 
As someone with a fatal (eventually) chronic illness, trust me, none of us think we can do it until we're in the situation. Then the options are killing yourself or living with it. What would you do? People like me often hear that we're very strong. But really, it's more like lack of options.
Depending on the country, that may or may not be true. 
My Uncle died of the same cancer as well. My mother was in denial so my wife and I pushed her hard to go out there as much as possible. He lived five months from diagnosis and she ended up being there when he passed. All things considered that was a good last five months where they focused on being together as a family.
I know where to get a 2,000 lbs crate of dry macaroni. (Seriously, they're huge) 
Thank you, I appreciate it! I'm more scared for my kids if anything, you know? I don't want them to be scared or worried. They are all under 6, so I obviously haven't told them. I left work for the pregnancy, and now this. Times are tough.If you don't mind me asking, what did you have done to get rid of it? 
That's absolutely badass and I sincerely hope he takes you up on that offer. 
Wow thanks.  With the Reddit Secret Santa always a success, im sure Redditors will be more than happy to help fellow Redditors who are down and needed a smile.
How'd you end up with the permanent pain?
Appreciate it :).I tried lyrica, along with pretty much everything else. Sadly I get the same effect: nothing. I don't know why but drugs in general don't seem to work on me, I always feel the same as before.This unfortunately extends to painkillers as well. I have oxy and stuff (prescribed) but even that doesn't really worK well enough to bother and simply increasing the dosage won't ever end well.
Thanks for the compliment, but I'm certainly no angel and have been a selfish, petty ass for the majority of my life. I hope I can provide a better direction for my nephew though, and if that's all I accomplish in this life, it's enough for me.
You would do that? That's incredible! If there are weekend tickets sometime this season, I'd never be able to thank you enough. Wow.
I'd rather die in sweat pants and an old T-shirt, and be a comfy ghost for all eternity.
I've never been so early to a sprog comment. But, fuck man, that was beautiful. You're seriously talented.
I too ask for Guac. 
I am a nigerian prince who has a sick son, but I cannot help him without $10,000 wired directly to my bank account. This will help me pay the fee to the bank to release my tens of millions of dollars. I will of course send you some for your troubles
I am actually surprised this thread turned out as well as it has so far without being labeled serious. Bravo, Reddit. 
Nooooooo!!!
And take (or have someone else take) videos of yourself *with* your kids. They will want to look back and see their relationship with you, and the love you had for them. 
Order some postcards online and get some stamps.  Write to her when you've got something to say.  It only takes a minute or two.  Send her some postcards and stamps in case she wants to write back.  Dementia grandmas don't check email, but postcards matter to them.
Not this time. We are talking about it via PM. It should happen when they come down. I'll keep you posted. 
Thanks! Sorry to hear about your father. Even though he isn't here, I still appreciate his service. In regards to scatter his ashes from a Coast Guard boat, it's totally doable. We've done at least 2 or 3 memorials and scattered ashes since I got down here in 2014. Just reach out to your local Coast Guard unit and see what they have to say. No promises though. 
I would encourage anyone new to this thread to not move forward in reading comments unless you are strapped with the tissues.  This thread appears to be cutting onions. 
I'm in, too. Also, there's a sub r/randomactsofcards (i think) they'd probably help as well if you post there.
Canada here, would love to send a card! 
 That's what I'm hoping. This is so doable, as another redditor pointed out!
My parents are both alive but this never occurred to me and has me reevaluating my relationships with them. I feel undeserving like I take them for granted when I really don't, I don't think. 
You can still have a headstone if you get cremated. Everyone on my Dads side who has died has headstones next to eachother but they all got cremated. Saves on space too!
"I would offer you two but I only have one"
Interested as well. Japan is a great place.
That's very sweet, but don't shed a tear on my behalf. Ive spent a lot of time and money on vapid, selfish arrogance and complete disregard for the feelings of others.Im just trying to put a dent in my innumerable sins.
Not OP, but also had a spontaneous pneumothorax and yep! Tall thin male.
I'm an FFXIV player too. I'd be willing to get him a little something for in-game. Do you know his character's name and server?
Not too be morbid...but maybe your dad could just look after it for a while and you could mail it back to u/tsukihi3 once your dad doesn't need it anymore?
Yup! I have some hope that CRISPR may eventually help cure genetic diseases like this, but I rather doubt we'll see it in her lifetime, or mine for that matter. At the very least, even if it does come out and becomes widespread, I think there will already be too much permanent damage, but at least we could seriously help future generations.
My paternal grandfather was dying in the same hospital I was born in, and my mom told me when I was younger, that my dad grabbed teeny-brand-new me, ignored all the nurses, and brought me to see his father for one visit before he passed on. My dad's a whacko, but I'm glad he did that.
We definitely could
Wouldn't having hep make you nonviable as a donor?
Liver, I believe.
I have had hep c and b since I was 18. I'm over 60 now.  Main thing is avoid alcohol.  Also avoid rough sports where you could get struck where your liver is.  Don't dwell on it and try to lead a normal life. The doctors told me I would die of cirhossis or liver cancer. Jokes on them,  I'm dying from lung cancer. Just take it one day at a time and remember,  everybody dies,  and doctors are not always right.  Good luck. .
>If you can get your insurance to approve it, it really does workUgh, the real death panels.
I finished a 3 month course of Harvoni recently, my stepfather is Egyptian and managed to source it for me from Egypt. It was $600 total. It breaks my heart and saddens me that such an amazing cure is so inaccessible here when it's so cheap everywhere else. 
In Canada and the US it is. Unless the person co signed, the debt dies with the debtor. The only chance for collection is from the estate of the deceased, but unlikely there would be any assets to distribute to debtors in any case. 
This is what I am terrified of.  There is no happily ever after with this tumor.  The outcome scares me to death and I don't want to think of a life without him, but know that is reality.  I am so sorry for everyone's losses.  Cancer sucks, but Glioblastoma is a horrific asshole that never goes away (sort of like my ex-husband).
My wife and I work in a hospital, I wish more people understood this simple logic. Don't prolong someone's life for your own selfish desires. 
Has this treatment made the front page? I don't know. I don't know if they have even released any of the data. But all large clinical trials like this should have a data and safety monitoring program. At some point it became unethical to continue with a placebo group when the preliminary data showed it to be effective to a certain degree.  This does not mean the great majority of people are cured though.  But her dad is still going strong with no growth of his tumor!
...Where is this pasta heaven and do they have take out
I have no cervix now.  They cut it all out because it didn't spread, and then I took some pill form of chemo just to make sure.  It was super easy, but like I said, the waiting for the results was the WORST.  :(  Also, I don't have kids, so between that and my missing ovary due to another medical issue, I'll probably never have them, so that sucks too.And yes - telling the kids definitely requires something more definitive. :)  
> Fucking Reddit. I ~~like~~ *love* this place.FTFY
Are you near a library? I found the first one available for borrowing at my local library website!
Took a bad fall while snowboarding. Apparently my joints in my back are permanently inflamed.
I'm basing this solely off the resistance to painkillers and other medicines, but do you have any of the markers for Ehlers Danlos Syndrome? I know it can cause resistance to anesthesia and other drugs, so it might be worth at least a quick Google search if you've never been tested for it. 
I'm pretty sure he's never written a comment in non-poem form. Hold on I'll ask him. OH great almighty Mr. /u/Poem_for_your_sprogHave you ever written a comment in non poem form all along?
"I meant," said Ipslore bitterly, "what is there in this  world that truly makes living worth while?" Death thought about it, "cats" he said eventually, "cats are nice." 
Take your upvote!
I'd like to send one too please. Also, you're a good friend.
Now I'm just imagining like, the IRS of cat pictures, stalking Redditors for what they owe ;D
You guys are awesome. This is why i love reddit so much, hope he gets in contact with you guys. keep being selfless people
A man can build a thousand bridges in his lifetime, but if he fucks just one goat he is known as a goat-fucker rather than a bridge-builder. 
Same checking in here. Well I was thin at the time. After it happened I put on 25 pounds of muscle to try and prevent it happening again. One can hope
"Myself and the rest of the shareholders will be eternally grateful for his tireless efforts to increase our quarterly dividends, and he will be sadly missed.  He worked his fingers to the bone and my accountant says it was entirely worth it."
I'll ask him. It's SouthernRogue, I'm pretty sure, but I will double check!
My mom went into labor with me and a couple of hours in my grandfather died. Labor stopped. Mom says I stayed a while to meet him and get to know him a bit.I am an atheist, but I still like that story.
Very good. PM me, we'll trade details. Let's talk to him and see what he has in mind. Shouldn't be too hard.
Oh yeah? If you think THAT'S impressive, next time I go, I'm going to give them 16 gallons! 
Some parts are still useable for others. Additionally being a donor also gives permission to use your organs for research, so their organs could help others who have the desease in the future.
Huh. I've never been tested for a match to anything before. Where can I go to get put on a donor list for my spare organs/bone marrow?
You too friend, how bad are the lungs?
My brother-in-law was able to buy it for $1000 from somewhere overseas. Maybe India? He's working on getting another course for my sister. If anyone wants any more info PM me and I'll ask him for specifics. 
I'm very sorry for what you're going through. Regardless if you have three months or 30 years left with him you both can still have many positive memories. Focus on each other and fuck cancer.
I work in a hospital. One thing I often want to say to family members is, please don't let your loved one die here. Take them home. As long as they're here, we'll poke and prod them until they or you say "stop."Most people don't realize that being in a hospital is the least comfortable you can be if you're dying or ready to stop treatment. It breaks my heart to have to stick a needle into a 95 year old for a blood test that is irrelevant at this point, but he's here and we have to show that we're doing something. It also really makes me angry at the system.
It depends, can you carry a ton of macaroni?  
I'm sorry about that :( there is always adoption, or other options, if you decide having a child is right for you and your future :)How was the process and recovery of them cutting it out?
I read it as love the first time. 
Yup - I have tons of knowledge in this area. :)  If you want you can PM me and we can talk about it.  I probably don't have time to handle the day to day but I can definitely help with paperwork, process, and technology side :)  Almost like a board member :-P
dela where?
I'm so sorry to hear this.I'm 26 and dealing with a shoulder injury which might have ended my ability to rock climb.  I already have shin and knee issues that prevent me from doing any sports involving running.  Without my constant climbing (2 to 3x a week) I've already begun to gain weight and I've been really upset about it.That being said - the injury doesn't prevent me from doing day-to-day things or interfere with my work.Really puts things in perspective.I wish you the best, and congrats on the marriage!
I think it's crazy that opiates/oxy has no effect, on him. Like, if you upped the dosage enough, it'll numb it all but possibly get you so high you wouldn't like it. If those don't work, would weed really be strong enough?
he has on his ama
The one time upboat makes sense and we blew it.
I'm in Santa Clara and a neighbor has 4 VW buses in his driveway, should I go show him this thread? Not too sure what that'll accomplish but ya never know, people know people and it really is a small world sometimes..

You guys are amazing, this should be higher up. And as for you, someeyes, stay blessed fam!
Not as bad as some others I know.  Have to be careful is the main thing.  I cough up blood sometimes,  and sometimes I just have to rest no matter how much I want to keep up.  Short of breath from doing just about anything.  Tired a lot but still have to take care of myself,  do my chores, stuff everybody has to do.  Not getting any younger. 
Developing countries are exempt from pharmaceutical patents, so Egyptian companies can sell it for much cheaper. 
And also it's sometimes hard to even see it like that. People say, "How am I being selfish, I'm helping you live longer," without taking the time to really talk about it. Euthanasia is an extremely difficult subject for us to talk about without seeing it as giving up but after 70, 80, 90 years of life and only seeing pain and suffering at the end of the tunnel, it's a conversation we must have and actually WITH the person in question, and not FOR them.
I'll bring the truck around
SUPER easy.  I mean, it's not the most pleasant when it's occurring, but I was walking the next day like nothing had happened.  You have to wear pads though, and no tampons or anything for a while.   :)  Overall I'd say it's one of the easiest (but grossest because of the whole pad thing) medical procedures available.  
Count me in as well. I don't know how I can help, but I have a lot of spare time that I can donate to this if it can take off. PM me or whatever if you need help with logistics or visibility I guess. I can also help with funding a little. 
Dela there
Opiates don't affect my mom, but weed does. It doesn't fully get rid of the pain, but it takes it from 'it hurts so much it's hard to move' to 'there's a bit of an annoyance but it can be overlooked'.It's different for every person, but there's enough varieties of weed that there might be a strain out there that can help.
Goddamn it. 
Someone post this to /r/FFXIV. Let's do something nice. 
That makes me feel a lot better. So they kept you awake through it? I'm a wuss when it comes to pain and procedures. 
again, it went unnoticed.
Lol, another XIV player here, willing to help in anyway I can
Oh you can't miss it lol, I got multiple emails, texts, letters, and phone calls, even other members of my family got phone calls asking to get in touch with me. If they manage to match you they'll make sure they find you one way or another.  
Yeah - I stayed awake, but honestly, I would recommend going under.  I did it because I just wanted it over with, but if I had it to do over again I would definitely do twilight anesthesia or something if your insurance covers it. :) 
Not this time.
That's terrifying, but reassuring. *If they want your marrow, they'll find you. Don't worry.*
Take your upboat! :D 
There are already a bunch of articles about this exact topic. From what I gather from a few of them, pollsters were thrown off by the voters who didn't want to admit they supported Trump (being called "Shy Trump" voters), and by the rural white folks who tend not to respond to pollsters' calls but turned out in huge numbers in this election. I'm sure that this election will bring about a change in the pollster profession. Most of them got schooled yesterday. 
'Well there was this cartoon frog on the Internet...'
I don't see anything changing after the GOP was rewarded for 6~ years of obstructionism... :/Even if the Dems swing back into power in 2018 (highly unlikely), gridlock will be the new norm now that it's been proven to work. Politics above country.
I'm surprised no one else really commented on this. He was really struggling at the end. I got the impression he really needed to go to the toilet too. 
The next episode is going to be legendary

I know right? I can't fucking believe it.Trump actually won. Trump will be our president. President Trump.This is the most... interesting? News I've ever read while taking a dump.The next few South Park episodes should be pretty interesting.
Given he's flipped flopped on TONS of social and political topics in the last few years, it's entirely possible. 
"I'm sorry, but you need ten years experience for this job starting out at minimum pay."Fuck you, Trump is president despite never holding office in any other sense of the word. I can sit at this computer for eight hours just fine.
I've never seen a more resounding "We don't like you". 
The Simpsons are always right
I hate that I have to upvote this.
It's not shocking at all to me.  As a bartender, there have been many a group discussion on politics while CNN played on the TVs.  Everyone would murmur how "both candidates suck" and how we're screwed.However, once the crowds cleared and there was nothing left but one-on-one conversation with the guests and I, their pro-Trump colors would show.
And then >= 2 of his choices on the Supreme Court. :(
May you live in interesting times. 
No supreme court as well.

"The Berenstain Bears universe."
Is this true? Source? 
And both will be covered by Huffington Post in their entertainment section.  They said it themselves last year.
i feel like a lot of trump support wasn't vocal about it because of being taboo in a lot of sense. but when it came to the poll they were free to vote how they really wanted
I would like to reset the time line please....
That's the scary part to me too. Even if something were to happen and Trump were to step down, we would have *Pence,* who supports gay conversion therapy, very not pro choice, pro religion in government, etc. Trump is dangerous, but he seems to mostly want the title and the power to me, while Pence knows what he wants to do.
What I could only ever see as a joke has now become a reality. I feel like I'm being trolled by the entire American population. 
I keep thinking Trump was selected as an easy candidate to be beaten by Clinton. Some people's plan got fucked hard.
Clinton campaign made the party stonewall him out of the nomination
Trump vs Kanye in 2020Like seriously what the actual fuck
Plus the Cubs won the world series... Back to the Future II is literally our reality.

It's only rigged when it might go against your choice. When it comes out in your favor, then it's only because the conspiracy failed to take hold. 
Oh crap!  Trump won!  Oh we never thought it would happen so we voted for him.
Rip EPA funding. Sorry for disappointing you Leo looks like we'll probably end up behind China in terms of renewable energy with the way trump has campaigned. 
And the best part is that it's 9/11 for most of the world.
Dude, the post is set to new.
Honestly, he alone does not scare me. I don't think he even knows what he believes, he is incredibly wishy washy and rolls around in simplified rhetoric. However, the SCOTUS, the house and the senate are all aligned with a party I do not agree with on to many matters; And they may have more sway of the new president in matters than you would want in a leader.

David Bowie's death unraveled the logic of the universe.
Then you would have enough money to build mars colony.
Most of them have got schooled this entire year. They have routinely failed to predict anything, confirmation bias is a bitch. To be fair though the prevalence of cell phones makes polling difficult and the closet trump supporter  is impossible to quantify. They had the same problems with Nixon.
We joke, but the Internet had a huge impact on this campaign. It gave Trump a platform by which he turned from a laughing stock to a legitimate contender. "Discuss the influence of Internet memes in the politics of 2016" could definitely be a history question in a few decades. 
100% national healthcare is repealed.

I don't think I heard anything Trump said. It was just hilarious watching his head bob up and down and him snap back awake lol
Yeah I realized that as well but it was still funny to see lol. He did well because we all know at his age he was also bored to death.
BUCKLE UP BUCKAROO
Has he done it for the primary bet?
Don't forget literally the whole entertainment industry
It should be 20 minutes of him shouting no at a camera. It would be art. 
They got Bernie.
I think people want to think of it as Berenstain because us little fucks couldn't spell for shit.
We have to keep them around as an early warning system

Pence is insurance against assassination.
Well shit you're right. You're MY boss now.
Thats what should be taken away from this. This was the democrats election to lose, all they had to do was put up fucking anyone else. Just some bland everyman or woman. But nope. They wanted a Clinton.

Mutually Assured Destruction. Trump is a genius because if someone gets rid of him, the country gets destroyed by Pence. Always gotta have a Nuclear (Pence) deterrent.
This episode of Black Mirror is a little too weird for me. 
Exactly, I didn't vote for him either, but his tone and the content of his message make me hopeful. He mentioned he wanted to bring all Americans together and hopefully he will actually work toward that and not disappoint us. 
Stage 3: Bargaining
sad tbh, Im pretty sure bernie would have won if he got the chance
Don't let your memes be dreams. If you think this election inspired a lot of memes, I can't wait for 2020

Man I am so depressed right now and this has me cracking up. Thank you for this comment.
Please analyze the rise of populism within american and British societies, be sure to include the rise of the internet as an alternative to the 20th century vision-tubes and the impact the transition had. 
The Dems can filibuster everything for four years. That's really their only gambit.The alternative is to let them run the country undivided and see what happens. The downside for them is that 2018, which would ordinarily be a great year for them, does not have a favorable electoral map since they have to defend a lot of purple seats Obama won in 2012.
Have you tried not being born in America, but in a real humane country?For real though, I have no idea and I feel for you.
Hahaha, I was looking at this the whole time too! Feel really bad for Baron and Melania, being a political family took them by surprise.There was one point where he scrunched his whole face up because he was holding in a yawn!
It won't dawn on him for many years, probably, how insane that moment actually was for him.
Also got self-assisted suicide in CO, don't forget about that. 
No, no, not as part of that bet. Just as a general penance.
Except for Alec Baldwin, who's probably got the best job security in the world right now, probably better than Trump's
He is probably blazing it up right now
We call it the Berniestein universe and from what I hear you can get the full 5-season DVD box set of *Firefly* on Amazon.

Bowie dead, Cubs win World Series, Donald Trump is honest to god president. This is a satire's idea of the future.
Poe's law is an Internet adage which states that, without a clear indicator of the author's intent, parodies of extreme views will, to some readers, be indistinguishable from sincere expressions of the parodied views.
Holy shit, that's brilliant
I don't think anyone *Wanted* her, she just refused to let anyone else take her potential presidency.

Hillary and snowden sharing an apartment in a repurposed office in the Kremlin. A sitcom I'd watch 
Florida, Arkansas, and North Dakota are all red states that voted for marijuana decriminaliztion but only for medical reasons. Only blue states voted for recreational marijuana. 
I can understand this in other countries where voting is mandatory, and people who don't want to vote are forced to. But actually going out of your way to go out, line up on a Tuesday evening and vote for a dead gorilla is some next level shitposting. 
Yeah it's lost it's believability to be honest. 
When he brought up Hillary, I was expecting bashing. Was pleasantly surprised and I sincerely hope he keeps that kind of tone in his presidency..
Dormammu! I've come to bargain. 
Rotate 180 degrees and its the same, minus the slashes of course. :D
I'm pretty sure 19+1+1+1+1 is less than 25852016738884976640000.
Except the Senate can change their rules and end the filibuster.
To be honest I think it took most of america by surprise. I'm really curious how the rest of the world that is on reddit will react to this.
> self-assisted suicideSo... suicide?
On the other side, House of Cards and South Park are fucked.
Dormammu I've come to bargain
I still fucking cant
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away.
Florida got medical! First in the south, it's a step in the right direction. 
Just end me then.
Damn, no thread is safe for Golden State.
Sometime last year we seem to have switched into a parallel universe
Uhh the DNC sure as shit wanted her
If Hillary had refused the job and stayed in the Senate, she would probably be president right now.
Hell six months ago some were saying the party was finished or would need to redefine itself. 
Ah, young love <3
Medical reasons to include: "Oh my God the President is such a dick, I need some weed."
Eh it's a vote of no confidence. I feel like it's saying I don't like anybody or I am not informed enough to vote so here's my vote anyway that I support the process but I don't believe I'm  being represented here.
I need a source on this please! My buddy was a huge Matt Hardy fan but doesn't watch anymore. He would love to see this.
Agreed, by all measures, that was a decent speech and a good starting tone hoping he can drop the 'crazy' act and act like a business mogul that is now fucking president of the U.S
Shit...
/r/unexpectedfactorial 
I work at a liquor store in Australia. Sales were up.
Suicide where cops and doctors aren't bound to prevent it. 
Are you kidding ? South Park will have a great time criticising his every move. The only good part of it. House of Cards, I reckon they predicted Trump's last resort after 6 months of falling popularity and getting nothing done....start a war.
Dormammu I've come to bargain
I won't get it for at least a week. 
Assisted suicide is illegal again.
*we are the parallel universe*
Right? Sanders was cheated out of the damn primary because the DNC definitely wanted Clinton.
I live in Wisconsin and I know multiple people that flipped from Hillary to Bernie because her lack of campaigning. Bernie had 3 rallies at my campus and Hillary had one private speech. They also did not end up voting for her today either
They likely voted for real on all the other choices. This wasn't the only thing to vote for. That's why it's common. Folk who don't agree at all with the options on that one but still care about the other votes speak out this way. 
He's actually having a bit of a career resurgence at the minute, too.
It's up to Americans to hold him to his good promises (term limits, dropping TPP, finance regulation etc) and make him drop his bad ones (wall, Muslim ban, immigrant roundup, global warming denial etc).
RemindMe! 4 Years
Dormammu I've come to bargain 
I can't help but feel like if Sanders had actually been given a fair shake he would be the president elect right now. The DNC really fucked up. 
Maybe that's why Trump won. He connected with the American people a lot. He went on talk shows like every morning, he had a rally like every night.I don't like him, but I hope a higher level of communication between the President and the people would be great.
Global warming denial is probably his worst 'promise', especially as he considers it a Chinese Hoax.
OP better deliver
Dormammu I've come to bargain. 
RIP global warming 1896 - 2016

Yeah! Those are my favorite. I've always been a storyteller at heart, and I love jokes where you can memorize the set up and punchline and get from point a to point b in whatever  way you want. Shaggy dog stories are the best, and if you do it right people aren't pissed off that you just took 5 minutes to tell a joke that didn't have a real punchline.Are you from the southeastern US by chance? We also call them "shaggy dog stories" when folks in our family tell stories that have far too many details that aren't relevant. You know, "starts every story with Genesis."
Only except they don't remember, so you have to remind them, then you just end up dissecting and killing the joke in the end. At least, thats my experience.
This is why i hate telling jokes too, i'm socially retarded and even if they go along with it i'm very likely to punch up the fuck line.

It's the fluidic version of the lever.

Though wetness may be even (same amount of fluid per volume, as most liquids are incompressible), going deeper into this thread and I can feel the potential (for puns) dropping, and the pressure (to perform) increasing. 
Of course that's your contention. You're a first-year grad student; you just got finished reading some Marxian historian, Pete Garrison probably. You're gonna be convinced of that 'till next month when you get to James Lemon. Then you're going to be talking about how the economies of Virginia and Pennsylvania were entrepreneurial and capitalist way back in 1740. That's gonna last until next year; you're gonna be in here regurgitating Gordon Wood, talkin' about, you know, the pre-revolutionary utopia and the capital-forming effects of military mobilization.

Not proud of this but O chem was the only class I've "cheated" in.  Like an hour into the test it was a "draw the mechanism" question and I could not remember it.

I mean I guess she figured it out right?
Reminds me of my group projects in college.
This exact thing happened to our group in an escape room a few months ago.  I guess some of the people weren't listening in the beginning and missed that the box by the door was for our coats, purses, etc...So about 5 minutes into the escape room, someone in our group drags out a purse, dumps it on the floor, and proceeds to go though the wallet.  At one point, he says loudly "hey, this wallet has a lot of money in it" and we all turned and saw what he was doing, including the owner of the purse.  She was horrified.
York uni? 
> fire extinguisher on the wall that she was CERTAIN had to be for something. For an hour she wandered around aimlessly carrying a fire extinguisher. Mom sounds like she played a lot of early 1990s computer adventure games: USE FIRE EXTINGUISHER ON DOOR"That doesn't work that way."USE FIRE EXTINGUISHER ON STAIRS"Nothing happens."
Take off clothes, get kicked out, room escaped. Winner!
"Sorry brenda, we can't all escape."
Nobody had ever tried which option? Because I probably wouldn't think to look across the street.Also wow, that's early for a bible study, but I guess there's a lot of material to go over.
Oh man. Imagine breaking up in a room you can't get out of, then having to work together to solve puzzles to get away from each other. Was it fun to watch? This will be the plot of a rom-com in 6 months
>oh that wasn't us we thought you put that in there.Nothing adds to the ambience of an escape room like actual human feces.
When I played, our train of logic  pointed to taking apart a hanging light. The people knocked on the door loudly and told us not to dismantle live electronics. 
"And next time, it won't just be the furniture we rearrange." (Cannot find the relevant Far Side comic - but that is what this reminded me of)
More of these places should have people fixing their own destructiveness afterwards (when they're breaking rules given to them prior) 
Wow and I thought the world was running out of heroes. 
And then you kept checking on them.
Not really for free if the company's selection process sucks that way.
Can't even tell those guys to get a room, they're already in one.
The only thing I've ever heard measured in racks are ribs but somehow I imagine you mean beer?
Wtf
What the fuck. Did the actor lose his eye? 
"I shot the escape room operators and kicked the door open, i'm so cool"
I always imagine that the people observing are continuously make bets on what the people do.
Yeah that's always a bummer - It'll be two people, just the couple. Only the guy is completely freaking out the whole time about having to pop the question at the end, so, the girl ends up dragging the guy through the whole thing, doing all the work - Or, worse, we give them all the answers after an hour of standing around - All to reveal this ring at the perfect moment, only, that moment is completely ruined by this newfound perspective you have on your fiance, as this completely bumbling idiot who didn't solve one fucking puzzle the whole time 
And if you stick metal in electric sockets, you win on escaping life!
If it's a stupid idea and it works then it's not a stupid idea. 
there is money between the space of the door and the wood, they're supposed to combine it with other props in the room for the code to get out.

What was the obstacle? If it isn't supposed to be climbed over, it should be designed in a way where people don't think to climb over it. 
Not really. They were kinda dicks to begin with. They just tried to explain why they did nothing wrong, which sucks because there are plenty of awesome cops in my area, and we got the shitty ones 
Yeah I don't understand either, maybe I'm just missing something, but how do you plant a spy in the group like this?
now i'm imagining an episode of the office where michael brings everyone to an escape room

I see this a lot too. One of our rooms has a jacket in it, and some people just assume its one of theirs.

I find that watching people attempt to escape the room is an excellent way to assess their teamwork, problem solving skills, demeanor under pressure, and general character in multiple ways. Your friend's boyfriend sounds like a jerk. I brought someone I had just started dating to room escape and watching them was a huge indicator of lots of aspects of their personality early on. 
Astonishing!
Imagine the mind place scene flashing.
It's a small pipe for smoking, usually weed, but traditionally tobacco. 
I was shocked at that point, the torture thing wasn't as bad because he said something dumb like: "Torture you from inside of the room while you're outside". But the "rotten child" part really got to me, haha.
Yeah it's super frustrating but also understandable, you've been working towards this point and when it's finally there it can feel as if it's not really "THE END".But there have been moments where I got into discussion about their logic behind not leaving.
Now that's thinking outside the box!

"It's for the greater good."
They told us later they didn't know what the hell we were doing, but didn't want to intervene. We eventually had to ask them if she was supposed to still be cuffed. I feel like they probably should've asked us about it, but eh, it made a good story! 
You can get out at anytime. There's usually a door that's not part of the puzzle. 
That would be IKEA, actually.
April:  This is my home now.
I think the idea is that the teammate on the phone sacrificed himself (turned into a chicken and couldn't talk) in order to deliver the hint involving acting like a chicken.
They're too weird for me.  It's even weirder since duck penises are corkscrew-shaped, so this is just a human penis pasted on a duck.  I imagine they float upright well with a rudder like that, though.
I work today I'll try to snag one
At an escape room we went to we started taking apart a photo frame with a "do not disassemble" sticker on it. They seemed quite annoyed but in fairness they also had "do not open" writing on a lot of things you had to open to solve the puzzle.
We only have minutes to harvest!
Oh shit and then each time you repair it, it probably looks more like it's a clue, so people rip it up again! 
I'm not sure. The escape room employee said that he was scared to enter the room to tell the guy to stop. If I'm remembering correctly, he was asked to leave
Yea that actually sounds like a legit step to solve the puzzle
Why was this knife here if I wasn't supposed to murder the rest of the group with it? 
Fallout Logic
So you're gonna try to tell the guy in the $4,000 dollar space suit how to solve an escape room? C'mon! 
Maybe he tells everyone they were the first...
Anyone who ever apologizes for the mess they made, made a tiny mess in comparison to the person who leaves without saying anything.
Why didn't you listen to them the first time?
they automatically refill if you try to do that without drinking them, DUH
From that one conversation I had with him, he seemed to lack a fair bit of common sense (who asks for the answers without playing?? Goodness...). I saw the guy again with his company some time later and he looked like he wasn't part of the crowd; everyone else seemed pretty chummy. Funny enough, he was pretty into the escape once he went in... My staff and I fondly shake our heads whenever we think back to him lol
Yes
Yup :/ that they in all fairness paid for.
I mean I wouldn't expect the type of people who fuck in an Escape Room to be courteous.
Yeah beer, must be a regional thing. Though a 30 rack of ribs would have also been a sight to behold.
She escaped with 7 seconds left, unmodified and with minimal help. 
One time I had a group of kind of redneck people come in and they all smelled funny. We assumed it was some weird pot and just got them in the room. One of the weirder gentlemen went outside in the middle of the game and came back in and released a large cloud of smoke into the room. After they failed to escape, we took their picture and the same guy screams "All right guys, let's go smoke some more meth!" We still don't have rules against this. 
If you played point and click games in the 90s you know those might actually be things you'd have to do in some of them!
It's pretty difficult to electrocute yourself with modern sockets. Not impossible but you have to try.
Her way was faster
The solution here is barbed wire.
I would guess it's the spy giving the mission to solve the puzzles in the room, (basically the game host) but it ends up being the spy all along.
That would have made a great episode
"Stanley, you escaped from life in 'da hood', we could really use you here"
That actually fucked a group I went with once, nobody checked the damn coat rack

One chick rode naked through the streets on a horse

yeah I haven't gotten to them yet neither. onwards we go
When we finished I thought we were only 2 or so minutes off the top 5 board and I remember giving her a bit of a death stare. I was being a bit thick though and we were just under 9 minutes off so it wasn't that bad.
I bet that was annoying. We did another room with a group of friends and started off with the room really dark and only one flashlight. We are probably 85% of the way through and my friend made the comments about some lights in a box. Went to look and there was 4 torches in the first box that was opened she just didn't think to mention it.
Ha! I can only imagine this is the reason she is your ex mother in law.
I gotta flush my shirt. 
But now he's added legitimacy to the prop.
Found a clue!
"Honey, I rented a boat for our honeymoon."
Definitely smart to look at the books! But they are REAL published books, they have page numbers and words. If you need to use them you will probably have a clue/colormarker/hints.  No escape room should make you look through 10+ books blindly.
Reality has never stood in the way of a rom-com plot before.
IKEA is the ultimate escape room. 
We've had around 3 proposals in the escape rooms so far. The first one was really nice. The guy met us weeks beforehand and asked us to personalize our prettiest escape room. All the clues were about their relationship like where they first met, first kiss, etc and at the end of it all, was the ring.The second was shitty. We were not informed at all. The girl was chained and blindfolded in a small, black box room. No idea why he thought that would be a good place to propose.The third was hello kitty- themed. I just heard about it from my coworkers but w h y
See I would have assumed I was supposed to decapitate the chicken
So you'll fuck a rubber duck, but only if it's a female rubber duck? 
Well that's their fault really. 
Thank you Mister Snute, we'll be in touch 
Yes! After a group ripped up floorboards in one room the next couple groups saw the misalignment from our repairs and assumed it was a trap door. We had to add 'don't remove the flooring' to our briefing.
So you're saying that cutting up the carpet with a pocket knife *was* the key to escaping the room?!
He's the only one who survives when they complete the puzzle and the whole station rapidly depressurizes.
The key is inside them!

It's part of a larger company wide competition between branches. Near the beginning of the episode, Dwight openly suggests tying up the escape room attendant and torturing him for the information. The camera would then pan quickly over to a slightly nervous looking teenage boy and then back to Michael who briefly ponders it before telling Dwight to get serious.
wasn't she also made of chocolate?
Can confirm, I was the radiator.
I keep forgetting I chose that name...

It's a control thing! 
The next guy will have an excuse. "Well it *smelled* like a real toilet."
How did you end up in the utility room twice?
I made an escape room based on Viking history set in a college, and I put in some books about the vikings for decoration. Someone used them as a shortcut on a combination lock (which a clue hinted to be the year the vikings invaded England). I didn't mind them doing that because they showed ingenuity and didn't just look it up on their phone.
There needs to be a movie where people go to an escape room then an actual disaster happens and shit gets really real. Could be a romcom or a thriller or both.
The first one is actually genius
Friday's would be perfect. If she says yes you can celebrate with endless cheese sticks and potato skins. If she rejects you then you can wallow in self pity with endless cheese sticks and potato skins. It's a classic win/win scenario 
Ya when op brought up sacrifice I was thinking 'no way is she about to do decapitate her friend
It was a male duck.  Why *wouldn't* it have a dick?
I don't fuck my duckies, it destroys them after a couple years and I don't want to ruin all the good ones I have left.
Haha yeah I can completely see that. I think out of all of them, Phyllis would actually be the only one to sit down and solve the puzzle first, even though Stanley could have solved it faster if he wasn't doing his damn crossword!
What a genius
'But *could* I?' he wondered,  'and *should* I?' he thought -  'It's present,' he pondered,  'and *surely* I ought?  It's *clearly* included,  and *why* would it be -  If not with a purpose intended for me?'Perhaps it's a pointer?  Perhaps it's a clue?  I'll *never* be sure,  But I'll know when I do!  I'll do it!' he whispered,  'I'll do it!' he cried.  He sat in his suit and he watched as they died.&nbsp;^^^:)

I was running a room with a secret room inside of it and the group had to get a key off the wall inside the secret room. We have something inside another box for you to get to it, but this older dude, may have been 60, pulls off his belt, holding up his pants with his hands and whips that key off the wall like Indiana Jones. Like I mean he whacked it off the wall and into his had. It was amazing to watch, but he still didn't get out. 
Monkey Island! :) Thanks! Good old days. is it available on pc anymore? my original cds wont run :(
She just clipped through the wall to skip the 'escape room' sidequest.
Can't get blood from a stone.  Sometimes these groups are awesome.  The kids have an epiphany.  Not that it changes lives but it gives them a clue.  Most of the time it's just what you would expect.  I get crap for it.  "Condemn them to failure!"  I say bullshit why is it fair to enabling their leeching behaviors?  
/r/RedditWritesTheOffice 
In some way or another for a reason I don't know why, this reminds me of the "game/competition" where you go door-to-door starting with a dollar store item, and get people to trade you for equal or more value if they want it. You see who ends up with the best item at the end of the day.Some people start with a toothbrush and end up with a piano or TV.
You certainly wouldn't be in any danger. 
Going out on a limb here. But I'll guess alcohol played a part. 
The second one might be making the best of a bad situation.
Yeah, OP that sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen. You sure that's a public attraction you're working at and not a BDSM meetup?
We went to one based on the saw movies where we were all chained to the walls/ chairs and blindfolded. Some of us had a little play in our chains.  So there would be a clue near one person, who would call it out and it would allow someone else to open a padlock or locked combination box to get keys. It was exciting.

At some point we get a camera pan to Creed standing in the corner of the room visibly sweating. He points to the camera above him.  "I did something like this in Kyoto for a lot of money a few years ago. Let me know if anybody brings in chili peppers."
It's like when Dwight traded for the magic beans. 
The third one sounds like something my fiance would like. For some reason she absolutely loves hello kitty. I dont get it, but if I get her something hello kitty themed, it makes her smile, so thats more than enough incentive for me.
Are you going to hurt women?
I've been to one called the kidnapping. They go over everything with you quite extensively. The blindfolds are sleep masks that you can opt out of wearing. The chains connect with those easy open lobster claw clap things, and you can unclip yourself if you need to. 
Also the same place also has a game where you start all locked in a prison cell. You have to pass a cup of water between 3 cells to get the keys to float up to the top of a nearby bucket and use a broom handle to hook them into your cell to escape. You're then loose in an even bigger cell which you also need to escape to get into the main room.

Yeah people are clever and think these rooms are built for geniuses so they need to Sherlock the hell out of it. Whatever rule you come up with someone *will* find a way to interpret it to mean there's a clue involved. Which is part of why a lot of them have monitors and speakers, so the employees can tell you to knock it off if you've decided you need to dismantle the heating pipe to get a key out of it

Alternatively...A horse walks into a bar. The bartender says, "Would you like a drink?" The horse responds, "I think not," and vanishes.Those who are familiar with philosophy should get that this joke is poking fun at Descartes, who famously said, "I think, therefore I am." However, I didn't tell you the explanation before, because that would've been putting Descartes before the horse.

Alternate version:A priest, a rabbi, and a minister walk into a bar. The barman says "is this some kind of joke?"Though I'd actually use "Englishman, Irishman and Scotsman" as that's more common in the UK.

If you get the main gist of it down, you can ad lib everything else on the spot, which is mostly quotes of whatever they are doing when they meet, followed by the boss being skeptical.

A woman walks into a bar. She says to the bartender 'I'd like a double entendre please'. So he gives it to her. 
First 2 guys make typical and useful wishes while the last guy makes uncommon and bizarre wishes.  We as the audience expect the 3rd guy to have some clever plan on how to do something even better than the wishes of either of the other men.  But then we just get the imagery of a guy with spinning arms and a nodding head walking into the bar.
Should have linked it to /u/me for extra confusion.
Why do birds fly south for the winter?Cause it's too far to walk
This is the first time I've ever seen anyone besides my husband tell this joke. He saves it for when ducks or geese are actually flying overhead. On at least one occasion, he started laughing too hard to finish the joke because he knew how poorly the guy he was telling it to was going to react. That was awesome!

Squirrel is hanging out in a pine tree, chewing on a pinecone. Suddenly the tree starts shaking like crazy, so he looks to see what the commotion is all about. Lo and behold, elephant is clumsily climbing his way up."What are you doing up here?" asks squirrel."Oh, I just felt like climbing up here to eat some pears," replies elephant."Stupid elephant... this is a pine tree, there are no pears here.""It's ok, I brought my own pears."

Dude..
It's funnier if you think that the dog doesn't need a tree to pee because he's a dog, he can go where ever. The joke is he's holding his pee for no reason, or that his dog logic thinks he can't pee unless there's a tree.Or if you refer to a couple getting lost driving somewhere and one says they'll pee their pants if they don't find a bathroom soon. It's funny to think dogs share that experience.

I wasn't implying that it would be difficult to remember the specific sequence of events, just that I'm going to want to recall that this joke exists when the time comes that I want to tell a joke.
You know the ping pong ball one?...Last summer I was on vacation visiting New Hampshire. I went to a concert with a group of friends and on the way back the guy driving starts with the ping pong ball story. He lines it up so it fills up the entire 25 minutes to get back to where we were staying. 25 minutes.
Or the second one, since he has first crack at the second pint.
I have been laughing at this for over an hour now 
I even laughed at the explanation.
 I know nothing of Australia.  But I know Karl.

In college a prof told a story of giving a speech to korean dignitaries, and he told a joke that had them dying from laughter. After his talk he asked the interpreter why they found it so amusing and he said that it wouldn't have translated well so he just told them the speaker has made a very funny joke.
You know how birds fly in the big V's and sometimes one side will be longer than the other? You know why that is?  It's because there's more birds on that side.

I like it better as a anti-joke where it's just a deadpan "I'm eighty" with no pirate voice.   
I've heard it like this '..... we don't serve your kind here. So the rope walks out the door and ties himself in a knot and ravels his ends a little bit and walks back in. The barkeep says hey aren't you the rope that was just in here? And the rope says nope, I'm a frayed knot.'

Fook sounds more English to me. Feck is Irish and fouck is perhaps more accurate to what a Scottish "fuck" sounds like
I dodged that shit like the matrix.
Also, dogs don't wear pants. 
That's awful.funny tho
The Black Pope.I'd watch it, but only if it stars Samuel L.
Well... we have a lot of sword fighting bare men
You should know the joke by heart because you know Dave.
I honestly like the first one more because of the build up between the three guys. I was thinking there must be an ulterior motive for the arm wishes but they already head me cracking up. Then he walks into the bar, arms flailing and head nodding - I'm cracking up even harder. "I think I fucked up". Fucking got me good. Me and my friends say that when we're doing dumb shit so it hit home. 
oh man the money i would pay to see that meeting
And then the wheeze laughing afterwards. Lmao you're so right.

It will actually be starring Eddie Murphy as both the pope, his wife and his mother. It will be hilarious, I guarantee. 
Are you the representative for the entire internet? I knew I'd get to meet you one day!

I am not very cool (long story; very overprotective parents + orchestra-nerd-turned-science-geek-turned-medical-student) and had to google this reference... THIS SONG IS FANTASTIC AND THE FOO FIGHTERS ARE FANTASTIC WHERE HAS THIS SHIT BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!??
I feel like my life just found its purpose. That was to lead you to the Foo Fighters music.  I will tell this story to my children. 
All his life he was searching for something  Something never comes never leads to nothing  Nothing satisfies but he's getting close  When manly_lumber jack said "Watch him as he goes!"

What a good noodle <3
I had good friend, when I was in primary school who had a step dad I really couldn't stand. He was quite a bit older than her mom and very strict. I even avoided to go to her place, when he was there. Later she told me that he beat her and her brother quite regularly.
"Maybe it's because he was a 35 year old man who wore visors."Funniest thing I've read this year
The amount of pedophile stories in this thread is freaking me out.
I like to think she actually said "Wang_Dipthong"
>Took 10 years but i was right.Nice :)>He is currently on year 1 of a 32 year sentence for repeated rape of his daughter.  :(
Did you divorce your husband after that?
So he walked into the shower with a bunch of naked girls? And no one else thought it was strange?
Yo momma so fat, she survived and lives a happy life!
Your grandma sounds awesome. Leaping over furniture and escaping from a murderer. 
I want to meet your sister and find out about myself.
The assistant pastor at my parents church always gave me the creeps, couldn't quite place my finger on it since he never did anything particularly creepy, he just looked like he had something to hide. A few years later, he was arrested for upskirting young girls at the mall. No telling what else he was doing too. This was a decade ago, dunno if counseling worked for him or anything but I haven't seen him pop up on the news at all. 
It's not often you hear about people still having contact with their first girlfriends - at least, I know more stories in which people don't stay in contact rather than they do. May I ask, how much time is in between you and her breaking up, and them getting married? It may be a bit of an offtopic question in this topic but I'm genuinely interested. 
My sister's class at school had a competition to write to him to get on to his Jim'll Fix It show. She was picked, and she really really wanted to do the thing she wrote about. But she completely refused to go to the show because she said he was creepy. She got in a tonne of trouble at school because of it, but I guess that was better than what could have happened. 
This sounds like high school. Please be high school.
Do you work in Gary, Indiana?
I hate that I know who you're talking about. 
I dated a guy that everyone thought was the greatest, and by all accounts, seemed to be. But my kids really didn't like him and my brother described him "as super mild mannered but the kind of guy that comes home one day and just murders his entire family" The relationship didn't last because of these reasons as well as my own but, as of 2 years, he's still just a great guy as far as everyone knows. Now it has me thinking. 
Oh!  Nonono, she died from stress during a move. :( 
Not for that caper, but I think he got popped for something else.  And I got a phone call a few months later from an angry ex-girlfriend telling me my suspicions were correct and which pawn shop he used.  The police were just like, "Meh."
To be fair, it's not a thread about people who gave a good first impression and later turned out to have an exemplary character.
She did. It's a family name. The first wang_dipthong was my great great great grandmother. She was the biggest wang alive at the time. Now there are only two wangs left - mom and I. Mom remarried and her name is Wang Stroker now. I'm the hardest Wang because I haven't found love yet. Hopefully one day, I'll be a softer wang. 
Thanks for offering a ride, but I think I'll just ~~walk~~run...
This about sums it up
Not yet.  Complicated, lengthy, messy, and almost entirely on Reddit (see feed)
Yes! There is a saying "she was thought to be crazy by the man who drove her there". So true. Or woman. I guess
For real.  That's sick and manipulative.
I sometimes think my life story could have been a fantastic book for Oprah's book club.Maybe this is why I hate things like that and prefer humor? Sometimes dark, sometimes with cream and sugar.
This reminds me of our close family friends - father had been molesting his daughter for years and his wife (my mum's best friend) treated her like the *other woman* in an affair.
Yes, Dave sucks. But I, too, would like to know more about this avocado ranch. Specifically why it's not a farm, but a ranch. Also the avocados. 
The avocado farm was a hotbed of drama and passion, but that's avocado farms for ya.
It was fucking horrific.  We knew something wasn't right with him but we had nothing other than our gut feelings and some creepy looks he gave some little girls.   And of course everyone else in the family just loved him so we looked like assholes for refusing to associate with him.   Even after his conviction people in the family are still making excuses for what he did and trying to tell people that what he did wasn't really that bad.   My husband doesn't talk to that side of the family anymore.  
Right? How's she going to afford the rent without a roommate??
From own experience: it never goes well, and the person who tried to warn the others becomes a cynical bastard because of it. 
Wanna come over for waffles? Maybe it'll make your day better :)
Why not just get a divorce, holy fuck. 
I guess some did, I'm still friends with a girl, that also went there and she left the club for the same reason I did. I think they were either too embarassed to tell or they really didn't think of it as strange. As I said, he was loved by everyone, he also was teacher at my elemantary school. People trusted him. 
It was a legit reason for him to enter the showers and us being seven years olds somehow liked the idea of having a snowball fight...
/r/wholesomeyomommajokes
The great country of Nonobia resents that comment.
Yean. Not quite as good as before, but a lot of that was me moving across the country for school and her wanting to stay close to home.
"when you look at someone with rose colored glasses, all the red flags are just flags"
She's in better shape than anyone I know, that's for sure! XD
I'm gonna assume that it was a knife behind his back  and the last sentence does say the cops were called
I think he was lonely and heartbroken. She was like this dream come true for him. She pretended to be into everything he was into, even though I could tell that bitch didn't like animals. If you like animals you don't look like your playing freeze tags when one accidentally brushes up against you.Was he wrong? Absolutely.Can I understand WHY he allowed himself to be fooled? Yup.
100% totally agree. Not even a question. It took a lot for his mother to even speak to him again.
Yep, and then to keep up with the lie (since he actually was just working there) he had to build more lies about going back to the store to work there. And then build another lie about how he's also rich from the stock market to explain the income he was getting from stealing and eBay sales.
I think if you spend time worrying that you might be secretly bad, you're probably not too bad.
Don't give her any Jet.
Unfortunately where i lived (when this happened), these things won't be taken seriously by the police.. 
Childhood sexual abuse is a manipulative thing. It's not uncommon for abused folks to remain in an abusive situation, sometimes their whole lives, say if their abuser is also their brother.
This is the kind of content I want on r/nosleep Not some shit like *My Uncles PortaPotty is Haunted part 1719*Even though this is real, and not for the purpose of being scary, its so much more intense and enjoyable to read. 
Not only did I trust my gut, I also drew dicks on his car when I could find it in the parking lot.
It did indeed. But this was some years after I'd graduated, so I didn't really have any reason to argue the case again with anybody.
Don't remember her name, unfortunately. My parents were really good about not being dismissive when I was a kid.
Her other guy came to see her one day and she told my brother that he was an old coworker. So my brother said he'd take them all out to lunch and she lost her shit, and it all unraveled. She admitted to everything, from using my brother for money to having this whole relationship for their entire relationship. 
I know a Bulgarian girl doing this. Shes attractive and has a good job, and is married to an English guy, but has a 'soul mate' in Bulgaria. She also goes on dates with other guys, as long as they're rich or really handsome. It's weird, because all her Bulgarian girlfriends think she's perfectly entitled to do this, and being married doesn't take her off the market, while her husband is in total denial and thinks she's just friendly with other guys. 
Oh absolutely. I felt awful for him. But I wanted to hire a sky writer to tell her to fuck off haha 
I used to get people to pull their own harness up, and would show them how to close the buckles. When it came time to thread the rope through the loops, there was a good 5-6 inches of rope between my hand and the harness. Can't be too careful.Speaking of careful, I always double and triple checked harnesses, both to make sure they were tight enough and that they were properly done up.
Same here, turns out the dog had secretly been evil etc
They're good fluffy domestic assault detectors, Brent
Dogs always know dude.  Just turn yourself in to the police now and save everyone the trouble.
i finally understand why in english class they say to define pronouns
I like to recommend this book as well, particularly for women, we are socially trained to be nice even when our inner alarms are blaring.
Yeah, turns out some pensioner in the pub I drink in was a prolific pedophile, it turns out he was at it for decades, generally against very vulnerable people; disabled children etc, basically the worst you can get. What was horrific is that he was reasonably normal, you expect these people to be monsters, the idea that they're walking amongst you is the scary part. 
Good ole' Gary. Make sure you gas up before you get there. You don't want to stop. 
Don't know, but he was sharing with the roofing crew he was working with.
No, she sat in the library for years 
Can't you see?
Username checks out. History shows posts about Africa. I'm almost 99% sure OP is really Oscar Pistorius and is just trying to be relevant again. 
 Indeed, Johannesburg born and raised! Okay, so to be fair, please don't take my story as a full and complete portrayl of his character. After all, we were just teenagers at a house party - I'd hate to be judged for who I was at 17. Maybe he tried his best to be a better person in the following years. My story just tied in perfectly with the question so decided to stop lurking for once and contribute..... it's been cathartic. 
You and me both. Obviously I never would have pegged him for being that fucked up, but I didn't like him from the beginning. Not only for his karmawhore ways, but just the way he acted and talked seemed off to me. 
An investment to the betterment of humanity. 
Yup, my boyfriend was like "she probably just cheated" but me and my guy friend I guess were being nice and giving the benefit of the doubt.
People like that are the minority, but they're the ones that stick in people's brains and turn our whole society to think "men can't like playing with kids or they're pervs".
Try being a *dad* without your wife present at all times. I've had to defend myself from strangers accusing me of pedo intentions towards my own children on the playground. Though to be fair, this is more a statement on the sorts of people that would attack somebody they simply assume is a predator, than society itself - which seems to have more and more of those people in it anyways.
Lol, that part is straight cold. "Oh, you found out I was cheating on you? I'm afraid I'll have to break up with you!" 
snek was avenged <3
Somebody should make that thread
Sometimes I wonder if I'm a narcissist, as I have been called one in fights before and I can go all scorched-earth, but I try to keep my ego in check by questioning myself. I feel like if I let myself go unchecked I could become one especially because I'm not perfect and make mistakes. Also when I go scorched-earth it tends to be in defense of someone I love
Good luck. We are on Team AllysWorld. 
Do it. Write the book 
Do you want rampages?Because this is how you get rampages. I hate hearing shit like this so much. THESE ARE YOUR FUCKING KIDS MAN. FUCKING DO THE RIGHT THING. OR DON'T HAVE KIDS. 
Sole manager of said Ranch here! You see, in order to become a farm, we need a proper set of investors backing us. With your help, we can put this Ranch phase behind us, and become a true Avocado farm once and for all! I'll take you for a tour sometime.
That does make me wonder though, if they already signed a lease together shouldn't he still be liable for his half of the rent?I mean I don't know if I would push it to far and sue someone crazy like, that but if you got his half plus get another roommate BOOM free rent!
Don't let it get to you.  Sometimes you cannot fix stupid.  You saw the problem when nobody else could.  That is a very important skill.  Keep your eyes open man!
My gut instinct says no
He wanted the insurance money and didn't want to lose custody of his 3 year old. Source: the article.
I'm thinking it was a not-subtle message from the judge. The number I wish was wrong is how many times the high-school girl stabbed her foster mother; why (and how, honestly) would you stab anyone 178 times?  I couldn't even imagine stabbing Hitler 178 times.  (I mean, the father may have talked her into killing the woman, but there's something *very, very* wrong with a person who murders someone with that much overkill. (Beyond being a murderer, that is.)  That's like, almost *beyond* psychopathy. 
Yeah, that's usually the story.  This is how they get to the position of trust they need to get what they want.  Everyone is always so surprised.  It's almost never the guy with the weird mustache.  You'd never let him near your kids, so how would looking the part help?
That in itself is creepy.  Just the snowball thing... Yuck. 
Hey wait a minute!  You're not OP!
I think they did but just did not expect it from their prized employee
Reminds me of my favorite Mark Twain quote: "If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything." I don't know how people have the energy to keep up an elaborate web of lies.  I've lived by this for many years, and it has made life pretty easy, bitching even.  
I say the same thing to parents, if you spend your time worried that you're a bad parent, you're probably not. Bad parents don't give a shit. 
Ugh. That's terrible. Sorry you had to deal with that.
Denial is a powerful thing
I chuckled at this. Love it. My favorite meme is the one where someone asks Michelangelo to do the Sistine Chapel & he's all "ya but I'm gonna draw a bunch of dicks on it though" 
That's so awesome. That's the kind of parent I want to be someday. 
Kids can be super honest sometimes. Other times my daughters tell me about all the dinosaurs they hunted and killed and the caves they live in where they festooned the walls with the dinosaur intestines. Idk whats real or not real anymore.
My Asian mom did stuff that other people could take as being creepy. She loves babies and would want to hold them. Then she would say something like "oh he/she's so pretty. Can I take him/her home". Obviously she wasn't serious.
My Asian mom has also done some things that would freak out Americans. Once on a road trip we were getting ready to leave a ratty motel/apartments in a hick town, mom sees one of the live-in children watching her eat cookies. She has the kid come into our van to eat cookies with her. Needless to say when I came upon the scene I quickly explained in non-English why this shit could get her in some big trouble, this isn't Asia, get that kid the fuck out of the van before someone sees. 
So she is dead now? 
Do you happen to know if this is common among Bulgarians? Or just a one off thing 
If anyone ever said they knew how to do it themselves I'd let them, but I would always always always double check the harness and make sure they were clipped properly. After every attempt too. When it comes to safety, it takes A LOT to be "too careful."
Yeah I was imagining this dog setting up op. "oh really? The dog shit in the living room? The dog we all love?""I SWEAR, WTF, WHY WOULD I SHIT IN YOUR LIVING ROOM?""Get the hell out of my house you freak "
In the original story for "Minority Report," Philip K. Dick actually had "predogs" instead of "precogs" but Steven Spielberg felt this would be too realistic, and detract from the scifi element. 
I feel like there's a new person with each pronoun. 
Awww what a good pup! I never had a dog escort me, but my friend's dog would always randomly show up on my back porch, demand to come inside to sniff and then leave. 
It's a tradition in our family to give a copy of this book to every girl graduating from high school. Really, everyone should read it, though.
That's what I was thinking. I don't get how it's possible to do that kind of thing and keep parental rights. Especially since she said he had a daughter. 
> generally against very vulnerable peopleThis is important to remember. The poor, the disabled, the shy, the lonely...serial abusers learn who to hurt.
Seems like its always the ones obsessing from the pulpit about homosexuality that turn out to be cock crazy.  
I've noticed micro facial expressions in myself during times of conflict and stress. Random muscles twitching or a darting eye or things like that
You know you're entering Gary when it's 100 degrees outside and all of the car windows start rolling up.
Ah, grad school
You're just not the girl for me...
OP - Oscar Pistorius. I see what you did there!And I like it. 
You and your friend are decent people, it sounds like this was the beginning of the crazy and you weren't to know. Glad your friend got out of it. 
If you really want to creep them out, hate kids *and* football.
I had my infant son out shopping at Staples with my wife's Guncle and a random lady literally tried to take the baby out of his arms because a baby that young "must have a mother" and we clearly stole him. It was insane. She went from, "aww, cute baby" to "I'm saving him from you perverted gay kidnappers" in 5 seconds flat. Thankfully store management escorted her out.
That's what my friend "Denise" is like. She was absolutely polite the first day I met her in work and all I really thought of her was that she seemed sweet. Well it turns out that she's the absolutely nicest person in the world. My friend "Lisa" met Denise at my birthday party and was shocked at the fact that I hadn't been exaggerating about how nice Denise was. I've literally been sat next to Denise going "aw man I'd love some chocolate right now" and she has offered me money so I could get some. And she wouldn't expect me to pay her back. I love her. 
Constant vigilance!
I dunno man. I make pretty killer waffles
what kind of confused brain thinks like, hmm I really love my daughter I want to be a part of her life. Divorce will likely fuck me over. What's the solution...oh I know, murder her mother! 
Yeah fuck snowballs. Snowballs are fucking pedophiles man.
This is not a standard thing in the US or Canada at least. Group showers for seven year olds supervised only by a male coach?Also the post said he got in trouble after assault at a training camp for younger girls. Do 5 year olds have "training camps"? Maybe this is in a country with a different sports system or something? Seems possible as handball is not so popular in North America.
It really says a lot about the owners. Good on them.
It still doesn't check out. First time something goes missing at night you have your security system improved. Most people don't sit there and go "oh darn it, an electric piano disappeared again" and then forget about it.
Coming from a guy who told people his name was Mark Twain
Thank you :) It's all good now, this happened almost 12 yrs ago and I've moved to another country since:) 
I think variations definitely translate fine/exist in English.  "Oh you're such a good kid, I should take you home/adopt you myself!"  Or even naughty children, "if you don't stop acting up, your mom will leave you with me and I'll put you to work!"  But there's definitely a tone people say it with that makes it obvious.  The "not taking no for an answer" is what puts the situation into creepy territory. 
And now some kid is out there persuading all the other kids that getting into a van really does result in free cookies. Nice going, Asian Mom. 
No, she's actually completely single. Apparently other dude didn't know she had been dating my brother, so when he found out he kicked her to the curb. 
I know couple of Bulgarian girls and they're nothing like this Might be it's just that group. 
Right, but in your area, how many "white van" incidents have there been, versus the amount of familial child abuse? Your fear is misproportioned, because your bias tells you that the people in *your* life wouldn't do something like that.
Feels like graduation from middle school would be the more appropriate age for this. High schools girls get trapped in a lot of shit because they don't know how to stop someone without being "rude." (Personal experience.)
As the father of a severely autistic girl, this scares the shit out of me. I know if someone took advantage of her I would kill them. How do you protect a 7 year old who can't even tell you she's hungry, or needs to go to the bathroom. This is a terrible thread to start my day.
That is so fucked up. How does someone do that to their own children (well, any child)? What a monster.
A lot of preachers tend to do sermons on the things they struggle with more frequently. It's easier to talk about something you personally have an issue with than something you don't.
It's the only thing that makes sense.Omama bin Laden?
I know it might be wrong
I fucking lost it at "perverted gay kidnappers".
*reads username*
No, kids are...
I think it depends on how often they check their inventory. Do they count their items in stock every day, once a week/month? By the time they checked, several items could've been taken over a period of days/weeks. As an insider, he knew their system and worked around it. 
I work with the kids that have shit like this happen to them, and I gotta say, I agree with you 100%.
Did your brother start dating the other guy?
can confirm, dated a Bulgarian girl for a while, can't confirm whether or not she put a curse on me when it ended though.
Holy shit. The coherent sentence shows the darker meaning...
Well also abuse from family is way more taboo and kept hush hush so you would never really hear about it. 
When reading stuff like this it is important to remember how the over-whelming majority of humanity would never harm your daughter. A lot of us would die before harming a child.
I used to work at a rape crisis center.  One of the staff had a FIL who had raped his wife, all his daughters, all his DILs, all his granddaughters and god knows who else. She finally put her foot down and made their family be no contact.  But no one ever stopped him.  It can totally be generational.  Which makes me want to puke.
More like Yomama bin Laden. 
I'm in love with Stacy's Mom
Work in a store, and now count our inventory every monday. But before we did it 2 times a year. You could have stolen a shit ton of products in that time, but once you do inventory, you finally realize how much you're missing.
I was actually gonna say or beat him to a pulp lol. But I don't want anyone being done for randomly fucking up a bad man with no actual evidence on what he did.
Though that would have been the best conclusion to bring this all full circle, no. 
Not that I know of. My brother moved five hours away shortly after that so I doubt it. 
> DILsHer raped his daughters-in-law?!? And his adult married sons reacted how? O.o
What do I have to do with any of this
She's got it going on
I have a friend that works for a professional inventory counting service.  They go to huge warehouses to count inventory and have these weird hip mounted computers they use to count and keep track of stuff.  When I knew him in high school he could barely do math but now he has Rainman level skill at counting a group of matched items close together.  
Yeah mob mentality can be a lovely thing... I feel bad for all the innocent older men who look like Elvis and sing like him in Australian bars.
Best thing about being full circle is that you're never straight.
so your brother is 2 hours away from that guy?
Quite possible he was a high authority figure within the family that noone dared to question
As someone who is socially awkward to a borderline debilitating extent, thank you. If I'd have learned people skills young I wouldnt have to put so much effort into it now that I'm 21.
Schools should just make kids who are bad at math do inventory.
If it helps he has a kiwi accent.
I sucked at multiplication tables all through school. Got a stock room job after graduating with a masters. Knew my multiplication tables up to 16 in three months. 
Wow what a fruit.
That's a really compassionate way of seeing the North Korea situation
Have parents who grew up in Korea, I'd definitely say that they have more resentment towards Japan than NK. I'd have to ask them, but they seem to be more sympathetic towards NK, especially since many have relatives there. 
It is due to the isolation and difference in North Korean language and culture in comparison to the South I believe.60 Years of total separation has its affects.
It's heart wrenching to think about. I'm sure many people just kept waiting and hoping for unification...going to their own death never knowing what happened to a parent, child, or spouse.
Yea my parents' generation, they used to have regular evacuation drills and stuff. But they do not Reddit. 
I think most Koreans want reunification-- I, as a Korean-American do.  I'm afraid that that the only way that will happen is via a war where tens of millions die.
You should make your own post with this question. I'd be interested in reading the responses. 
yeah this is what I wanted to ask. Can't imagine that there were actually children receiving these letters, NK government probably wouldn't allow it.
That is an incredible compliment, thank you. I did work in the translation industry for quite a while, so that may definitely helped. I also go on reddit on a daily basis, and read/watch a ton of English based media.
There is a documentary called A State of Mind that focuses on the Mass Games in North Korea. I watched it several years ago and it was really insightful and showed how they push the value of group dynamics over individual achievement. 
Not OP, but what you say regarding the impracticality of reunification is correct. However, the ideal is for reunification; it's just no one has any concrete ideas for this nor do we agree on a lot of things regarding NK.Sympathy for the people is supposed to be a given, so that one day if reunification does happen, we can be ready for it. As OP mentions, the NK regime and military are the taught as the "main enemy/adversary". This is an acknowledgement of that the threat that is NK yet that we must not be confused with "regime/military" and "people".
They probably didn't want to tell children anything worse. 
People forget that South Korea was once a fascist dictatorship.
The popular choices were the US, Canada, and Australia. 
For younger generations, the consensus is to stay where they are now. SK people sacrificed a lot to get to where they are economically and does not want to lose their sons/brothers/fathers to war.My perspective is that the country must be united once again. Depends on what party takes over the government. If liberal, peaceful merge. If conservative, hit me and we will hit you back harder. However, both parties have aims to reunite. Just different methods
Well, we had to watch the videos of those kids and we felt bad for them. It hits you hard when kids who look like you and speaks the same language dies off from starvation
That's adorable. :)
They did, but not the people. Implication was that NK people are just "hypnotized" by communism ideology and needs to be save.
May be we are related?
Among Korean youth it's more apathetic than hateful. Source: Am Korean with youthful Korean friends 
Its not a taboo topic to talk about or anything. Its comes up just like any other political comment.
Yeah, they were built with the idea of doubling as bunkers/shelters in mind.
which part of Seoul were you visiting? I find it hard to believe people were visibly uncomfortable with someone speaking Japanese, there are Japanese tourists everywhere.
I know! My grandpa didn't even recognize his little brother :( I'm pretty sure my grandpa abandoned his family when he joined the SK army with his best friend. He was a great grandpa but generally a pretty shitty person. His little brother is still alive and awesome! Eerily lives sorta close to the DMZ. 
Often in South Korea, North Koreans face social isolation and discrimination
She didn't trust it. Said something about not being regulated or something
You can visit through a tour group and everything is very restricted 
No. Probably from the Chinese character for the U.S. which means "beautiful" and is pronounced "Mei" in Chinese. Same character is likely pronounced "Mi" in Korean. 
My father in law recently visited from South Korea and we watched that show together.  Basically it is a Korean style talk show where professional South Korean hosts interview defectors about their life and experiences.  Since North Korea sucks so bad, it might come across as propaganda but it does not seem to have a script.  You can watch the most recent episodes on ondemandkorea.com but there are no subtitles.
I would be drunk any time I was awake.
I mean Korea transformed so completely during their lives, can I ask how they talk about this transformation and how the country was under the elder Park, or how they use industrial tools that they might not have had as children if they were especially poor?
I could potentially see a coup of sympathetic North Koreans finally overthrowing them.
Not to mention the fact that, you know, he's committed war crimes and will probably end up in prison for the rest of his life and/or executed.  Pretty sure he mostly doesn't wanna die. 
I have read about letters and propaganda fliers being tied to balloons and released at the DMZ where the wind carries them to the North. I could see these letters being gathered by SK and US forces for exactly that sort of psyop. Of course, I'm just speculating. 
That could be the case. We definitely don't tell our children about the atrocities we've committed in the US until much later
This is definitely it. Thank you for sharing.
The defectors are usually called "sae-tuh-min" which means something like "newly-housed". I remember having one classmate in elementary school who came down from NK with his mom. I remember him having a normal school life, and no one had anything against him. He was actually quite popular due to his awesome soccer skills. As far as I know, even the  parents including mine were "curious" of how they got there, but showed no hostility. 
I think its important to not equate their actions to decisions of the people though, I think its good to foster compassion towards the north Koreans amongst south koreans.
By people do you mean South Koreans?  The demonizing of North Korea was probably done under the exact dictatorship you're talking about.  The people today are not ignorant of the dictatorships, and are very much resentful about it.  This is especially so after the impeachment of the recent corrupt president, who was the daughter of the dictator.
When I was talking to people who worked for reunification efforts in Korea, I heard that often times Koreans from abroad feel more strongly about reunification than native Koreans. He stated that unfortunately many people in Korea have become ambivalent towards the idea of reunifying. Would you say that's accurate? 
How much of that kind of footage exists? It seems like something NK wouldn't allow to be shot, let alone let out of the country.
My father, who grew up in a communist country, was told of the poor starving kids in America.
Yes and also compassion for the northerners. They did not choose to be that way. They we left behind. Many of our families fled from the North. They had sons and daughters and brothers and sisters who didn't make it. They weren't evil. They just didn't make it out. It is a source of grief. 
I find being bilingual so fascinating. I wish I could learn a second language fluently but everyone I know speaks English so I don't have anybody to speak a second language with to get fluent enough to know what it's like.
Older gen: yesYounger gen: look at West Germany, our economy is gonna collapse
There is a significant amount of radical left in Korea who are sympathetic to the North as a means to be be anti-American or are vehement with nationalism and jingoistic.  Remember that there is a draft in South Korea for all young males of a certain age.  Not unheard of that some Korean youths would look at their current situation and think "I'm here because of this unKorean interloper."  It is very likely that there would be a few among the Korean armed services who don't want to be there and will have a "phase" that echoes radical left politics. 
They were actually my friends awkwardly enough. On a rowdy night a girl had a talk with me about how they despise the Japanese. Mostly because of war crimes.They're in their 30s. Living in the metropolitan areas. I've also had a man get annoyed at me when I said kanpai by accident when I was sloshed. Great people otherwise though. I hope the hate can be let go some day.
Very reasonable to say that, since there's not much science going on there, god knows what kind of food regulations they have over there.
Yes, as you say, Migook does not come from Korean's view of Americans or America as beautiful. It is a direct borrowing from Chinese, and I would venture to guess that the Chinese word for America was from the "-me-" part of America (uh-MEI-ri-cuh), since that is where the stress is (that's why we get "Murica"). Once they had the sound, they likely chose a character with positive meaning that has the "mei" sound.  Also, "han" in "hangook" does not mean one. It is just a proper name.
Yup. My mother bribed the border with 'fine' products purchased on the black market to escape socialist Poland in the '80s.Times were tough... 
South Korea would have a huge hit to their economy. 
I'll have to be honest and say I'm unfortunately not a good resource for this particular question. My dad and I, while we love each other, like many father/son relationships, exclusively talk about baseball. My mother grew up relatively wealthy in that era and I've seen many people her age not even relate to her like "wtf you had a tv?" "wtf do you mean you took a taxi to school?" 
> sympathetic North Koreans:\
> Pretty sure he mostly doesn't wanna dieIf he were to step down willingly, I am quite certain there could be an offer of amnesty and nice retirement package. If he is deposed, he will likely be killed in country long before he gets an opportunity to face war crimes trials (which is likley why Uncle died). Whatever amnesty is granted, it won't be the same as being dictator for life, so as long as he believes he can keep it together, he won't surrender. 
When I was a soldier, I would always salute to US troops, just for the heck of it. Some of them were not used to it, but they always seem to get a kick out of it. Thank you for your service. You are always welcome to Korea.
One important thing is they have a different vocabulary. The use very few English loanwords, if any, and instead use different words. The South Koreans use them all over the place. This isn't even including the rest of their sentence structure. Korea used to have many regional dialects and accents. Some were very strong. Seoul had a different one than Busan, and they had a different one than places in between. Now, South Korea is mostly a standard Seoul-ish accent. However, the North didn't merge towards the same language, so they talk different, even unintelligible to some. 
There's really no reason for south koreans to be bitter. You have to remember the split was ~65 years ago. A lot of people still have family in nk. During the war many families were split up because only some were willing to make the trek through dangerous conditions to escape north korea. My grandma had to cross through war zones at the age of 11 with her parents so we technically still have relatives over there. 
Japanese internment camps, trail of tears 
Pretty one sided description of the Korean War buddy...you do realize it was was the North Koreans...backed by China and the Soviets who invaded the South? And it wasn't just the Americans supporting the South it was  21 countries  of the United Nations who helped defend South Korea from the invasion force. Don't make it sound like the US just decided to bomb the hell out of the North.
The fact that she was elected in the first place suggests the resentment is not as total as you suggest.
A strong argument against unification may be the potential for the SK economy to collapse if it were to absorb the NK 'economy'.
I guess the same way actual photos we get from tourists that go there. Risk their freedom to get unauthorized shots. 
He wasn't entirely misplaced. Tens of thousands of inner-city youth were and still are starving. And I understand that the Soviets in particular liked to portray the problems of racism and black poverty as endemic of the inequalities of the capitalist system. It was a "you may not have much, but at least you're not left to fend for yourself like those poor people capitalism brushes aside". 
It's just how you phrase it. Don't form a causal relationship between the food they waste and people not having enough. The finish your plate mentality isn't healthy anyway.
That's kind of adorable. Bonus points for good grandma.
For me was always Africa. My mom gave me a kids book that had a spin wheel on it and on the spin wheel was an about 70% chance of hitting a third world country and it was supposed to say how lucky you are for not being born in shitty countries. She made me spin it if I didn't eat all my green beans.
Biggest is food shortage. During famine, cannibalism happens often in rural areas. Also if 1 person defects, public execution for all family members left behind
Well there are two types of gov officials.1. Comes and goes with gov change every 5 yrs2. Rose up the rank from bottom up.My case is number 2, so.. not much? 
Probably suffer the same fate. I'll imagine it be pretty hard to come out of that environment being normal probably will take years to reach whatever normal is
German here: Our economy didnt collapse! The east drags us down a bit, but overall it works out.
Many still are still wiling to, but the tax is going to be MUCH higher that what is now and younger generations may not like that much
There are plenty north Korean communities are in south.
Kim Jong Un personally taste tests every piece of candy produced in North Korea. 
I mean like a general or something secretly wanting to end the regime.
They are the kind that will send millions to their death before making personal sacrifices.
That's good, some other users were telling stories about negative biases on NK so I expected more of that and it was just nice to see an alternative
Hell, there are people in the Republic of Ireland who are concerned about the economic impacts of reunification with Northern Ireland and that situation doesn't even touch that of the Korean Peninsula. I'll give those South Koreans a pass. It's an absolute clusterfuck of a situation. Although in both cases I think reunification is ultimately the best decision. What's a few years/decades of economic hardship versus fostering an unnatural divide amongst a people that doesn't need to exist. 
I'd say slavery is quite a big one
I've seen this said elsewhere and it confuses me and makes me wonder if education has changed. I certainly learned about all the atrocities against the Native Americans and slavery. We didn't get all the grisly details in elementary school, of course. But we did in high school. This was 25 years ago though.
Unfortunately, yes.  Although it has heightened definitely since then.  There are people who regard her father as a great person, since he was the only dictator that used his absolute power for "good" (for certain people).  People who lived during his rule, that benefited from it, still hail him.  Even today, there are protests by older conservatives calling for the decriminalization of the former president.  The rest of us are hardly sympathetic, and a lot of this resentment is also being carried on to such people.
It would probably be a million times worse than Germany's reunification.  East Germany was backwards and poor but nothing like the disparity between the Koreas.
The tourists are only brought to Pyongyang and other areas which are permitted.  The tourists don't get to see the real North Korea, the villages, or obviously the forced labor camps.  
The ironic part is that NK was stronger - economically, militarily, etc. - than SK until the 80s or so. Additionally, both were dictatorships, so being a Korean just kind of sucked for a while (in a way, Korea is the Poland of Asia...).
It's not just inner city youth. I live in a rural area, wife's a social worker, works with kids that have been abused, trust me, it's a very serious problem in rural america as well.
> The finish your plate mentality isn't healthy anyway.Why, if I may ask?
If you landed on the 30% did you still have to eat your green beans?
I think I fall into that category.  Grew up poor, and although I'm doing very well for myself as an adult I feel like I am in a hybrid gray area where I don't always know what a "normal" person would do.
:/ fuck me
Excellent point. I'm sure SKorean realtors would get excited too.
There was a 3:1 GDP per capita ratio between West Germany and East Germany. Between North Korea and South Korea it's something like 40:1.
Well considering the fact that they've been only divided for short period of time compare to SK and NK. Also, East Germany was one of the riches countries among communist nations.
Those at the top got there due to being complicit in the regime's practices, self-interests, and bootlicking.  They're not all of a sudden going to have an epiphany about altruism and risk their life to save the peasants.  Furthermore, a coup would take more than just one general-- it would take a group of people all risking their lives and the lives of their families for generations to come.  Why would they take that risk when they're generals with the best lifestyles already in NK?
Like most world leaders then?
> Republic of Ireland who are concerned about the economic impacts of reunification with Northern IrelandOther way around, lad.
I remember learning slavery in Kindergarten, and they taught us about rounding up the slaves with a fucked up version of tag. 
I think it's about the same. Like in elementary school we knew about the slaves and Native Americans, but it wasn't really until middle school when we were shown Roots in history class that the conditions became more clear. Then of course we got even further into it in high school, although the primary focus of American history was ALWAYS the Revolutionary War.
Same story with Francisco Franco, in Spain. Ruled from 1939 to 1975. Lots of political oppression, nationalism, women's rights violations, but the older conservatives that lived under him still seem to think he was good.
That sounds a lot like my knowledge of reunification Germany
There isnt a very big gap. The only difference is that NK doesnt use english loanwords, but  the way people speak in NK is no more different than the way south koreans in jeollado speak, for example
I agree, I recall reading from several sources that regardless of the problems in communist East Germany, their quality of products and volume of production was better per worker than just about any other communist bloc nation. I personally believe it was due to the German culture. NK has been more completely transformed in such an entrenched fashion, I think the difficulty of orienting their population into any kind of a modern economy would be profoundly difficult. I do not believe the pre-communist NK culture had a society as modern as the pre-WWII German example.
Yeah, it is pretty disappointing. When he took the power, I was hoping he would be more open to the international community since he lived and was educated outside. Last a few years, I rather wished his father lived longer.
Are those areas visible on like google earth?
Starving ethnic minorities? I don't think the Soviets really should have thrown stones that way
I've spent my life struggling to not clear a plate of food that I ordered and paid for, even if I'm already full.  I know it's mental, but it's really, really hard.    For my daughter, we're teaching her to eat "until her belly is happy".  If she's still not happy, we might tell her she has to eat more of her chicken or broccoli before she can have a potato chip, but as soon as she says she's happy she can stop eating.
I had that book too!
Indeed. Don't have to be poor to buy rice in bulk, in an Asian family you'll go through several kilos per week some weeks.
Was wondering this too... I see the poverty mindset more in people who buy in small quantities because it's "cheaper" even though once for ounce it is more expensive. People used to going through financial difficulties tend to buy what they need to get by, while people who are more comfortable will spend more and pay less overall on things they are sure to use. Like how you can buy a single individual snack size of chips for like a dollar, or a large party pack size for $4 and it is clearly more than 4 times bigger. 
And if someone commits a crime, 3 generations of their family have to be held in concentration camps 
Would assume there would be a bump in tourism from curious outsiders too. I for one would love to visit Heaven Lake at some point during my life.
Also, crucially, the West Germans were very highly educated. That's one thing the Eastern Bloc did get right. Building physical capital is easy once you've already got human capital.That sure as hell ain't the case with North Korea, especially because malnutrition as children stunts people intellectually.
In the even of the North Korean government collapse it would be absolutely no problem to give dietary aid and raise the caloric intake of absolutely every living person within North Korea's borders.
No, but a giant war may be...
People at the top may live a more luxurious lifestyle, but they are also in more danger as the Kim dynasty regularly "purges" the ranks of anyone they have the slightest suspicion of. It's possible that at some point Kim Jong Un will leave the wrong person with nothing left to lose, then it's just a matter of deciding if they like their revenge hot or cold.
My 2nd grade teacher was actually born in one. That's all she ever told us, I guess we were too young to get any real details
The reason was politics.  FDR was elected on a "we're dissatisfied with the economy and distrustful of foreigners who terk ehr jerbs" sentiment similar to what we see in recent American politics.  The dead giveaway that they never actually thought it would make anyone safer is that they never actually bothered interning any Japanese Americans living in Hawaii, where Pearl Harbor happened, because that would have really been a hassle, and Hawaii didn't really have voters glad to see their Japanese neighbors interned they way mainland America did.  
My understanding is that the culture, wealth and education gap between North and South Korea is way more severe (now) than the gap between East and West Germany was in 1989.FWIW, even now it's pretty easy to tell East and West Germans apart if they're above a certain age (~ 35)
I would imagine that the reunification would be more like nation-building after a fallen dictator. SK would have a lot of help from Western powers if NK government were to collapse. It would take time, but I don't think it would harm SK's economy in the long run.
No, they just look like low-resolution brown and green. Same with large parts of Africa, unfortunately- I wanna see some elephants from space 
The US has orchestrated multiple coups of foreign governments, but our leaders still condemn coups done by others.
Ah, I see. I can see that point, yeah.
I have always wondered how they determined 3 generations. Like if the women don't have kids are they raped?
Yeah, at least the East Germans were well educated and had enough to eat, they just were like 2 decades behind in societal development and weren't used to personal freedom or an open society. North Koreans are neither well educated or well fed, and are close to a century behind.
Isn't the top reason we fought the last world war prevention of that? Among many other reasons of course. 
You're thinking of Iceland. Ireland was where 99 Luftballons bombed North Korea.
I don't know how much one of those would cost, but let's highball it and say $20,000. There are four other living males of the Kim line, so that'd be $80,000 plus shipping.
That is a very good point, but in truth those last two lines were largely intended as a humorous cap-off to what I was saying.
> will leave the wrong person with nothing left to lose,I think you watch too many movies.Hard to picture a 60 year old aristocrat *John Wick*ing a whole government.
Second grade was when I recall learning about Japanese internment. The lesson was simply "this is what we did, here's various points of view about it" and we moved on. That's about how I expect it to be covered.
> it's pretty easy to tell East and West Germans apart if they're above a certain ageHow?
Keep in mind China lives next door. I doubt they'd be thrilled about American GIs handing out freedom on every North Korean street corner...
Cuba is an interesting example I hadn't considered. They're economically behind the world, but they've at least gotten materials and technical knowledge past the embargo - the digital revolution happened there. There's also a large US-Cuban population helping to tie them to the rest of the world. Integrating Cuba (into who I'm not sure) would be tough, but at least the culture gap wouldn't be absolute. NK is hard to even imagine.
Also, the fact that east Germany had support from the then still very powerful USSR which basically subsidised them and gave them access to large amounts of foreign goods. They did the same to North Korea and, for the first few decades, North Korea was doing pretty good. After the USSR and the rest of the east block collapsed, NK basically spiraled downwards rapidly. 
except the higher resolution images on Google Earth are taken using aircraft...
My understanding was that most of the time these family lines simply end in the concentration camp. The women are often raped, though not specifically to create a third generation.
>they just were like 2 decades behind in societal developmentNot at all, they just lived under a very different system. In several aspects they were more progressive than the West. Think legalising homosexuality, women's rights, school system and child care...
You're thinking of Hiroshima. Iceland was accidentally discovered by the Wehrmacht when they were retreating through the nuclear wasteland of Cambodia.
Ever heard of a coup? It's never just one person, but it always starts with one person.
Attitudes, they grew up in a very different environment. Even to this day voting in Germany tends to skew along the old east and west divide on somethings.
Tried finding the pic but couldn't, would you be able to share? Sounds interesting.
That one seems fairly easily solved, though.The US gives huge mountains of aid to South Korea, who then pass it on to the now annexed North Korea.Now you could argue that China wouldn't like South Korea, as an American aligned democracy, handing out freedom on ever North Korean street corner, either, but they wouldn't have a leg to stand on internationally if they  complained about that.
From what I've read, women who are raped by guards (sometimes they enter relationships through fear or because they hope to have a better chance to survive-in my book that's still rape) are executed if they become pregnant. Children fathered by prisoners who are born in the camp usually die because the mothers are starving and can't produce enough milk.
For those who don't know, the show got its name from the way our devices resemble black mirrors when they aren't active / with their screen(s) locked.
I saw that as a 14 year old kid in the late 80s.    Shat me right up it was so plausible.
The set and palette colour were very unsettling. All that grey and green and emptiness made me feel uneasy. 
Worked as a CVS photo technician when this came out.It was extra creepy for me because I realized how easy it would be for someone to be like that.I had been working there less than a year and already had so many people that I knew much of their family history and insight into their family vacations.
Watched it with not one clue what it was about.Fucked me sideways.
There are a few jump scares, but in the context of Jacob's Ladder they don't seem cheap and they are legitimately unsettling.
The book is like that as well. Even when she's being "sweet" you're on edge because you know she'll change in a snap. Such a haunting book. Need to see the movie.
Eraserhead just confused the fuck out of me. I would go so far to say that I am still confused three years later. 
Talk about a movie that's hard to watch again... just because of the sense of impending dread.  You just feel greasy watching that movie.
Ted Levine was so crazy as Buffalo Bill it really makes you wonder if it impacted his personal life. If he wasn't married at the time it must have been tough getting a date.  Who wants to date the guy who played Buffalo Bill. 
And now that guy is The Flash. What were they thinking? Giving Kevin powers like that.
Ok I literally just said the big jump scare in The Thing was the best of all time. But I take it back. The one in The Descent is the best of all time. It was literally the climax of the movie. 
Oh man, I forgot about that movie!!! Mothman Prophecies scared the shit out of me as a teen, and then they casually add that it's based on real events? I just wanted to get that movie the fuck away from me forever. I gotta watch it again and see what I think of it now. 
There are so many scary movies that don't age well, but this is just as good today as it was when it released in 1968.  So eerie.
The bathtub old woman is still one of the scariest things I've ever seen. That and the typewriter scene, which is one of the most clever and iconic horror movie scenes ever I reckon.
God damn, the rape scene in that movie will never leave me.
Sesevenen
The one part of that movie that always gets me in the last session tape where the doctor asks "Where do you live, Simon?" and the response is "I live in the weak and the wounded." 35 years old making my husband check under the goddamn bed and shit...
Hands down the best acting by a Dog, EVER.
That last scene when they're in the basement was the scariest fucking scene I've ever watched.  And nothing happened!  It was just the tension and the realization of standing in a room all alone with a killer.
One of the most grusome movie deaths Ive ever seen is from Bone Tomahawk
Making up a song about Coraliiiiiiiiiiine!First half of this movie I was like, "Pshhh this shit is for kids. Was my friend high recommending this as a scary movie?"Second half of the movie had me on the edge of my seat and gave me the kind of goosebumps that last for hours after it was over.
I don't find movies like this scary. I'm not on edge or afraid just disgusted and sad.
See also: In the Mouth of Madness
I was so afraid during that movie that i honestly felt like i would die if i didn't stop watching it.  So i had to finish it the next night.
You should absolutely check out Perfect Blue, the film that Black Swan was heavily inspired by.
When you casually find all of your missing friend's teeth in a baggie... Yeah, love that film
LONG LIVE THE NEW FLESH
That doorway part though. Fuck.
I saw this movie on the last day it was in the theatre. I was the only one in there. I knew nothing about it. I just assumed the footage was real. At the end, I was so terrified that aliens were real that I sat in the parking lot on Google for 20 minutes making sure that movie was fake. I'm a grown ass man, and I don't scare easily (or much at all, really). To this day, I have tricked 4 of my friends into watching it with the pretense that the footage is real. 2 of my friends - also grown ass men - had nightmares. Good times. 
1408 has something for everyone. Are you afraid of heights, tight spaces, drowning, burning, freezing, dead bodies, ghosts, being drugged, or simply losing your mind? If so, then there's a bit in the movie that will make you uncomfortable. It's a hell of a trip. Definitely one of my favorite movies. 
I'm forever torn on the ending.  On one hand, it was powerful, bold, and *really* sticks with you.  Like, forever.  On the other hand, it's *really* sticks with you.  Like, forever.
I really liked this movie, just saw it recently.  Great atmosphere, great period acting.
I was skimming this thread HOPING someone would mention Signs. I have never been so terrified. I actually have chills reading the scene you mentioned because THAT was the one that took me over the damn edge. I absolutely love that movie, but hell if I'm ever going to watch it again. My family loves teasing me with it though. "Don't look in the pantry, Father...." nope nope nope nope nope! 
"We never play nightcrawlers anymore frank"
"Why are you doing this to us?""Because you were home"*shudders*
To be fair, he said without resorting to jumpscares and this one is pretty jumpscare heavy. Still uses them well though. 
Best music.
Whelp, I learned something neat today.
I can't bring myself to watch another episode. It is that unsettling to me. And the major reason is: I know these horrific stories are completely possible.They don't write a frontend in visual basic to locate an ip address that's 666.553.343252.23423. They don't "zoom in and enhance". I was impressed by their accuracy.And not only technological accuracy. Socio-political accuracy as well. I love-hate this show. 
Everyone in my theater was silent afterward.  It was very strange, but I think everyone felt heavy.
Now Mark Zuckerberg is *everyone's* photo technician!
Robin Williams is typically light hearted a goofy in movies, especially since he is a career comedian. They probably walked into this not knowing to expect a different kind of performance, only to learn that Robin Williams is an extremely malleable actor that is extremely talented.I don't think people expected Robin to play such a creepy character, so they wrote it off as bad when really it's a fantastic movie.
I've bought a cheap Jacob's ladder and I agree they are surprisingly unsettling 
I've seen Jacob's Ladder, so I feel like I should never take a hallucinogen, because all that imagery is rattling around upstairs still just setting me up for a bad trip. 
Yeah, I'm not watching that... 
Kathy Bates nailed it. 
greeheeheasy
That's why it's so scary.. There's seemingly no motive for the killings. They just like to kill people!
Yes yes, Leatherface has no care about being caught or what will happen next after Sally tells the police about that messed up family.  He reacts like a child that was just trained to slaughter.  
The lack of actual gore is a testament to its genius. 
but none of the jump scares in that film feel like they were put in there just to make you jump, they feel more natural. More like "somebody kicked a door down in the corner and it startled me" vs "The camera panned around and suddenly there was a face right next to the camera and it screamed and I screamed, and everyone was screaming."
(Serious)Yeah, that's the closest any movie's come to switching its entire genre within a minute
I dunno, I'd marry me. I'd marry me so hard
The crawling around in the airduct Jumpscare is definitely up there...but it's not cheap. You kinda expect it to come.However, the worst part of the movie is when you know it's coming, and you can see it... 
It's why I bought a Vive.That and E:D
*inches closer*
Should have been Green Arrow
I love Tilda in it. She was fucking fantastic! I got stressed watching her driving around without saying anything.I am ambivalent about how I feel about her character though. I feel sorry for her but at the same time I feel like she demonised Kevin a lot. I'll stop here coz idk how to do a spoiler tag on mobile and I might reveal important plot points.
thank you. I even looked it up to make sure I got it right, and then immediately got it wrong.
To be fair, you may be thinking of one of the posters for it that does make it look like a comedy. My wifi is shit right now so I'm having trouble linking it, but it's the one where Tilda and JCR are sitting in what looks like a waiting room with the title above them in big block letters, which is a pretty common "comedy" style poster. 
I didn't know what it was about before I saw it.First half builds anxiety with touches of eerie and possible fantastic elements, and right after that scene, everything devolves to a rush of adrenaline. I love this movie.
Can you believe that bitch lied about which cave they were going to?  Fuck her!
It held up pretty well. Read the book. The book adds a lot of context to what the actual events are they talk about. A lot of regular normal people saw and experienced a LOT of weird stuff right before the bridge collapsed. The book is good if you like UFO mysteries. 
I was holding my ex's hand during that part. We both jumped a bit and recoiled. He ended up snapping my wrist. I sat through the rest of the movie with a broken wrist.
Scary and heart-breaking at the same time. This is what I want in horror movies. Scary with a story.
The film that The Others was based on, The Innocents (1961) is also excellent, loads of chilling scenes that just unnerve and really get under your skin. Zero jump scares, no blood and guts, just great storytelling. Think I watched the whole movie on YouTube, def worth checking out.
When he is slowly walking up the stairs "Wendy. Let me finish. I'm not gonna hurt ya. I'm just gonna bash yer brains in". And he slides between such an eerily calm delivery to growling and back again in a way that is some of the best acting I have ever seen.
Sesevenen 2: The Sesevenening
Okay, but don't you agree that it's way too good of a film to say it resorts to cheap jump scares? And the jump scares aren't what makes the film so scary imo
I haven't watched that movie in about 2 years but as soon as I read that line, I literally got chills running up my spine. 
It's October...you HAVE to watch it! ...again
Just re-watched this last night on a whim. And goddamn is that dog perfectly CREEPY.
Excellent point.  The blood jumping out of the petri dish is one of the most effective "jump scares" in the history of cinema, frankly.  
"*I* drew those posters."By the way, that's the guy who voiced Roger Rabbit. 
I love the part where a man offers to drive a woman and her baby to the next gas station. The expression of the woman after we see the reflection of the station passing by in the windshield is just genius.
Okay I've had the "making up a song about Coraline" part stuck in my head for like three days now 
the other-mother
It also didn't have that pointless boy character. Coraline did everything on her own (plus cat). There was no "eek save me" moment in the book. She tricked the hand and saved the day. And they left out just how long she was alone while her parents were kidnapped. That's every child's nightmare. 
I like the 80's horror movies (esp since when I was scared of any movie as a kid, my dad and I watched horror and action movies from the 80's to show me how funny they are without audio!), but I HATE movies like "The Hills have Eyes" specifically for the rape scene. I mean, c'mon. That movie was fucked up enough as it was, but adding a rape scene just disgusted me. 
It's even worse when he snaps out of it and realizes what's happening.
Yeah literally they made a jump scare out of a door opening in that movie. That pissed me off. Still very good at building the impending dread though. Their situation just gets worse and worse and worse. 
Wonderful movie!  I highly recommend another orphanage ghost story, The Devil's Backbone.  
There were two reactions I saw to that movie coming out into the parking lot.  One was "that was stupid " and the other was "can you walk me to my car? "  I was in the second group
That's the first completely silent jumpscare that scared the shit out of me.
THAT WAS THE BEST PART ! 
STDemon
> 2 of my friends - also grown ass men - had nightmares. Those weren't nightmares, they were memories of the abductions. 
I went it pretty much blind, and I'd definitely recommend people do the same. All you need to know is that it's a very, very tense movie - so be up for that.
The best part is that Goodman's character continues to complicate even after the movie's over. The reality of the situation, what he knew and what he thought he knew about it, what he knew and what he thought he knew about his "guests," there's the reveals about his past, his actions viewed through his mind, Mary Elizabeth's mind, and the viewer's mind...It's fuckin perfectly written, the best antagonist in a long time, and a masterclass in manipulating ironic distance
I was on edge expecting Goodman to dunk him face-first in the acid but no, *pop* and he was gone like that.
I think Goodman seeming like such a kind and gentle man only contributes to how menacing he seems in the movie.
Stephen Kings short story of 1408 scared the dogshit out of me.  It was just forty something pages.  But it was psychologically intense.  
No idea, but the way he stares does stand out.
That's the part that really fucked with me.  There are actual psychopaths out there.  This could happen to anyone.
Even sadder than Grave of the Fireflies?
Yeah, I made the mistake to watch *Threads* first. It made *The Day After* look quite upbeat, actually. (And yes, I'm serious. *The Day After* retains some optimism, comparatively.)
Kind of like Bryan Cranston. I spent the first few episodes of Breaking Bad wondering why Walt hasn't done anything dumb and goofy yet. 
Another one is "Final Cut". His SVU episode based on the Milgram Experiment was good too.
WHAT IS HAPPENING? Is it flipping? Flowing? FALLING?!?!? DAMN THIS MYSTERY OBJECT
There are two people in Hollywood who ruined themselves for future roles by playing a monster too well: Anthony Hopkins and Kathy Bates.
Also, in *The Shining*, the hotel and its ghosts are King's alcoholism.  Unlike in *Misery* though, he didn't realize this at the time.  He later said, "I was the guy who ~~had written~~ wrote The Shining without even realizing that I was writing about myself."
Fuckin right, boys.
You just sort of assume it's always sweltering in Texas, doesn't matter the time of year.
Oh, boy! Here I go killin' again!
Totally. One of these days he's going to hurt someone.
I expected to hate the TV series. But Mads did a great job concealing the monster that his character was with a serene and confident exterior. Some of the CGI and first season "Killer of the Week" stories weren't great, but overall it was FAR too good and high concept for network television.
That's what made Lecter scary. Not the fact that he could easily overpower most people without breaking a sweat. The fact that he *didn't need to*. The fact that, given enough time and the right environment, he could simply convince someone that it was a good idea to let him eat them.
> Starling is in control, barely. She is terrified but has to stay in control, if she looses herself to the fear she's done.This right here made Jodi Foster's whole performance. She did this throughout the film, keeping her face blank, and her voice steady, while showing the obvious signs of fear (swallowing, furrowing/twitching of brow) to those of us who knew what she was thinking. Really a stellar performance from her.
Perfect response
Dammit Monk, just put the lotion in the basket!
Yeah, that one is kind of just tying that whole scene together. You know he is gonna die, it's just up to the Alien to make its appearance at that point.
I honestly don't think I could handle playing that game with a Vive haha. It already gave we way too much stress. 
No sure how believable he would be with a blonde wig, glasses and super leet hacking skills.
that's because The Swintonator is a goddess among mortals
I can't imagine what it must be like to be in her shoes. Even from an incredibly young age Kevin seemed to know what he was doing in regards to how he was around his father, to make it look like the mother was always at fault.   Imagine the mental battle of "my child hates me" and "but he's only young so I must be mad."
It's fleshed out much better in the book. The book make you realize more why Kevin is how he is and his dynamic with his mother. I feel the movie went for the more classical mysterious monster for no reason type thing which is never the case in real life.
On subsequent watches you'll notice that a lot of the cave creatures are visible in the cave before the big reveal. Usually only partially or for a second, so they look like normal cave fauna to the unaware. Good movie. 
Wtf...
And *The Innocents* is the movie version of Henry James' *The Turn of the Screw*. Such a creepy, unsettling story.
Someone in a similar thread pointed out that Jack Nicholson doesn't blink at all during that scene, went back and watched it and got even more freaked out. Seriously creepy shit. 
Totally. That movie is so great at establishing a slow-burning sense of isolation and fear (and just a general feeling of "off-ness") so when the typewriter moment comes it's a perfect moment of true horror. Ugh, It makes me sick to think about it even now. 
Se7en 2: Ei8ht
Oh, yeah, of course. Its one of my absolute favourite 'slow burn' suspense movies.I guess I'm more just pointing out that even the best suspense movies like *Se7en* will have at least one jump scare, even though it was unnecessary to the vibe of the movie, IMO.It was the stuff you didn't see that horrified you. You had to imagine John Doe doing all these acts just based on the end result and crime scene photographs.
(doing my best Tina Belcher impersonation) Eeeehhhhhhhhhhh
From what I understand, that "dog" was acting like that because it was half wolf and in a terrified state. It was confused and scared, so it went into super quiet stealth mode.
Palmers face just before they test is fantastic. A resigned "Oh fuck."What's more terrifying that it's the Alien impersonating him so well it's got his goddamn mannerisms.
Yeah. They are frightening because something unexpectedly terrifying just happened. Not because the music swelled and a cat jumped out of a closet or some shit.
Steroids are basically magical when used safely.
Check out Kubo and the two strings if you haven't already. Made by the same studio and has a similar animation too. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^(The aunts are also pretty creepy)
In an interview, the guys who adapted it added the little boy so coralline wasn't just talking to herself the whole time. It made for a better movie, but the book was perfect
It caught me off guard. No jumpscares for the entire movie then one out of nowhere. 
I know every other form looked normal but for some reason the huge guy had like no eyes and it was terrifying
you get outta here with that
I've never felt so on edge watching a movie but absolutely enjoyed it. Perhaps one of the best recent movies out. Ending was a bit on the cheesy side but I still would recommend for others to see the movie.
Apology Accepted. 
She was an awesome heroine, I love how she wasn't a helpless idiot, like so many other women in these types of films. She actually used her smarts and figured out ways out of things.
Yes! the short story was crazy good. I was kind of disappointed with the movie adaptation though.
That's really weird, man. Who'd be into that kind of stuff?
Something different is Prisoners. He has a CRAZY stare in that. Basically hes a detective that is assigned to two missing girls case. Although it doesnt say it in the movie, you can tell his character is wired and barely has sleep. 
Had a friend argue that it ruined it for him. That there was no motive. I argued thats what made it horrifying. That there was no motive. Pure, unadulterated, opportunistic, random evil. 
That's not a bad thing to be traumatized about. The threat of nuclear war was serious business.
Well, he did decide to manufacture and distribute Meth, that's pretty dumb. 
Kathy Bates seems to have really found her niche in American Horror Story. Love all her AHS characters. 
Further, he laments that he does not remember writing the book Cujo. He was drunk throughout the entire writing of it
Canadian Trailerpark Massacre
I'll kill anyone!
That first season is some of the best television horror I've ever seen. They did a great job. 
There's a line from the Hannibal TV series that simply states "Hannibal doesn't use coercion.  He uses persuasion"
He was awesome in Shutter Island!
Alien: Isolation nailed it, but you'd kind of expect it to, considering.
Im a very nervous person,  started playing isolation twice,  had to quit both times due to frighth diarrhea.  The sound design in that game is horrifying
I actually lost sleep after watching that movie. It's so deeply disturbing. 
It sounds like something that will intrigue me while simultaneously fucking my head up, which is sadly the kind of thing I like to read 
Yes, but she chose and planned for her daughter. Kevin was instantly regretted from the moment she had sex without contraception. She was terrified when she found out she got pregnant from it. Her entire pregnancy was a completely different experience than with her daughter. Same with the birth.Reading the book gives so much more detail to her thoughts and feelings behind everything. I really recommend it. The movie was good, but the book just gives you so much more.
>normal cave faunaWhich is still fucking horrifying
From what I understand, that "dog" was half alien and bursting open. It was wanting to kill people, so it went into super splatter mode. 
I love the tension everyone else has too in that scene, implying some of them aren't even sure about whether or no they're the alien.
I read an interesting theory about the end when they sip the whisky...well, they filled all the other bottles with gasoline...and the thing has no idea what gasoline tastes like so takes a big swig and the guy next to him realizes who/what is next to him.The guy who posted it originally was much more compelling...it's been about 20 years since I saw the film and I'm not sure about the specifics.  An interesting read, though, if you look it up.
I wish I had personal trainers, physicians, and dieticians to show me how to do it properly :(
KUUUUUUU-BOOOOOOOO
I was devastated to find out Wybie was only in the film, but I understand his purpose and the fact that he's not needed in the book.
Does the ball hitting the bathroom window not count as a jump scare?
The It that appeared in her kitchen was the scariest to me. She was like pissing herself and missing teeth and she just looked wrong.
That film is so underrated. Hugh Jackman and Terrence Howard also give amazing performances in it.
I thought she was really funny on The Office too.
Bates' very next movie was Fried Green Tomatoes.  She was nothing but a sweetheart in that one.  Although she does go a little psycho in the parking lot hehe
I think cocaine was the bigger problem while writing Cujo iirc
Halifax Cheeseburger Massacre
I just love killing! 
I couldn't believe it was cancelled when they announced it, it had amazing reviews, just a small audience. 
"Seemed like a good idea at the time."
If you jack the brightness way up you'll see them in the background a lot easier.  This is true in Quarantine and the Friday the 13th films as well.
Absolutely. They caught that a brief amount in the fillings scene in the 2011 version... some of them clearly have that "How the fuck do I even know?!" look on their face (Chris Hulve sure does!)Naules at that point looks like he's just going to die regardless, the reactions and breakdown in the psyche of all of the guys is fantastic."Now, I understand you gentleman have been through a lot lately... but I'd rather not spend the rest of the winter TIED TO THIS FUCKING COUCH!"
"And the best actor award goes to.... THE THING!"*Explodes in a shower of blood and assimilates everything*
Me too, man.. I'm so heartbroken by finding out all my goal bodies were roiders telling me all I had to do was work hard.
His eyes changed depending on how he was interacting with reality. The reality he was facing was dependant on wether or not he was taking his medication. 
Paul Dano, too. He's always solid.
Indeed. Also water boy... She has that honesty that some actors have that even though I recognize her face, I don't have trouble seeing her as the character she's portraying. 
"I'm older and have better insurance". 
Dartmouth Cheeseburger Massacre 
Nothing that good and morbid lasts.
"I'm tired of these monkey fighting snakes on this Monday through Friday plane!"
Seriously though, these guys sold that tension. if this wasn't viewed by everyone at the time as one of those cheap special effects block busters these guys would probably have gotten awards for properly showing that tension and fear from this scene alone.
Then Tom Hardy comes along and says "i did steroids of course" Paraphrasing.
My wife and I always wait for the Paul Dano scenes where he gets the shit beat out of him.  *Prisoners*, *There Will Be Blood*, *12 Years a Slave*... Dano is always there to take a beating.
Vikki Vallencourt is da devil
Favorite line in a movie, ever. 
Cheeseburger Picnic Massacre
That we got three seasons of that show was a bloody miracle.
Do you see what happens when you FIND a STRANGER in the ALPS!?
In a way... I'm kinda glad they didn't? It'd a cult classic. If it'd have had a blockbuster we'd have got The Thing: Reloaded and the such. 
I have serious respect for people who are open about their steroid use. The deception and lies spread by "fake-nattys" disgusts me, though.
"I like Vicki, and she like me back! And she showed me her boobies and I like them too!" 
Someone pissed me off in the parking lot last week, and that scene immediately sprung to mind. I'm finally old enough that it's true. 
Mustard Tiger Massacre
Not really. I sneezed 30 minutes ago. Sorry.
individuals, maybe they would think it's odd after a couple days. But having that translate to a global understanding and acceptance is unfathomable.
You think this is funny but there are like 10 people with bleeding noses reading this and freaking out
In my entire life I have never seen a person that realizes they are about to sneeze race for a tissue.
Good in theory, but as a nurse most people in the hospital aren't really sneezing. My thinking is that a day care worker or elementary school teacher might notice it first. Or someone with a severe allergy to cats or something. 
/r/ShowerThoughts
that's what I'm saying man. 
That'd be good. At the end all of the soldiers put their weapons down as a sneezing man comes staggering out of the building. They weep.
This was my first interpretation of the question as well. You've got that tickle in your nose, but your body is powerless to take care of it. Your eyes are watering, your sinuses are stinging, every breath you take leads to a tiny prickle of pain... I think we'd notice pretty quickly.
I would realize pretty quickly because of this. With all the snow reflecting the sun in my face I'd be the savior who figures it out.
I am right there with you. Fuckin love it. Especially when you sneeze like 5 times in succession and your eyes water and your nose just goes numb, like you didn't even have one. 
...has anyone hiccuped?
I'm guessing he's anywhere from 5'5 to 6'3.
With an hour for a cat?
Same deal here. First time I walk out on a bright day, I'd know.
yeah, but everyone would have to believe them.
I'd say with social media and people writing about anything, it wouldn't take so long before it gets in the news. I'd say a week or 2.I can picture a bunch of people on twitter or facebook: "Wow fantastic, I haven't sneeze in days"Then slowly they would notice each other's comments. Then some not so important blogger would write about it. Then more and more important blogs would, then celebrities would come forward. And Bam! People listen to celebrities's shit. News start talking about it and people get scared. Studies starts around the world.
I can just imagine telling my grandkids about the golden sneezing days of yore.
So it started as of 15 minutes ago. 
I have been on this subreddit for a long time and I think this is my favorite comment I have ever read.
Gotta go to work, hired a PI to watch for sneezes. 
it'd take like a week max.  sick patients that sneeze no longer sneeze.  allergy sufferers no longer sneeze.  social media connects us all easily.  it would get noticed, go viral, and it wouldn't be hard to test the results.  i think you're looking at 3-5 days for the general global community to be aware.
I mean, there is literally people with conditions that make them sneeze constantly, if all of these people (idk how many there are) just suddenly stop, people are going to talk, not to mention tissues won't be sold, nurses around the world are bound to notice some weird shit is up. I think a week at MOST, for the civilized world to know about it. 
Yep, I'm one of them. WTF
We can confirm that /u/copious_hyperbole is dead to his lack of response.goodnight sweat princ
I have done this. It gets messy
Guys I think it's spreading, I just recovered from a nose bleed and I could've sworn I just hea
Y'all all need to lay off the blow a bit
They used to have a button you could just click but they changed that because "The Man" wanted them to use gold. Way to bow down to the establishment, reddit. You used to be cool, man.
No this am he the copius-hiperbowl. AM good. No worry. Must leave for exkuse reason. Bi forever!
I do this all of the time
Thank you, I was trying to think if I was crazy or not because I don't think I've seen someone sneeze into a tissue.  Maybe some old timey, 3 piece suit wearing guys who sneeze into their cloth handkerchief, and then use it to wipe their mouths and eyes.  Gross.  
Yeah, it would definitely be all the people with allergies first
Well, *someone* is bound to overreact though.  *This lack of sneezing is mentioned indirectly in Revaluations! The end is upon us!*
It's actually identical to the last season of Torchwood... But with death instead.
They could hire people to pretend to sneeze.
/r/ShowerQuestions
I haven't smoked in weeks and I feel like I've got a contact high from that question
I think you're lying because I can't remember the last time I sneezed. OP is clearly a rogue government scientist that has decided to tell everyone the top secret research that governments perform to maintain control of the world.
I can't wait to see the cinematography for that.  A 10 minute long shot of Clive Owen walking with someone sneezing and everyone staring. 
Same here.  I think that's how it would work.  People with allergies would realize within a couple days, comment on it to other people, other people would start going "you know, I haven't sneezed in a while either" and word would spread until it became clear.
How do you know that wasn't the last sneeze ever? You could have been the last person to sneeze.

I found the sneeze fetishists.
I had the hiccups a couple hours ago, sorry. 
I read this without noticing the exclamation mark. "I wish, at least once a year, I have a horribly painful hiccuping episode.
Playing safe with averages and a range, I see. /u/Dudwithacake, I'm going all in with 5'3.
It's an actual observed phenomenon called photic sneezing, or Autosomal dominant Compelling Helio-Ophthalmic Outburst (ACHOO) syndrome. (I'm not making that up.) It's not well understood, but it affects 18-35% of the population and can be genetically inherited.Source: the totally credible sources that the Wikipedia page uses. Also, my nose.
He's a government shill. It's a coverup
I just keep thinking about what it'd be like trying to explain sneezing to my kids. "Daddy tell us again what it was like, in the before-time.""Well, kids, your nose would feel kind of funny for a second, then there'd be like, a nose-explosion that you can't control, and you sometimes involuntarily made a sound like, 'achoo,' and then you just went on with your day.""And what caused it?""Cats, for some people. Pollen. Too much pepper. Sexual arousal, for one guy I knew in high school."
Your nose, of all noses, shouldn't be bleeding! *Oh God it's happening.....*
Mine was bleeding a bit earlier, but I think that was because I accidentally inhaled some powdered benzoic acid in the lab earlier. Hasn't bled since, so it hopefully killed any eggs that were in there.

We can still blow our noses, you know.
And on desk walls.
The worst is when the tissue box starts getting low and the tissue falls inside the box.Then when you have to sneeze you have be like a fucking ninja to reach inside the box, carefully lift off the next sheet, and pull it back to your face with 1-2 seconds. Anything less than perfection results in grabbing a whole stack of tissues, flipping the tissue box across the table, and sneezing all over your arm.
But who has kleenex always within reach?
"Huh, that's funny, I'm *not* miserable right now. Something's not right..."
And his time to shine would come. He would be world famous, and die surrounded by loved ones and admirers.

They would, but lacking the ability to sneeze, while annoying, isn't life threatening. So while they'd notice, it'd be slower, as developed countries tend to have a higher availability of care and they're likely to have more important things to worry about than lack of sneezing.Not being able to sneeze would be odd, but when you've still got epidemics of TB and Polio, then it's pretty low down the list of things that you report to the WHO.

I've been sneezing all day because I caught a cold, but now I'm not sneezing anymore. I could get used to this whole no sneezing thing.

That's a bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see if it pays off for 'em.

Which is why you laughed at it.
The sled in the middle of the room was the jigsaw killer the whole time too.
No don't have your girl sneeze while giving head. The end result is not pretty.
Hahah, I've done that too. I think what makes us look even more like fools though is when we're out in public and randomly start making faces at the sun. At least I can explain myself if I've told someone to look at the sun XD Although they don't usually believe me, so I guess I do still look like a fool lol

Wait...*sneezes* okay now 
we need to start /r/nosneeze as a place to post that you just sneezed. that way, if you're ever unsure, you can check the subreddit to make sure that the world is still sneezing.
DAE remember sneezing? Fuck I'm old.
As now, do we.
I have something very similar but it happens when I'm thinking about making a sexual advance. It's very specific, I can imagine sexy stuff and nothing happens but if I'm lying in bed and I get the idea to make a move on my wife some wire crosses and I sneeze and I hate it.

They are both symbolic numbers. 7 is a sign of completion or fulfillment, and 40 is a sign of renewal or cleansing. There are a lot of symbolic numbers in the bible. 7, 12, 40, 3, 6, 50, 10 and others.

I think this is the real answer to the thread. It'd probably take about 3 hours for the public to notice and the realization to spread that more and more people are riding the edge of glory in sneeze-limbo.  Maybe, ten minutes in the hospitals and schools for the nurses and teachers to notice every other person with a sinus affliction all complaining together that the sneezes just won't come. This would make a weird movie. 
never thought I'd see those particular 3 words in 1 sentence.
The boy was dead. Elisha brought him back to life (or, more accurately, God through Elisha).It might be worth noting that there are lots of sexual connotations in Hebrew that could be used in this context (and are used elsewhere in the Bible....like when Ruth lays at Boaz's "feet"). This is not one of them. "Stretched across someone" is not a sexual term. 
If Man is five, and the Devil is six, then God is seven.

Yep, Confirmed HL3, picture Lord Gabe sitting at his desk writing dialog for the game windows open listing to Born Free, all of a sudden he has a sneeze attack and sneezes all of his work on HL3 out the window. Now before you have a stroke, know this cant happen now because we are free of sneezing.

Yes, but now you can join the ranks of the photic vanguard and be forever vigilant...watching and waiting for the day when the sneeze stops.

Oh no, it's worse than we thought. Humans aren't losing the ability to sneeze, our governments are simply cleansing away all those who do sneeze. E* we're all done in now, I just sneezed. I only hope the underground resistance is able to carry on the fight we died uncontrollably blinking for. 
yeay girls don't sneeze

He probably thought you were going for his cheek and missed. 
Did you expect him to leave you hanging?
He was probably hiding his boner
Speaking from experience, odds are he probably got hurt a lot in life. I've had people flirt with me as a joke (and I knew it was a joke because she'd rejoin her friends, point, & laugh). That kind of treatment can build up and really damage your confidence and self-esteem.
The Gentleman!!
The only hint that is actually foolproof. Well done.
To be honest, I'd think you were kidding unless I was your SO. It would be too awkward to walk in on you showering and be wrong. 
At least you seem like a really polite guy.

You: *post a photo of you pet doing something silly*Him: "Hey remember that time you let me touch your boobs?"

The arm thing is too subtle tbh. It could just be you being clumsy. Yesterday a girl I was sitting next to touched my arm three times in about a minute and the first two I thought might have been on accident, but the third time I said "what's up?" And she said that it was an accident. So yeah :/
I think you may have gotten rejected
Sometimes Netflix and chill just means Netflix and chill... Doesn't it? ...Shit!
I dunno man. I had a lady friend visit me in a different country while I was working abroad, share a bed with me for two weeks, and practically act like a wife with me. I told her I was into her and when I directly asked her if there was anything going on between us she said no. 
Nah, she doesn't think you're stupid. She's disappointed, but people are pretty familiar with the dangers of dipping your pen in company ink. You're not an idiot. The opposite really. Just keep her in mind if either of you leaves the company! 
Actually I think that one might work.
It's ok...I can literally invite my husband to get in the tub with me, and he doesn't get it. Sigh..
...poor girl, that's like the ultimate rejection. JFC man
Good on ya. Always cut that shit off immediately
A girl in college asked me to study with her at her apt. At some point, she brought up PornHub and pulled it up on her computer. She said, "Omg! all these girls have weird nipples! Like who has nipples like that?!" I was confused af because I thought they were just normal. A few minutes later, I was like "ooh! Let me show you some of my favorite videos" She got super pissed at me and started calling me a creep. I got pretty defensive and eventually went home. Years later I realized that she was trying to show me her boobs.....
Well, did you?
You got zucced. But the only thing that got wet were your eyes. 
Honestly, good on you for not assuming. 
Her : I want to have sex with youMe : Thanks.
Fire is much more effective at keeping warmth than cuddles. That man's a keeper.

also as a guy, its hard to tell to what extent that hint goesfrom a simple "i think you're a cool person and we should be friends"to a "you're pretty attractive and i wouldn't be opposed to having a relationship"to "perform intercourse with me"to "im being polite and keeping the party vibes up, but to be honest I am indifferent to you."its hard man. i can barely read books

Why'd you see his dong 
Have you ever known a guy who assumes every girl is into him? Like a girl looks at him when trying to get around him and he thinks she was checking him out? No one wants to be that guy.
Can't stress this point enough. Be blunt about it, we have all the time for that cute flirty hint shit when we're dating. Still remember back in the day when a girl in school I was talking to said "nah I've got you" after I asked about who she was seeing(keep in mind I wasn't thinking about any relationship). Still has me thinking wtf these years later.
That would be my response if some girl kissed me at all even if we were the only people in the vicinity. "The light post is right there did you mean to kiss that?"
What is holding hands but a really slow drawn out high five anyway?
I can just imaging that happening to JD, hilarious

She needs to take the guy's advice and just be straightforward about it.

It's this entire thread in three minutes.

Thanks! I have so many more... I love my boyfriend, but you really need to hit that guy over the head repeatedly with boobs before he realizes you want to have sex.
If only you would have just pulled his dick out and started sucking it we wouldn't have to play these silly games.
Having been in exactly that scenario in high school, I just started repeating "think unsexy thoughts" out loud over and over, it made her laugh
Panic seems to be responsible for many of these stories going no where, but I panic too so I get it. 
GRAB US BY THE DICKS!
Aaaaaand, she's married. Don't worry fellas! Another one will come along!
I hear you. I've had bad landlords too. Unfortunately in this particular instance...our landlord was pretty great. 
I looked in replies to find out why she was adopting out her dogs. 
That's pretty solid confidence. "Yeah I could do better than that and I don't even need to prove it."
I did this for shits and giggles to a friend's dog instagram. I sure hope that dog doesn't get the wrong idea.
That's too logical. Get outta here.
And women blame us for being oblivious. We are, but still...
I mean, it kinda does. I do notice the contract, but just take it as any other accidental contact.
This has been Late Night Dating Tips, with Reddit, thanks for joining us.
Seriously, I've turned girls down before by feigning ignorance like this, that's what I assumed when I read it. It lets you avoid flat-out rejection and makes them think you're just a clueless guy, and lets you avoid sleeping with them.
Yes, Netflix and chill is what I do when my husband takes the baby out for the afternoon and I'm home alone.
And with that all my previous suspicions have evaporated. Any and every conversation I was presently considering to have had sexy ulterior motives was actually just normal friendly conversation.

No you want to beat IN the bush
Yep, that's my husband. I've tried being coy and he picks up on it like 30% of the time. I've gotten to the point where I just say "Wanna go fuck?" rather than being coy. Works like a charm.

GODDAMNIT ANDREW SHES TRYING TO BE MYSTERIOUS AND SHIT FIND IT YOURSELF
A surprising number of these are young men unsure what constitutes consent, and young women unsure how to grant consent in a way that doesn't disturb the sexual tension. It's almost as if the sexes have trouble clearly communicating their needs and desires to each other because of some unspeakable chasm.
To be fair the automatic assumption that the girls in these stories are desirable may be wrong. I've had signs where the girls version is probably me being super dense and in reality I can read the signs clear as day but am not interested so without needing it to be awkward I play dumb and head out. 
Me: Hahaha. Sure you do. 
Worked out?  She has him captured and tranquilized!
Teach a man to cuddle and he'll fuck for one night. Teach a man to fire and he'll fuck for life. 
Seriously. She said jump and he built a plane, overachiever in my mind.
Yup yup yup, she's probably amazed at my fire building mad skillz.   Wait, she's not smiling. Why is she staring at me? Oh shit. Did I take too long to build a fire? Is the fire not big enough? Is it TOO big? That must be it. Oh nonononono. She thinks I'm a wood wasting blockhead.  I blew it. I'm never gonna get a girlfriend. Dude life sucks. I gotta go play counterstrike.*storms out of the chair into the night...*
Can confirm, as I'm now realizing that I was in the same scenario not long ago and chose to painstakingly gather tinder and fire making materials, start and maintain a fire, and miss every hint she dropped. 5/7 would burn shit again
*Build fire, demonstrate worth. Perhaps then female* will *be attracted to me.*
At least you're a go-getter. Don't beat yourself up...
It's when the woman is staring at the man thinking "kiss me", and the man is wondering "do I have something stuck between my teeth?"
Mine and my boyfriend's code in public is, "Wanna watch Predator?"
Yea...that's a terrible hint, tbh. That would basically be screaming to me that it was a joke and to turn around/look away/give privacy.
Seriously. Who chose the movie? If she chose Saw, knowing the intention was sex, that's kind of alarming.
Ass spaghetti
MICHEEL HOW ABOUT I COME INSIDE FOR A CUP OF NIIIIICE, HOOOOOT COFFEE?!*youre a wonderful man nico, tell me wonderful things!*
Coffee at 3am is not coffee, coffee at 3am means sex!
X gon' give it to ya
"So where are you sleeping tonight?" totally sounds like she's making sure you have plans to sleep somewhere else. If a friend is drunk at your place and you want them gone before they crash there, you would ask, "So who's driving you back home?"
Vagina
There's no way to tell. Maybe she's just being polite?
I would've taken it as a diss.>I haven't had sex in two years!>Oh that sucks, but I'm not gonna help you out with *that* hehehe>feelsbadman.jpg
Hahaha, I have an SO now so that's a ship long sailed...I also wouldn't know how to find her if I wanted to. Last I heard from our mutual friend, she went to Asia to teach English.
Im laughing way to hard at this
Yeah, she could have made a move. Just enjoying someones company is not a clear mating signal.
Dont worry. I can mostly read books, and I havent really figured it out either.
Seriously. Most of the times guys think "she's totoally hitting on me/giving me a sign." But we're afraid of being wrong and looking like an ass. 
It's almost like some guys  didn't get the hint
We had sex twice, I guess he didn't understand all I wanted was more sex later on 
I don't see it as a mistake. It's a preventative measure against a mistake. Showing up to what you think is a date only to discover other people are there makes you feel like shit. 
Classic strategy, can't spot a tent in motion.
GIRL ON THE BUS BARELY HAD ANY IN HER HAIR
"So she's sucking my dick and I'm here thinking, 'Does she like me, or...'"
Okay then that's a missed hint
thanks, now it makes sense
He didn't know he could do it doggy style so you could both watch X-Files
I mean c) you really can't tell, she could be just reminding you that her hints weren't really hints at all, and that you made the right decision by choosing to go home instead. Like it was said, she could have been just being nice and it's always best to just keep your wits about you.
I have literally dragged my husband by his penis to the bedroom. He's pulled my hair. It's been a fun 10 years.
My first time I swear the entire time up until we were actually fucking, and I mean up until I was balls deep I doubted she wanted to actually have sex and thought it was just some joke and she would stop joking before I did. Welp, neither stopped joking for 3 years after that. 
I used to have bad landlords. I still do, but I used to, too.
Or it sounds like he interpreted it as previous boyfriends couldn't last more than two minutes into *Aliens*, the filthy casuals.
He's a good dog, bront. 
I dunno... I've seen the movie Carrie. People be evil.
I hate that. Or when you're deep in thought, staring into space and you realize that you are looking right at some girl and it's awkward
We have a code now. "Want to take a nap?" The problem now with two kids, one a newborn, is I'm never quite sure if we are going to sleep or have sex until we get to the bedroom. Usually we have a nap and then have a nap.
Damn that ant died and you didn't even get any 
That'll do it.
idk she might just be being polite
It's not even denseness, just a failure to properly escalate. Dollars to donuts says they picked up on it but thought "There's no way, she's just being nice or goofy or whatever".
Every time I say "nope, no way she's actually hitting on me", I think back to the days when I would take advantage of the slightest hints and end up embarrassed and rejected.
**HAHAHA YOU MUST BE SO EMBARRASSED!** 
This exactly. Girls are still under the impression that the guy is just supposed to "act" on his urges and make a move. I've always been worried that I will cross some line that I didn't see thinking I was getting "make a move" signals. Girls, if you want to give signals do something physical like touching his hand or taking his arm. We will 100% get the signal if it's physical rather than verbal.
Lol not falling for that again. Where's the camera this time?
/r/absolutelynotmeirl
I think that's for the best. He needs supervision.
But what if you're not good looking but can build an amazing fire?!
That, or he sucks at making fires
Nail on thl3 head
I knew my LV. 99 fire making skill would one day come in handy [EDIT]: and then you can wrap her in your skill cape to keep warm [EDIT2]: wow, first time getting gold, thanks. May Saradomin forever guide your path:)
*light man-self on fire*
Ok so I think I've understood the "kiss me eyes" finally. When I feel awkward that they are staring at me I should kiss them 
Me and my girlfriends code is "Wanna go to the garage?" Because the first night in my bedroom she said, "So this is your bedroom?" And I said, "No this is my garage."
Noooo, but she had the "kiss me" eyes...
As a military man, most of my 0300 coffees don't mean sex.They sure feel like it though.
That or it's just a really fucking weird question.All these responses, why the fuck don't they just go "hey wanna fuck?"
60% of the time,  it works every time
Damn Canadians
You drove her off the continent!
Probably because you smerked a jernt.As an aside: it reminds me of Hyperbole and a Half's Spaghatti Naadle.
Look at you, Mr. Fancy Pants. I saw a book once. I've never even been close to figuring it out as well. 
I don't think he was the one missing the hint there
All of you are too nice. Where were you all when I was trying to get into standup? ;)
"She's probably just being nice, probably feels bad for me or something. It doesn't mean anything."
WHEN I SPECIFICALLY ASKED YOU NOT TO?
This isn't even a hint though!! It's a very blatant request. How??
You're 100% sure he got the hint? Some of these comments are making me wonder if that was enough.
"Wow she's putting a condom on me, her commitment to a bit would make Don Rickles proud!" 
Good scenario: the girl's into you and you have a date to prom. Better scenario: a bucket of pig's blood drops onto you and you develop psychic powers.Win win.
Oh god this is too familiar. You space out and come back to the wtf look. 
Do you nap first? Or nap first?
To all the ladies that have made it to this point in the thread - welcome to the reason why we missed your hints. Bc if this isn't "the hint," then I'll never think anything else is. 
Maybe she's from Canada
...guilty of this. When in doubt, I default to this.
Well, yesterday I told a good guy friend of mine that I wanted to have sex with him. Just straight out. He was really surprised but hey, guess who got laid today?
Find yourself a blind partner.
He had to chop down a tree and split it into logs first.
r/unexpectedrunescape
Mate you don't kiss the eyes. You're not ready for this at all.
"FIGHT OR FLIGHT"
Here in my garage...
Healthcare worker. Coffee time is literally anytime. 
What did you say about me?
"there ain't no dick here for me - I'm out"
I was born illiterate. I hadn't seen the printed word until I was already a man!
Yeah you really cant tell in this situation. Shes probably just canadain and beig polite.
DO YOU KNOW THE PHYSICAL TOLL THREE VASECTOMIES HAS ON A MAN
Sex happened so either he got the hint or just said "fuck it" and decided since the kids were outside and we were in the bedroom, why the hell not? Haha
Well, from what I learned from others, it may have backfired more on her than on me. After I rejected her she got back with her boyfriend, and they dated for a few years. I'm not sure if they were together when he was arrested. She and her best friend stopped talking at this time too. I don't know if it had anything to do with me. I never told anyone about this incident. My thinking was that it was better that I lose my chance with her best friend than jeopardize their decade long friendship by trying to defend myself. There were plenty of other girls out there.  
You Aladeen first.
Think I might need to take a trip to Canada.
Or "there's no way she's serious. Clearly she's joking and if I respond genuinely she'll think I'm creepy."
Probably Chris Evans 
Had to dry it out, chip some kindling 
PUNCH HER IN THE EYES!
Got my 47 lamborghinis
Eh Buddy
She's probably just sucking my dick so she doesn't have to tell me what a loser I am.
Married, with kids, pulled to bedroom by dick where you guys then have sex."But is she *really* into me? I just can't tell!"
Be the change you want to see. *raises arms above head and whirls tongue*
You're not wrong
Thanks
I watched my own vasectomy, it was interesting. I was more concerned about the nurse...who I  went to high school with and hadn't seen since.It was a bit awkward. 
My MIL passed away suddenly a few years back and I ended up being the one to go through her things for donations because my husband and SIL were too emotional. I found 2 whole drawers of sex toys and homemade porn that went straight into a trash bag and into the dumpster. Never told my husband.  
How did you do? 
At first I thought they were just super chill and open about this whole thing. Like I imagined it was 10am and you were helping a customer find some Code Geass manga and they just wanted everyone to check out their work. 
lol when my dad was in the US Army in the 60s he was stationed in Germany for a year and on more than one occasion they'd load up a missile in to the back of his truck and he'd drive it by himself to another part of the Country. All he had was a sidearm. I think security was really lax back then.Fun fact, he learned to drive in Germany in the US Army. Didn't have a drivers license or anything. They just handed him keys and he started driving around. He was irritated when he eventually got back to the States after a few years deployed and had to take the drivers test.
Fuckin mad eye moody at it again
So I'm assuming as an 8 or 9 year old, you didn't know it was weed.. so when did you figure it out exactly?*15 years later, in bed sleeping...*You: . . .You: . . .You: . . *WAKES UP* IT WAS POT
She could have been saying "it would fucking suck if I framed you as a serial cheater"
**DID YOU FUCK MY MOM, SANTA?**
Please tell me that they are on different sides of the family
"Damnit Britney, your sex doll cost us *another* sale!
You and your friend were going to take a dump together. Damn. Friendship goals.
ayyyy hell yea gramps you hit dat brah i'm out
Sex in the outdoors is awesome, just don't forget the blanket.
Not as hard as the work she was getting
He wanted you to find it, so you could get a raise.What a bro!
> and intercepted my mom who would have freaked out.Such a good wingman for your aunt's boyfriend.
I found my mom's vibrator as a kid. She told me it was a neck massager. I still cringe everytime I remember this memory. Btw, worst neck massager ever. 
My parents never allowed me to watch Ed Edd and Eddy. They said bad words like "stupid".
Goddamnit Cyril!
I have a similar experience where my mom refused to admit that Santa wasn't real. She had made the "To:" and "From:" labels on her computer to avoid us comparing "Santa's" handwriting to hers, but she accidentally left the program up when we came down the next morning. She insisted that Santa had used her computer. 
> my dad still likes to bring it up at Christmas dinner.Your father is a strange man.  My daughter walked in on my wife and I once when she was about 10.  I have not ever mentioned it to her.  And we double check to be certain the door is locked, now, too.
That's so fucking cool.  
That's when you show him some nudes of your girlfriend so it won't be awkward
Sysco. Cisco makes Networking shit. 
Well, thanks for giving all of us that mental image, I guess
Aww fuck man, sorry to hear 
And a lifelong love of leather jumpsuits.
That must have been really tough. Glad she's still alive. Hope things got better for your family.
This reminded me of the time I pulled off some mission impossible level shit (at least to teenage me) with my dad.  I put the slightest amount of some face cream I found in the bathroom -- not oily, but left the faintest residue -- on the TV remote buttons, and got him to put in his pin # to unlock his blocked channels on the cable box for me.  I could see his fingerprints on the buttons and later while unsupervised, used that to figure out his code.
Similarly, Chris Pratt placed an order with us and i have his gmail address. i actually had looked the order up when i was investigating fraudulent purchases. People put in fake names sometimes. Sure enough, the address the package was going to was some huge mansion place so i deemed it not fraud. The email address is actually kind of funny, I'm sure he made it himself. No, I won't give it to any of you so don't ask. 
That's some Jason Bourne level shit for a middle schooler.
To think bank robbers in movies lay these really elaborate plans to get into vaults, and then it turns out they could just go in early and see the combination for themselves
Well, at least they all were getting along.
That sounds exactly how my mom died.   Staring up still me, then looking up beyond me, focused on something that only she could see.   And then, the life left her and I could see that...like a light turning off.
For some reason I absolutely think Ted Kennedy was f'ing with your teacher...totally a planned joke to freak out your teacher... I grew up with a very Irish Dad..the bullshit never ends
Usually? So this was a habitual thing, and you didn't make a point to avoid it?
You the real MVP 
Hope it was the Aunt on your mom's side
I looked it up. It wants me to confirm my city, with the only option being Detroit. Then it asks for my email. No explanation or details are given. I'm too scared to proceed any further.
this one's kinda cute and not completely horrible compared to the others in this thread.  the same thing happened to me when I woke up when my dad was putting coins under my pillowcase and taking the teeth for the tooth fairy away.
this is my favorite thing in the whole thread
Who has sex in their parents house with an unlocked door?!?! That's protocol number 1 for sex in the folks house rookie!!!!!!
Then what happened?
Nowadays you can just search on Goggle for nip slips.
Do you still have them?
Multitasking.
For the sake of my own sanity I'm choosing not to believe this.
Hahahaha that's fantastic. Teach you to accelerate your child learning! 
Did you say that not knowing it was true?
The one I used to have - she was about 26. Unfortunately being 8 meant I couldn't fully 'appreciate' what I'd just seen (if I was 14 man that would have been some beautiful dream). 
as someone who for several years could only afford to heat my house when my daughter stayed over, I know how awful it can be. Hope things are better for you, I'm lucky enough to be alright financially now
You're a kind soul
Top 3 :)
Best administrative assistant ever.
He robbed the Mob and kept his job
The peasant! *At the diner...*He didn't pay his check.
I'd guess it was trees. Possibly a makeshift arboretum of sorts... 
I don't think I was. She had a good 30 years on me, and never implied anything before or after.
Yeah honestly I'm rooting for Team Dad here. I feel like it's a team effort in making sure he gets that nut.
Or she was inviting him to dinner at Chuck N' Ducks
My best friend in my early twenties married his cousin.
"I taught gym back in the day. There were these two students in my class who were really strange and never left each other's side. One day, I was taking my lunch break (generally had to eat and shower at the same time because I don't have much of a break) when the weirdos come walking in together. They looked up to no good (they were about to head into the same stall), and it was especially odd because there were no gym classes during this period. I told them they weren't supposed to be there, and they got wide-eyed like I caught them doing something they shouldn't be and ran away."
And that's what he did.
Yep, at family parties I regularly go up to my bathroom to smoke a bowl with various family members / friends. So if going into the bathroom with someone implies we fucked then I am one incestual whore of a man. 
I was like 9 so I was more scared about getting in trouble
> I made eye contact with the guy, and he started cracking up.
Damn, I'm very sorry that you had to witness that.I morbidly think of how different/better/worse life would have been had she succeeded. My own mentality aside, if it weren't for her, I would have never come to America, but because of her she has single-handedly ruined my (half)brother's childhood, and in a way I basically had to raise a kid at 12 years old while keeping her bat-shit crazy ass away from him as much as I could. Families are fucking weird man haha.
I appreciate it. But in the following years I will have learned that my mom is severely emotionally unstable, which helped me rationalize that incident and put it behind me.
It's like when Daryl gets Michael to ask for a raise cuz they make almost the same amount 
He let me ride his 4 wheeler
Did your parents also have to check parental reviews online before you watched anything?Yeah, I got made fun of a lot for that.
Veteran here. VA mails me pills in an opaque ziploc bag with adhesive instead of the zip mechanism. No padding, easily tearable (thats how you open it), and is just loose bottles of pills shaking around inside.
This is true of ANY company, not just FedEx. HR is there to protect the company, not the employees.
When I was a PA I used to get sent spreadsheets from everywhere from my Manager which I then had to send out to the wider team. I always checked for hidden columns but also learned about hidden tabs. One time I almost sent out a spreadsheet to the wider team which had performance feedback per person and their ratings from their Manager and their peers. All this information was in a hidden tab. That could have been so damn messy. Silly HR.
That was literally my first thought
That was in the past two weeks 
Your cat was definitely the leader of a cult
Haha. That reminds me of my brother who almost did the same. He found a pack of condoms in my dad's old jacket(coincidentally he was looking for chewing gum too) and he started blowing or filling them with water. When my mom came home he started asking why would they hide balloons from him.
She was a habitual condom chewer.
That's the true power of boobs
It's a hard job with a boner
I saw on this show that they were some kind of modified Blackhawk that allowed them to be much more quiet
"Hey, your daughter makes that same face! Lemme see if I have a pic..."
and then what happened
Yep! That is basically what happened to me except he pulled up the wrong folder on his computer so it was a lot of pics. It wasn't like it was a normal nude either. It was pretty raunchy pics too. She is a great lady and I tried not to think differently of her, but just will never get that image out of my head. She is very attractive so I guess that's a plus at least.  
Sounds like he became awesome at that moment.  Plenty of kids wouldn't have given a fuuuck and been mad about it,
Shit man there are some days when I wonder how I'm able to feed and clothe myself
And a hunger for a hand-formed hamburger with two slices of wonder bread.
you're not the only one. i found one written by my sibling from when they were very young. still really messes me up. i hope things are alright with you and your family, solidarity and all that 
> Was it real spies or just dodgy companies?Or just a married couple trying to spice things up.
That would explain the glory holes. 
I've wondered if that's how they hire new spy recruits
I did something similar as a kid with an iPod touch. I wiped the screen clean before handing it over and could see the general directions their fingers were going but not the screen. When I got it back I could see the fingerprints and got the password in a couple tries. Felt like such a badass at the time, haha.

Innocent?  This is a hacker/cracker in the making.
Can you send him my nudes?
I must not tell lies...
Though I'm Australian I was born on Papua New Guinea. A little while ago I couldn't find my birth certificate anywhere so I rang the hospital in PNG where I was born and gave them my name and DOB and my parents name. With little fuss I was just told to wire them $70 and they'd send me a copy. I then realised how easy it would be for me to steal someone else's identity either living or dead. 
We had the same friend group so it got passed on to them pretty quickly that I saw them. Those friends had my back and also stopped hanging out with them, which was nice.
Yeah, who cares about sanctions when you can just send assassins to clean up the problem?
Yeah.
They usually don't realize it when you are hiding in a bush.
*nice*
I'd seen it all
You have to be quite early to be 5 years old.

Lots of alcohol that night. And lots of denial in the morning
*Alarm clock goes off*"Oh boy, 3 A.M!"
Well of course, do you take my family for being savages or something?
I don't know if she knows, but everyone is still married so I suppose she don't know. For all I know I'm the only one who knows what happened that night since its not unlikely they where all blackout drunk.
Im still waiting.
Sassy attacked him?
You bet your ass
I believe the F-117 was responsible for a number of UFO reports before the government acknowledged its existence. 
Personally speaking, I was never to have my bedroom door closed growing up unless I was changing. Didn't matter what age I was. My mom threatened to remove the door when I wanted peace and quiet once and I had it closed. I actually live with my future in-laws currently and at first it weirded me out, because they give us *all* the privacy and don't bug us for shit. They don't come to our room whatsoever. We could probably die in there and they'd have no idea until our bodies started smelling.
A really nice pic of our team holding a tournament trophy
He's not wrong though!Edit : I mean he isn't wrong about sex being natural, not hugging your grandson with your dick that was just pulled out of your grandma... There...
I hope not.
 Only he's allowed to goggle 16 year old nipples.
No kidding. There are so many logs generated for that. If it ever comes out, it is going to be pretty easy to find out it was you.
Efficiency
I do, what a cunt. Did you manage to get some money off him?
That's sociopathic. I couldn't handle an affair to begin with, you have to be mentally fucked up to manage basically 3 families plus girlfriends.I knew a guy kind of like this, family friends. They had a normal life, big house in the OC, 2 kids, etc. Their life blew up 4-5 years back because he had another house and 6 kids with a woman 50 miles away. How the fuck...
Yeah I'd rather anyone I know see me naked than have them know some of the shit I've gotten off to in weird moments. 
You are correct. Source : am woman. 
I've been the same for the past 4 years, I only put the heat on when she was with me, which isnt that often. For the past few weeks I haven't heard from her. I called her mother and she says "she doesn't want to go to your house to be cold and bored anymore". 
For real. I'd have waited outside the door to see shit hit the fan. 
Emperor's New Groove never gets old
Nah dude, you missed out on Greece. 
I'll do you one better. A friend of mine and his wife MET at a family reunion. Cousins. Same last name. Everything. I think they are at least 3rd or 4th cousins. But woah. 
I love happy endings
I'm sorry this has happened to either of you. I can't imagine what walking in on any of that would be like.
Haha he told Michael to ask for raise because Darryl himself asked Michael for a raise at which point he'd make more than Michael. One of my favorite episodes.
My younger cousin wasn't allowed to watch Spongebob, either. His mom was fucking insane, and one of her rules was "inoffensive words instead of swears are just as bad." She said "what the heck" was just as bad as "what the fuck." Spongebob used "barnacles" like an expletive, so it was banned 
What do you mean by hidden tab? A hidden sheet in the spreadsheet??
A hooker a day keeps the wife away
We had a cat like this in our neighbourhood, a big, white, haggard looking thing. Found him meowling outside my house when my cat went in heat, looked out and there's like 15 fucking male cats on my lawn behind this big badass motherfucker like "send out the wench, human". She gave birth to a couple white kittens a few months later. 
I found my mothers dildo and thought it was a big finger. Ran around the house screaming at people and pointing my "big finger" at them. 
Can we talk about how good those condoms taste? And how often they break?
"No, sorry, that's your wife again... hang on... I have your daughter here too."
If my research is correct they then had a threesome. 
Do we get a fight to the death now?
to be fair, kids don't get that spoiled on their own
Instead I just feed and loathe myself.
Thanks for saying that. I hope your sibling has recovered? My mother ended up pretty unhappy the rest of her life, unfortunately. She died ten years ago and I think she really wanted to go. If nothing else, I tried to not make the same mistakes with my kids as she did with me.

You go in the stall and say the secret password, "bumblebee." A dick slowly emerges from the hole in the stall. There is writing on it. You begin sucking, and slowly some of the writing wipes away from your effort, leaving only the permanent marker behind and revealing your next target.
"But dad I can't read this mess""I FUCKING KNEW IT YOU'RE A SYNTH"
In which case more power to them.  It's like a red team/blue team but at home.  I expect responsible disclosure though no telling your brother/sister until 30 days after you've told me how you did it.
Chris Pratt is such a nice friendly guy, he'll probably send you a box of chocolates and flowers."Nice dong buddy, but I'm happily married. May your whang find a friendly hole some day."
lol that's funny! What's your birthday again? I dont wan't to miss the party. And are your parents going to be there? I always loved your parents names but for some reason I'm forgetting. And weren't you born in a hospital with some cooky name?? Good catching up with you!!...... what's your name again?
That is currently happening to my friend group we cut all contact with them 
I will do this, too. I don't even know what a wombat is, but I'm sure as hell gonna persist in saying that those fuckers ate my salad.
/r/beetlejuicing
Hmmm, that's a short answer... 
Ahh so that's why that homeless guy pissed on me
I could probably write a book of the shit I saw in room service: prostitutes, danger sex, people in the middle of sex, half naked women, half naked men, sex toys, used condoms. I've had to give my opinion on lingerie, tattoos, and piercings. Oh and there once was an aggressive rent-boy!
It's a long con. 
Of course I don't think your family is full of savages, /u/Adolf-____-Hitler
That fucking cat is EVERYWHERE. 
Same for all secret aircrafts, its why UFO sightings change through the years.
I used to fight with my parents about this but they eventually let me have my way. The issue wasn't so much that I was trying to hide anything... it was more just that they were loud as hell and I needed to close the door to be able to hear myself think. 
Yeah that stuff is stored in like 9 different places. If he used the email in his browser you can even find the cached page of that email. 
No Xp waste
Yeh surely the mother could sue him or something . What did the divorce give the mother ?
Seriously.  How does one have the energy to do that?  Much less the time and money.  One kid is kicking my ass.
I feel it depends on what kind of boss it is.

This seems like a pretty clear case for alimony. The money and mistresses probably came out in the divorce lawsuit. 
My man.
"Met at a party" is incredibly accurate and easy to remember. 
On the review of the movie "Drive", they put "2 characters hold hands" under sexual content
OOOOH YOU SAID WORD NUMBER 11
And then there's the "very hidden" tabs you can only access by changing their property in the VBA editor..
If you tear a few small holes with your teeth then:   A) The condom can't break if it's already broken (fingeronhead.jpg)      B) The sperm will be too scared to go through the holes because it feels like a trap.
>Accidentally opens folder of all of the dad's female relatives
"Isn't it amazing how similar they are from behind?"
Woah, shit, you've got a keen memory. That was like 2 years ago. But yes, it was some dumb nazi death threat picture that I reverse image searched and found his Facebook from. Back in the good ol' days. 
awks
Yeah, a bit like a danger wank. Couple call up, order 2 sandwiches. The thought of getting caught by the room service guy spurs them on. I mean she was still naked under the covers, and he was sweaty wearing just a towel. Gave me a tenner tip as well, so I'm not complaining!
Some techniques are timeless.
dad appears and they lock gaze
>and he was sweaty wearing just a towelmaybe they were just watching cops
They agree to both become janitors, and eventually work at the same place, go into a bathroom and start kissing by the sinks. Who cares if someones in the stall, they'll just laugh as they run away so gay and gay. 
I KNOW, THAT COPS DOESN'T START TIL 4!
i think it would be harder to explain why they're smiling as if for a photoshoot while being double penatrated. 
Special effects existed before Photoshop. A lot of the things you can do in photoshop have manual, physical analogues in film effects.

By keeping the photo paper still under the enlarger, blocking the light from the enlarger from getting to certain places on the paper at certain times, and changing the negatives in the enlarger.  The way silver gelatin photo paper works is that the more light it gets, the darker it gets.  By making sure that only parts of the paper are getting light at a time, you can build up the image like stacking layers in photoshop.
Yeah, the War of the Unicorn and Cat were dark times....

There's another one that was even more popular. Like a day after 9/11, every one was showing an image of the towers with smoke billowing out of it that had a photoshopped "demon" face in it. People went crazy over it. 
Faked his death at Columbine to carry out 9/11.  Genius.  
They could just figure its a hat. Look what costume and makeup departments do for movies. Thats totally something you could do with practical effects.

He may have taken things a bit too far
It could be, Photoshop back in the early 1500's was called paint.
Most of the top posts would be easy to explain without any knowledge of photo editing.Taxidermy would explain all the weird animals. Makeup and perspective tricks could explain a lot of the others. The Biden waifu thing would be weird I guess, though it would just make people think he's a weirdo who really likes anime character cardboard cutouts more than actually being unexplainable.

It's funny how people don't know (or forget) that Photoshop and its tools have the names they have *because* it's supposed to be a digital photo shop.The same way Avid Media Composer (and Premiere to a lesser extent) and its tools we made to mimic/emulate a physical film editing bay. *cut, splice, split...*(same goes with almost any other digitized process, cut, copy and paste anyone?) 
Dude, you can't cut in line like that. THERE ARE PROCEDURES.

When you gotta write 3000 words, but could get the point across in 2000.
Your point exactly. It's all because of when these programs launched, they were targeted for that industry. Using their terminology only makes sense. But now the history and context behind the terms is long gone for most. I remember when I was first learning avid in school, a foreign kid just couldn't understand why the terms were splice/ cut. While everyone else didn't even notice and assumed it was called those just because.
that's why things like this and also d.a.w's and video editing programs were created. to have every one of these tools at your literal fingertips

Really interesting to see the techniques they used, and how much time it would cost you to just adjust the kerning or something. He was cutting and gluing letters and shit.

You could be drinking watered down hard lemonades and this game would still kill you. 
We won't have the health care for new livers.
I'm preemptively cringing at the thought of him doing this. 
Whenever Trump says something you agree with, drink.It's only as dangerous as the rules make it.
And instead of Simba, Joe Biden comes back in several years and fights Trump atop the burning White House. 
So no drinking then?

he uses the word "very" more than an elementary schooler who hasn't learned enough adjectives
I'm a little dismayed at how few people have suggested not watching it. All these drinking games feed his ratings. He feeds on ratings. We need to starve him. BOYCOTT THE INAUGURATION!!
The words President Trump are going to be a reality by the end of the week.

Or, if you can and want to, peacefully protest. A lot of cities will have small rallies and gatherings. 
I wonder if he'll rename the White House the Trump House.  It's pretty lucrative real estate you know
Don't worry, you won't have to be concerned with money after drinking that much.

"People are saying..."
Yea. Even if you'd do a non-alcoholic version. You'd wind up with water poisoning.
Bigly
Should do it with the requirement doubling every time, and that would still barely ward off alcohol poisoning.
Never stop. 
I think we've found the issue: His lexicon contains so few words that no matter what word(s) we decide to drink to, he'll almost certainly use them so frequently that there's a real likelihood we end up with alcohol poisoning. 
LOL. How'd I forget that one! Yuuuge mistake... my bad.
You misunderstood. He's actually the best at dodging military service. That's what that meant. 
I don't think vodka's a healthy choice. Although it is rather apropos given the rumours circulating. 
Especially since it's so disturbingly plausible.

**A reply from Daddy Don:** "That's a tremendous question, very very tremendous.

He told me Donald, he told me Donald, you're by far the best candidate to be president, no doubt, you're the best candidate of all of them. And you know, it's something I realized then, you know, he was right. Tremendous guy."
While the ruleset I've included might get you pretty hammered, this would kill even Andre the Giant.
Fake News: Every time Trump criticizes major news outlet (e.g. CNN, NBC) as fake news because they wrote something he didn't like, take a shot.Orange Russian: If Trump mentions Russia take a shot. If he mentions Putin, take two shots. If Putin suddenly walks onstage, finish the bottle.
Everybody says it, all the time, everyone always says to me: "bLbGoldeN, you have the best of the best words, they're amazing, tremendous amazing!" and I know they're right, because everyone always tells me all the time and you know what? I've heard someone say that I had regular words folks, regular words and really, and really it's sad, sad!
You know there's a lot of research and complicated, very complicated stuff that goes on in the cyber, because it's made by very smart people. Some people once told me that China was the one that made it, but I look at them in the eyes and always tell them: "We're American, you can't fool us." Folks, we're at war, we are, we are, we're at war everywhere and there's people dying instead of being safe here with us, and having a tremendous time. Let me tell all of you something, I'm going to change all of it, I'll change things so much you wouldn't even believe, because I win, I win all the time.

I started drinking heavily several years ago because of Trump.
Well if everyone who opposes Trump starts drinking heavily throughout his presidency, the only ones alive to vote in 2020 will be his supporters.
There's actually a documentary out there that floats the possibility that half the reason Trump ran in the first place was he was furious at getting embarrassed by Obama during the birther thing at the Correspondant's Dinner and this was his version of revenge. Might explain why he seems to be promising to replace Obamacare with Obamacare++
It's like Head-in-a-Jar Nixon, only much more terrifying.

What does a snail even do?
Decoy snail.
It would actually be more interesting to give a million dollars to a snail.
Or you could put that box inside of another box, then mail that box to yourself and when it arrives you can smash it with a hammer. 
Decoy Antarctica
30 years later you're making out with a girl.  Your hand brushes her cheek.  Suddenly, you feel your immortality draining away.  You look with horror at your hand, stained with makeup.  You taste her lipstick on your lips.  You realize that finally, after all these years, the snail has had its revenge.
Easy, make it hard for the snail by always being a decoy self.
Why not put the snail in a snail sized bubble?
Except you just got baited by a decoy snail
I was thinking in the same way as this, with one million dollars, if it can only crawl, I would move accros the ocean, and first calculate it's crawl speed on avarage, and then at about 80% of that travel time I would move once more.
Would League of Legends sell for 1 million dollars is the real question here.
Yes! I'm actually surprised that a mention of RT is so far down in the comments. I remember some other "Million Dollars But" and "Gavin or Google" scenarios posted here that got quite a bit of recognition. 
Decoy snail.
Congratulations, you just stuck a decoy snail up your ass.
For one million dollars that might be a stretch

Decoy genitals.
Decoy sky.
Cup is a poor choice, it may be able to crawl out, why not use a jar with a lid?  You have a million dollars, you can afford the lid.
Gottem
I was thinking the same thing! After probably just a few million years, I'd wish I could die. Not just like when you get depressed when everyone you know dies, but pushing through all depression, I'd say only a few million years before I become Bowerick Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
"Someone I can trust with my life." I'd sure as hell hope my closest friend could trust me and not try to kill me for a million bucks right on the spot. I'd promise him way more money from the investments later on down the road.
What, so it might crawl at a solid 180 feet an hour instead of 90? That's very nearly enough time to move half a block.
You just got baited
Nahhh bro.  *"The Cask of Amont-escargot."*

Yo isn't it crazy how you could put a million dollars cash in front of a snail and it wouldn't give a fuck it will just crawl away
or, to save on postage, you could poison him with salt! Talk it Kronk! Feel the salt!
It was a decoy box

I could try to crush it with something first. If it lives, it's the immortal snail.

He's super-intelligent, though. Can't fool that snail.
the decoy snails won't *know* where you are though, and won't be intelligent enough to follow directions.

Why would that be a stretch? Nobody said you have to live in a mansion in an expensive part of the continent. 
You make money off being immortal so you can finance it
A hamsterball then. Intelligence isn't going to do much for a snail stuck in a hamsterball.
Keep your friends close and your anemones closer. 
Correct. Rather unrelated to immortal snails, but the series doesn't get enough credit for how well it handles the concept of death. While it's absolutely still treated as a tragedy, it's never treated as a "loss," as in "this person has died, which means they 'lose' at whatever we're doing." It's an inevitability. And the tale of the Deathly Hollows concretes that idea perfectly by treating Death not as some Devil, but even as a potential old friend. "You will die, and that's okay."
is his GF a snail also? How did that work? did you break her? Is this how you developed your weakness to snails? did you steal your million dollars from Super smart snail's Girlfriend? Can snails have mustaches? These are things we need to know OP. 
Mineral water.
Idk I think I could tell the difference between a real super intelligent snail and an ordinary snail pretending to be super intelligent
I feel like there's literally nothing that would be more efficient than "wandering away from the snail". 
With the mineral water company the snail creates with his $1 million, this could really shorten your life span.
TIL snails are ghosts
Oh well then, lucky it was a decoy rocket.
ok then.  if it dies, it's a decoy.  If it doesn't, it's immortal.
semanticstoaster
Wait, I thought the snail thought I slept with his girlfriend? How recent was this divorce? Was the snail cheating on his snail wife with his snail girlfriend?
Hey, now. 
You just got out-memed 
the world is gonna roll me
OP lives in a dorm with the top 1000 League of legends and Dota2 players. If he needs more salt all he has to do is say aloud "I heard Dota was better then League" or vice versa. The ensuing salt explosions will form a new mountain of safety from your snail pursuer.

Decoy orgasm.
It is never stated that the snail would be presented, visually or otherwise. Therefore there is no way to keep your eyes on it. If you happen to be shown a snail by the person making the deal with you, you have know way of knowing if it is the intelligent snail or not.
I did not, sorry.
As legend would have it, Cannedinternet spent the rest of his immortal life smashing snails without any sleep or leisure.
I'd lose it in less than 200 easily. 25 is pushing it already.
You can always hope, but I think my own mother would probably put the snail on me 
Guess you should offer the money before anything else, and make sure they promise to help before pointing to the snail. Cause it's just common sense if your friend says "under no circumstances can that snail touch me" to pick it up and wave it in their face

Snailed it. Actually that pun had very little to do with snails. So bad. 
Does anyone think if it as a "loss" in that way?I've only ever heard of people saying "loss" to family and friends that no longer have the deceased in their life.
It's pretty simple actually. You just put your micro penis in the shell
But could you tell the difference between a real super intelligent snail pretending to be an ordinary snail and a real ordinary snail? 
"Moving just like, a little" might have it tied for laziness though.
It was a decoy of a decoy snail, so it was the real snail, meaning you launched the real snail on a fake rocket so you just wasted money on a fake rocket that did nothing to the snail.
That's a pretty good way to vet decoy snails
Sex with snail's girlfriend.
Well the snail divorced his wife cause he found out she was cheating on him with you(or at least thought so
You're an all star.
I just spat my coffee on my desk, this is fucking hilarious
have friend smash the snail with a hammer to prove its the immortal snail. if it lives, proceed with the plan, if it dies, shit self.
/r/2meirl4meirl Seriously though, hang in there...you still have a long ways to go
The fuck?  Is that sub trying to cure depression and cynicism?  Well it's doing a bang up job.  You go sub!
Clearly you haven't figured out a way to become a super intelligent snail either.  
The ring came off my pudding can!
"Ryan, why does a triangle add up to turning the other way?"
The poor man wants all that he has notThe rich man wants not all that he hasThe snail neither has nor wantsSo who among them is the wisest? 
Could even go over it. Sliming it up
Right! The salt...the salt for kuzco...the salt chosen to kill kuzco... kuzco's salt...
You can do far worse. Have a vet (the homeless kind) remove his shell and plop him in a little tempered glass jar. Fill it with salt to keep the snail weak and wear that shit as a necklace. 
*virtuous mission plays
Except there aren't enough boxes on earth to box every single snail. OP you're no more prepared for this than we are.
Oh my god.
WELCUM TO THE HYUDRALIK PRES CHANNEL. TUDAY WE WE WILL CRUSH SMOL INDESTRUCTIBLE SHNEIL. 
That explains *Twilight*.
Asking the important questions.
Decoy snail
I have 25 square feet of room to dodge the snail for the next 10 years, who needs sleep anyways 
Oh then I'd just order a new ball every year.
can't believe I'm getting roasted on a post about a hypothetical murder snail 
HAHA I HAD A MIRROR AND NOW YOU'RE DEAD!
You're moving the goal posts. The premise is that it crawls towards me, not towards where it thinks I will be. 
Believe me, I've been behind a few snails in a customs line before.  HEYYYYOOOOO!!!
The snail is kind of a dick.
This is exactly why the snail is trying to kill you.
And "OP" still gets 25k karma. Oh hi reddit, what's up. 
These guys watched last week's podcast
A superhero duo where one dies if they touch. That would be interesting 
Doctor, in a whisper: *Did you get a million dollars to fight a snail too?*
But how could the snail communicate with people in order to do that? OP's snail doesn't speak, and snail drool is transparent when it dries.
You could spraypaint the hamsterball black
"A long-lived Magikarp is able to utilize its immense splashing power to leap high enough to scale mountains." I'm sorry, can you hop over mountains?
What if the super intelligent death snail is tormented by its own immortality and decides the only way to end it is to end *you*?
but not invulnerable.
"Now it's time to escargot to heaven."
Yeah, they're using it in the wrong context. It's loss to reflect absence, you've "lost" them from your life. It's a misreading but it's still an interesting implication of the language we use when describing death.
911 something something 
I'm actually curious as to what super intelligent means. Is it super intelligent for a snail or super intelligent for a human. Because then we're basically talking about a deadly game of tag with a slightly slower, smaller version of Stephen Hawking. 
Decoy, not fake. The decoy rocket is headed to Arcturus. Bon voyage. 
Get your game on.
Decoy desk
the snail would find a way to make it look like it died
Thanks, bud. You too.
Gives a warm fuzzy feeling. 
I try. Each day I get a little closer.
Take my pen knife, my good man!
If you jump out a plane you can run down a mountain because.....wat?
Me and I'll take that million dollars now.
That salt? 
I have a pet snapping turtle.  I already pick up any snail I see with tongs (because they are slimy and gross) and feed them to my turtle.In this scenario, the snail which my turtle cannot destroy in the one that gets boxed up forever.
i know right, i've been banned from that sub on all of my alts. you literally just have to disagree with someone, or ask a question.
After 650, age is just a number.
It's a very intelligent question. Watch out for this guy.
Ummm just put a glass cup over the snail. Too heavy to lift for the snail, and now you're safe. Why is everyone complicating things?
and hire someone to steal the snails money
It's not like he's embarrassing you in front of your friends.
You're right, I didn't re-read the prompt and was focused on "knows where you are". Would be a more interesting match if he wasnt forced to crawl towards you. I think the spirit of the op is simply that it attempts to get to you, otherwise it doesn't matter whether the snail is intelligent or has money, since apparently all its allowed to do is slowly crawl towards you.
>you both become immortal
That snail is immortal though
A constant stream of people who've been paid to hurl snails at you until you just give up.
 It'll move faster.  The snail has Tsa Pre-Check.
Doctor: Then why is it covered in vasoline?You: Don't tell me how to make soup. 
Superintelligent snail goes to a beach and writes a message in the sand by rolling around. Good counterpoint though.  
You can't spraypaint your knowledge its harsh thoughts away though ;_;
EXISTENCE IS PAIN TO A SNAILSEEKS
Yeah ~~angry~~ livid millionaire snail in extreme pain? what could go wrong?
"Take me to snurch"
but the real snail actually calculated that it would go into outer space and with his 234 billion dollars that he got from investing in mineral water he nukes the entire earth, and leaves you intact. He walks up and touches you. GG
Decoy snail
It's a smart/immortal snail. Not a damn reality-warper. We're talking Deadpool immortality here, not Mephisto.
It's both
Because I'M ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE SNAIL, SHIT THIS IS A MISTAKE!
I swear it's Springfield's only choice. 
YES that salt!!!
Or leave it with the turtle. It is immortal, but it still feels pain.
You wouldn't want to risk imprisoning the original snail with other snails. He would develop a way to teach the other snails to do his bidding and now you've got like 30 snails on your ass, any of which could be the touch of death. As a matter of fact this might be the origin of all these decoy snails. 
He might be a snail.
The Snail is *very* crafty.  It will outsmart you with a decoy and strike while your guard is down.
I'm not gonna hire someone to steal money. I believe stealing money should be it's own reward.
Oh dear Lord forgive this young man for committing a murder.
You are the snail, aren't you? You won't fool us with your penguin disguise.How long did crawling this post take? Did you have to invent a new input device? So many questions.
He would live there to eliminate the chance of decoy snails. Only the immortal snail could survive coming after him. Then he could set a trap for him.
Just because it survives doesn't mean the journey needs to be pleasant.
He's tough asnails. 
Seriously, this part wasn't made clear at all.  Can the snail be reasoned with?  Maybe I can convince it that it's in the snail's own best interest to let me live.  Maybe he didn't read the rules too clearly either and only just ASSUMED he had to try and kill me.Everybody's all focused on running away from the snail or trying to trap or kill it first, but... Did anyone ever stop and just ask the snail why he's doing it?
I think I know what to do now, you give somebody 3 bucks to put the snail into a plastic hamster ball, and then you *bury* the ball mildly deeply into the ground, snail now is trapped there forever. And you have a free million bucks.
Yes, you can.  It's called huffing.
I just witnessed a murder!
decoy snail
EVERYTHING YOU SAY TO MEEEEEEE
Mission snailed!
We're on to you, snail 
The worst part is I can't even relate the story of this burn later without sounding like a loser. 
And then it all turns out to have taken place a) in a dream b) during a bad trip. I'd watch the shit outa this movie.... Actually, can you imagine the trailer for this? How boring would that trailer be? I'm just imagining a bunch of ominous cuts between a guy running and a snail crawling with a gleam in it's eye.
This would be a great way to fish out the decoy snails though. The one that survives the trek across the flats is obviously the one that can kill you.
Well now the snail has a stillsuit
Get out. 
Seriously, the little guy doesn't gain anything from my death. It's not like I put him in my will or anything, why does he want me dead?
Day man!
Not in your neighborhood you didn't. 
SENDS ME ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE SNAILGOTTA INCREASE MY SALT INTAKE
SHUT UP WHEN I'M CRAWLING TO YOU!
It's a decoy snail.
This post was before its time. 
No one has friends on Reddit anyways. We're all karmawhoring
Like that spoon murderer trailer.
That's where the opposable thumbs and glass jar comes in. Checkmate.
If a snail becomes a Buddhist monk, masters his body's response to pain and *still* thinks it worthwhile to chase me across miles of salt in order to kill me: I'm going to start to wonder if I've got it coming...  Hey snail, was I Hitler in the last lifetime? Stalin? Did I step on your eggs? WHY U CHASE ME SNAIL?!?! O_o
Does it also have precog and blue-on-blue eyes?
The snail would seek your death quite naturally.  You are both immortal.  You and artificial intelligence are the two concepts on this planet that represent a real existential threat to it.  Eventually even if people imprisoned it, their culture or even species, if someone doesn't try to free the snail for their own benifit prior, may go away.
I NEED A LITTLE ROOM TO FLEEEEEE
AND I'M MADE OUT OF CHEEEEESE
Which is a real shame, cuz it's gonna be delicious
Maybe getting into jail was the snails plan to put a glass cup over you!
>We're all karmawhoring...on this blessed day.
It could also be that the snail craves the sweet embrace of death, dreading an eternal life of watching all of its snail friends die while he lives on. He knows the only way to die is to kill you. 
Wtf? Lol
Ive seen this epsiode on porn hub before
I'm in the same boat. I did hang an Xmas wreath on my front door.This has been an absolute sucky year, made a gazillion times worse because my 12 yr-old dog died in August. He was the family I celebrated with.
I work in hospitality. You'd be surprised how many women in our restaurants freak the fuck out when Mariah Carey's "all I want for Christmas is you" comes on. It's alarming the screams from the grown women everywhere. 
Also working! Apparently people still expect an ambulance to come on holidays..
Is she a pug, too?
That's no excuse to not be spending time with your family.
Holy fuck. I just went bankrupt a few minutes ago. I feel you dude. 
I'm on the toilet, OP. Get off my ass, man. 
Parents just divorced, at my grandparents house watching elf for the 70th time with my sister, love the holidays!
Look at Mr. Fancypants here flying one hour instead of driving.
I'm still struggling with my soon to be ex wife's affair, the holidays are tough. It's been 4 years since I found out and everything fell apart and I'm still a wreck. If you need someone to talk to I'm here to listen, trust me you need to let it out or the holidays will fucking kill you.
If I may ask, what does your wife think about it. If that was my mom, she would have gotten in their faces to tell them to stop with the bullshit and get them both something or neither of them.
It's only 7:52 PM Christmas Eve here. Trying to get your presents early you time traveling piece of shit?
Your day sounds like a great independent movie I'd put on a list to see once it hits the shitty cinema in my town which it never will so I'll forget about it until I see it on Netflix four years later after scrolling through my suggestions for half an hour.
Sounds like your folks are thought poisoned. Sucks for them to miss out on a cool kid and awesome memories... I wish you Happy Holidays and huge successes in 2017. 
We are your family :D
My family is content to sit in the couch together and say nothing. We're doing it now, it's great.
Hannukah isn't a big holiday?  Then what is?
I'm sorry to hear. I used to think I had a mood disorder and my depression was my fault. Come to find out my emotional issues were a result of narcissistic abuse by several family members. Cut that family off and life is amazing now.I don't know your situation but hang in there. Keep searching for answers. I hope you enjoy your Christmas Eve.
I'm sure your cat loves you.
God damn, I wish I had a compound. Or at the least a barbed wire fence around my house.
Perhaps you could make something out of clay to play with?
KEVIN!
Not as hard as my dad hits.
Porn star, eh?
Castrate
Mom had a stroke on January 9th of this year. I'm the caretaker, brother too busy with work. Sucks but it is what it is. I'll get my life on track when I can.Hope your holidays are great and have a good new year!
Appropriate response lol 
I can't help but think that the nearest animal shelter might have a lonely dog that's anxiously waiting to celebrate Christmas with someone who will love him back.  
Thanks, it means a lot (:
Thank you very much!!
Thank you. Your post sparked an interesting thought. I can rant. I can rave. I can curse and storm against fate. But through it all I am oddly ... grateful. I have been blessed by them, and no matter what comes next I will always be in debt to all that led me to this point.  
I'm a grown-ass man and you'd be surprised at how I freak the fuck out when it comes on. There's a diva in all of us.
I can explain my jealousy in crippling detail. 
So do astronomers, that is why they went there. 
Well, yeah, because that's the exact location they used. Paranal Observatory.
It is :)  Had a hectic day. Last minute shopping, travelling for hours to get here (on public transport with an overexcited kid) and helping my folks prepare for tomorrow.  Now it's time to relax with shitposts and wine!  
Probably. She's out with her fiance.  
AND firetrucks.  *eyeroll*friggin' Divas.  Put out your own fires and drive yourselves to the hospital.  You'll never learn to take care of yourself if we're always doing it for you!
3pm to 1am here. Single with no kids. I offered to work Christmas and Christmas Eve. Time and a half plus a two full day's worth of vacation. Gonna be a nice paycheck.  
This is my human granddaughter.  I also have a pug and chihuahua on my lap. 
The family that squats together, plops together.
We need a subreddit for people who lost Christmas games to recover.
As weird as it may sound here is where I can talk without being judged for who I am(instead of what my opinion is). No one in the family gives a shit about me till I am earning well and doing what I am supposed to. I could start doing drugs and I am sure no one would notice. All my friends live a thousand km away. So yeah.. this site/you guys <3.
Can confirm, just got home from a gathering just oozing with passive aggression, taking offence to someome else's personal choices, and shit-talking absent family members. I *wish* I could spend Christmas alone. So much bullshit.
All more trouble and additional expense to him currently. I could agree if he had the money to float $40 for a small claims lawsuit, but the guy is eating rice and butter for Christmas, chances are he doesn't have $40 to float like that.Also suing her would mean interacting more and twisting that knife. Probably better to avoid contact and move on. Extract what learning or lessons you can from the situation, turn the page, and start writing the rest of your story.
Me too. I don't call it reddit, I call it brownit.
4 kids screaming, dogs going crazy, wife and mother gossiping with each other, blah blah blah. At least im in the same room
My family has a picture of all of us kids and my mom in the front room reading books. About 10 years later we realized we had replicated the pictures...with electronics.
Thanks for your kind message. Despite reddit's imperfections, it blows my mind that ranting into the digital ether can bring out genuine support like yours, even at a time like Christmas Eve.
Thanks dude. I guess I've only delayed the inevitable; soon, she'll start demanding to know specifics of my "program." But it's reassuring to know this happens to other people out there.Out of curiosity, what are you studying?
Education, it turns out.
No need for the sarcasm tag. You speak truth.
Hurray two Christmases! 
Mrs. Fancypants, and the drive is 9 hours over mountains with a two year old, so...nah. 
Oh gosh this hit me harder than some of the other emotional replies. 
Thanks man. Been playing Fifa and Final Fantasy XV! FF is so good! 
Hey buddy. I lost my mom in October 2012 and the first Christmas was absolutely awful. Four years later and it's a mostly happy affair for my family with a few sighs and sometimes the occasional tear.  The pain never goes away but it's less "front and center" as time goes on. I hope you'll come to appreciate it for the time you have with the family that's still here at some point like my family and I have.
Thank you 
I feel so hard for you people. I've never been married but my ex broke up with me after dating for 3 years on Thanksgiving 2 years ago and i found out she slept with a roommate of mine the day after christmas. Holiday's kicked my ass and I was only 19. I can't even fathom it being someone you trusted so mich to marry them and have kids with.
I had this happen 15 years ago.  My mom somehow managed to out together one of my all time favorite Christmases  it was a real rough year but I'll always have fond memories of that Christmas. 
It's not as simple as just "be happy anyway".
on the first night of Hanukkah my true love gave to me
Because us jewy-jew-jews (everyone say that out loud) do that tomorrow night.
And a Happy Jew Year 
That's tomorrow- don't get too ahead of yourself
I can't sing Christmas songs or decorate a Christmas tree, or leave water out for Rudolph cause there's something wrong with me.
Do you have a "merry Christmas" saying for an Islamic festival? Something like "joyous Eid" or "happy Ramadan" would probably roll off the tongue.
We are all the fuck ups.
1am here in England, merry Christmas! 
And now, 3 hours later, it's still 12pm Christmas Day in Australia.Everyone forgets the west coast #bestcoast
Or the person you'd rather be with told you to fuck off and ran directly into her exes arms. 
Thank youEyes are very white now
"Look, you can keep yelling or you can help me by harmonizing. Do your part."
The writing would probably be pretentious as fuck and there'd be long, pointless close-ups on random shit like empty soup cans or whatever, but if you watch it with a kinda-hot art major she'll think you're deep and maybe you'll get a blowie 
Family hug! :D
my mom always says, "IDK, you start a conversation." Umm, you were the one who wanted to talk
This is a great suggestion OP. I did 5 years in the Army Infantry and got injured in Mosul Iraq. Every night afterwards was a nightmare(literally). VA prescribed me mini press and life has been much more tolerable. Even if your PTSD isn't service related don't hesitate to PM brother. We're all in this together. 
Now that is the holiday spirit! If you guys want a 3rd, let me know. 
It's considered important because it's had to become important so Jewish kids don't feel left out at Christmastime. But in terms of the religion, it isn't a major holiday, it's a minor one. 
I got a legendary.Lucio.It's a frog skin. Fuck you Blizzard.
Eh, maybe...
We live far off the beaten path surrounded by woods and streams. We call it "The Compound", but it is a working ranch protected by cattle and Dobermans.A lovely place by day, but a dark and forbidding place by night.
Damnit! Should have thought of that when the stores were still open. 
"You're what the French call les incompetents."
I could go on forever, baby.
It's Christmas. A reference to Home Alone should always be expected
Now we know why you're on reddit.
Please make sure that you take care of yourself. You can really get worn down over time. The stress will really do a number on you physically and emotionally. My brother and her family could care less and it's taken a toll. I've let my life get off track for too long. Please don't make my mistake.I wish YOU awesome holidays and a fabulous New Year. Please PM me if you ever feel the the need. I never understood what far reaching impact strokes could have until my mom had both of hers.
that's the only response!
She's a spy.
Are animal shelters open on Christmas? Because if so that's what I'm gonna do.
if you don't have friends like me you can always shoot me a PM buddy
One of the best Christmas songs to come out in the last 30+ years.So many people try to come out with "new" Christmas songs all the time.  None are anywhere near as catchy.  They all just seem so.... fake?  Lifeless?  I don't know.  But they're nowhere close.
Do it.
#&nbsp;#&nbsp;^^that's ^^deep.
That sounds exhausting.Have a Merry Christmas tomorrow! =)
Damn swingers having all the Christmas fun 
Ugh, I guess I'll make sure the runway at this airport doesn't ice up so all you jerks can go see your families... Then again, I'm Jewish so I kinda volunteered to work.Edit - WOOWOO!!! ALL ABOARD THE GOLD TRAIN!!! SEE YOU SUCKERS IN THE LOUNGE!!! Seriously though, thank you muchly kind stranger! I hardly think doing what I do is gold worthy. Honestly, I'd do it for free. I get to be up close and personal with big trucks and planes.Edit 2 - Hanukkah started tonight?! I had no idea... /s
Had a stroke patient a few minutes ago. It's like they have no regard to my need to bake cookies and watch Christmas movies. 
But...but... this is the big one! I'm dyin'!    *You hear that, Elizabeth?! I'm comin' to join ya, honey!*
So... Was that the shitpost of Christmas Past, Present, or Future?
7pm to 7am here. Working at the front desk of a motel. Someone's gotta keep the rooms warm and doors open for hookers and junkies ;) 
"This is my human granddaughter." i can't stop laughing at this

I'm sorry dude. Here, take some love.
Sometimes it's reddit. Those are scary times
Are we in the same house?
We're not the typical household, but it works! :)
The way you write tells me that you are an intelligent well rounded and reasonable person. PhD or not, you'll be fine I am sure. 
Well, at least it sounds like you're living away from home. Distance definitely helps. Also, r/AsianParentStories is your friend.Applied math! Specifically, physics-based models that are used to study living systems.
The next time she starts in on you, tell her that you're just not smart enough to earn a PhD like her and your late father - and that's it's obviously because of the recessive defective genes they passed on to you.;>
Did you keep the maiden name of Fancypants when you wed, or did you marry into the Fancypants family?
Sorry :)
Nice! Ive been wanting to play FFXV but I can't justify getting another game with the 5 im already playing.
I know you weren't talking to me, but I really needed this right now, so thank you.  Technically this is my 2nd Christmas without my little sister; she passed Dec 2015.  But last year we were all so numb it didn't really register.  This year however...it's been awful and I'm having a hard time keeping it together.
Similar situation after 5 years. I know plenty of people have it worse, but its been 10 months for me and feeling like shit is putting it pretty lightly. She was once my best friend and I don't think I will ever be the same again.
We have been really fortunate, we were donated a tree and ornaments. It's just been waves, I'm okay and trying to handle it, and then I just have a pity party. I go between pity/sadness and then guilt. I had so much, I'm fortunate, I'm lucky - why am I feeling bad for myself?? It's been a rough year.
One present
Lots of us did it tonight! In fact, I'm just heading home from a big ol Jewish Christmas Eve right now!
Eid Mubarak!
3 hours behind and you cunts still can't get your shit together.
I'm sorry m8. Hopefully you can still make the best of the holidays.
I have PTSD from something not service related, and I have constant nightmares. I haven't been able to reliably sleep in years. Is there really a medicine that I can get that would help out with that? I never mentioned it to my doc because I figured the nightmares were just something people dealt with...
Don't play without me I want in
Hopefully. And I'm not kidding.  Pm me and I'll give you my number.  Call it anytime 
I'm sure there's an origami version out there somewhere...
I know you've been smooching with my brother
Thanks I really appreciate it! I'm currently looking for work in nyc so the plan is in motion my friend.
You're right.. Many rescues allow fostering though; it's a great way to have animals in your life without the financial commitment.
Thank you!
No, it's high altitude.
It was. But we got there safe and sound and that's all that matters :)  Merry Christmas to you too! Have a great one <3
Happy Hanukkah!
Here it is friend. Hope you talk to someone, PM if you need anything else. (800) 273-8255

HAHAHA. YES. I AM HUMAN. COME, FELLOW HUMANS, LET US ENJOY COMPANY AND MERRY FESTIVITIES WHILE INJESTING GLUCOSE INTO OUR ONE-WAY DIGESTIVE TRACTS.
Damn, even other people's cats eat better than me.
r/slavs_squatting 
I am so sad that is not a thing.
And here is an upvote for you as a example of my love of your love.
I'm trying to force myself to think and feel that way. I'm just so terrified of people getting the wrong idea about me or something. I've never *ever* been good at accepting help from others, but lord knows, if I've ever been in a situation where I needed assistance, this is certainly that moment. 
If it ever becomes Blackit go to the hospital. 
Maybe, do you see a five year old wearing a Sonic costume and screaming that he's a "speed-type" Pokemon?
Sounds like a house I would like to live in.
Hey, thanks! I intend to be fine, and to maintain sanity and decency in the face of my mother's extreme and outdated opinions.
Yes, distance helps a ton. Wow, that sub is too real.And very cool! That happens to be similar to what I'd want to get into if I ever did pursue more schooling (which would hopefully be despite and not because of pressure from my Asian parent).
Diabolical. She might respond by deciding to limit the spread of said defective genes by massacring me.
Oh, sorry, forgot the hyphen.Fan-Cypants. 
Stay unsinkable, friend. 
That's gaming in your 30s for you.  "This will look great on my shelf!" 
Going to be a while - but it doesn't have to. Just go at your pace, there isn't a rule book. Make changes in your life, get healthier, meet new people, chase your dreams. You can and therefore you should. 
It stays with you. I remember a bunch of strangers donated so much for us including beds, couches, etc. It was crazy. It's also ok to feel bad, you lost things important to you. They're just things but they were yours and meant something. I was 13 at the time but I still have moments now where I get sad thinking about my old toys and how I wish i had them still. What's nice is, you will forever have a greater appreciation for everything you have in life and know how quickly it can be taken away, making you appreciate it even more.

Obligatory not a doctor.But if you can't sleep this is definitely a thing to talk to your doctor about. One of my roommates in college got prescribed medication to help her sleep because she had such powerful nightmares. There is definitely help out there for you if you ask. 
Alright, I believe ya..
I tell ya what I'm gonna give you, Snakes...
Everyone always forgets Cliff and Bony Bob
My heart grew like 3 times bigger reading this banter. End of day holiday wind-downs are the best, because it's just winding down for more holiday tomorrow. Merry Christmas. 
Every day apparently. :(
NICE TO MEET FELLOW HUMAN WITH ~~SYNTHESIZED~~ HUMAN OFFSPRING
Just you wait 
Hey buddy: take the gift and pay it forward. One day when things are working better for you, you can do the same for someone else. That day will come!
Not too far off my situation...
When they get grounded they play games for my husband. They mentioned it to their friends and all of them were like, "I wish I could play video games for my punishment!"
Do it over phone. 
Oh your two year old is half chinese?

There's a million things I haven't done 
Once I'm finally financially stable again, I'll be damned if I don't pay these good deeds forward. I've ever felt this way before, I've never been the target of so much caring, especially from strangers. It's sobering, and completely altered my perspective on some things. 
That's it young lady. Now you have to do my dailies for a month! 
Sage advice. Same strategy as breaking up with a significant other.
Before I pump your guts fulla lead!
My tired eyes read that as on oxmas day, I imagined you having this awesome pagan holiday around a roast ox and bonfire with lots of mead.
What's yo' name, man?
I was sooooo angry when Adam Sandler's Hannakuh Song came on the radio it was cut off in the car the other day. I'm not even Jewish and it is one of my favorite songs of the season. 
That sounds like... 10x more exciting than Christmas. Someone needs to make this a thing.

That's half of what Skyrim is
It's on meter, I love it
Haha this is why I cannot study or write while listening to music or TV. My papers will just be full of lyrics and dialog I heard.
I'm sorry you lost your mom
This made me laugh, cos SO & I respond to most of each other's questions (about anything) with "in your butt". I may change it up & borrow yours. 
I did this. Moved 1 door down, but I never even spoke to the new occupants of the old place. Just barged in one day coming back from the laundry room with my laundry basket and there's a shirtless dude laying on the couch, probably high as a kite. We just stare at each other for a minute and I say "I used to live here!" and started walking out as he was laughing.
On a similar note, I did park maintenance for awhile and often entered the opposite sex bathroom to clean. I have found myself yelling "FEMALE MAINTENANCE WORKER!" before entering the ladies room
What did you do with the beer and why is the answer you chugged it?
Been giggling like mad at all the stories, but yours? yours pushed me over the edge. I think My laughing just woke up the neighborhood..
Thank you for the diabolical idea of how to get rid of telemarketers! 
I somehow do this e v e r y year
"Fuck you, this is all you get."
I just burst out laughing at 2. Thanks for that.
Imagine you pick up someone elses signal with the baby monitor and start hearing voices in your car. 
I once poured the fresh grounds into the basket before placing the filter in.Upon realizing my mistake, I emptied and cleaned the basket and then placed the filter in its rightful place.Then I poured the water in and hit brew.Fifteen minutes later, I had a full pot of hot water.Not a good morning.
The other day I was checking in at an amusement park. After the guy scanned my ticket, I, for some unknown reason, held out my hand. And the guy handed me his scanner. 
You can lead a horse to your kitchen, but you can't make it cook you breakfast.
Haha I've done that.I was walking through town with my gf at the time, looking at stalls and shops and she was in my periphery, or so I thought... She had stopped to look at something else and a woman of roughly the same height and hair colour was stood next to me.I checked my phone for time, gently caressed her shoulders and said "come on now, it's time for us to head off". And just walked away from this woman.I turned around a few meters later to see my gf a luminescent shade of embarrassed and this entirely freaked out little old Asian woman.
I had to go to Walmart once after finishing my midnight cashier shift from a competing grocery retailer across the street. I absentmindedly grabbed my stuff, approached the cashier and asked her if she found everything ok. We stared at each other blankly for a little bit.
I wish that's how it always worked. If so, I'd be showing up at work in the middle of the night like every single day 
Yeap. The amount of times I've ended a phone conversation with, "Okay, love you, bye," that wasn't with my husband/mom/dad/brothers on the other end is embarassing.
What did you used to do at the airport? I think airports are interesting
I did something like that when I was like 8. My dad was in the car getting ready to take me and my brother to the game room, and I didn't want to miss out so I ran to the car without pants on. Then I hear my mom yelling out the window, "YOU HAVE NO PANTS ON!"
I was making breakfast one early morning and cracked my eggs straight into the garbage.
I once did this in a skype conversation
So.. how did it taste?
I have done this. Instead of grabbing my coffee, I got my tv remote and didn't notice until I got to work haha 
Once I was feeding my 1 year old a banana and talking to my mom. In the middle of the conversation, I pushed the banana in front of my moms face and just waited for her to take a bite. It took like 30 seconds to register that I was force feeding my 48 year old mother NOT my toddler. It was hilarious. 
My boyfriend tried to wake me up from a nap and he started tickling me and I started freaking out and getting scared because I thought he was a wire stabbing into me and I was a mountain? 
i was really hoping it was the other way around :(
It's better than looking for your glasses while you're wearing them. Not my proudest moment...
Makes sense.
Im laughing so hard at "goodnight yourself"
Have done, but with just two. First egg: "oh, dammit!" *Rinses egg down sink*Second egg: "oh...oh, fucking come on"
Sometimes I wake wake-up at like 6 AM thinking I'm late to HS and rush to get out of bed. Those were dark times. 
Most people are kidding when they tell Jesus to take the wheel
Poor foodWhy didnt you help itYOU COULD HAVE SAVED THE FOOD
How'd it taste?
That was the best day of that rat's life.
You reminded me of my favorite one!I kick my truck door closed all the time.  One time, I kicked it closed before grabbing my phone, and in a sleepy panic *threw my keys into the truck just before the door closed.*  I was so out of it I yelled "Yes!" because my sleep addled brain must have thought that was awesome.  Had to wait for my wife to get home to open the door to the house to get the spare.
I worked at a restaurant where we had to knock on the bar door before opening it, I probably did it about 20 times a day for 6 years. Almost every time I open a door that you just have to push open, like a bathroom door at a restaurant or something, I knock really hard like three times. Lots of weird looks. 
Ah crap something similar happened to me. I got to a party and saw people I knew, mostly female, so I gave them all a hug and a small peck on the cheek, get to the one guy in the group, both of us bearded men and proceeded to give him a peck on the cheek. We both just stopped and stared at each other. 
Could be worse. Your hair could be unprotected from 99% of odor causing bacteria. 
Fortunately cats have an ATTACK setting to protect against such mishaps.
I can't stop giggling at the moo cows, now *I* look crazy
I would have cried. Bitter, idiotic tears. 
NOOOOOOOO 
I've peed on the lid before because I had expected it to be up, and didn't realize before peeing. Not a good time. 
Yeah... they probably didn't need the pee to know if you were on drugs after that.
Ha, I've done this at work. The woman on the other end just laughed and said "Love you too" and hung up.
This needs to be higher, I can't stop laughing. That is 1,000,000x worse than calling a teacher "Mum"It reminds me of a time during a Japanese language class where my teacher was a very masculine woman who had a pretty deep voice. She was super nice mostly considering this was a grade 8 language class where nobody particularly cared and got pretty rowdy. In a moment of autopilot, I wanted to ask her a question and out came: "Hey Dad." I felt so bad about it.
I had this happen to me. I had procrastinated on a film study project, started working on it at 8pm the night before it was due, made it about 1/2 of the way through by midnight, and woke up in my bed at 5:30am to go to school with no recollection of anything after midnight. I was freaking out thinking I still had four hours of work to do to finish, but checked the document and it was *done*. Last saved at 3am. I got an A on a project that I barely remembered doing, and I had done the second half *faster* than when I was conscious.
That sounds more like drunk than auto pilot
What size sub?*meat long*
I've tried to put milk in the cabinet where the cereal goes a bunch of times.  I've even tried to put the box of cereal in the fridge. 
And you left the stove on too?
Oh god I've done this more than I care to admit
Why would you eat a stray mint that had just been in your pocket for months anyway?  It would be all covered in lint and gross.
In school in Ireland we have an oral exam for Irish and whatever foreign language you learn, German in my case. So I speak near fluent Irish in my German.I sit down for my Irish exam and start speaking German.I wasn't even on autopilot I was just so focused on not speaking English.
ouch
Did anyone say anything?
You have the best child.
We drink maple syrup for breakfast in Canada anyway.
Try retracing your steps. I do that too and it's probably increased my success rate to 3/10
Never pulled that one but I did freak out and start yelling once when I  got up to take a piss at night and couldn't find my pistol or holster.
I put my car keys in the milk fridge at the grocery store one time. Didn't realize until I got to my car and had to retrace my steps.
I'm never sure what to do when I'm in the middle of using a public toilet and the maintenance person yells into the bathroom. Does one yell back, or just finish as quickly as possible and gtfo? 
Had I been a year or two or I probably would have drank it.  I have it to the lunch room teacher who has known my mom for years.
this has been the most entertaining thread I've read in a while.  I think my heart is starting to beat irregularly from all the laughing.
Lol it's fun for that too.  I have a standard angry "THIS IS A 911 CALL CENTER AND YOU ARE TYING UP EMERGENCY LINES" speech for when they call the actual dispatch center, so I just give that haha.  Never get those calls again.  Would recommend answering with a fake agency name so you don't get some emergency call out of the blue one day though.  That could suck.
YOU ARE GOING TO LEARN TO WORK FOR WHAT YOU WANT
Just the very image of him angrily hurling coffee at the passenger seat like it offended him somehow has me in tears.
Imagine you drive past an abandoned house with it and hear Russian agents plotting to assassinate the president, using baby monitors instead of handheld radios.
Like sweet, sweet failure.
I knew none of those people where paid. They all just pass on the torch.
I would be flattered personally if I were old and some young thing accidentally carted me off, but maybe that's just me.  When you're old it's always nice to have something random happen like that, as long as you're not being abducted lol.
I worked as a greeter at a store that isn't Walmart.  One day I was thinking about how I had to go to Walmart after work and greeted people with "Welcome to Walmart" several times.  
I work front desk, and now whenever I'm in public I unconsciously make eye contact, smile, and greet everyone I see. Luckily, I'm in the south, so people don't think it's *too* weird, but I have gotten plenty of strange looks and I deserve it. 
Nothing I could compare it to, to be honest 
He was an autopilot. 
My brother did this- family of six (four kids, two adults) drives 30 min to restaurant. Get out of the car, brother isn't wearing a shirt. "I thought I was wearing one!" None of us can even retort, because no one else noticed either.
1. open banana2. discard white parts into trash3. pick the stringy bits off4. notice I'm holding a peel and not a delicious banana5. ...6. go back to bed because clearly I'm not functioning and need to turn myself off and back on again.
Depending on what it landed on I would have still ate it, but then again I'm more than mildly alcoholic.
Skype meetings are the worst about this because you don't have any body language to clue you in that someone wants to say something.So usually one or two people just steamroll the conversation and you basically have to talk over them for 30 seconds to get them to stop and give you some time.It's honestly a real problem with conference calls in my experience.
Like old beef jerky flavoured sand.
That sort of mistake is the reason I was nervous for so long about tutoring kids.
damn that's even worse since you left something behind to take the essential remote with you.
I honestly thought it said 1 year old banana... 
You tell those bastard tunnelling moles 
"And if you look to your right... you'll see my house"
If it was OCTranspo in Ottawa, people might have laughed about it in public but you can be damn certain they made a bunch of passive aggressive posts about it on /r/Ottawa.
Not as bad as not being able to find your glasses because you can't see without your glasses.
It's faster if you do it in the microwave
I cracked one right into the trash can. One tap on the side of the stove then right into the garbage you go! Liquid first, shell second, patience last. 
A heart stopped, or someone stopped breathing. Code red or code blue.  At least that's what I remember from when my mom worked in the emergency room. 
I rushed all over there concerned and apologetic and she's fuckin' arse-deep in a packet of ham and actually tried to cling to the door as I took her out.  She'd seen fuckin' paradise and wasn't leaving.  
These kinds of stories are my favorite.  Your brain was trying so hard to be helpful, but couldn't have failed any harder.
I worked three jobs once, and they all had different ways of answering the phone, plus, of course, my own phone. One day, I picked up a call at one job, and my mind went completely blank. All the caller could hear from me was "Ah, uh, Thank, hello." Pause. "Thank, uh, This..." Then I hung up. 
Most of my friends would probably just roll with it
He smiled.And said.I know why my daughter likes you.It made it worse
He doesn't want to talk right now. 
No, but when I was a kid I was a bit of a tomboy and wanted people to refer to me as "Pete". I think it was a regression!
And the circle of reddit continues
The guy who was monitoring our test was just like "WTF?!?!"
Wait what?
I did. 
Can I borrow your powers for a couple of nights? I have to finish my thesis.
He was piloting under influence. 
MEAT. LONG
I did this once. In pretty warm weather. I didn't realize I did it until I came home from work and wondered why the whole apartment reeked of spoiled milk. 
A really common one is she asks me what I'm doing (through text), then asks me again a few minutes later (after I've answered, I'd like to add). I always respond "you just asked that" and she says "oh yea. Autopilot".
I used to fall asleep talking to my first boyfriend when we were in high school.  My favorite was when he was talking about something mundane and sleep-me responded with "I'm dressed up as an Indian right now."  I woke up when he just said, "What?"
1-2-3-4-5, btw
*gestures furiously*
I need therapy.
Nope. Dead silence. 
he has some serious moments, i admit. other times he's a shrieking pain in the ass.but sometimes he's pretty awesome. 
yeah it was so weird he didn't even blink he just thanked me and went and got his mom. 
He did not, no.My hope is that he didn't notice me.My fear is that he was only pretending to not notice me.
Sounds like you had a few beers before writing this.
I may get fired before this thread is over
I used to be pretty good at making people do this. If you say "Thank you, have a nice day" in the right tone of voice when you hand their card or change back, about 1/3 of the time they'll just drive away. I got two cars in a row to drive off one day. IIRC, only one of them came back, looking sheepish, to get their fried chicken.
I told them I wanted heated seats, dammit!e: ty for gold :D
It took me a minute to figure out what was going on. I looked down at my hand and I was like "uh, I think you need this," and handed it back to him. He just took it like "thanks..." and went on checking the next person like it was totally normal.
Sir, you are a potato.
Yeah I hate when I get abducted
Welcome to Costco. I love you. 
so, safe to say Mr. Peepers was not a chicken then?
Oh yeah? Then what's his vector, Victor?
I think it's because almost everyone at the airport is probably there for an important reason
Absolutely. It's compounded by latency. Even a half second of latency makes that "who is taking the initiative to speak here" so much more awkward.
Did the cat like the cereal?
lol caked.
I think that is just normal for location based subreddits. The one for my area is like condensed bitterness. I'd never want to do a location based meet-up. 
Open the camera on your phone, it sees clearly and you can hold it as close to your face as needed. 
It's permanent, too. Charge it in the microwave once and never have to charge it again.
Gives new meaning to 'Netflix and chill'.
I did this more than a couple times when I was a cook. Cracked the egg into the trash and stood in from of the stove holding an egg shell trying to remember what I'm supposed to do next. 
There are many "codes" at a hospital. When someone "calls a code" it's a code blue. Hospitals have code teams that respond to codes outside of the ER or even inside the ER. Calling a code basically means drop what you are doing, this guy is dying. 
"There's a bug!""Uh-oh" said the programmer, as he rolls over into a more comfortable position.
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO BACK
I do this a lot. I answer my own phone by stuttering out "good afternoon this is ouionme...Uh sorry yeah uh hey hi what's up"
Just keep rolling with it until after the marriage.
Well, at least he liked it.
OK then. We'll talk when we get home.
That's amazing. How did they respond?
Drinking it in front of him is a real power move
naked is a drink wawa is a store
Seems like you played the part well. 
P.U.I. Still better than a D.U.I.
AS LONG AS THE MEAT IS, SIR.
Some meats are longer than others.

My mom will ask me the same question three times in succession, forgetting I already answered each time.
what happened after
Ah, so he's a child. (Am also parent. Solidarity.)
"Thanks dad....Mommy I'm scared."
*Shuts eyes tight* "IF I DON'T MOVE, HE WON'T KNOW I'M HERE!"
It all went downhill after his mom packed him a beer for lunch.
You are evil in a hilarious way.
I really hope this guy is somewhere else in this thread:> I work at an amusement park, and the other day I accidentally handed my ticket scanner to a customer. Played it cool, at least
Ah, shit, totally forgot, my brain was on autopilot
We have clearance, Clarence.
You think that until you start working at an airportSource: I work at an airport
Yup.

The brojob train has no brakes. 
No, just Walter, but he's shy. 
Shock and hysterical laughter ensued. 
IMma take the silence as a thunderous "no"
By far the best in the thread so far. Just imagining the coworker's face is fucking killing me hahaha
I mean, If I was planning to kill someone, and they offered me a blanket and pillow, I'd probably change my mind.
We got karma feedback cause he was so happy he got us ice cream.I fucking love ice cream 10/10 would help out again
... So like three inches?
Did you consider that your mom may be a main character in a video game?
It's been an hour. OP's dead.

Bruder is german for brother. So if anyone calls you on it, now you have an out.

You cannot even blame it. Kind of sad for the rat to having seen the truth.
Oh my.
He's a very special boy.
So is Pete a nickname for you around them?
I'm dying imagining him saying "don't worry, I got this. Follow me" and then him just day dreaming all happy driving along
Not to mention that laying prone on someone else's couch is almost the worst killing strategy you could use
^^^IT'S ^^^ABOVE ^^^AVERAGE 
the men bit her, now she's turned into one of them. A manpire
Great, now we have a radicalized rat.
Unfortunately. 
_points gun at own head_  "Imma kill you guys."
You can protect yourself by putting a chore list on your windows
Consider yourself RES tagged as "Pete"
Even today, that just made me laugh, thank you. 
This is really delightful, lol
He was a social genius among other things.
Robin Williams could find humor in anything. With that being said, I love how this sentimental piece was written by /u/SHITS_ON_CATS. 
Spoken like someone who's struggled with depression.
"Carpe, carpe diem, seize the day boys, make your lives extraordinary."
Fucking loved it. Proved he could step away from comedy and still nail a performance.Good Morning Vietnam was my favourite though.
I have been depressed lately, so the other day I went on Netflix looking for a movie to cheer me up. I ended up watching The Birdcage, even though I have seen it several times before. I picked it because I loved Robin Williams and he has never failed to make me laugh. I feel so honestly sad that there was no one and nothing to cheer him when he most needed it. I feel like one of the brightest lights in the universe just winked out and the world just got a little bit darker.
When he burst into Christopher Reeves room shortly after his accident portraying a russian doctor there to perform a colonoscopy...Reeves said it was the first time he laughed and knew things would be alright.
It seems to me that the most successful comedians always have an intimate understanding of how life can make jokes out of us.
According to his publicist he had been struggling with depression.
Good Morning Vietnam
You treat a disease, you win, you lose. You treat a person, I guarantee you, you'll win, no matter what the outcome.
"We are willing to help, Lord, but what, if anything, is needed? For it is true we can seldom help those closest to us. Either we don't know what part of ourselves to give or, more often than not, the part we have to give is not wanted. And so it is those we live with and should know who elude us. But we can still love them - we can love completely without complete understanding."-- Norman Maclean, A River Runs Through It and Other Stories 
Until we roll 5 or 8, Robin.  Until we roll 5 or 8...
Now I understand Patton Oswalt's Tweet. Thank you.
Eerily reminiscent of Oscar Wilde- "work is the curse of the drinking class." 
His vocal talent. Accents and everything. Very well done. Trained at Juilliard right? 
RIP Mr. Williams. We'll all be waiting for God to roll a 5 or an 8.
The thing is with Steve Irwin at least I could've expected to see him go in such a way. While tragic it was oddly fitting of him. But, I can't even imagine Robin Williams without a smile on his face much less depression and suicide. His death seems to hit something deeper because of how unexpected and unlike the image we all had of him. 
I don't think anyone could do it convincingly, this made me realize how one of a kind he truly was. 
My uncle saw him jogging in Hawaii--he yelled out, "That's Robin Williams!" Robin Williams heard him, turned around and screamed "Where!!!" Then continued on his run.
When your job is to make everyone else happy, people forget how to make you happy, because they are always coming to you for happiness and assume you are sharing your own happiness, rather than putting off your own worries to cheer them up. It's easy to think the funny guy is in a good mood all the time and forget to ask him how he's doing, especially since when you do he tries to hide his own feelings nut to trouble you with his own
I think it's a pretty common sentiment amongst performers (and probably fine artists as well). The unofficial motto of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts is "If you can see yourself being happy doing anything else, don't do this."It's only the people that want to act/do comedy/dance/sing more than anything on earth that can ignore all the naysayers, even when that naysayer is Robin Williams. That level of tenacity is mandatory in an industry where rejections happen for sometimes years on end before landing a big break.
"Heard a joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says, "Treatment is simple. Great clown Pagliacci is in town tonight. Go and see him. That should pick you up." Man bursts into tears. Says, "But doctor...I am Pagliacci." Alan Moore, Watchmen.
You could almost see both the pain and regret in Robin's eyes during that moment that he said that quote... I almost wonder if, even then, he was depressed and felt alone. I wish someone could have done something for him. Of every person alive, famous, infamous, or just a normal-everyday-person; nobody deserved this fate LESS than Robin Williams. One day we laugh and smile and feel our hearts warmed by Robin Williams.One day, we cry and feel our hearts ripped from our chests. HE was truly a great man.
Depression is a pretty fucked up thing. You can't think or reason your way out of it. You know it is dumb and pointless and makes no sense, but damn it hurts like a motherfucker. It twists your thoughts into awful things and lies to you.
Now that's dark, because in it, he plays a man coming to terms with his wife's suicide. He dies and travels through hell to find her, only to see her cursed to relive all the pain and sorrow and rage that led her to that decision, again and again for all eternity. This hurts to type. 
If I see a picture of him at the funeral I'll burst into tears.
I just watched that, I loved him. "Wait a minute, that's from Good Will Hunting....you're Robin Williams!"
I feel he would be like, "I feel fucking terrible like everyone else."
I've always argued against this rating.  That's just an score based on what Critics thought of it in 1991zSpielberg made a movie for children. There isn't a single person who was a child in 1991 that didn't love it. It is my all-time most played film. Hook was my childhood.Critics hated it. The children loved it. By all accounts, I think Spielberg accomplished his goal perfectly. 
The poem is "The Stolen Child" by W.B. Yeats, if anyone else is curious. Worth reading in full!
"This cappucino is tiny! It's more like an alpacino!"
Another one where he plays someone deranged is Insomnia.  He was fantastic in that movie.
Saddest fun fact ever. 
Mr. Fish - the movie.
I cannot handle watching his work right now, but when I'm ready, watching the Birdcage will be my own personal wake for him. Gah, there I go crying again.I'm so sorry you've been hurting. If it's too much to handle, please reach out to a hotline, or heck even hit me up. Much love for you.
He also paid for treatments Christopher Reeves' family couldn't afford. 
Oh man! That would be so cool to go trick-or-treating and meet Robin Williams. I wonder if anyone ever dressed up like the Genie or something.
Wow, that's really deep. I'm not being sarcastic either.. and yeah, it seems like simple cheap philosophy, but at the same time, there is a bit of very dark truth to that statement, especially in relation to Robin Williams' death. Man.. life really is fucked up :'(
Jesus, that is well written. Its dusty in here :'(
<hug> to you and everyone else who comments.
*huuuuugs*
This is a great comment. I keep hearing people say "I don't understand how anyone could commit suicide." If you don't understand it, consider yourself lucky. I was treated for clinical depression for three years. *It's not something you should want to understand.*
This one. I was talking to my son just last night about Robin Williams and told him he needed to see this movie. I think we'll watch it tonight.
It's not your fault.
That meme is going to be really sad for a while.
He brought humor to the role, but he preserved the character's dignity and humanity to prevent it from being a complete joke or a characture of a gay man.
This was mine too. Even though we couldn't see him, it's amazing how they got the genie to look *just a bit* like him in the face...So god damn sad right now...
It's a Rocketship!
Batty's rap stays with me to this day.
Miranda: What happened?Mrs. Doubtfire: He was quite fond of the drink. It was the drink that killed him.Miranda: How awful. He was an alcoholic?Mrs. Doubtfire: No, he was hit by a Guinness truck.
The powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse.
YES. This movie is SO underrated. And Robin just absolutely kills that role. 
"Thank you...for gracing my life with your lovely presence, for adding the sweet measure of your soul to my existence."May he rest in peace. In paradise.
Such an underrated film. I could never understand why the critics hated it so much. 
I can't figure out why no one is talking about this movie. One of my all time favorites. 
Totally forgot all about this movie! I'm definitely gonna have to watch it again. Was so sad to hear about his death, I didn't believe it for a second thinking it was some bullshit till eventually my whole Facebook feed was about his death. May he R.I.P. :/
 You treat a disease, you win, you lose. You treat a person, I guarantee you, you'll win, no matter what the outcome.
To watch that right now would reduce me and my soul to nothing but a sniffling crying sack of lumpy potatoes.
That was my favorite quote.  The theme and ideas are so pure in that movie, the delivery is so perfect.
It would be cool if all teachers everywhere had a moment of silence while standing on their desks tomorrow.  Too bad school isn't in session.
I make a lot of dumb jokes on this website. Sometimes people say "aren't you a doctor?" as if to insinuate that I can't be goofy ... being a doctor is part of what I am, but not all of what I am.
A couple of hours ago, I was watching the episode of Family Guy where everything Peter touches, turns into Robin Williams. After the episode ended, I refreshed reddit, saw the top story and just screamed in horror. Within moments I went from musing of a world full of Robin Williams to living in one without even one of him.
Maybe this was the jungle and God finally rolled it... :(
>Redditor for 2 yearsWhat an unfortunate time to shine :(
Those who are most depressed often seem the most content, because they don't want others to worry about them.
Whoever could do it hasn't been born yet.
That makes me smile. 
How many of you just read this in Barack Obama's voice?
Good joke.
When you're depressed, none of your successes matter, and all of your failures--real and imagined--loom large.
Gottfried's got me. 
Alcohilism and depression often go hand-in-hand; one causing the other.
"Sometimes when you win, you lose" 
Prepare for tears.
Oh man, I forgot this fact and thanks for reminding me. God dammit Robbie, why did you have to go!?
Fun fact: every single one of Obama's speeches includes the word bangarang somewhere.
I'm rather surprised this is so far down. I guess it must be a generational thing... 
I know.
It's not your fault.
So watch it now, it's on Netflix.
Completely agree. There is a very tender moment in the movie when he tells Nathan Lane's character something to the effect of "what does it matter if I say you can stay or you say I can stay? It won't be a home unless you're there." One of the more touching scenes I've seen regardless of sexual orientation. 
I started the movie thinking it was going to be dumb and over dramatic. In the end I was laughing every two minutes. He just played the role so well.
bangarang!
I'm sure you can get can get a pretty good idea of what voicing the Genie was like by watching Good Morning, Vietnam.
He's got another serious and almost creepy role in Insomnia too. 
I read this all in his Doubtfire voice. I'm smiling now.
Wasn't it a run-by fruiting?
i. am. job. 
The powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse.Think about that quote.  Think about how it captures both the helplessness of humanity's existence and the hope of defining why we are here.  Any moment where we feel lost in the overwhelming vastness of life we can remember that our purpose isn't to define life, but to contribute to the definition.
It's an amazing movie.  Have seen it several times.
My friend worked on that as an intern. Robin Williams remembered him by name throughout the production and even defended him when a supervisor was giving my friend a hard time. Even when the cameras aren't rolling, he was a great guy.
I think the problem was marketing. Commercials made it sound like a screwball comedy, actual movie was a drama. It was a faithful representation of Asimov's book, too
Our job is improving the quality of life, not just delaying death.
I loved this one:"A doctor's mission should be not just to prevent death, but also to improve the quality of life."
I feel horrible for his daughter...
No--don't give in to the "feel worse" impulse.  You're doing the best you can.  And you're alive.
Or discovered.
I've always thought of comedians of sort of the dark humorist balancing the forces of the universe by making us laugh at sad shit. Comedians probably spend a lot of time thinking of crazy shit that would drive a less creative person fucking insane. Hats off to the clowns.
How could you *not*?
Everybody laughs.
It's ok man, real men cry.
They were roommates at Julliards and they promised each other that if one of them got successful they would take care of the other.  
/u/sucks_at_people probably meant intentional suicides. ODs are often accidental
Yeah, this is too far down. It's one of his best performances, IMO.
It's not your fault.
Don't fuck with me!
Just checked. They took it off.
I just watched it two nights ago, and he played the perfect "straight" man (har har) to Nathan Lane's over-the-top hilarity. But the true star of that movie is Hank Azaria. He steals the show, which is saying a lot considering who he shared the stage with. 
It is
I hated Red Foreman for a month
I might add that Robin treated us all, we all won.
Or invented
I read it in the voice of Jordan Peele doing Barack Obama.  Luther chimed in a couple times.  He was pretty pissed.  
 Roll on snare drum.
And they did. The Williams family took care of Reeves' son after both Christopher and his wife passed away. 
I think he meant both since it can be often hard to tell, and when doing drugs in those high quantities the lines can be blurred.
I know!
It's not your fault.
Well, I was going to recommend he pirate it, but that seems wrong on a day like today.
It'll be on television soon with this news. There is going to be a Robin Williams marathon on every channel. He was that loved.
Eets tha shooz
Bicentennial man?
Curtains...
God, I would hate to be that son. Loses his mother, than his father and than his father's best friend in all tragic circumstances. I know that the son was probably preparing for his father and his mother to pass away (since they had 'terminal' illnesses) but can you really prepare yourself for that? And now with Robin Williams leaving, poor kid.
It's not your fault.
What with Peter Pan and all.
Awww, well how 'bout this. Give someone you know a random hug. Just a no reason, out of the blue, big ol' bear hug. Then tell them to give one to someone else, and then to someone else, and someone else... Eventually, it'll make it's way to me. One day, I'll get a random hug from someone, for no discernible reason, and I'll say to myself "Oh! That's my Dreamstakeroot hug, right there!"Plus, as a bonus, every person in between will get a small moment of random affection and appreciation. It's a win-win, really. 
Don't fuck with me!
R
It's not your fault. 
What if this is true, but you've never noticed? 
Oh man I'd kill for an extra hour of ~~sleep~~ watching old tv show reruns and playing with my phone.
DOVAHKIIN, DOVAHKIIN, NAAL OK ZIN LOS VAHRIIN!
They have to be 1/2 inch difference 
He'd clean the entire house thoroughly, then take all of the trash, dust, and misplaced items he's collected and toss them all into one important room. It would probably be most effective in a bathroom or bedroom. The genie could also "clean" the house of some things that would bother you if they went missing- batteries, some lightbulbs, a remote, maybe a door.
I see a loophole here. Buy one of those two dollar toy cars, classify it as 'your car', trade that in for a 1986 Datsun, sell the 1986 Datsun, repeat, profit.
what if you accidently rip off one of your nails? you're fucked dude. 
"Oh no, I can't find Spot!"*Arf arf arf*"Aw fuck..."
I can kind of feel the emotion in this one.
This reminds me of the "shitty super powers" game I used to play with my friends whenever we went to to all-night diner after a closing shift. My favorite one was telekinesis, but only within the context of making soup.Other winners included:- creating sexual tension- always knowing how old a person is- being able to turn on lights with your mind, but not off again 
Would it also throw the smell? If so, I choose this one too.
Just go to school in washington
I did this today... I work in a oil refinery and they WILL NOT lemme in without my badge... And I forgot it... Had to drive 45 minutes home to get it and then 45 back... Lost $50.... :(
Shitty part: it's always warm and mostly flat
The ol' bait n' switch
Granted, but you'll get $500 worth of shit. 
It's only Bud Light.
Fuck, I would use a real wish for that.
But it's only ever pennies...
You should specify what type of rimshot.
Could substantially change your life, though.  You could use it to get laid a shitton, especially in tourist heavy areas.  You would speak the first language of every foreign girl in the bar.That would be life-altering.  In more ways than one.
A kind of shitty burrito is a dangerous thing.
Why do you clip like you're running out of time?
So... double its size? 
I'm failing to see the kind of shitty part
Dump it into the self-checkout at your grocery store, or wherever. It'll take a few months to burn through that much change, but it's free, and using the self-checkout avoids the burning judgement of a minimum wage cashier.
There's not always an arrow, sometimes it's just an icon on the dial.AND ON MY PARENTS' 05 SUBURBAN, IT'S ON THE WRONG DAMN SIDE.That is all.
Dude that's not shitty at all, I would invite you to every shitty party I ever threw.
They said shitty genie, not download adblock.
I had a professor in college who only owned black slacks, brown dress shoes and white button-up shirts (the kind that are formal, but don't have an actual collar, so no ties ever). He owned a lot of each (showed us a picture of his closet), but it was all the same outfit. Great, smart guy but you're right, he was SUPER cartoonish. 
Shit aspect: one minute into your shit, a guy in a wheelchair rolls into the bathroom. Every time.
"shits fucked yo" end of wish
Pay with plastic. Boom wish granted.
"This is the last one""Id like a sandwich""Here's a fucking bullet to the head""Thanks"
Definitely shitty when you're on a long drive by yourself
That would harm me so badly. I'm obsessed with the old arcade game Snake. 
Call Vector Control in your county and say there are a metric crap-ton of mosquitoes hatching because of all the water.  Be sure to mention Zika virus concerns.  They'll shut that down quickly.
Basically the meeseeks ?
It's okay we'll just steal this question, reword it slightly, and ask it tomorrow while we have nothing better to do at work. 
Thats a stoned comment if I've ever seen one.
>Decoy snailsI'm sorry, what?
The shitty part is that the genie is the one doing the other assignments. He dropped out of high school and doesn't particularly care, so the grade you get on them hovers just barely above failing.
> but it's only BudwieserOP only said *kind of* shitty.
The shitty part: one of your more senior relatives cleans it up every time, complaining about it constantly
but only if you shower
that right there's a shitty wish
Wish granted, but it doesn't fly.  Instead, it drunkenly staggers about breaking things and trying to fuck your wife. Also, it's inexplicably racist.
A small portion of your wish shall be granted. I just upvoted all your reddit activity of the last 20 days. Have I done well?
Everyone would just assume you fake-bake....nice and shitty.
You didn't specify what stuff or where it comes out, so now every time someone sneezes, you shit your pants.
Nah, the real wish here is to have chik fil a open on Sundays
But that wouldn't be shitty, it would have to always be ar 5% so it's always warning you it's running low and is in battery saving mode, but never dies
The kinda shitty part is that you don't have to go, but you still get reprimanded for not showing up. 
would people be able to tell the difference?
This power is not ready for mortals.
Yeah well, not sure you want to lose 10 lbs the shitty way.
My inlaws have a Camry from 1984 and it's needed ONE shop repair in over 30 years. Fucking planned-obsolescence. 
You could easily test by doing it in a mirror and seeing if anything bad happens to you
permanent pink eye 
That... that isn't sleep, buddy.
>or have work to do.Sounds like my fault, for procrastinating.
Tbh, Dovazhul would be a cool language to talk in...
I think people are misunderstanding "kinda" shitty and reinterpreting it as "completely fucking useless". The original wish was fine 
I think you have *Shitty Genie* confused with *Satan*
> sell the 1986 DatsunTwo dollars!  Yessss!
Seriously those fuckers can go up to $20k.
They won't get ripped off, because then they won't be the appropriate length. 
Who the fuck spilled spot remover on the dog again?
WHO THE FUCK SAID THEY LOST THEIR 3 FOOT DILDO?! WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE?!?!
Well, if op doesn't have theirs anymore, I feel like this could cause almost infinite virgininess.
Yeah, he misses the smell of ass hair on his head.
Does it have the shit bits in it still?
my favourite is from red vs blue  The ability to fly north. You have to walk any other direction though
I imagine it like a magician, like Gob from Arrested Development.."Ma'am, open that bag of bread.""It's toasted.""ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?"
I'd throw it into people's mouths
It's as cheap as dirt. 
My work is strictly about passes but they always keep a couple of temp ones spare if you forget...And you're nice to the receptionists.
Ok? It's easier to chug that way 
Masturbate on the master switch.
Prono 3000. The blowjob machine. 
I mean, I guess you could use it for fertilizer.
$50 bucks right now would make life so much more comfortable. Just enough to eliminate a few small worries.
Get a bidet. You won't care if it's a clean shit or not.
An Amazon review of Metamucil: 'It's difficult to fully convey how much I love this product. No single household item has so drastically impacted my life. It's like thinking that the whole world is black and white, and then someone flicks the colour switch in your brain and you see rainbows and Haribo for the first time.That's how I feel about my new found bowel movements. This is stuff if legit, yo.'
Fuck, I knew I should have bought Coors. 
Once you give your dog knowledge, then it just becomes depressed like a human.
still, adds up and is better than a kick in the teeth
I found a hundred dollar bill on the ground once. I've probably peaked with my money finding.
[ ](/fl_excited)I call dibs on the other kind of rimshot. I've always wanted to be able to fart on command. 
Ahhhh but it's only after I've gotten drunk *with* them; so, I have to keep them entertained while we drink a lot, while potentially being mutually incomprehensible up until that point.
Pray the clay away really did it for me.
...but he doesn't see numbers above people's heads...
You are perfect.
Like I said, not worth the effort. It's the mildest inconvenience in my life
/r/UnexpectedHamilton
so anyway here's a mutant swordfighting a robot
well, average size but yeah
Every fucking time he said.
You overestimate my throwing capabilities.
Having been a "minimum wage cashier," gotta say, we're not the ones burning with judgement.
Most banks aren't accepting loose change any more, only rolled.  They exist, but finding one would be an adventure.
The side the little nozzle of the tiny gas pump icon is on is *not* an indicator of which side it's on, some just don't have it
That's the shitty part.
A better genie would load you up with uBlock Origin & Ghostery extensions for the perfect 1-2 punch.  
I'm like this, four pairs of matching chinos, four plain black shirts
Me too thanks
And when you have a quick sneezing fit in the car on a back country road, that would lead to true discomfort.
Yeah but occasionally that person is going to be you. 
rip osu people
From the people who brought you "Is a hot dog a sandwich?" and "Is cold cereal a soup?" comes "Is a pedal a button??"(It's not)
Salt it.
^started my period last night with PCOS. Sleep with tampon+pad, still have to get up every 2-3 hours to change both unless I want to change my sheets too. 
And if it gets really successful, we'll do it again next week. And the next week. And the next week. 
When the Americans are all awake. 
Yeah?  Well there's the old joke.  What do you call someone who went to medical school, but had a shitty genie do all their homework so that they barely got passing grades and graduated last in their class?"Doctor."
OK fine Bud Light Lime it is then.
That's not shitty, that's a miracle from god.
Make America fuck again
Holy shit! I did it and then I dropped the toilet paper roll in the toilet!**I HAVE THE POWER!**
It is to me
So, like German sex, but less efficient.
The dad only spoke Klingon to the kid, the mom spoke English, kid started rejecting dad at about 7, and by 14ish could not speak or really hear Klingon
AND MY AXE
You could fix a inconvenient loose toilet seat with the profits!
Still, getting and selling 1 a week for $10,000 (that's how much decent ones are selling for on ebay) would still be $480,000 a year if you took 4 weeks holiday off. Granted the amount of money you could make would go down as time went on, but even if you worked for 10 years you could retire comfortably. Even if we assume the toy car trick didn't work and you had to buy a real, shitty, car for <$500 a week, that's still a lot of money.That doesn't seem like a shitty wish. It'd be life changing if used properly, so I doubt it'd be allowed.
Probably the same asshole who took a bottle of polish remover to Warsaw
A dildo with three feet? I likey.
Yeah but think off all the great olive oil OP could make
Nothing like the smell of ass hair in the morning.
Only if you don't want it to
Teethshifting isn't shitty at all, woulda saved me $10k
But where did the toast come from? 
Who hurt you?
Yeah but the fertilizer is expensive as shit
Receptionists are the gateway to everything and everyone. Be nice to receptionists
God invented funnels for a reason
Shit, mate, I'd take 10 bucks now and be happy I don't have to starve myself for another few days.
Bidet? Don't mind if I bidoo.
>you see rainbows and Haribo for the first time.  That's how I feel about my new found bowel movements.If those are sugar-free Haribo, he'll be feeling those new-found bowel movements all right.
If it works, it's really Holy Shit
What's your daily intake of fiber?
Its like poetry
Unless you're always down on your hands and knees picking up loose change, and end up getting kicked in the teeth anyway.
You shall be called Sir douchebag, the dragon born.
There are three types of rimshots: one where you hit the rim and the skin at the same time, another where you put one end of the stick on the skin and then hit the rim, and for the third you put the stick on both skin and rim and hit it with another stick.  
>Don't let your spine misalign whilst in line - get America Online!goddamn
That's a really lovely thing to say
$2 for a years worth of inconvenience?! Even if that isn't your property it's still your throne. Just poo it!
the growing is NON-STOP
How do you measure? I start at the tip and stop until I reach a number that I'm comfortable with.
Me stars 
BAH GAWD
Makes me sad when a good comment is ruined by edits
Every fucking time he said.
Can confirm, the people behind you in line are probably much more annoyed by it.Looking at you, old lady who still uses checks, didn't even bother to write out part of the check ahead of time, and writes as slowly as is humanly fucking possible.
My credit union has a mechanical change sorter. It gives you a receipt to take to the teller, and that much gets deposited into your account. No fee if you're a member!
>The side the little nozzle of the tiny gas pump icon is on is *not* an indicator of which side it's onWell if it's there, it shouldn't be on the *wrong* side, that's just ridiculous and bad planning :humph:
Yeah, you try douching yourself with queso everytime you go to wipe.  After that, everytime you fart you'd literally be cutting the cheese.
One person would just shit their pants seven times in a row. Think about the pain that would cause.You monster.
Given /u/AlienVoice lives somewhere like London with a population density of 1510 per square kilometre then there is roughly a 1 in 12,140 chance of it being them. I think that's pretty decent odds.However if you're out camping or something then you're in for a shitty time.
Still better than spending the night crying in a ball of pain on the bathroom floor waiting to puke again. (Me, age 13-23, until I went on birth control.) I would literally rather die than go back to that.
Anyway, what was the scandal at your high school?
Doesn't look like anything to me
Hey, I'm American and awake.WAKE UP PEOPLE 
You monster. 
Fuck America great again.
I went for a wiz in a coffee shop restroom while waiting for my friends, and my cap fell out of my coat pocket and into the toilet *while i was peeing*. Had to fish it out by grabbing a dry bit, and put it in the sanitary towel bin. My friends arrived to meet me, and one of them left their wet cap beside the table (it was raining heavily outside).I recounted my story, and when one friend said "What did you do with your cap?" i grabbed my other buddy's wet cap from the floor and handed it to the first guy. *"I fished it out"* i said. Dude nearly gagged.
Yes, and probably bloodier. Lots more fighting and power struggle. 
Just to clarify a bit, the kid started rejecting speaking or listening to klingon, so the dad switched back to english.
Or buy one that's 1/2 an inch bigger. 
If someone's selling one on the market every week, it'll drop below 10k pretty quick.

A year in which I sit on the loo twice a week at most. I think you're vastly overestimating the size of this inconvenience, I literally picked the smallest flaw in my apartment. That loo seat will still outlive most of our society
Tip to asshole
doubling your dick size seems like too much to ask for.
If it misses, you're totally being watched. If it goes in, who knows. Could've just gotten a lucky shot. Better throw 10 more to be sure.
Long ago when I worked at a grocery store, I asked a customer why she chose to use checks. She proceeded to fucking complain to management about me after I finished with her.Excuse me for trying to understand the benefits of using checks.
My bank has a machine that takes your change and deposits it into your bank account if you log into the counting machine first.
Hay fever kicking in.
I have no other symptoms of PCOS besides that heavy bleeding. I've been on four different types of birth control and my PCOS powers through like a champ. Now that i'm off birth control due to my slightly higher than normal blood pressure, I get depressed, have regular cramping AND a heavy flow. Plus I can get pregnant with unprotected sex. Lose/lose all around
It depends, what's something the opposite gender does that you think is weird?

Make fuck great again.
This guy fucks. 
Not really, there are plenty for sale now, and it's not creating more supply, just shifting the ownership around. And the guy I responded to was talking about moving around the country to find new cars, so that would spread out the effect even more so. 
You'll be the charming hobo everyone knows enough to smile at, but never stop for.

I can't get the measuring tape over my head without it snapping out and rewinding, and also how do I clean a shit streak off my back? 
You can make a payment with no money I your account. Checks take 3 days to clear a bank. They can even bounce and then you didn't pay at all but you still have the food and now you're 3 days away.
As someone who also is a mental health cluster fuck who thought they had narcolepsy, get a sleep study.  Turns out I have sleep apnea, and the lack of good sleep resulted in narcolepsy symptoms. Tall,  slender,  fit, female.The doctor was a skeptical dismissive asshole when I showed up because I met zero typical criteria.  But when it came to diagnosis time, he was all proud to tell his med student doing observation that not all patients present with typical appearances.  
Make America great fuck
Give us this day our daily Mead and forgive us all tresspasses as we did not see that this was not our own home...

**Edit7:** Wowee a second gold!?!? thanks stranger!!!
it doesn't always work like this anymore. a lot of places process your checks electronically right then and there like a debit card transaction. 
Great America, make fuck?
Think of the sound that would make as he walked around.  Like swishing a beaded curtain.
And lead us not into DUI checkpoints, but deliver us from hipsters. Amen.
Just gild him $10 worth. Then he'll still have had someone waste $10 on him, and he doesn't get to use the money.

Shia Lebeouf
Can confirm. If they run your check through the little machine at the register it was just turned into an electronic transaction like a debit card.  Even if they don't do it right there in front of you it is pretty rare any more to have a few days before your account is debited.
And why is it "eugenics would be cool?"
Did he just say "making fuck?"
Found the Shitty Genie.
As opposed to the more confident Lebeouf
Had those machines for 20years in Australia but don't debit the account. They send the details to a clearing house who insure the check on the spot. It will reject checks not based on account balance but based on a record of passing a bad check or if the checkbook had been reported stolen.
They call the Magical Bum homeless. What they don't know? The world is his home.
My sister and I both had this before. It is often unprovoked, and a rare occurrence. We just blink, and wham our vision is 20/20. Then we blink too soon and it's over. I remember grocery shopping with my mother once when I was about 13, and I blinked and suddenly had perfect vision. I saw everything clearly and could read all the labeled sections in the back. I blinked and everything was blurry again. I was amazed and also extremely disappointed that it disappeared so quickly. 
He probably realized what it was and didn't want to get taken to crow court.
Sounds like some messed up version of Over The Hedge
Something similar happened to me. I was 5-6 and was playing outside with other kids. All of a sudden, those two cars stop by a sidewalk, they grab a girl on a tricycle and speed off. Only her bike was left. We ran to my mom to tell her someone got kidnapped. She was cooking, somewhat listened, nodded her head, smiled, "Oh, really?" and that was it. I think about it often. 
It seems you have the grim. 
could have been the colour of your shirt as well.i work at an aquarium, and as someone who wears the uniform, animals get thrilled at the sight of me often, just because of my shirt colour.

You probably touched a Brugmansia. They are loaded with scopolamine and can cause you to see things that are not there. Inverse colors are a common hallucination from them. Brugmansia are a very common garden flower, despite their effects, because only small children will be effected by contact alone. Did you have big orange flowers that hang downwards in your garden?
Abraham Lncoln Edt: Thank you knd stranger!
You should talk to the other guy with the post about doing his ashtray in the kitchen and never finding it even after a remodel
Wait what do you mean exactly? Like you fell in such a way that your pants slipped down and your back twisted over? Or you like, saw a vision of your buttcrack appear before you?
Could have been a Will-O'-Wisp especially if it was over a lake. The theory is certain gases like methane and phosphine are either ignited by lightning or chemically react and release light creating what looks like a floating light.
Can confirm. Saw it too. I was being babysat at an uncles house and he had a Super Nintendo that I desperately wanted to play, but he insisted on watching sports. I distinctly remember hearing that quote. 
I was walking to class and passed by a trashcan with a domed lid. On top was a bottom piece of a bun. As was walking by it, a squirrel came out of the trash can and put a Chick-fil-A chicken on top of the bun, then went back inside the trashcan. I assume it was to get the top bun. I really wish I took a photo of it.Another instance was a squirrel with a cigarette butt in its mouth.

We (people in southern Appalachia) call that a Crow Court. I've seen it happen too, just with one in the middle. While it definitely does happen, apparently no-one knows why. We all know that corvids are crazy smart, so I think the idea of a Crow Court isn't far off. Maybe the crows in the middle did something to endanger the Murder, or they're sick or something. Either way it really is surreal
That is neat. I can't come close, but, in around 2001 I was playing online poker (hold 'em) on dialup. I'd been dealt AK suited, played it moderate cool, then the flop came up giving me an instant royal flush. Immediately my connection dropped, and by the time I got back online I'd been timed out and we were on the next hand. It took all I could muster to not put my monitor through.That was the end of online poker for me, but over the last sixteen years of casual kitchen table games I've never seen it since.
A driver in my hometown (suburban NJ) saw a giraffe run across his path. He immediately pulled over for a cup of coffee, and told people he thought he was hallucinating. They tried to call him an ambulance, but then they saw police cars going by... turns out the circus was in town and had lost its giraffe.

We finally saw him walk past her house the other day. Very strange, we even Googled to see if there were any reenactments near by but found nothing. He's a doctor of some sort so I suppose he just has a passion or heavy interest in that sort of thing and has the money to make or buy those uniforms.
No, it was me. 
Insect?
That could've been the start to a real touching Rom-com or maybe even a drama, but you fucked it up.  
> This guys feet were as long as a pillowI love this comparison
If a creepy TV ghost mouthed the word "Floppydlop," I would not stop laughing.
Sounds like ball lightning
Here in Japan there is an urban legend about human-faced dogs called "Jinmenken". They are said to appear running along highways at night and have the ability to talk.
This one I can imagine is legit. Just not real. I used to get very real hallucinations right as I was waking up. 99.9% of the time it was seeing a spider or spiders climb up a wall or across the ceiling. Like, huge spiders. Sometimes bigger than could ever exist in nature. I used to go literally flying out of the bed, scared outta my mind (huge arachnophobe). But then one day I stared at one, too afraid to move, and it slowly faded away as it crawled. Still happens once in a while now- I just ignore it until it goes away. Anyway, it seems very similar to what you described.
My wife and I were in the dinning room and the dog was next to us hoping for scraps.  Then suddenly the bedroom door opened and slammed.  The dog immediately ran up the steps towards the door, just as I did.  I searched the upstairs thinking someone was in the house but no one was there.  What's interesting is we both (wife and I) heard the door knob turn as the door opened.  Clearly the dog heard it too.   It was also on a calm day, no wind and our house has no drafts.  
should have asked for a few 20s
Or would you rather fight 100 rabbit-sized deer?
Most likely a penis that looked like snoop dog to be honest.
My cat went to our neighbour's flowerbed. He was a roamer, so I can imagine that he'd been there before, but I remember him hiding under our rhubarb plant and meowing sadly a few hours before that. Poor baby.
Wherever you are, Magical Bum, we love you.
I will defend any dog in crow court, I'm very educated in _bird law_
"Uh... so what do we do now?" "Letting me go IS an option." "Fine~ Not like anyone will believe this anyway."
No, never heard anything afterwards. That's why I've been wondering whether this was real or just my imagination. On the other hand, other kids were with me and all saw it. 
I once wore a maroon shirt to a zoo whose uniforms were maroon. I attracted the animals everywhere I went. This is probably the right answer.
There's historical accounts of some of them lasting for several minutes and moving around doing all kinds of weird stuff, from boiling water in a nearby bucket to devastating explosions. Observing them out in the open like in OP's story is quite risky, you're much better off staying inside the car when it comes to lightning.
I just googled it and you're right, not a chameleon. I think it was an Anole. 
Followed by dump trucks.
I think humans reserved that name a while back. 
In Hawaii? 
Yeah, its called ball lightning. It can pass through windows, and is SCARY SHIT.
It's just crazy that Ball Lightning is so rare and has barely been recorded that as a 10 year old I witnessed it. Just did some very quick research and it was first recorded only 3 years ago (?) and we still dont even fully understand it.
Brugmansia are terrifying! Not two days ago I read a "trip report" about some dude who took Brugmansia tea he made out of TWO LEAVES *AND* TWO FLOWERS (one leaf per 32oz+ of water is MORE than enough), and the guy ended up crashing knee-first through a plate glass window and then ripped the back door to his house off its hinges with his own two hands. Shit is terrifying.
And it was a Shiny, too! What a missed opportunity.
That's a chalk line. Sounds better than someone catching him and spray painting him which is what I first thought. 
His buttcrack flashed before his eyes.
Lights. Curtains. Close thread. 
Literally swamp gas?
I have a cousin who lives in Kentucky that has a petting zoo.  She has a kangaroo, an alpaca, a camel, and various other animals you'd not normally see in Kentucky.  She's brought the kangaroo with her to family reunions a couple of times.
The real question here is who threw away a whole Chik-fil-A sandwich?
Oh Damn. Its 1:30 am here and while I was reading the last sentence my dad started shouting in his dream. Almost shat myself. Almost. Phew.  
Magmeato
He sleight-of-handed himself
D'aww. 
He was fishing with mates. They saw him go overboard. 
Crow mob justice 
Me too. The picture of cows laying on their backs, trying to defend themselves with their feet was also very absurd.
Yeah but this breaks rule 3 and four.Only two crows to a fight and only one fight at a time.
"for the watch"
> the flop came up giving me an instant royal flush. Immediately my connection droppedThis just sounds deliberate on someone's part.
And his profession? Business.
Why would they not believe you seeing a raccoon? 
There's also lots of small, barely-regulated zoos in Appalachia. It's far from certain that they'd report something like that.
Ghost ride the whip

I'm no liquidologist, but if you had two very viscous liquids, the less dense of the two being black, and you poured the white liquid on top of the black liquid, I figure this could happen.
Fences you can impale things on usually are. 
No worries mothbro, hope you got home safe
Sorry Tim.  Some advice, kick your heels off when you're walking down the street at 3am with a few drinks in ya.  That way I'm less likely to notice you swaying.
There's a *LOT* more to the story of that day, this is just a quick summary of the last minute or so.  It was very very very surreal.  I have no idea if my brain was forcing me to see things a certain way or if it was very supernatural.  
The other is Southern California. I woke up to one 15 feet away while backpacking in Cespi. They are massive!
I lived in Korea for a few years and the road to my house was rice paddies and fields and some forest. One time I was driving home late, and out of the forest stepped an old woman with long white hair, wearing white traditional korean farmers clothes. My headlights landed just as she stepped out. I floored it around her and headed home. No one believed me. 3 years later I saw her walking down tne street in the same clothes and a few friends were with me and we had a good laugh. I really thought Id seen a ghost. I feel pretty bad for speeding past her at 10pm now.
Nah, it's He Who Walks Behind the Rows.
And so soon after the cue ball? Dammit, quantum tunneling. ~~Your~~ You're supposed to be statistically impossible.
Nah, one sock
Yes. Also the kitchen was recently redone and it still never turned up. 
It's probably an open secret, or like, secret from the kids or something. My friend who used to smoke would always tell her then-4yo kid, "Mommy's just going outside for some fresh air." 
Not from KC, but I live on that side of the state. You sure it's a civil war uniform? There's a fort around that area that does a living history thing. He could volunteer there, or he could volunteer at a museum or in Lecompton. That area, especially Lawrence has a pretty deep, significant history in the civil war as well as in the territorial era.
From the context, he might have meant "spirit" (autocorrect?)"Sprite" is another word for a fairy or elf-like creature. Unless he's actually talking about one of those somehow dressed in prison guard garb, I'm going to go with the misspelling theory.
Or at least photoshop a squirrels head in a buff kangaroo with a buffalo wing.
Perhaps they meant Project Blue Beam
> Neither of us have seen anything like it before or since, have since moved away and the topic doesn't come up much. But once you mention "New Mexico", everyone thinks it's a joke anyway.I don't think New Mexico has aliens, but it is where they developed the Atomic Bomb and there's still tons of rocket scientists and military people out there. Who knows what's going on at Los Alamos. 
Probably a person, insects can't type.
More like a horror. OP wouldn't be living to tell this story if he decided to fuck with whatever freaky ghost bitch decided to join him. He did the right thing. 
Directed by M. Night Shyamalan.
Oh. Even the laughter of a 3 year old at 3am is terrifying. 
No way, that's still terrifying
That one made me fucking laugh bud
>When I was a little kidYou are now on a list.
Same! I was walking through my house and it just hit me like I walked through a cloud of my grandmas perfume. It was so distinct, I hadn't smelled that smell in years but I knew exactly what it was. It wasn't scary or anything, it was just super comforting, and then it was gone. I really hope it happens again one day.
Thanks for the nightmare fuel, Japan.
Yeah I get that, only it's always the shape of a person I see.Doesn't even end up being shadows, just a blank wall my mind somehow generated an intruder on. 
oh my god, just picturing my little cat doing that breaks my heart. must've been really tough for you.
Oh, *really*? Let's say you and I go *toe-to-toe* on bird law and see who comes out the victor?
LPT: when going to the zoo, where the same color shirt as the staff uniforms
Yeah anoles are pretty jumpy! Most reptiles are cold-blooded and need warm weather to survive. If they get too cold, they can go into a sleep state or die. I don't think one would survive weeks in hibernation, but it is possible that another anoles got stuck in the snow before you discovered it and warmed it up. Anoles can survive weeks brumating, but I don't think they could go for so long at freezing temperatures.
/r/unexpecteddad
Yes! More specifically on Maui.
Ball lighting chasing some teenagers through some woods could make a good low budget movie.
Got a link? Sounds crazy. 
Nah, shiny mice are green. This was clearly a sonic sighting. It's easy to mistake a hedgehog for a mouse at those speeds.
My dad used to do that to vermin. He had a live trap, and if he caught one, he'd spray-paint it bright yellow and release it on the back edge of our property. If he caught it again, he'd drown it.No idea why he thought rodents deserve a two-strike policy.
Did you ever ask him if he actually know what was happening? Or was it just in case it was your granma coming to tell you guys to go to bed? 
He gave himself a mooning
I really admire your dedication.
Kentucky Down Under? I took a field trip there in elementary school.
I think it just depends on whether the feed is scrambled. Most of it is these days :(
I did that once. It was a stressful day and I just wanted to enjoy a spicy Chicken sandwich. The bag broke which ruined the fries I was really looking forward to so I was already pretty upset. Then the first bite into the sandwich was that weird chewy feeling where maybe there's a tendon or something* that your teeth can't bite through and it grossed me out so I quit and gave up on the treat I bought myself. Just wanted to vent about that
From northwestern Iowa. We get a cougar every couple years wandering through neighborhoods. Last one they killed in front of a school bus. 
Sleight-of-ham 
Holy shit, maybe you missed some follow up story or something?

At the end of the day, you win some, I win some.I think I've made myself perfectly redundant.

25 Hours a day at the Business Factory
Heck, it might've just been out for a walk and decided to pull a prank before heading home. If it was there in the morning, the zoo would never know.
Or perhaps 3 What's New Pussycats, and it's just a really long song.
Also if there was some reactive contaminant in the mixing vessel...which he probably wouldn't have known of.
What else happened? If you don't mind sharing, of course. 
I feel like with the amount of picks I have purchased throughout the years, my bedroom floor would be covered in them. But I can't find a damned one of them. 
Right into the black hole that cars have next to their seats huh?
Where do you guys live? I want to make sure I never go there.

I mean, Area 51 (Groom Lake) is real. It's a facility for developing and testing advanced aircraft.
Do we really have to assume that all ghosts are murdering assholes? Why cant they just be chilling watching game of thrones with us once in a while.
I know right? Not even to try to figure it out or anything, just to have a cool story to tell. I wish I had weird/cool life events like that to tell others. My go-to "interesting story" I tell others is about the time I tripped while running down the stairs and sprained my ankle for a week. I would trade my sprained ankle story for freaky doppelganger story in a heartbeat. 
Like I wasn't before.
Just enjoy all the people asking you where the bathrooms are.  Animals aren't the only ones trained by shirt color.  
Why is this not a thing
I saw ball lightning one morning while I was on an exercise walk through a cemetery.  Scarier than shit.  Fortunately I wasn't alone. Just before Dawn.
I was reading through like damn this sounds kinda cool maybe I'll tr-oke nevermind maybe we'll leave chowing down on hallucinogenic garden plants for another day...
Can one of you draw? A drawing would be nice, since there isn't a photo. 
Yeah. He knew. I was young and didn't know much about them. Just knew I should be afraid of them. Smell of rotting meat can be a sign that one is near. He knew this and reacted. The smell lingered for about ten mins then went away. Followed by dogs barking like crazy again. 
We have unscramblers galore in Bolivia. They even get monthly updates to keep up with the new codes. Pretty sure you can do that with UK signals, too. It's obviously illegal, though. 
That's okay, I lose my appetite when I hit those chewy spots too. Sorry your treat didn't work out.
I'm pretty sure they're just trying to deny it to keep peace since it's getting pretty close to the actual town. No darker conspiracy.

These crows aint loyal
Yeah he was REALLY into jury duty
My imagination says that last crow pecking at the already dead crow was the grieving mother of a baby crow killed by the said crow. 
Cherish it. When I was a kid my sister accidentally let the parrot out of the house. Within seconds a murder of crows tore him up. As if they had been waiting. They didn't posture, no preamble, didn't try to eat him, they just killed him and flew away. Seconds. Crows are savage

My mom always tells me that when I was born she thought I was abducted by aliens.
Because it's hardly unexpected to find dad jokes on reddit.
That's fucking terrifying 
Filibuster! 
Shit like that is more common than people realize. Alien abduction is a little extreme. But post-partum depression can fuck a woman up. Sometimes they can't rationalize why they aren't enamoured with the new baby, and instead feeling all these terrible feelings. Many consider, and some conclude (pathologically), that this is not their baby. Usual explanation they come up with is an innocent mistake by a nurse. But with hospitals today it's extremely unlikely. And with DNA testing and all, easily verifiable.
Or faked his own death and took on a new identity to start a new life?
Thanks, very much appreciated.  11 years goes by quickly, and while I miss her as much today as that day, it does turn into the "new" normal and you stop hating the world.  Hopefully some random redditer runs across the story when they've got a lot of grief and it brings them some comfort too.
Now there's something I haven't thought of in a while. 
Maybe he's on Reddit.  Didn't that one guy who did an AMA say he faked his death from a boating accident 
Blackbriar
That seems somewhat fraudulent...
My sister was asked to go on jerry springer by a coworker, but she declined. It was the episode where a man was dating a woman who turned out to be transgender. Not sure what my sister's role was supposed to be. 
My favorite is the episode (no idea which of the ghost shows it was) where they hear this wheeze. Most of the show was them freaking out about them. Come to find out it's a really fat cat just chilling on a bed upstairs with a breathing problem. It was pretty funny.
I mean, if they're making you do things that you wouldn't do normally, that's literally fiction...
Someone did AMA about American version of this. He said he had to end up selling the car to cover maintenance expenses.On mobile so can't find the exact URL.
They piece together the narrative for these based on fan reactions. Social media is probably more responsible for keeping reality TV going than almost anything else.They don't like the fact that that BITCH Alison is somehow still getting all the attention from Tyler? Let's work with that, and make it so that she's actively manipulating him and really doesn't care.
"...we already agreed what it would look like after its done.""I know but at least act more surprised!"
Can confirm, Survivor is some real shit. I had a lecturer who used to be part of the medic team. People got hurt pretty often, although it was usually the crew, since there's a lot more of them. But exhaustion was a big part of the cast's issues.He also watched a fellow cast member drown, while on an expedition/day off on one of the islands. Those islands can be genuinely dangerous places.
Everyone seems to know a guy.
I'm just sitting here in this alley smoking Meth and next thing I know this 7 foot tall gorilla of a man and a skinny dude holding a bright camera are yelling at me. I start running and next thing I know the gorilla is on top of me, I'm sweating and bleeding from my forehead.
My friend was one of the rubbish acts. He knew he was awful, the producers knew he was awful. He was only putting on a character for a laugh. He got called back for the novelty "shit act ensemble" at the end of the season.Also, this is why so many people come out with shit like "I quit work to be here!" and are devastated when they don't go through, the fact that they've got through the untelevised rounds already has gotten their hopes up.
Even as a viewer, I've reacted to that. They do a lot of stuff that looks good, but they don't do anything to the bits that keeps it running and safe.
High attitude chamber sounds horrific.
"Wait, wait, can we try that entrance again? I don't think I seemed surprised enough."
A month ago Reddit told that the show was filmed in a recreated studio, due to laws pertaining to the filming inside pawn shops. Anyone know the truth?
My fraternity helped in a build of a house for that show here in our town. Can confirm, Ty is a dick. He just acts like he's god's gift to the world, and that he's too good to talk to you. Also, he doesn't do jack shit towards the build, they go off kind of like a Habitat for Humanity build. It was still a cool experience. 
> go to sleep around 11pm only to get woken up at 2am to film again to make them more irritableIs that why most looked dead inside?
They clear out the store for filming and select people from the line outside to be extras during filmed sequences. Almost all of the items brought in are prearranged. 
What they mean is that he's not outrageously attractive but also not deformed enough to have a good sob story. Perfectly average just won't cut it.
There's videos on YouTube showing them getting recognized during filming. I'm sure it's harder for them to film segments now. 
I wonder as well.  Some of those kids are ripping the carpet up and poking holes in the drywall.  Some lady comes by with a chalkboard and makes them do chores.  All the sudden they are angel and can't stand to see them go.  And the parents are incompetent boobs who become parents of the year by the nanny reminding them that their kid needs a hug sometimes.  
I had two friends on the show. There was a lot of disappointing issues with the way the show was made. They were very restricted in what they could do. Like not being allowed to go over that hill where all the edible plants are, or failures making it into the show, but not showing when they actually succeeded in getting a fish. Basically, the survival was real, but they were set up to suffer. And of course the editing filled in when needed for the "story".  Also knew a guy on Dual Survival. It seemed pretty genuine, but there were definitely moments where you could tell something was up.  
In this case the word "somewhat" means quite likely.  Maybe they said a few weeks thinking OP would be back in like 2 weeks but OP returned like 4-5 weeks later, idk
One of my highschool friends who is trans ended up doing a Springer show where they did this whole "I'm a man" reveal to their boyfriend. They had never met before.
My husband worked for two years as a tour guide at Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia.  It was haunted alright - by bats, cats and rats.  Never quiet, always something going on among the furry residents.  He did a show in the rotunda, and the audience was dive-bombed by bats and a feral cat kept knocking over the props.  We were both there many nights locking up by ourselves, and it was damned noisy for a deserted prison....but of course the other employees blamed "ghosts" or "spirits". 
My favorite for this is Destination Truth. The host is an archaeologist and part of the Adventurer's Club. He does another show on the travel channel now that's a little less outlandish in what's being investigated, but with both shows they go into pretty nice detail about the areas they're visiting and some of the customs of the local people.
Or more likely an undercover cop.
Haha for realz. To avoid that pitfall, the producer gave us an address that avoided highways 
When you get into the cab, they give you a rundown on the rules, and you'd be free to say "no thanks" and not ride anywhere.  But it seems fun, so I'd do it.I'd be annoyed at being hungry though.  There's no reason they had to tell to eat less at lunch.
> I mean, if they're making you do things that you wouldn't do normally do, that's literally fiction...Nah, don't you know? It's "REALITY" tv!
Not sure if it's true, but I heard they have that clause more in case they need to, but it's not something they actually use.ie- they find out a contestant is a convicted rapist, they can just vote him off the show without worrying that a convicted rapist will win the grand prize. 
There is no escape from the Bill Wurtz memes.
There's a few times (never aired of course) where the person came home and went apeshit that their house had been violated and that everyone had to put it back how it was otherwise lawyers, etc..
Wouldn't surprise me. Lord knows if that happened to me, and I was unaware of it beforehand, I'd sue. I like my furniture thank you very much.
"When I say 'Hello, Mr Thompson' and press down on your foot, you smile and nod."
It's completely random from what he told me, his tattoo really doesn't suit is personality and it's fading like crazy already, a lot of people say the tattoos they got done weren't done to a very high standard ie. not deep enough in the skin etc 
Are  you saying that all reality shows should have their characters replaced by pregnant 16 year olds?Survivor just got *way* more interesting
people like to look at nice houses I guess
The way it works here (in Georgia) is, as long as you don't sell it, or make an obnoxious amount that you MUST be selling, it's legal. But they payed it off as being totally illegal to even make it. And yes, we do have some "back water, back woods" stills, I got one myself, but that is just for fun and tradition. The good stuff is made in stainless steal vats, refined several times, and in a controlled condition like a storage shed or someones garage. The show was just all about getting ratings by pushing some ignorant stereotypes. 
I was on my phone and couldn't be bothered googling. Took a punt on the auto-correct. Totally wrong.Better change it before this hits front page and my inbox gets flooded with corrections. 
A restaurant I used to work for catered live celebrity chef events. Several of them were winners of Top Chef or various Food Network cast members (not the big names, but members of the teams that swoop in to help). They would send our owner a signature  recipe in advance, he would show up with one of his chefs and while the Celebrity Chef was making one serving of their dish out on stage to demonstrate the two of them would bust ass and make a few hundred copies to serve to the audience once the demonstration was over. 
And his ole mate olive oil. 
I was watching some American survivor like show and one of the guys who initially scouted out the island got bit by an extremely poisonous snake and had his flesh on his leg destroyed. 
> Koh LantaHa!
*tips hat*
That is a great question.  We outside performers just went home after filming.  I bet they did stay together though, just not same bed.
"I know a guy who's a specialist in Napoleonic-era French enema kits, lemme give him a call."
I'm pretty sure my uncle was asked if he wanted to be in the show by his friend. As for the item, I don't think he ever told me the part about where it came from.
I know that for Fixer Upper, they use a bunch of stuff from Chip and Joanna's stores.  The people are given a price to buy the staged items if they really love them, but otherwise it gets pulled and goes back into the stores.
Best episode of cops was"I'll get you bitch"or that episode where that lady was so angry at her husband she takes out scissors and starts cutting everything in their house.  Even her hair.
"I'm wearing boots of escaping! I'm wearing boots of escaping!" 
I'm glad he knew, I always felt bad for the shit acts because I thought they all believed they were good when they were basically being asked back for the public humiliation.
Kind of. You've got to be either really great or if you're terrible you've got to be a character.Kevin Smith, the fresh faced graduate who is terrible, isn't going to get anywhere near the judges auditions. Whereas, Colin Jones, the 56 year old plumber who's got a secret love for Spice Girls songs and is also terrible, is more likely to go through. It is an entertainment show after all.
thats weird that just because he works for a company hes considered property of disney.
We had Natasha Raskin as our presenter, Dickinson was varnishing himself up elsewhere.
Not always.  A few people got lucky enough to have some decently impressive engines installed 
wtf yer a car and a person??
Pretty sure thats because you were in the target demographic. Doubt many 40 year Olds were watching that like "I'd be so cool bringing that to the office on Monday." 
They are *really* experts at preventing this kind of thing from happening. I have heard stories of people on big brother where the staff was trying to push them to trash talk on other people and they would ask the most horrid manipulative leading questions and when they tried to refuse, they held up their contract and threatened to sue them for not cooperating.
$20,000 buys a lot of camo and cowboy boots...
I thought so too which is why I had my feelings hurt when I realized what show she was actually talking about. Because of the nature of the show it felt more like she thought my clothes themselves were tacky, not that she thought punk/goth/whatevers should dress more normal. One thing I noticed living in LA though is you almost never see anyone dressing alternatively, no dyed hair, no piercings, which is a lot different than I expected before moving there. So what to me was just a normal outfit was probably a lot different to her. 
Haha I actually have a feeling that might have been how it went down. I assume most people put together their worst outfit for the interview but I still had some self respect so I put on something I'd actually wear. I think if I had a pic everyone would agree it looked alright -- just looked like a movie assassin outfit or something. Woot let our spines fuse together! Ha pun. AS power. 
>can we try that entrance again?Why don't you take a seat over there... 
I've actually thought about how funny it would be if they show the guy getting taken down after he walks out the front door, and then it cuts back to Hansen just unwrapping the happy meal the guy brought with him. 
I went there a couple years ago. There is the pawn shop where you could buy stuff like a normal pawn shop. Apparently, the Pawn "Stars" come out sometimes to interact with people, but not very often.  One of the workers told us there was another shop they did the actual filming at. 
Everybody that appears on Pawn Stars has to apply and have their inventory pre-examined for authenticity.  It's not like random people bring in that kind of stuff. They also pick people with stuff that isn't real, to try to make the show seem authentic.
Adam Carolla actually called him out as being a fake. Asked him questions a real carpenter should know. It didnt go well, Ty is a phony.
Oh yeah. Plus the family was fairly wealthy and totally didn't need to be rescued. Meanwhile my friend's dad's house was still flattened.
You can, but local noise ordinances apply. Of course you can do whatever you want if no one enforces the laws or you bribe the neighbors. 
I've heard stories like that happening as well as of families who pretty obviously have zero money management skills suddenly get a house free and clear, worth much more than their old one. They mortgage it, waste the money, and get foreclosed. So all that charity work and good feels gone because the family ends up where they were heading in the first place. Another favorite is I've read people who did Fixer Upper would move out of the house and then list it as an Air BnB or similar since it has that 'star power ' attached to it.
As a chef I can tell you we are all dead inside
Yes, he was the host of the show then. I do not know if that has changed, that was the only season of that show I have ever watched.
Here's your ticket to Paris, you deserve better than this.
Probably about a 2. You sometimes get an actual documentary about animals, but for the most part it's Finding Bigfoot season 23 and Jackson Galaxy Cat Whisperer reruns
...because the ferrets learnt from the dog. It was his plan all along to get famous.
My favourite part was on the show they got all this cool stuff and then as soon as it's over they take a lot of the cool stuff back. 
The terrorists have won.
Was it where she was dressed as a hula girl? I didn't see the whole episode just a clip, I have no idea why she was dressed like a hula girl. 
Josh Gates is definitely in my Top 5 People to Have a Beer With list
But what would dust be doing in a haunted house?!
So are you saying that the cooking show opportunity was false, and that they baited you into cash cab?And that they abandon people hungry and alone and remote as standard operating practice?
Hungry people have a harder time thinking and remembering things.
"Scripted reality", as they actually fucking call it :s
Also on the x factor you usually have to have a sob story 
You could make a religion out of Bill Wurtz memes.
Completely understandable 
Like seriously, who the fuck thinks it's a good idea to redecorate and repaint a person's house without their knowledge or informed consent?I'd be fuckin pissed too, even if it was a quality job. 
It must be "De grote beurt", what a fucking shit show that was.
PSSSSTTT I think he is talking to you!
My husband is a tattooer and I've watched the show. Based on the information I have available to me, this is probably the correct answer 
Survivor would become the prequel to 16 and Pregnant
My husband started off passively "watching" The Bachelor because of me but now he knows all the tropes and can spot which girls or guys will make it to the end and thinks the show is hilarious.
Nah it's just interesting to see what people's houses look like around the world. Same reason neighbors are always snooping during an auction
Oh crap! The real estate market has crashed??! *drops smashed avo on toast*
Exactly this. I know it's fake. I just like to see the different house, pick the one I would like the most and then see how the renovations go.Although nowadays, everything in the US seems to "I want an open concept", with no separation between kitchen, dining and living room. And the kitchen MUST have an island or a peninsula.
Nah, it's cool. I do remember that show. It's hilarious to see that the most cheffy thing Aristos did was go outside and fang durries. 
See I'm kinda more okay with that IF the recipe was made by the CC. I dont think it will be very smart time wise to just have the CC cook for the whole audience
It's part of the Aussie food pyramid.
Naked and afraid
People used to do enemas for medical reasons a lot. Tobacco enemas were a thing in the past.
Nah, hands down it's gotta be that "I can break these cuffs" dude.I was on the edge of my seat when he tried to break those cuffs. Turns out he couldn't break those cuffs.
Nah some of them were just taking the piss.
Everyone and everything is property of Disney. 
Wasn't there one guy who got a brand new car because his old one was Frankensteind from two or three different cars?
I dated a girl that was on a failed USA network reality show "Vanderbilt MDs" where they threw a bunch of medical students into a house and tried to have a Big Brother kind of atmosphere.  She was the cute girl in the bunch and she explained that hey kept trying to feed her alcohol or get her into the hot tub.  However, she grew up in a very conservative household and knew her family would be watching, so she never did anything interesting on the show.  They paid for medical school and her housing!
Yeah it probably went down more like "hey we got a literal potato in a burlap sack down the hall, let's cut the normie loose so we can get lunch."
\*Chris Hansen turns to the crew\* "Hey guys what do you want for lunch? I can message the next perv from the bait account and ask them to bring some fast food."
The show is filmed in the back room with sets that look just like the actual store. I was an extra on it before. They asked us while we were waiting to go inside.
Go on any autograph or memorabilia forum, bring up Pawn Stars and you'll see people complaining about all the fake crap they've bought on that show.
Adam was a contractor so that makes a lot of sense that it'd piss him off for some dude to lie about it on a show. 
You know you've hit rock bottom as a tv personality when you start doing mortgage commercials. 
That's OK, it's probably half made out of cardboard!
Or if the town wants publicity and willing to make a concession for a short period of time as long as the towns name and some of its features are highlighted somewhere in the final broadcast of a show
Noise ordinances aren't enforced based on who's making noise.
We have the same situation in the UK with polish guys. Hardest working people, do such a good job, never complain. And a lot of people regardless still have the same bullshit attitude to them, that they're terrible scrounging immigrants. 
I just want to let you know we appreciate your hard and gruelling work^pls^dont^spit^in^my^food
Ever make your way to the house's interior?
Back when History and Discovery were still decent, Animal Planet was pretty good too.
What seriously
No from what I remember they were all dressed pretty casual/normal. The guy put on this whole disgusted act, but anyone who knows my friend irl or even has them on Facebook knows they're extremely open about their transition. 
Speak for yourself!
He definitely seems like an awesome guy. I imagine just listening to him talk about his adventures would be fun.
Now Luigi's Mansion makes a lot more senseHe was just vacuuming dust

"I'm just a small town country girl" ^^^whosedaddyboughtmemyownrecordingstudio
No, don't 
Where's the reality show for this? I'd rather watch this.
Right? What are they expecting? That the person is so overjoyed they completely forgot about all the other things that have been in their daily lives for years?
Pretty sure doing a makeover of someone's house and getting rid of their furniture without the hone owner's notice or permission is very illegal. 
Yeah, if youre gonna fake anything, fake the reactions. Tell them beforehand, have em sign a waiver, then have him fake surprise
It was so bad that it was amazing!
The people on that show, specifically that Sketch guy, are universally hated by the tattoo scene. He also steals designs from other artists. All sorts of controversy about him and this show. 
The woman always need a place to "entertain guests" and the man always needs a "man cave." Or it's just "not authentically [insert current county] enough."
Will it have an open concept floor plan?
I hope you insured that smashed avo...
There's always that one person in the couple that seems to complain about every little thing. "MMMm yeah I dunno bout this caaarpet""Mmmnoot feeling this kiiitchen""Yeeeah this one doesn't have a ocean viewwww"
She also wants to live in the middle of the city but also wants it to be quiet and charming. Her budget is $12 and she also has a sack of potatoes. 
Thats true, but we really have no way of knowing if it was by the CC or not. And they *could* do a large batch recipe and have assistants help plate, but I suppose part of the event is teaching you a recipe to cook for your family in realistic portions, not how to cook for hundreds. 
It *is* the Aussie food pyramid.
Will you be my enema guy? You know, just in case I need one?
That made for good times on YTMND
Yeah. They gave him a new Scion or something that looked like a cube. He had a handicapped brother and some other kids he drove around for his mother. I remember this one pretty well, I felt super bad for this guy. He was pretty young, like 19. He was my son's age and he had a ton of responsibility helping his mom. Seemed like such a sweet kid. 
Behind the scenes: "Now remember, this bad boy puts out 500 BHP, your fiat panda has an original 40 HP, so never EVER floor it""...and the new engine weighs about 300 kgs more than the old one, so technically you can't bring any passengers"
LMAO. "Hey bb, don't forget the lube and condoms. Also, some Wendy's. I need a #2, large, with a Diet Coke. A #6, medium, with a sprite and substitute chili for the fries. A #3 with Sprite. I also need two crispy chicken snack wraps and a 4 piece nugget. And can you do lite ice on the sprite with the #6? Thank bb."
Or payday loan commercials. *Looking at you Montel Williams*.
Look at mr. fancy walls, using cardboard! I built my home out of toilet paper and used McDonalds straws!
Noise ordinances are also probably not enforced when all the houses are flattened in the area.
stereotypes don't help anyone. I worked with poles for years and like any group many were hard working, especially the younger ones. Then I'd go home to my house share with 5 of them, 3 were on benefits and two were incredibly violent alcoholics who I could hear drinking all day and often woke me up belching. They were both women. People are people.
As someone who had a made episode shot at their school and others in the area, this is pretty spot. You basically audition, then whoever is picked they definitely pick a narrative. Without giving too much away there is some definite pushing and prodding of lines and things tonforce a narrative, but nothing too crazy. The work and everything is all real, and the celebrities actually end up fairly involved. Not the worst show by any means. The camera crews weren't super invasive either, they got most of their footage in at set times
Steve irwin's death also killed Animal Planet
In said AMA the dude talked about how for example he had a cool TV put into his car for the show and once his episode was over they took it back. It's kinda funny in the end 
I am ALL dead on this blessed day 
Which is the only reason why anyone watches his show. I don't think anyone actually expects he's going to find the Loch Ness Monster in a 30 minute tv spot.
I'd watch that. 
How about I do, anyway?
"No said everyone"
Trading Spaces used to air the ones where people were pissed. You should look for the purple house episode.
[Redacted]
Honestly, I always thought that's how those shows worked. Surprised that part is actually honest.Guess it's not that complicated when the family is behind it, but still. Doesn't seem like a great idea. 
The whole final season where celebrities would pimp a car and auction it for charity was amazing! I mis that show and its cheesyness.
One of the tattooists from that show is also in a new one as a judge for best british tattoo artist. The guy is nowhere near good enough to be able to judge other people's work. 
You can tell the "fixed" one because it's a gigantic black blob haha 
Sketch is so shit. Jay does pretty good black and grey realism from what they show. Then there's Alice: "I want death jumping a motorcycle over a valley of lava" "Okay so I've drawn this flower..."
God that "man cave" shit has to stop. It's like a virus of cliches invented by a TV show that's spreading to reality. You're not keeping up with the Joneses now unless you have a side room with a 400" tv, a deer head and a beer sign. 
I NEED TO SEE MY KIDS WHILE COOKING OR SO HELP ME GOD
Not always. There was an episode awhile back where the couple ran a catering business. The house they looked at had new metal shelving in the basement with catering supplies on it, a bed in the master bedroom, and landscape material in the backyard. Needless to say, that was the house they "picked" and they had already started moving in. 
The other day I was watching that RV show. There was a new rich kind of couple - the backstory was that he had "sold an app" - that was checking a million dollar RV. While checking the bathroom the wife said "oh, I can't stay here because there is just one bathroom sink. The thought of sharing it makes me want to puke."Wow, just wow.
Even worse is when it's like, "John sells artisan tinfoil hats and Sarah wrote the first paragraph of a novel six months ago. Their budget is $2.5 million."

If I got the opportunity to hug Holly Willoughby, I'd insist on at least a few takes. 
I'm surprised they didn't just install a sack of gold plated potatoes.
He seems to love dissecting modern society. 
The "I'm studying and I guessed the answer to a question, checked it, saw I was wrong but yeah I kinda got it and moved on" style.
obviously saturated board? oh mygodican't
Shoulda made it out of bidets and straws, uses much less natural resources.
And to be fair, I don't think they should be after a catastrophe like a tornado or a flood. When people are without a roof above their head construction should be allowed to continue 24/7 if you have workers willing to work that long.
Poles are totally random, can confirm, I'm a Pole. 
Killed Steve Irwin, too.
I hope this is only "the stuff we did was not actually street legal so we have to take this out so you're allowed to drive your car" and not "well show's over, pack it up boys"...
"Tryyyyy iittttttt" he said again
That show was terrible.  It was like they were trying to play practical jokes on each other instead of making something nice.  I saw one where they spray painted someones couch.  
I have a 100+ year old piano that's been passed down through my family. I would commit felony assault at the very least if I came home and found it gone/smashed in a dumpster.
Also the ones without identifying shots so that no one tracks them down.
Mum? Is that you?
Even in the video, they do it as much as possible. At the end she's like "please... Please stop... Stop touching... Stop touching me..."

"What do you mean I can't have a Playstation in the middle of the steering wheel?"
"Nooo," said everyone a little quieter
There was one episode where they glued hay on the wall! Literally hay. Can you imagine how gross that would be!? I just imagine dust and allergies like crazy. Plus, how the heck do you remove that?
I'd do it over the 40-year-old sofa.
50 cent
Ah yes, the spudometer
It's just a job to him, and the $$ is too good to pass it up. It's not a carpentry show, it's a reality show. His job is just to yak cool-sounding words, converse with people, and act excited/surprised/sympathetic at the right moments. He doesn't give a shit about carpentry. If it was a show like *Holmes on Homes*, where the host is very hands on and does a lot of the work himself while expertly explaining the process...Ty would get fired by the first week. One thing Ty has going for him he probably worked hard on public speaking and how to host shows. Not a complete loss, I guess.

I think your friend might also be my dog.
A few years ago, a friend of a friend called everyone in his contact list and left long, rambling messages. It was how I discovered my friend gave him my number. Fun times.Anyway, he called his best friend - who was my friend's SO - and left 2 full messages crying about how he wanted to live in Middle Earth. Literally sobbing. He had a drunken breakdown because he wanted to be a hobbit.
do you live in new orleans bc i'm pretty sure i said that a few times 
Hey now
I mean, I've heard much worse drunk logic. 
I hope you didn't let him
He had to confirm the kill.

He apologized profusely and offered to buy me a slice or something, I declined, he just ran out, the cashier said he didn't even pay for his slice that he dropped on me. I paid for it in exchange for the cashier wiping my back for me hahaha

This is the saddest comment of 2017.
Was totally your fault.
My wife does this 2 to 3 times a year, and the way she responds "you do?" is so honest and adorable it makes me remember why I fell in love with her in the first place.On occasion she'll also beg me not to leave the room  because, "you're my friend!" in the exact same tone.
Those aren't rumors anymore
This is why I don't drink heavily, until it becomes the reason I drink heavily.
Second Story?!?!? The maddest of the lads!!!
The threesome or the invitation?
DRAW FOUR TO THE GROUND
Well he was obviously attractive enough to get with two girls in one night!
Yup, that's the way it should be.
If there is a pool,  it's a pool party. 
yeah, pretty much how the convo went down except with a dutch accent
She's a keeper all right! Lol
"It's not blood, guys! It's not blood!"
I really had no idea how to respond. I just thanked him and hugged him even though I had just met him like an hour before that.
Yeah, a friend yelled at me and I dropped it in the last second :)
If I get you for a Reddit Secret Santa next year, I promise I will make you a lovely cross-stitch sampler- instead of "Home Sweet Home" it will say 'Midnight Is A Whole Minute, And I'm A Slut", maybe with some pretty flowers and vines along the edge :)
I'm invested in this story, how'd it turn out 
It looks an awful lot like they just pushed the rack back.
My first time in nola I hopped out of the car, walked ten feet down the sidewalk, and saw a guy walking toward me with his pants unbuttoned and penis flopped out, just peeing everywhere.
But he *is* technically correct though. 
I ended up making his taquitos for him
Surprisingly enough his phone is fine. 
That's what I immediately thought of.
I like to think that it's one of those "every square is a rectangle" kind of things. If you're wasted, you're also significantly tipsy, and probably have a heavy buzz going on. Every subsequent level of drunkenness also includes the previous level of drunkenness. It's like building a pyramid, except instead of getting closer to the sky, you get closer to the floor. 
Did you do it?
Three or four shots worth.  That's how I would quantify strength as well.
Yeah she was like, "If you're gonna send a dick pic put a little more effort into it" we were laughing so hard it was so unexpected.
5 more minutes of this, and I'm gonna get mad!
Dude probably has some kinda plumbing related PTSD. I hear shit goes down when you're a plumber.
The dolphins will though. Dolphins are notorious drunks.
Because it's unattended beer in a backpack? That's prime beer stealing territory.
I'm thinking that's how the accent developed in the first place 
As a brit living in the usa, even the Americans I hang out with get bored of hearing me answer the same questions about where I'm from, how long I've been here, why I came in the first place, whether I like it, whether I go back home to visit. The questions are the same every time, and get fucking boring to answer to every waiter, shop attendant, or person that hears me talk. If I could fake an accent successfully I would.
If they can do that with their bare hands it's probably best to just let them keep it
Or maybe just a person who tries hard and believes in himself.
"I know what I'm about and it's standing in camp fires"
For all those times you need to stand in a camp fire!
A guy with fireproof shoes is definitely rocking cargo shorts
Not necessarily it might be like those heat shielding suits. They are fireproof and stays cool on the inside. 
This is why you only do this at someone else's party.
One time I got insanely drunk and started sliding off a chair. In my drunken state I realized what was happening and said, "I'm falling." Unfortunately my fuck account was empty so I slid for an agonizing 1-2 minutes while saying "Nooooooooo" until I finally fell and hit my head on a table.
He said they were stoned, not drunk 
It's a miracle he didn't suceed in selling his scarf with that, honestly.
That's the only way to do it; Uncle knows best.
In my experience as a volcano owner, the volcano is usually the death of the party. Most casual smokers can't really handle it. 
Reminds me of a shroom trip I had where I just texted a bunch of people "What impact have I made in your life?" 
So now you don't have a butt?
60 percent of the time it works every time.   In reality, I saw most females start talking with him then quickly make their retreat. He seemed to be having a great time though. 
When you are drunk enough, the responses come out of you.
I spent way too much time trying to figure out what "k rap" is...
You know, the traditional New Year's bathtub fire.
He just drops 'bathtub fire' like those are two words that go together all the time...
No no, I want to hear first how this wasn't *a* bathtub fire, but *the* bathtub fire. Like this is just how New Years is done there.
Well he was belligerently friendly.
It sounds like a euphemism for something much more exciting
I WANT TO HAVE AN ORGY.PLEASE.WHY DOESN'T ANYONE WANT TO HAVE THIS ORGY?*passes out*
I respect you for trying. 
it was five shots, but the shots glasses were double measures. When I woke up the next morning I jokingly said "so who's up for shots?" and then nearly threw up just thinking about it

I'm three years off of my brother's birthday. I had to stop and think for half a second if I ever got drunk and petted someone's beard.

It was a joint venture. Pretty much everyone in the household screamed, peed and subsequently cried at the stroke of midnight.
It's an insulated box for keeping drinks and food cold. They're typically made of plastic
Who didnt?
"WoOoo! Two thousn' n' sevaughn teeeen! WoOo0!" *clink*
Yeah, it doesn't come standard but it is available as an optional accessory on the new 2017 model year.
This actually happened to me, on New Years 2012, in Portland. It was a homeless man inquiring. 
Like calling your teacher "mom" and living in silent shame for the rest of the school day. 
i've done that... then tried to correct and the recipient said not to worry. 
1 glass, no problem. 2 glasses, that's funny but I can see it happening. 3 glasses, we all know what's going on here. 
To alcohol! The cause of, and solution to, all life's problems.
Tell her I said hi
They kept playing a cover or Leonard Cohen's hallelujah on the local Christmas station, people realize that's a super sad, not Christmas song, right?
Yes, he was formerly the banker.
It is an otherworldly feeling.
I collected 5 of them, so no worries.  
Sadly, no. It's a human skull so maybe it makes them happy ;).
Hahah,"Everyone, I peed my pants! Great Happy New Year!"
Um can I sign up for that too? If these,are the types of gifts reddit secret Santa does, I'm so in for next year.
He did in fact kiss every person at that party before 12:01 
What kind of phone?
It's not a pyramid scheme. It's more like a funnel. 
Can't remember 
It's not MY fault this is happening
So long and thanks for all the beer
Turns out, there is no actual Scottish accent. Everyone in Scotland is just drunk all the time.
That's what I figured... like.. Merry Christmas to you bud.. enjoy your door
A man who stares at goats
He's a witch burn him!
He's also the sort of guy with no leg hair after standing in so many fires.
I love Frankie Boyle's story of the most Scottish thing he'd ever seen. A drunk guy pishing against the door of a house. He finishes, gives it a shake, puts it away, takes out his keys and opens the door.
It's the car dealership tactic:  First they feed you, then they take your money.

So, is this a one time thing, need a new bathtub afterwords sort of deal, or is a dedicated fireplace bathtub? Plz respond quickly, I'm on my way to lowes.

First day of 2017, reddit already stuck in a loop.
That's how traditions are born.
it was probably one of those styrofoam gas station ones
Look at it this way: you took the pressure off of everyone else by being the most drunk one. No one else has to regret anything. They'll just deflect by saying "Yeah, well, what about baenca? Hooooo boy!"
They had the same issue you did and mixed up "piss off" and "don't worry."
Can confirm, have done this and thought the same thing. 
>JyckleNice 
Well, if I stop drinking now I'm afraid that the cumulative hangover will kill me.
You can't trust those corrupt bankers
Not just every single girl. Not even every girl. Every *person*. What a champ. 
Seriously, OP, we all need this answer.
Now I kind of want to see a hieroglyphic of a dude using a beer bong.
You're such a puss, Bill. 
Can season 3 just be out already?!?!
Scottish here. Can confirm. 
He's getting himself a house, one piece at a time.
but how
Bathgate... What a place, what a people.
Ah, the ol' restaurant tactic.
OP delivers. Turns out there were trees involved too
Yeah, who contributed that peice of paper to the stack? 
Demolition expert perk.On second thought, wait.... Demolition amateur
Like "Decoy Snail"
How dare he introduce himself to me 5 times in one night, how rude.
Can't think of a better way of starting 2017.He probably kissed more person in the first minute of 2017 than I will in the whole year.
Even more shocking it was an iPhone. 
and it didn't cost him a dime. You'll know it's him, the shittiest house in town
We need a duck.
One of the oldest scams in the book. 
Oh that was Winston Bishop. We call him Prank Sinatra.

The Germans were meticulous record keepers, and a lot fell into Allied hands, at the end of WW2.
Anything that serious won't be actually true "declassified". Shit like MKULTRA had to be leaked.
Kudos to the tech who said "Three is good, but four is better"
Do you have any link or the full speech? I would love to read that. I searched around and only found bits of it in articles. 
I think it's called kinetic bombardment. 
If you think they'll declassify any relevant info, I think you'll be in for a shock. 
Why do you think governments are trying to regulate the internet?
They did this in the States as well. Very very disturbing history.
They mentioned this in the Great Train Robbery, that people would leave the factories at night so covered in phosphorous that their clothes would glow in the dark.  Life in early industrial Europe was pure shit.
I read somewhere that the German higher-ups didn't trust their low level workers and soldiers to carry out their orders against the jews thoroughly, so they made them fill out paperwork meticulously, thus that is the reason there is so much documentation of the holocaust. 
The only confederate war prisoners that were executed were the commanders of the prison camps.
the evil experiments they are doing today will still be classified.scary to think what will be posted to a thread like this in 70 years time.
Largely for the same reason, if the US were to nuke Russia it would probably send more than 1 nuke.
You call your hamburgers steamed hams?
I mean, doesn't everyone know that different police forces do this? There's literally a phrase for it: "agent provocateur".
So far?  Only if you're a frog.
For some reason I love the idea of a nuclear powered rocket whose only attack ability is to fly all over the place at Mach 5 breaking shit with shockwaves.
Appropriate for a weapon. 
This could be the cause of the speculation of "Chem-Trails". Well, it's a plane instead of boats of course.
What was crazy to me was the scale. Usually when you hear about these cult communes it's like a handful of people - maybe 100 people if that. This was over 900 people. Over 900 people willingly took their lives for a crazy idea. They also murdered a congressman.
The distorted music does add to the eerieness of the tapes.
I think they'll reclassify it all.  It won't be declassified until everyone who remembers it is dead and it's of historical interest only.
Two is one and one is none 
There was also a nuke accidentally dropped on Mars Bluff, SC back in 1958.
Wait, so it could have been 200 times the size of fat man... fiddily fuck that shit RIGHT off.
From what I can gather nuclear bombs don't detonate by themselves. They need to be triggered. So it just disintigrated on ground impact.Meaning they are not impact sensitive. They get triggered.
I can't believe that we survived so many close calls during the Cold War. It's a miracle that we didn't blow each other to bits.
For most people the thought was "Ok, go to Texas or Mississippi for a long weekend, come back, tarp up the roof and go to work afterwards."  
It was very surreal. I was a senior in high school at the time. Was napping on the couch and woke up to that bulletin. It was too late to go anywhere at that point. 
I was listening to Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy today and you reminded me of this. "It is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it... anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job". - Douglas Adams.
A bad sci-fi author
I feel like this advice might also work in a non-assassination context
The sixth symptom of groupthink is the illusion of morality, in which members participating in the group decision-making process tend to lose sight of their personal moral principles. Rather, belief in the overall morality of the group overrides any individual sense of right and wrong.
You'd pretty much lose all sense of yourself and reality, I can't imagine going through that
So the UnaBomber left Harvard in 1969, and that report was published in 1976. I was too lazy to read it all, but did anyone read it and confirm the unabomber was a victim? That would be some next level shit. If anyone was wondering he's 74 and currently serving 8 life sentences if my Max Payne trivia is on par 
it was mostly about trauma-based mind control.  Torture someone till they break and program them with whatever the fuck you want.  Evil shit, honestly.  I'm pretty sure the conspiracy theorists are right to some degree that kids are being run through this process.  I'm not sure the CIA does it any more but likely something more underground. I don't know.  There is too many terrible things in the world and I can barely stand it some days.
Just "The 4th Kind" and it is a very scary movie. 
Seriously, what's the worst that could happen. Best case scenario you got a new superweapon of people who can look into the office of USSR secretary, realistic case scenario you wasted a time of a few interns
Some odd million years from now some space squid from Europa will be looking at a barren scorched Earth thinking. I wonder what happened there!
There was actually a similar interview on NPR recently (last week or 2 weeks ago). Someone who had been writing a book on some of the CIA's research in psychic phenomenon basically said that yes, the material is crazy to be researching, BUT, when we have the budget and the means to scientifically analyze what's going on, why not just verify. After all, if it turns out all the crazy powers and phenomenon are true, why wouldn't you want to be able to utilize it?
The most fucked up part? His "drug cocktail" to erase memory appeared to have worked. While trying to find victims, only two were found because others asked about it recognized tattoos on the women. When the women were approached they offered to talk to law enforcement but had no recollection of anything even remotely like that. Then the moment they heard the audio from the tape the memories came flooding back and they remembered everything.Last Podcast on the Left has a pretty good episode covering this.
Yes, many of his victims were released after he got tired of raping and torturing them.  Before he went in search of a new victim he would typically let the previous one go.
I was not prepared.
Declassified. Its always the act of revealing that is surprising.  Humanity are capable of anything.
"What we're telling them to do is so bad, we don't expect people to do it. So instead of saying 'fuck that, no' we're gonna make them prove that they did it."
Well the atrocities didn't become public for quite some time so many parents didn't know what was happening to their children. IIRC, most were orphaned children or young adults that couldn't take care of themselves because of their disabilities. 
It was directed by an alum of my high school so we watching it in a class and it's honestly a fantastic documentary. They really capture the air of uncertainty around the Crospy case and the feeling of horror that plagued Staten Island while he was on the loose. Chilling is really the best way to describe it. 
If you look at the time line the Tuskegee trials started 2 decades before Willowbrook and lasted almost 3 times as long. I would say Tuskegee is where they hot the idea to do the tests at Willowbrook.  The only thing more disturbing is that they started Willowbrook after the defeat of the Nazis and should have known better.
Good thing they didn't know about the SUNDIAL. 
Yeah this still happens today all over the world.Can't legally arrest peaceful protestors? Then make then violent. Helps with PR too as it makes the protesters less sympathetic. 
It's absolutely not cost-effective
Let's agree not to kill each other's kids.Don't attack clinics or the medics, we both need to help our wounded.Long ago people would trade PoWs back and take breaks at night, in winter, or during holidays.The goal is to keep the battle contained and restrict suffering. Our soldiers fight yours, and if we get a win condition we stop. After all, we all had lives before this that we kind of don't want to be super shitty when we finish the fight.This only works when both sides agree though. 
Another thing about chemical weapons is that soldiers can prepare and defend against them (gas masks, mopp suits) while civilians would be helpless. 
fuck
Jesus fuck.The Sundial probably could've burnt and irradiated nearly everywhere on earth regardless of detonation area.Holy shit. The dude who designed didn't stop to think at all if he should do it.Why would anyone ever need a weapon that absurdly destructive, to the point you could irreperablly damage the earth and kill literally billions of people? That's just... Wrong.
It's endurance is described in *weeks*. That's serious shit.
The Ministry of Defence tends toward random names that don't hint at what the project actually is while the Department of Defense likes to give the game away on the front page, a bit like the Germans during the war.
Also neutron flux/gamma radiation being radiated from it. It was a 600MW reactor, basically 1/3 nuclear plant, unshielded. Really not something I would want to stand close to
A lot of them didn't do it willingly. There were guards forcing them to with guns.
Once everyone who was involved is dead, the docs will be released.
I think he's saying it won't be creepy because it'll be mostly images or files stating mild stuff like that. 
Imagine screwing up the autopsy of the President of the United States.
Optimists believe we live in the best of all possible worlds.Pessimists fear this to be true.
I've always loved military understatement.
Yeah, no core in it, though.I lived in Florence for a few years, found out about that then...creepy to think about how irresponsible we are with our nukes, then realize Russia has them too, then watch a dashcam video from Russia and think...how are we all possibly still here...
Only seems fair really. 
That's why they invented ICBMs. We no longer have nuclear armed bombers on permanent patrol.
Cant help but think people would point fingers at the soviets too. Nuclear war avoided.
From what I've read and found,  most nuclear explosions are in air,  meaning timed or altitude triggered. Don't quote me on it though. 
Isn't there any ethics approval for experiments in US? WTActualF 
And Beeblebrox was perfect because he didn't care for governing. He made the people happy. That is until he stole The Heart of Gold. 
Or to quote Frank Herbert, author of Dune:    > All governments suffer a recurring problem: Power attracts pathological personalities. It is not that power corrupts but that it is magnetic to the corruptable.
Another lol:> In the hands of an expert, a powerful pistol is quite deadly, but such experts are rare and not usually available for assassination missions."oh btw Steve on your way home could you assassinate someone for me?""Sorry Mike I don't have any time on my schedule."
They may have planned ahead. The article mentions how at least one woman was told to fake a pregnancy by wearing padding and such so she would appear to be pregnant
Yup, the Soviets. It was a serious consideration at the time.If you fancy having the shit scared out of you, go and have a watch of the BBC drama Threads (readily available online) which dates from that period and depicts exactly what would happen to one of England's biggest cities in the event of a war. I was born well after it was produced and well after nuclear war was even a possibility but it still scares the fuck out of me.
but doesnt acid lose half the power of its dose if you use it the next day, for example if you do 100ug one day, and do the same amount the next day it would only feel like taking 50ug?
Hah, that's one helluva occupational hazard. "Spontaneous psychedelic experiences may occur." 
I've heard 4 life sentences, but yeah, this is what Wikipedia has to say; >As a Harvard undergraduate, Kaczynski was among twenty-two students who were research subjects in ethically questionable experiments conducted by psychology professor Henry Murray from late 1959 to early 1962.
The flashbacks of being terrified by this movie are coming back. 
Who says it can't be both?
Worst case? An enemy spends the money and you don't, then turns out it *works.*
Until some Jupiterian Overlord orders the Europan Army to finally advance on Saturn and it's moons, hoping to conquer and defeat The Saturnistic ideology because they are a bunch of dirty space cucumbers who keep picking fights for no reason and are slowly spreading throughout the solar system.
> Then the moment they heard the audio from the tape the memories came flooding back and they remembered everything.This is fucking horrifying, I imagine that flood of information could near destroy your mind.
It's the taped intro for his victims. He basically explains the victim will become a sex slave in horrific detail.
Exactly.  It really bit them in the ass when they lost the war.The allies knew exactly who did what.
If it were any other country, yeah, but even that wouldn't be able to take out Russia. Just too much space.
You also need to already have clouds, it doesn't just make water from nothing.
the higher the stakes, the more chance these gentlemanly rules get subverted
The Sundial blast would've been the size of Texas. The fallout and subsequent nuclear winter would have probably killed almost everyone on the planet.
There was a guy on NPR talking about Jones town. He said over half the people were either kids or elderly who would have had no way surviving in the jungle and would die either way. Basically the mos of the people had no real choice in the matter
And you can imagine people being a little hesitant to raise their hands and admitting to accidentally nuking North Carolina. That delay could be absolutely fatal: someone's nuked NC and the military aren't saying anything.
Damn, I'd go just to look at the sign. I mean, look how impressive it is. Really carries the weight of what nearly happened there. 
This and nazi experiments are why there is ethical approval now, before that there was nothing
Even then, his job wasn't to govern, it was to distract the people from who was *really* in charge.
Or Terry Pratchett> Some chief went to prison to see the prime minister and said, 'Mate, your mob can dig it all up and drop it over the edge of the world, no worries.'> > 'Why did he have to go to prison?'> > 'We put all our politicians in prison as soon as they're elected. Don't you?'> > 'Why?' >>'It saves time.' 
What level is tom cruise & john travolta?Ooh. And will smith.
My God, they've created a pay to win game!!!
Smart of your grandma. I would assume they'd just give the kid a different name though (once they took her). 
>after nuclear war was even a possibilitySo we're in the clear now? Phew!
Yes, it makes me wonder how space travel would be different if those men hadn't come back. 
Well it's not exactly 50% but yes, LSD tolerance builds very quickly. However with government approval and a lab large amounts of pure LSD can be easily synthesised. So whose to say they weren't giving these people MASSIVE doses of lsd toward the end of the experiment to keep consistent results?
Makes me wonder how the other 21 are doing...
Yeah, that was quite the exaggeration.  These aren't even close to Google Maps quality.
That Owl still freaks out my sister.
It's like the scene in Finding Dory when Dory suddenly remembers her parents. Except, it's not that wholesome.    
To further elaborate on the above. We aren't talking like a paragraph of extreme detail here.We are talking like a full on page or two about him and his buddies getting off on watching his dog rape the victim in more detail than you can be prepared for. I think the beastiality portion is what fucked me up and stuck with me all this time more than anything. But there isn't a "that's not so bad" part to any of the transcript  
Sounds silly but this would be the perfect defensive weapon. Don't attack us or we will detonate it and everyone loses. This was part of the plot of Dr. Strangelove. The Russians couldn't keep up with the us economic system so they built a weapon that would wipe out all life if a nuclear explosion went off in their territory. The problem is that once this weapon was built and the design known all it would take is some rogue state to say we all lose and boom. Game over planet earth. 
"I think the moon would look better if we added another crater riiiiight here."
I had no idea this was in Guyana until you said jungle. I honestly thought this happened in the U.S. 
You should read up on Jim Jones, he was nuts near the end. Apparently he would give people Kool-Aid tell them it was poisoned as a test on a regular basis to see if they would drink it before he actually did this.
Well, that's the most depressing sentence I've read in a while. 
Machi and her mom both fled to the US (they had enough money to get out luckily), so now her name is more of a reminder  of how close she was to losing her freedom and family. Her mom was also a badass sweetheart who swore like a sailor until she passed away in her late 90's. I should mention that Machi is my Tia in the sense that I have known her from birth - I actually don't have any aunts on my mom's side, so my mom's lifelong friends have become 'Tia' very quickly. 
I feel you. It's because it is so utterly blunt about what it's displaying that it's so effective. The special effects are ramshackle and low budget and they simply didn't have the money to make it flashy, so what you get is just an hour and a half of normal people suffering presented as casually as a kitchen sink drama.I know someone who remembers being shown it in school, which is practically child abuse.
I read somewhere that procedure was that NASA would cut communications. Imagine that, being stranded on the moon, just you and one other person until you suffocated to death. Scary stuff.
There are very few things I know about on the Internet that I steer clear of because I just don't want to deal with them:- this one- and the video/audio of the guy driving along when a brick comes through the windshield and obliterates his wife's head.I know there's a ton more along those lines but I don't go looking for that sort of stuff, these two both come up on Reddit occasionally and are staying blue.
That was the philosophy of most of the arms race at a point. Dr. Strangelove wasn't just some goofy movie, but it was an analysis and criticism of the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction. 
They also assassinated a member of Congress who came down to investigate
He was nuts from the start. I was there. I saw him on stage in SF around 1975. 
The idea was to let them die in peace and with privacy, not broadcasting their every panicked word to everyone on Earth.
That's exactly the line that got me thinking. 
if you think there's not at least one division working on that tech, you're out of your mind
Real life wallhacks
There is Mutually Assured Destruction and then there is Mutually Assured Destruction via SUICIDE BOMBING.
I think North Korea uses these sorts of bluffs. 
Yup. Exactly
As someone who works in a control environment I'd imagine it's also taking into account that listening in to them as they died would just break the comms guy and ruin his life...
I assume their families would be allowed to say farewells.
Yeah, I don't see any reason not to maintain communication in this situation if the technology allows it.
With all the free information we are divulging on social medias, they would know us better than we know ourselves by know most likely
Taliban must have felt laggy as fuck.
Sundial - when MAD is not both hardcore AND fucked up enough.
Eventually NK is going to say:"You know what? Fuck trying to launch a missile at them, build a giant underground fallout shelter and a **giant** bomb."
The thing is, they were actually drinking Flavor Aid. It wasn't even Kool-Aid. So it's probably doubly annoying for Kool-aid execs.
That's what I was thinking. I'd hate to cut them off, but if I was responsible for the people listening, I'd have to do it. Mostly because I would be afraid they'd be like me and feel an obligation to keep communication open and it would fuck them up. It's better for the person in charge to feel like shit for the rest of their lives than expect their subordinates to. 
What is it with cults cutting corners and getting off brand crap? Kool Aid isn't even that expensive. 
That could also apply to muggers.

Not all jobs need college.  Nobody can answer that question until you know what you're gonna do.College is expensive, but very rewarding and can lead you to a great career that pays well.  You have to decide for yourself -- is it worth it?

It requires licenses that take time and money to earn, but can prove to be profitable if you are willing to put in the time.

I'd say I work roughly 40 hours a week, though it varies. I'm working a bit more now that I'm live streaming several times per week. I work a lot on the weekends.My friends generally are very interested in my job, its much easier to relate to the minutiae of my job than a normal desk job. I also get a fair number of video ideas from my friends, and they like that sort of limited involvement.
Varies widely, but activities include playing around with random ideas in minecraft (sometimes as a vague as "what are some cool things I can do with x block"), livestreaming for 3 hours, browsing reddit a lot, checking comments on my videos, writing some experimental code, and, of course, building things in minecraft and recording videos.For various reasons I can't/won't say how much I make, but it's enough that I don't worry about paying the bills.

In terms of interesting?  Getting to work with friends who had birds of prey.  They're just fascinating animals!

I work as a grip in the United States (whose job duties differ from UK and Euro grips). Short description is non-electrical lighting (with mirrors, white foam boards, large rags often made of cloth to diffuse light), or rigging lights or cameras to places they don't normally belong. If a camera isn't on a tripod or a light isn't on a stand, a grip or rigger will make it so! Example: wheeling the camera on a dolly on tracks, booming the camera on the end of a long jib, rigging lights to ceilings or onto cars, etc.

The "reddit all day" sounds bad but its really not. His job is to fix things when they break, but a good system admin will manage to engineer a network that never breaks. If your sysadmin seems to be doing nothing all day that just means he's great at his job. If they're constantly running around putting out fires then they suck at it. It's counter-intuitive.

You meet other filmmakers, talk about your passion for editing, see what they're working on, let them know you're interested and see where it goes.    Generally you build connections over the years after learning who you trust and like to work with. It's a process for most of us, unless you were born into the trade.

There's a lot of serious risks that come with it. Arterial Gas Embolism, Decompression Sickness, Pulmonary Over Inflation Syndrome and that's really just the tip f the iceberg. All of which can be life threatening. Most of those risks can be avoided, however. 
I'd probably try to stay in the video gaming world. Move on to other games, or even game development.
If anything, it makes you appreciate the good movies even more since you understand how much hard work went into them. 
The military as a whole has a lot of jobs to offer. We're just the militarized/deployable versions of our civilian counter parts. In my line of work, you can expect to be dealing with teeth. There's a lot that can be learned though.

thank god! now I have 6 more months until I feel like I should go outside!
I'm currently in college, going for a creative writing degree myself. I've heard a bit about goung overseas to teach English, and it sounds really interesting to me.If you don't mind me asking, how do you get into doing something like that? What kind of training/proficiency/etc. is required?
I can barely spit out a drive through order for a coffee I get every morning. That combined with my lack of attention span, and destructive curiosity, I definitely would be fired within 10 minutes. 
The emphasis put on "LOL" really makes you feel that he is laughing out loud, as opposed to the less sincere, bastardized "lol".
Jimmies or sprinkles? Coming from a professional doughnut maker, you should know best of all. 
this. firstly, i LOVE watching behind the scenes stuff. why wouldn't i? it's like being a fly on the wall of the big budget movies i havent worked my way up to yet! secondly, i'm not very critical of movies, i'm a pretty easy-going viewer. i like all the big blockbusters, i don't get too caught up in Awards; i just want to see some spectacle, and a good story or some fun characters. :)i actually kind of enjoy explaining to my SO or my friends and family "how they shot this thing" or if they're nodding to something else behind the 4th wall. 
You should be a mechanic, I am and I have a hard time pronouncing my name some mornings. I ruined a "defective" fuel pump because I wanted to see how much distance and pressure I could shoot water across the shop. Got bored a few days ago and was curious to weather or not anybody fucked with my tool box so I wired roughly 120vs to that bitch and went to lunch.  He doesn't mess with my toolbox and I feel bad because the porter got involved and she's such a sweet girl. She hasn't talked to me in 2 days now and throws my tickets at me
The boxes say "sprinkles" but my family is from New England, where they're called jimmies. I'm so conflicted!
I don't know why you'd get that much grief. I've been wrenching for 15 years and one of the big rules is to not go into someone else'sBox unless they told you it was cool.Hell, I've worked in the same place 9 years now and I won't go into another mechanics box without talking to him, even if he has told me mi Casa es su casa. 
My dad says jimmies. The way I see it, if they're just chocolate, they're jimmies. If it's rainbow or any other kind, they're sprinkles. 
True, Rainbow Jimmies sounds more like a gay bar.
Didn't Google start ignoring literal string / exact match quotes a few years ago?
In addition, search for "problem xyz FIXED"
What's the difference between using "John Smith" and John/Smith?
You used to be able to get into directory levels and download mp3's like this. Haven't tried in a while. 
You can tell how much internet experience someone has by the way they phrase their searches. 
Google advanced search works if you're trying to sift through a tonne of things that are close to your search but not exactly. My problem is that my searches turn up nothing anyway so advanced search narrows 10 useless responses to 0 responses
True, but this can also bring up biased information. Check the inverse search too, if possible
That's how I found Reddit in the first place. After multiple google searches to my questions I would keep ending up here. So then I started always added Reddit to the end. Couple years later made an account.  Now I'm on here every day.
that all everyone needs to know 
Or use proper questions. Google can interpret natural language.
So what you're saying is that OP should have googled for this instead of asking us?
This might be too specific of a question but I was trying to figure out something similar to this a few days ago.  Would that work for a website that has overlays to blur things out? For example, if you wanted to see the answer to a question on Chegg thats partially blurred out?
"OP's mom" AROUND(5000) "house"
Thanks, this had bugged me lately, but not enough to Google the solution. Which is totally embarrassing in retrospect. 
I would put just that word in quotes. 
Years ago you used to be able to use this syntax to search for valid credit card numbers (e.g. 4000000000000000..4999999999999999), of which there were a jaw dropping number posted online, not even by scammers or whatever, more like small businesses not knowing the difference between intranet and internet site... I think Google censors those results now.
This is the only good way to search redditNow if only it didn't link to shitty fucking mobile versions
-site:... is more reliable 
Sometimes the whole process is figuring out the right terms to use. But that's usually where the less adept fail.But fancy features become more useful when you are dealing with names/terms that have multiple meanings. Products named with common words, or just trying to find the thing that shares a name with a much more famous thing.
I trust Reddit more than many other sites. I can read a bunch of different opinions and be sure that I'm not being misinformed by a biased source.
Seriously, pinterest in image results is fucking cancer.
oh so that's why i enter captcha so ofteni can't leave google now
If there are few results it tries to guess what you meant. Tools-All Results>Verbatim makes it behave.
I always look for reddit threads
Google treats the slash (and lots of other punctuation) as basically any word delimiter, so `John/Smith` becomes `John[non-word character]Smith`. Since it has no spaces, then Google will not separate the terms and search them as a unit. The difference between that and `"John Smith"` is that `John/Smith` should return any of:* John-Smith* John/Smith* John.Smith* John Smith* etc.

Dear Google, what's that thing where the guy does the stuff with his hand, and then the girl gets that thing that smells bad? Thank you, from Doris.
Be succinct.
Oh, you need a pressurized cement consistometer
The more words you use, the more of those words need to be in your ideal search result. Similarly, Google has an easier time mapping synonyms and similar words to those chosen if the string is shorter.*That said*, if your query is very close to what you're actually looking for, this isn't a bad way to go.
Yeah. A couple of days back I was looking for one specific Back to the Future quote that I only half-remembered. So I searched "back to the future enough future boy" and good ol' Google found it, enabling me to make a low-effort shitpost without even having to remember the quote. Thanks Google engineers.
And then you use quotation marks 
If youjust searched "satellite with gold disk" you get similair results. Depending on what youre looking for too much filler words can make it harder to find things.

Absolutely. For instance, searching "vaccines cause autism"... 
Sadly after years of watching people use search engines I would say minimum 75%+ of people ask questions. 
Honestly just 'dog cherries' would be fine

Use and, or, and not. Boolean operators. 
This do confuse my gentle brain. 
I tried that, well I tried removing the overlays and it appears that they are just images being blurred. It could work, but I don't know.

Thanks! I get so pissed off every time Google searches "verbatim" by finding synonyms, translating, etc...
When they started Google Plus. I think they want(ed) to dedicate the + sign to search for user handles. 
Problem is these days it thinks it's smarter than you and sometimes searches synonyms even then.

Because you're basically performing hundreds or thousands of searches at once if you extend the number range too much. So this would be an easy way for bots or humans to abuse google and overload their servers.
No, it's one search with wider additional criteria. The way you use it it's NBD -- what I'm talking about is something like 100000..900000 -- that shit will get you shut down.
-site:i.reddit.com will exclude mobile pages.
Honestly, this site can be a gold mine at times but the search function here is garbage. So half the time I need to google something I add "reddit" at the end lol.
Just when you think you found something cool, you have to make an account 
Maybe you're a robot. 
Yup. This exactly. If I don't add "Reddit" to my search I just get a bunch of clickbait articles.
`"John/Smith" OR "JohnSmith"` would cover all variations, too. `OR` can be used, and it works as you'd expect.
surprisingly, this is the way I google. and there's usually a few typos in there too. and I'm usually able to find an answer faster than anybody else who is looking. lol. well, I don't thank google afterward but I do usually post my query in plain text "the movie where the guy builds that pile of dirt in his kitchen" etc
Same boat. It used to be that this was an ineffective way of searching, but now it works pretty well especially if it's a question that's likely been asked before.

The Faculty!
It's a porn search you silly goose.
that illustrates your point well, though I've often found when I google that it's overwhelmingly about how trustworthy vaccines are.
I don't know why you regard that as sad. Depending on what you're looking for, typing a question is frequently a good way to turn up a result of someone asking the exact same question in a forum somewhere, followed immediately by the answer. This is particularly true with common software. You being the first person anywhere to have a particular problem with Excel is like winning the lottery - not fuckin likely.
... I don't trust you.
>Returned results for: Jeeves disappointed we've fallenHere's what I got: About 174,000 results (0.78 seconds) Poor Jeeves.
Yep, in a presentation a few months ago from a guy at Google, he told us they are trying to make it answer questions that are in natural language... Which obviously is not helped by people who type only keywords (like me) because they don't trust it lol. He was working in a team that makes some back end stuff about understanding natural language better, which helps with all Google products like search, translate, etc.
Yes I do (49 yo here, still feel 25 damn you all!)
I'm sure they used that example in your understudy.
Yeah I do but those are no replacement.  The "+" operator forced the results to contain a certain term.  For example "+adidas running shoes" would return results that ALWAYS had the term adidas.  It was great.
Not a true modo.  More of a quasimodo. 
Yeah thats what I tried as well, with some extension for google chrome. What he was saying though maybe sounded like you could just access the forum without signing in. Not expecting it to work, but can't hurt to ask
So the gold subreddit 
"Tons"
Yup, may be that's why it is "undocumented"!
I got 2 and 2 respectively. WTF is going on?
No wonder I was having so much trouble last week.  Why the hell did they remove it? 
Triple is 'real verbatim' and single is 'sort of verbatim with other crap google thinks is relevant'.e:although it seems very recently they've even altered that and made it similar to single quotes and I can't even find information on it anywhere anymore
Damn, what will happen when they launch Google Colon in 2018
God damn I hate it when it thinks its smarter than me. The other thing is when it takes the one key term *out* because it found way more results with that term missing... except I was *trying* to narrow down the search to the small subset of manageable results, not wade through 100,000 unhelpfully broad ones!
What does the cap say?
Ah makes sense, thank
-site:pinterest.com will exclude useless image results.
Fucking Google amp needs to die in boiling acid. 
Reddit is valued at at least $240 million dollars, and they can't make a half decent search function.
The trick is to read the most upvoted post that confirms your opinion. This way you won't see any bias at all. 
If only someone made a Reddit thread about tips for using Google and the first answer was how to view sites without creating an account
And I've been using -one -two -three like a pleb all these years
On google, If you click on the "complaint" links on those DMCA notices it brings you to an organized list of each URL that was subject to complaint. This is a good way to find the mp3 or other file you're looking for, ironically.
Is that real? They seem hesitant to even tell what vx means

Actually it was Charlie Bartlett but The Faculty was awesome too! 
Google scholar puts this argument to rest. You can literally search "thimerosal" and read the abstracts of the top cited papers.You don't even have to understand the study, abstracts are often written in plain English and are easy to digest.
Wait is trump an antivaxxer?
Some of the greatest scientific minds are on the spectrum.
I have had decent google fu for years now, and once in a while the old way gets me nowhere and I'll end up just typing a question like google is god. It actually works.
Google's put in a lot of effort to try and give good results to the less-skilled searchers that only search using questions. I've noticed that questions work really well if they're "when...?" sort of questions. I've had less impressive results with other question-words, but still use them from time to time.
My wife Googles literal questions.I use keywords.She sucks at Google.
"Do pineapples, also known as ananas, have an effect on the taste of your sperm, also known as jizz?"Or, find a result that includes:Either "pineapple" or "anana", Also either "sperm" or "jizz", Also "taste"
Just use quotation marks.. "adidas" "running shoes"
lol that place is boring trust me you don't wanna go there 
"casks of maple syrup"  
Yeah she would. She likes the front door and the back door.
Makes sense, my mind didn't see that information
Not hard to see what's happening here, just put two and two together.
I got 70,700,000 results...Not sure what to think. 
Happened back when they released Google+, so probably because it interfered with that.

Results for "how to fix car in GTA":* How to fix cars! * ^^^missing: ^^^~~GTA~~
Doesnt always work. Cant come up with an example right now, but sometimes even with verbatim, google still occasionally thinks it knows better than you.
I'm not sure what a straight up ban says, but before that point is reached google will start serving you captchas with the stated reason being "recent unusual activity" and if my memory serves me correctly they will also sometimes just not give you the results page on the first try and you need to do it again. I'm assuming that's just another variety of captcha in the sense that it might trip up some bots that don't get the expected results or they might parse that page in a way that normal browser users won't and google will detect.
mr skeltal
Fuckin pinterest with their domination of the Google image results.
What even is Google amp?  I use like every single Google product daily and still I have never heard of that.
People give posts ambiguous titles and wouldn't bother tagging them"I just found this weird tip today to help with my craft" is probably the title of that post you're looking for, and you'll never find it because of the stupid title
also 'site:reddit.com\/r/subredditname' to limit the results to one subreddit.
I feel like this is what the internet is supposed to be and you have to enter the info in like a programmer. Not quite but most people won't put in that extra step all the time. 
Of course you have to do some thinking in the process to decipher what is bs and what is not. I feel like that thinking shouldn't stop at the internet but also in books especially history books.
That's the correct way to do it on google; the parentheses are for ebay only (per OP's edit).
Might aswell use the robot that was posted everywhere a few weeks ago then.
Someone in the future loves you.
I love and hate when the top search result links to a forum where the first / only respond is "How difficult is it to do a quick google search?" Well it was a lot easier if YOU didn't messed up the google results you asshole
The other day I typed in "The other pig movie" Gordy was the first result. I was amazed. 
Its django unchained. Great movie.

"ananas" is the word for pineapple in a few languages, it's not a plural of "anana".

I've been in that situation before. Try saying aloud "siri, what to think". If that doesn't help you should try "alexa, what to think". If problem still persists just keep screaming until someone comes to help.
And they didn't think of renaming their useless unused service rather than messing with an age old convention. Urgh, Google. 
If no other shits can be given, maybe Google is the superior colon.

True story. Made a thread about an obscure Chinese electronic component. Found my own solution and posted it later on. Months later another user thanked me for it with that xkcd comic attached. 
Lol it totally works, I'm very impressed. "The pig movie" turns up Babe, "The other pig movie" turns up Gordy.
It isn't a joke, there are posts in that subreddit that clearly explain exactly what "VX" is...
"0 results"
Was much funner a minute ago when OP couldn't spell Banana. Now instead of comedy it's tragedy (comedy where I'm the victim)
Yes, exactly, but by using a regular "or" you're kind of implying that it doesn't matter, as long as it's at least one. But grammatically, what you said is certainly more correct. 
but does it have sharks with freaking lazer beams on their forheads

I don't think that - works any more. It's a trick I used to use lots, but haven't been able to get working recently. 
Interesting... I use chrome, signed in to google on an android phone and somehow that's just never come up.  Sounds annoying unless you have absolutely tragic internet speeds.

When discussing something on a reddit thread I often open a new tab to Google the topic being discussed. More often than not my top search results will be a reddit link. I wouldn't have to use Google for that if reddit had a decent search engine at least for its own content.   
It's no joke! There's a lot of active research into sub-Coulombic inductance coils. Apparently they could have applications in electric cars, Hyperloop projects, and Cranford C-beams.

Just standard lazer beams I'm afraid.

Or most things they do. Here's a laptop! But you can't take it out of the house as it needs data to work. No it doesn't have data capability haha
Yeah, as others said Google just decides it's smarter than you and thinks "No, spear is obviously wrong because it doesn't generate nearly as many search results!"
that's too gay dude
Your name is not as unique as you think it is ;)
My buddy did his PhD on Cranford C-beams. Their paradoxical change in structural strength compares to withstanding deep oceanic pressures when the forces are applied perpendicularly, where only the hypercrust plating was applicable in the tangent corners. The sub-Coulombic inductance coils could funnel out the weak energy so only the forces necessary to maintaining integrity of the C-beam and increasing its resistance/kg property remain within the structure.

As is tradition
Yeah the live thread is very confusing"Coup has failed""Military in control""Erdogan in Istanbul with thousands of supporters ""That is old shit he are streaming"My head hurts.
I feel like this summarizes 2016 so far.
Both the AP and CNN idiotically claimed what was propaganda without verification
What a slimy, spineless little shit. 
Yeah, it didn't really last long and now he can put forward more extreme laws and reduce the power of the military who's only job since the foundation of the country was to make sure it stayed secular
Request for asylum was denied by Germany, haha. 
"We are hearing that a coup is occurring in the democratically elected Turkey, the military wants to out democratically elected leader Erdogan, who was democratically elected" -CNN  
Calls people to the streets, flees instead of helping. Lmfao
Yup. A failed coup is a hundred times worse than no coup at all. Erdogan will now have reason for vengeance, and some very twisted legitimacy for further action. 
no one knows. the only "repelled" reports are coming from Turkish state and government agencies.the ones whom would benefit from actually repelling it.
I'm very afraid of that happening. 
Does it make you feel comfortable that he is talking about Pennsylvania and implying CIA involvement while we have nukes in his country? 
Propaganda?
Yeah... Very strange! It's all just so confusing! I hope some light is shed on this situation very soon! 
Scarily, it is EXACTLY like that. 
Good thinking! Those fighter jets would have made light work of him. 
Yeah, Ankara is pretty much locked down by the Pro-Coup forces.Still haven't seen anything other than Police vs. Military either - I think the lack of Military vs. Military might show that a far larger group might support the coup than originally broadcasted.
CNN aired footage of some sort of confrontation on the bridge. There were tanks on the bridge, and civilians crowding under an overpass with flags and the likes, chanting something. You could hear gunfire, but nobody knew if it was being fired at the state police, or if it was riot control weapons being used to disperse the crowds.
I am and I'm terrified for Turkey. Erdogan would be unstoppable if the coup fails. 
Can't help but be thankful. But I feel sad for the innocent people that are caught in the crossfire.
Not everyone lost, there was one winner and his name was Sultan Erdogan
exactly,now erdocunt is asking to snitch on internet coup supporters so he can hang them all as traitors.yeah thats democracy bitchez.
The censorship over there makes it difficult to hold a discussion.
Turkey already had a couple of millitary coups before while part of NATO. America likes the Turkish military a lot more than edrogen and wont stop this 
If they attached a generator to attaturk they could generate enough power for half of turkey just from him spinning in his grave.
Why are the Kurds against the coup, I thought they didn't like Erdogan?
Relevant username
Correct, Turkey is one of the few nations where the military is a separate entity. They were built and designed by Ataturk to make sure Turkey never turns to Islam.I don't think this is the first time they've done this, too.
That's pretty bizarre, but hey if it's stupid but it works it's not stupid. 
Ferdinand Marcos did this shit in the Philippines too.  Suspicious attack/coup and then martial law for a decade.  He syphoned the Filipino reserves and got rid of anyone in his way.  He only lifted martial law because the Pope refused to visit if he didn't.  I hope this doesn't happen with Erdogan, but it's not looking good.  Be safe.
That is my interpretation as of now. New developments may change my opinion but it just seems too staged to me. 
Or some more eager faction of the military got swindled they had more support and to go for it and are now used as scapegoats. 
Well, tyranny lasts for as long as people refuse to stand up to it. Every nation so far has shockingly, subtlety backed ergodan tonight...
There was no coup
As an American who knew nothing about him until an hour ago he sounds like a total douche. 
This is the military's 5th or 6th coup in a hundred years.  They have had some practice.
It's a snapchat of a TV of a facetime.
That's the second most important thing a military should be doing. All enemy's both foreign and domestic. 
What I've read is that people really like the military and support them when they overthrow.You would then think that the people would then elect people who would please the military.Yet, obviously not. Why?
I want to get off 2016's wild ride

Don't worry, Germany told him to fuck off I think.
he is still in the country, though.
Exactly.  It's a sad fucking day.
See, Germany really does screen its incoming refugees for potential terrorists...
Believe it or not that's a strong argument here. And considering Erdogan's supporters don't even hesitate to call for our death(infidels) even in peace, the guy is seen as the evil-found-body by the more educated population.Don't mistake, Erdogan's voterbase is unarmed ISIS. 
Fuck CNN 
Sounds suspiciously like an attempt to raise a shield using the turkish people as bait to force the army to retaliate against the population.
Germany rejected him, now's he's looking to the UK
Inside job by Erdogan to go "SEE, told you the military would coup" and using the fervor of his supporters, he'll sign in a new constitution that effectively neuters the power of the military and makes them a puppet for his Neo-Ottoman ideas to be used to put them into action? Also for a power grab and become like a dictator? 
If you're on holiday in the country, I suggest you contact your embassy in the country (if you have one) and ask what they advise you to do.
Germany should've accepted and then put him under house arrest so he can't stir up more shit.
Following the playbook. Night of Long Knives will follow, then Kristallnacht.
Exactly. If an outside power (say Iran ) were to attack Turkey, then the US and the rest of the NATO members would be required to respond.This is a internal matter and no response is required. Plus, I think most (if not all) NATO members will consider this a positive tthing.
They hate both. Secular military dictatorships in Turkey have historically been no kinder to the Kurds than Erdogan has. The enemy of your enemy is not always your friend. Besides the Kurdish parties themselves, no political force in Turkey is friendly to the cause of Kurdish independence or even Kurdish autonomy. 
Actually, he's just a coffee table. 
Despite how serious this is, this single post made me lol very hard. 
Well not necessarily stopping turning back to Islam but more to stop any straying from secularity.
That's usually how it goes. 
This seems more plausible than a completely faked one. Erdogan hears of a plot and allows it to go forward in a controlled manner, and reaps the benefits. 
It's wrong,  but not shocking. For example,  Turkey is a major NATO ally,  and they have a very strategic position to influence the Middle East,  so obviously western leaders don't want to speak out against the Turkish government. 
I had a Simpsons level flip-flop.  "Oh a coup, that's bad." "Oh the people leading the Coup aren't doing too good, that's good." "Oh, the leader of Turkey is an Islamist with an agenda, that's bad." "Oh, the people leading the coup support democracy, that's good!". "President Obama just backed the government instead of the military, that's..."  "It's bad."
I don't think it's really realistic to expect a state, esp a state like Turkey, to be overthrown without any casualties. 
Really depends who you talk to in Turkey. The military was at the head of some very unsavoury Turkish governments in modern Turkish history.Don't blindly believe one side is better than the other just yet as many on Reddit already seem to have made up their minds on who are the good guys.
German government was even more vague: "The democratic order in Turkey must be respected."
What a time to be alive.
It is, but the dangerous bit comes in deciding who is the enemy and who is not.
Secularists in major cities like the millitary more than edrogen and his Islamist party. In the 1980 coup the millitary ruled for 3 years before democracy was resorted same.will.happen now prob if they succeed. The goal if this coup is to remove edrogen who is trying to seize more and more power 
Take me out
You're out of your element. 
To the victor, the shitposts.
haha they better have done - seeking asylum in Germany who he tried to sue cuz of that comedian
Savage.
> Russia?Lol, my fucking sides XD. Putin is probable laughing his ass off right now.[
This country, man...
I feel like an idiot when I fantasize about being around some drama like this or a tragedy. I want to feel like I've seen REAL shit and have crazy stories. But I always remind myself that peoples lives are obviously more important.
Yes. I'm presently at a Hotel in Side quite far away from Ankara and Istanbul. Everybody, that is Turkish, here pretends like nothing happened. It's odd.
Forget about the coup. Let's get back to talking about what matters. A kid's viral video on white guilt!
Tell him to fuck off, we dont want himBring him to Glasgow if you must, then we can deal with him efficently
The turks everywhere would lynch him tbh
The U.S. embassy in Turkey has said try not to go to the embassy.
Armies tend to do that when there's little to no oversight.I was gonna mention 16th-17th century armies in the Wars of Religion in Europe, or the American Civil War, but those guys were pretty much fully sanctioned to fuck shit up.
Correct, but considering their position geographically it's unlikely that they'll lean to anything except Islam.
More or less, yeah. It's really confusing compared to Western powers, but it's a very interesting setup the more you read about it.
Someone like him was in power. Until certain countries didn't like him refusing them access to his country's oil. Some shit happened, and boom, modern Iran.
I don't think he's really backing Erdogan it's just that if the coup fails we still have to work with him so best not to say we support the people trying to kill him. It would make meetings awkward 
The message from the followers of Khorne were slightly less so: "Blood for the blood god! Skulls for the skull throne!"
It's a reddit post of a screenshot of a snapchat of a TV of a facetime
The very same.
There are a lot of shitkickers in rural Turkey. & rigged ballots, maybe.But it must be said; lot of shitkickers. Huuuge crowds of shitkickers.In this, Turkey is a lot like everywhere else.
Yea, just look at Egypt for the opposite situation.
problem is, turkey is huge, and apart from the big secular cities there's a lot of not-so secular countryside
Considering the military is (mostly, supposed to be) secular, while Erdogan is an Islamist, I would think so.
Take me out inside
What's a pederast, Dude? 
>Greece?Yeah, historically speaking Greece and Russia both hate Turkey more than anyone else.
A land of strong values and resilient people. The Turks can build empires as easily as they can destroy them.
The moment you do, you'll wish you didn't.
They should, better to stay calm and not 'pour out' onto the streets like erdogan says. Maybe they're used to it or expected this stuff anyway.
Even more disgusting is the call to prayer. If I was a practicing religious muslim I'd be offended my beliefs were used towards political gain WHILE RISKING MY LIFE.
I'll mention it next time we have tea together
What is the reasoning behind that? Is the embassy in Turkey and too dangerous to go there?
Political religion (islamism) is not the only 'un-turkish' or 'un-Kemalist' thing that the military has fought. Socialism and regional or ethnic (Kurdish) separatism comes to mind. 
Based ataturk. I will read some books about him. Sounds like a great man. Real shame they seek to destroy his legacy. 
>You at the barricade, listen to this:  The people of Paris sleep in their beds.  You have no chance,  No chance at all!  Why throw your lives away?
The government will say Erdogan has won until a helicopter is flying his hanged body through the streets.
Like when the US voiced tacit support for the 2002 coup in Venezuela, during the brief period when it looked like it would stick.
Personally, I think if you're in a region that has a risk of Islam coming to town and taking over, it's probably a good thing to say, "hey, FYI...military can come in and protect the people's democratic rights."
Say what you will about khorne, but we always know where he stands. A real straight shooter.
Under most circumstances, I'm decidedly against a military coup of a democratically elected leader. For this one, I think my feelings are pretty mixed.
Can't take out
Greece is like "Fuck yeah, time to take back Constantinople! Let's go boys!"
This is so true. I was in the Yugoslavian wars, and while everyone loves to hear the story I really wish I was unable to tell it.
Erdogan is a fucking moron. He's going to get his own people killed.
A call to prayer like this and the prayers for when a person dies has taken place all over turkey in about 90000+ mosques. A call to prayer like this is a Call to jihad. u can see why we're worried over here in turkey. Secular turkey is gone after this day u can be sure. I will be weeping.
They probably say this because it would mean leaving shelter to go there, and if the embassy is attacked, there is a higher chance of civilian casualties.
He also banned burquas in Turkey.
Well the last major rebellion in the U.S. was about a century and a half ago. Looks like we're due over here. 
"It is not over! We are reaching new heights!"
That's because if it's a coup and it's in Latin America the United States is almost always the one throwing it.
Yeah that's assuming the Army never undergoes a religious awakening.  I know it's super unlikely as they think it's their job to be secular, but weirder things have happened.
Its Tzeentch you have to worry about.
The main problem with democracy, and its greatest internal contradiction:What happens when a leader or government is democratically elected, which seeks to undermine or dissolve the very democracy that brought them to power?
TAAAAAAAKE MEEEEEE
Good way to demonize the military, no?
no way would they attack the embassy - isn't that pretty much declaring war on the us?
At this point I would expect fancy invitations to be sent out by the State Department...
I think after this, assuming the army loses, which it appears it will, there will be a massive purge and it will "enjoy" an awakening. 
Then it's fair game to kick them out.
call my name and...TAKE ME OUT!
Knowing how much of a dick he is, he's probably willing to use his own people as pawns.
Attacking an embassy is a very common move for non-state terrorists or guerrillas. US embassies are a relatively common target because the US is disliked by many non-state actors, that's why they're so heavily guarded.
But how do you kick them out when democracy has been subverted?  In other words, is it ideologically consistent to "save" democracy through undemocratic actions?
> probably I guess 100% is still a probability.
But in a way, if they are eliminating democracy, they are also undermining your vote.  They are also removing the very process that brings them to power; meaning they shouldn't have an immediate right to lead a non-democratic state if they were democratically elected.
Ya everyone in school lives on 7 layers of irony and I love it 
I am guilty of secretly enjoying watching parents of students who graduated with my daughter last year having complete melt downs now watching the children they diligently helicoptered become the drunk-party-animal-failing-all their-classes students.Karma may bite me over it, but I hated watching them give their kids *zero* leeway to enjoy any part of their lives.
But how dare your father not give their *little angel* an a+ on everything.What's frustrating is that the same parents that read your post will likely agree with you.  But then a teacher gives *their* kid a bad grade?  Well, now that changes everything.
Once you hit college: you better have brought your calculator mother fucker, no we don't have one for you to borrow.
But I rocked a rad pager during my senior year in 1997!!!
Now it's just "you do that assignment?" "I got it from Johnny you need it?" "Yeah send it" then we just text pictures over
Is this a Daft Punk joke?
> 2007: students came out to me privately in my officethat's interesting to me. What were their motives to explain themselves to a teacher?
Can confirm '17 I work for a cell phone carrier and one of the most highly congested part of our network is surrounding high schools. So not surprised
My little brother just recently graduated high school. During his junior year, another student streaked at a football game.  He was arrested and they tried to get him booked as a sex offender. He ended up killing himself. It was devastating, many many people were horrifie at the school's reaction. I remember my parents specifically saying that streaking at a big game would've been frowned upon but ultimately not a big deal when they were in school.
Nah, TI-84s are far more prevalent in my HS. Especially the new sim ones.
The connection between all generations, Pokemon
>use them as crutcheseven as an adult- I'm guilty of this.  Ten year old me was a much better speller.  
Yes, I've always heard about stereotypes (high school) like jocks not caring about grades and partying all the time. Some of my best friends are sports players and they work incredibly hard.
I was under the impression dabbing died with 2016. Was hoping anyway.
bitch, our fingers are crossed, don't spoil it
You could fuck someone born in 1997
Can I ask if you're in middle/high school or college? When I was in high school, every single person thought they were the exception and that everyone else in their class was a hairless barbarian.
97 - racial slurs07 - you retard17 - ~ironic~racism, homophobia, sexism, etc
Then they go bitch that this generation is too soft
It's even worse when a professor says "Go ahead and cache the entire internet on your laptop and bring it to the exam. It won't help you. Have fun."
Same. And my mom was CONVINCED I was a drug dealer. Mom, I'm on honor roll, student council, I'm a varsity volleyball player, and I just got a full ride to college (state school, but fuck it) ... I'm NOT dealing drugs. I just like my friends to be able to get ahold of me while I'm out driving around aimlessly, possibly mildly intoxicated, so I can stop at the Taco Bell and call them back on a pay phone.DUH. 
I think that's where we're at. The small phones were way thicker.
A Google drive or a network for the students to share everything, making cheating streamlined and efficient.
MBA is a networking degree. You should get it after excelling in the private sector. Kids who get them asap miss out.
God damn if this isn't the truth and most of us are still dealing with the repercussions of not knowing how to handle failure. 
I'm glad somebody else got it
2017 studentCan confirm. Would rather be dead.Not joking.
Yup class of 2018. I was literally crying last week because I realized all I care about right now is my grades and that I'm so caught up in it that I can't even answer the questions "what are your interests?" Or "what do you do for fun?"
Not OP, but I'd guess they likely are students who consider OP a mentor or friend.
Seriously...This whole topic has been an amazing read
The whole idea of a "Sex offender" has become so warped and diluted. It is no longer just for people who pose an actual sexual threat by means of rape or molestation, it is now a catch all for anyone unfortunate enough to have had somebody see them naked. Drunk and peeing in the bushes when a kid sees you? BOOM, Sex Offender. Harmless streaking prank? BOOM, Sex offender... 
TI-84 Plus CE is a work of art
I lived literally through the "hey, look, Internet!" and "hey, look, cell phones!" age. Maybe it's because I was tech inclined, but I learned very quickly to use both really well.There are a lot of people from my generation that don't, though.
And Star Wars.
I remember being made to write fake correspondence emails about random bullshit to my English teacher in high school as part of assignments. Good practice really, it's unbelievable how many people can't string together a coherent email or attempt any semblance of formatting it. 
I laughed when he said she was hot.     (it's probably a plus that she gets along with his daughter)  
That's exactly what I was thinking. I mean I think that movie exaggerated it (the cool kids don't think that "organized sports are so fascist"), but I do think it's true that the nicer, more accepting kids today are the "cool" ones.
Good news everyone, we're going to visit the internet today!
I saw a prequel meme in another teacher's PowerPoint, it was a surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one. 
'I was born far too late to discover the lands,  And the seas, and the skies, and the shores and the sands.  All the steps have been stepped, and the walks have been walked,  And the sights have been seen, and the talks have been talked.'I was born far too soon to discover the stars,  And I'll never set foot on the red dust of Mars.  I shall only encounter the future in dreams -  But at least I have memes.  But at least I have memes.'    
Referential memory has been a thing for a long time.  That's why you'd see the shelves of books in every engineer's office.  Not just because they'd read them, but because they used them to look up what they didn't need to know off the top of their head.  It's a trade off between how fast you need the info, and how difficult it is to look it up. It's just gotten so easy to look things up that more and more things are easier to remember via where you found them.  
We were 18 at the time and just didn't know better. We do now and that shit wouldn't fly today. We also didn't want to spend our vacation in jail, so we docked in the Florida Keys a few days and went back home instead of the bahamas.
No not the rum ham
I work at Chuck E Cheeses. When I'm in the outfit I dab. Little kids seem to love it still.
Its crystal meth around my area. When I was in school, cocaine was cool, but weed was already on the downward spiral of being typical.Turns out a good bit of my friends were stoners, I was just too oblivious to realize it. Which is probably why everyone looks at me funny when I say I've never smoked weed or did any sort of drugs (with the exception of alcohol, but even then, I didn't drink in high school, only when I turned 21).C/O 2012
The year where Logan just came out.
I was born in 1997 (looks at side camera), ladies
That's fucked up man
To be fair it doesn't matter what decade it is there will always be shockingly stupid people. 
People still say niggerfaggot and call people retarded we've just evolved for more 
Can confirm. I'm in an igneous and metamorphic petrology course right now. All our tests are completely open note, open book, and bringing your laptop is required (both for the internet and Excel being used).Test averages still end up being around ~40-50%. None of the questions are Google-able, we literally just have them because without being able to check various online databases (MinDat, etc) it'd be impossible to get through the test in the 3 hours allotted.
Our school has a Dropbox. The previous class sends pictures of the test questions:answers from last year. Technically not cheating because they released the test last year. 
This is the correct answer. The goons with MBAs have the same answers that goons without MBAs have: more cloud-based data-driven solution engines that free them from doing any real work, and having all sorts of accountability dirt on everyone around them.The difference is the 35 year old that just finished his MBA now knows a shitton of other MBAs that have C-level jobs at other companies, and it's much easier for them to land that sacred C-level on their job title.
The cost of failure has gone up, people can't afford them anymore. 30 years ago, if you dropped out of high school and couldn't even read you could still find a job of menial tasks to make a decent living off. If you pull that today, you will get paid slave money and have to work 3 jobs without even affording a place to live, if anyone would even hire a high school dropout. Multiply by 1000 if you drop out of college and god have mercy on you and your family if you ever get sick and don't die instantly.
Start to? That's already in full swing.
Not just on an academic level. God forbid you make a mistake in front of others then the whole world will know because of social media. 
me too thanks
Look at his username.  Doesn't look like it.
I feel like I'm beyond a nervous breakdown. I've gone past it and now I'm just in this intermediary where no amounts of stress gives me urgency anymore. 
You should care about bats. They are pretty neat!
Yep and also I teach/do research on sex/sexuality topics so a lot of students come out to me.  
My school wifi literally blocks google
I assume the only reason they haven't blocked all those apps is that your IT guys must also use those programs to stream video content all day.
Can you get enough bandwidth through the vpn for Netflix though?
That's awesome. They fucking played you guys.
I got the pleasure of watching a drunk guy outside of a frat house pissing on the side of the house when campus police confronted him. They told him they saw him pissing, and the dude's response was "That's impossible. My dick is so tiny you couldn't have seen it!" Campus police left him alone after making such a watertight argument. 
It's not laws and regulations that are the problem.  (Except for zero tolerance policies). There are certainly cases where you'd want a naked guy hanging around school to be brought up on sex offender charges.The problem is everyone, especially school administrators, being unwilling to use common sense.
My sister was in the band for Sparkman the night he streaked. I remember my step dad texting me about it saying it was funny. Then we followed the saga all the way up to him killing himself. Fucking ridiculous.
No, they should have been burned at the stake for condoning heresy.
And decent! It is a shame that they couldn't do it out of fear. If I was a teacher/admin, this prank would make me smile for two reasons: A) people actually paid attention in history class B) No one got hurt and to be apart of the prank you had to do your thesis!
When I was in seminary I was responsible for decorating the 30ft tall Martin Luther statue in the quad.  I did it seasonally.  I used the school's ladder to do it.  At like 1am.  At seminary.  People these days need to get a bloody grip.
For any who are wondering. No the goat didn't survive. it was a very shallow river and about 20-35 feet above.
If you've ever used a TI-84 Plus C you'll realize how amazing the CE really is
Been in IT for 30 years, beginning on the "big iron". It's the pace of change that is different. Related is, which horse do you want to ride (.net, java, Ruby, etc.)? My kids still roll their eyes at me because, for example, I can't get something to work on it. But when they have computer problem, who do they come to first? Yup, dear old Dad!!
Parents -> kids -> grandkids Original trilogy -> prequels -> new trilogy 
If the student was 18, it's their life. 
this is simple achievement vs mastery. the complex thing is figuring out how to raise children to be motivated by mastery instead.
You are absolutely correct! I do not blame the teachers, I blame the idea that surrounds them. However they say, take AP classes because they prepare you for college. That is not the case at all. I did not find myself more prepared, if anything I had to readjust to how I approached things because college does not hold your hand through a project or paper, you need to guide yourself. Maybe I am in the minority here, but I personally did not benefit from the way AP classes are taught 
That's the stupidest policy I've ever heard. For all what's worth though, back when I was in early primary school (years 1-4, they changed the rules afterwards) you could only give a student a "progresses adequately" (aka pass) or a "needs to improve" (aka fail) grade, in order not to demoralize the kids.Even then it only applied to primary school (up to year 6) not to everything afterwards (so for small kids it kinda sort of makes some sense, but still)
It just all flowed together in a way that suggested he was making a genuine comparison at all levels on his radar with no regard to the perception we might have of him. Just a slice of life.
21 and 22 are two of the best comedies I've seen in years, and the main takeaway is how realistic it is for youth culture (like Mean Girls was when it came out). 
Not yet
The day my history teacher announced that he doesn't give a shit about dates was the day I was actually excited to go to History class.
The brilliance of this poem is that it is truly depressing. I'm impressed and depressed at the same time. 
Yea but you didn't do anything wrong I don't understand.
I can't afford that crime. :(
IT SHOULD'VE BEEN YOU
That would be my hypothesis as well. Kids in high school now have, in a way, had the veil lifted that was on students 10 years ago. Most of them seem to realize that their future isn't as bright and open as everyone was telling them it would be when they were kids. 
Good for him.
Fuck this guy, pick me! Pick me!
I would guess you do it by being a 13 year old who's never smoked weed or spent time in the woods.

Now if only we had a nationwide transit network like they do...
Not in education, employment, or training.
Social Media has truly shown how narcissism and low self esteem is a pandemic. The only people that get joy out of others misfortune are people that are not happy with themselves and have to get that small feeling of being above someone else. Before social media the trend started with watching reality TV. I can't wait to see what the next 'ego boost' machine will be.
This is very important. People don't realize that we don't post our bad shit on social media, only our best. We shouldn't compare other people's highlight reel with our behind the scenes. 
It would seem from the sentiment in these comments that you've all been thrust into adulthood early. (Correct me if I'm wrong; that's my interpretation.) It's like you have adult rat-race-stress and society hasn't yet let you in the maze.
Haha yeah I hit that point last semester and basically went semi functioning and failed most of my classes. Going better this semester but I genuinely don't care anymore. 
Thank you for being there for those students. I'm sure for some, you were the only accepting person in their lives.
That's messed up.  Google and Wikipedia, etc are literally an extension of our brains these days.  
They most probably know you're using one. They don't care, but they know.
the IT guys can just whitelist whatever sites they want for themselves. Most school IT people have access to anything on the internet... Filters aren't auto-applied to every single account in the district. For example in mine, as a teacher I can access basically anything but porn or graphic shit (liveleak, etc) whereas kids can't use facebook, youtube, anything like that on their accounts. 
My wife's a teacher. Teenagers are soooo bad at keeping shit a secret. Like, teachers have ears, ya know?
Yeah.. I remember when my son was 9, I was checking his computer history, and he had searched for "nekid veginas".  After I excused myself to laugh for 10 minutes, we had another sex talk 
He must have been going for his MS because his BS was already on point
Zero tolerance is the easy way out, they don't actually have to think critically and asses things on a situation by situation basis.Laziness. Also, special snowflake parents.
That's actually hilarious and harmless
It would have been great! If they had used whipped cream, or almost any other type of sticky food item that didn't have a deadly allergy related to it.
Yeah, I remember my days at Catholic school all too well...
I have a soft spot in my heart for goats this is awful
I have the TI-84 Plus CE and it's my favorite calculator. No ragrets on spending $190 on it
My dad learned to program on Fortran. When we looked at my Sophmore year high school schedule and saw the PASCAL course he called it "new fanlged.". This was 1999.
The biggest problem I have with this is that their dependence on their parents is probably what's causing this in the first place.If they're not going to class and lying to their parents about it, they're only there in the first place BECAUSE of their parents. If they'd taken a year abroad or found a reason to actually be there for themselves, they might have succeeded.
Her ass was thick as hell.  My wife and I discussed it more than we talked about my kid's grade.
Why? You got memes, yo!
Not doing anything wrong and not having your day/holiday/life fucked over by over-zealous police are not mutually exclusive, sadly. 
Pirates aren't MY enemies, checkmate international law.
I graduated in 2014 and this was exactly the problem. Our history teacher called us the disillusioned generation. We knew the world sucked and we didn't have time to mess around. We all had jobs and did early college or got certificates if we could. I knew a few kids who wore suits every day for their internships after school. Not even a rich area, but we worried.
Jesus idk why but this got me good. 
> Fuck this guyWhat a great wingman. 
I had an interview for an internship, but they also interviewed 40 people for the position....Apparently they didn't want me. I didn't have enough experience to get the internship to get experience.
Of Mountain Dew?
We westernized long before we got rid of our shogunate so it's unlikely we will get the set of circumstances that will lead to that. We haven't even gotten a first shogun.
I also find social media can really crush one's self esteem because you have all your peers or your old schoolmates or people around the same age as you doing things or collecting all these great achievements, making great connections and seemingly having their life together, while you feel like an utter piece of shit in comparison if you're taking a longer time/less "successful" path to get to the same level. It can get fucking depressing and pressurising.
Exactly. And even when people do realize it, they often don't realize it fully enough to actually compensate for it in their mind and ego. Subconciously even though they know it's just their highlights, they don't feel it to the core enough to counteract the feeling of being lesser.
I didn't mean to imply that I receive no postivitive reinforcment because I do. Most of the time it seems like there is more negative than positive. Or maybe I just see the negative more 
Probably. I'm really not ready to be an adult.At all.
I took me like a month at my job to have my Internet Access unrestricted.My job:Programmer.
The IT guy knows, but he's likely too overworked and underpaid to give a damn. The school administration probably thinks that VPN is some kind of illicit drug.
My school's senior ditch day was ruinedBecause a senior asked her dad if she could participate in itHer dad was the principal 
Jesus. I guarantee there are still teachers there who despise you guys because they're still finding glitter everywhere. That's almost satanic.
When my son was the same age I found "girls who are not wearing underpants" in his browser history.  I actually still can't type that without giggling.
This is why I think it's awesome that pornhub now has a sex education channel to talk about the reality about sex.It's kind of fucked that we now need porn sites to properly educate people on sex, since schools aren't doing it.
After I graduated, the senior prank of the juniors at the time involved bringing the duck owned by one of the students' family members and letting it roam throughout the school. They also followed it in a huge crowd and took pictures with it. They all lost their senior trip to Disney and were threatened with calling the cops and being accused of animal cruelty
Do people have honey allergies?  When you touch that shit, good luck getting it off.

It's worse when you live in a small town that collects most of its income from tickets. I drove under two miles to McDonald's yesterday and passed six speed traps. The police have nothing better to do than sit in their dark, unmarked vehicles with the lights off and radar. Well, that and pepper spray teenagers for skating in an empty parking lot. Florida's great.
I'm not sure the pirates would agree.
Also graduated 2014, teachers had to accommodate as so many kids were trying to get into AP classes as AP tests are cheaper than gen ed classes at uni's by far. 
It's hard to not see it when you can see all the facebook profiles of people who graduated ahead of you and notice that not everyone got good jobs or are doing anything with their lives even if they went to college. And on sites like Reddit you can easily find stories of people doing jobs not related to their degree because they couldn't find anything.
If he's able to learn C++ well right off that bat that is great. I never had any programming until college and once I did get some taste of programming I loved it.If your child isn't keen to take on C++ (as it might be a little 'dry' for a youngin') you might look to the higher 'framework' languages (like swift, or .net framework with C#) which don't get into the dirty parts that C++ will have, but will increase his interest in programming. I hope your son is enjoying programming. I love the ability to 'make solutions' that programming allows.Good Luck!
Been there!Rejected for an internship and they actually wrote in their letter that they wanted someone with more experience. (Joke's on them, though -- a month later I was accepted for a full-time position with a more established company in the same field, and a few years after that, the company that rejected me went belly-up.) 
Most males use suicide such as hanging or guns which will kill you pretty quick and usually works. Females tend to use something like OD on pills or slitting wrists which is slower and is less reliable? (If that's the right word for it)
Fuck that, if I'm locking myself inside on my own, its going to be the cheapest, nastiest vodka I can stomach.
Man i want a shogun
Worked for a company that was working for Dell. Part of my job was to remote into other computers to do stuff and fix issues.Took about 2 or so months for them to allow me Internet access. Yet they still couldn't work out why I didn't do work during that time, even though they had been told numerous times.Yeh I worked in a place that didn't want to give me Internet access to do a job that requires the Internet.  
We all appreciated you in school.

Our senior ditch day was ruined because our "valedictorian" had her mom ask the school if it was an excused absence. Are you fucking kidding me?? The answer was in the name!
Not to mention the poor janitors. 
You mostly get girls in underpants with those search words. It is important to be able to use google in a good way, so you need to have a talk with him.
...since parents aren't doing it.I had the first "talk" with my son at 10. (Basic plumbing, dangers of becoming a young father, and mention of disease and the possibility of his weiner falling off.) Small discussions and questions along the way since. We'll have the final talk this year as he turns 13. (Foreplay, what diseases and why you might wish they actually made your weiner fall off, consent and the danger of being labeled a sex offender, emotional harm, etc.)
... I'll give you an upvote, but I'm not happy about it.
As long as he seeds he's alright with me!
Yeah he'll be taking Java and Python in high school, but until I can get him into a programming classroom I figured I'd try to teach him nuts and bolts stuff. He builds computers with me so memory management during software development is something I want him to understand/think he can understand. 
I beleive this is correct, in most cases women feel they need to leave peaceful, where men are more likely to just end it quick and easy.  
You can have a shotgun
Wow. That's... really damn stupid. 
There's some sleeper IT guys in school administration.  It's a steady paying gig with regular hours that you're usually doing by yourself, and with little supervision.  For someone coming out of corporate life it's easy enough to look past the pay cut and take the easy pope gig, and get paid to troll high school students all day.  
> Jesus, schools are getting really strict these days.Eh... it depends how tech-savvy they are I think.When I was in HS someone working on the school website set IE's home page to a network drive location. I got in trouble for "hacking" the network when I launched IE on the same machine.Who needs proper security when you can just punish students who expose your lack of security?In general the only thing I learned in computer classes there is that I already knew more than the teacher and she thought she knew more than me.(This was ~2002 or 2003.)
How was it ruined? Just ditch like normal. Them knowing ahead of time or not doesn't change anything.
'Oh, Honey'
"Son, your bad spelling and lack of keyword knowledge will never show you a quality vagina."
This is exactly the kind of thing that shows what is wrong with some parents. They think their child has looked up porn and they're mad? I assume you were a teenager when this happened.
The only talk I ever got was when my dad told me "If you get a girl pregnant, you don't have to marry them.  Pay for an abortion, take care of the kid, be a father, whatever, but only marry someone if you actually want to marry that person.  You can be a parent without having to be married to the other parent.  Both sides being happy for themselves is best for the kid."
We got the cops called on us as kids probably around 13 or 14 for hitting Crab Apples with golf clubs to clear out of our neighbors yard. Which the neighbor asked us to do because the bees/wasps love them. So we decided hitting them with golf clubs was the most fun option. Crochety old neighbor next door called up the cops and the cop came and was like "Yeah so you guys have permission to clear these out? Did he say with golf clubs? No? Well... Carry on I guess" Old ladies with too much time on their hands are the worst.
Unlock your phone so I can illegally search it or I'm going to arrest you! 
Aye, that be the code
I work at a 300,000-employee firm. The quantity of situations here where the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing is overwhelming. Sadly, a report of a person who was disallowed access to the very thing they needed to perform their job duties no longer surprises me at all. 
>  get paid to troll high school students all day.Is this the revised version of The American Dream?
Who is this hacker VPN and do teens ingest it anally with tampons? News at 11.
At my school, when the administration caught wind of a skip day, they would enforce rules very strictly for an unexcused absence, meaning your teachers had to give you zeros for anything missed that day and it also opened you up to getting put into detention.I more than made up for that time my senior year when I'd skip out on pep rallies. Not too upset about not having a skip day.
Your dad is a wise man. I've watched several people ruin their lives doing exactly this. Don't compound your mistake by tying yourself to the wrong partner. 
Is there a law on this, so I can actually source it instead of a random Reddit comment?
I hadn't done coke at this time in my life, yet. It was old spice original. I always keep a stick in my car.
They're more like guidelines.
> get off my LANftfy
IT guy here, though not at a high school. Can confirm, living the dream shitposting on reddit all day.
"we believe the new drug 'VPN' has been sold to children by 'The 4Chan' more tonight on 'The Factor'..."
Fuck, senior skip day was a set day every year and the teachers mostly planned around it at my school.
Son, your search history is a disgrace. What is this, amateur hour? 
Yeah but the high from a single whiff of Old Spice Original is enough of a gateway drug that it's clearly to blame for your current coke habit.
Found the leecher boys!!
IMO this is the most brutal and demoralizing thing I've read in this thread.  Even if you love your job and this happens it's hell. 
I don't know why but this was the only one that made me laugh out loud. 
I was thinking "for them to become intensely aware of everyone they've ever hurt," but this is even worse. 
How would that work if they were home alone? Would someone just break into their house exclusively to ask them questions?
Yeah, I can't imagine Mr. Salt n' Glass Penis-Tube up there sleeps well at night.
You monster
You have to let them get some sleep, otherwise they'll die from sleep deprivation.Let's make it random whether the scream goes off or not. Maybe 1 out of 10 times. Enough so that on the outside they appear to be functioning normally but they're being slowly driven insane by Satan jacking their Bluetooth speaker.
But wouldn't getting half a boner be an awkward situation, thus giving you a full boner? 
Oh. Now i see.. i have that curse
Sounds like my average day already 
So you're giving them a Time Warner subscription?
Plenty of people around here stay with sticky hands all the time. This is Reddit brah. 
I wake up every morning in a bed that's too small, drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little... but on pretzel day... well, I like pretzel day...
I'd prefer giving them that feeling of having to cough but no matter how much they cough nothing ever comes up. They keep coughing because they figure "This time, something will break loose and I'll have some relief" but no. No relief. They keep coughing because there's something in their lungs but it never comes out.
So a shitty YouTube video that always happens to be the only video of something you're trying to watch.
I have one of those stereotypical Asian parents. One of my friends would just randomly blurt out "Hey, when was that paper you needed to write due?" or "Are you ready for the math test?" and for the next week, my mom would be all "Pbghin! No playing video games, you have test coming up!" I'd correct her, but the idea of "there might be a test/paper/project due" outweighs the idea of "James is a shit-stirring asshole."
I have no feeling in parts of my right arm. No feeling, that is, except for when it's itchy. I can feel the itch, but *I can't feel it when I scratch*! It's like nothing is happening. And the itch just stays there for hours, maybe even a day or two. It's literally an itch I can't scratch and it drives me nuts!
And replace all of their salt with calcium bromide.
Time to castrate myself, because if people knew the sexual thoughts I was having then they'd run away.
Now that.... THAT is evil.
This is already my life. It's not so bad.
Hold off on this, I'm experimenting with behavioral altering by purposefully stumbling into them. Especially if they have their fucking laptop open walking around.
Sounds like a great idea for a chrome extension
A ring pop would be double the pleasure.
Just picturing this being implemented is hilarious. In places like the person's home or work, a device of some sort could be placed above the door to dispense glitter. For other places though I can only imagine someone hanging above the door waiting for this person to walk under or someone would have to follow the person with a bottle of glitter and sprinkle it on them every time. I think in order to not be predictable, each doorway would have to have a different person who pours the glitter. 
as someone with hyperhidrosis and social anxiety this is just another day for me 
Joke's on you; they will utilize this for free clean energy generation, making millions!!
Ouch! That's brutal.
So real glitter 
I like this. Very creative. You have a talent. You're probably on a CIA recruitment list somewhere.

Alright, I thought we were doing funny comments here, not ones which hurt.
It Follows
So like reverse eyelashes?
I think somebody's already cursed me.
Had this happen to me IRL. I took sleeping pills until the problem went away. When I'd wake up, I'd often spend the entire time crying because it was so uncomfortable.Can confirm, this is the definition of hell. I have fonder memories of being stabbed.
Hearing that music would legitimately terrify me 
I hate you. 
This is fucking horrible, maybe the worse not violent one for me. I have a pretty serious drug problem and usually the only time ill stop and go home is after a few days because I smell, I don't know why but for me being smelly is maybe the. Most embarrassing thing, strangely more than being a drug addict. 
that's clever as fuck, and would be insanely inconvenient.
My wife and i agreed that if either of us was terminal, instead of stringing it out by "making us comfortable", we bail on the hospital, say goodbye to our loved ones, and go on a bender, that for the terminal one, wont end.
So... ulcerative colitis? I already have that. What else you got?
But if they read a left-sign (and understand right) they will try to go right but then go left because they always turn wrong, which makes them right again....?
Finally a good answer that is not a magical curse.
Honestly this one wouldn't affect me much.  Sometimes hearing a spoiler just makes me want to watch the movie even more to see the events leading up to it or afterwards. The exception would be movies with an important twist, spoilers suck for those. 
Pretty sure necropheliacs wouldnt have an undying fetish...
Ok, that's a unique one. But it's pretty evil too. The octopi would almost certainly die pretty much immediately so you're gonna have some nasty rotting octopus everywhere for a few weeks, at least until it rains.
Fuck. You. 
Ha, lucky for me I'm shit at electronics already. In fact the more blue smoke I inhlae, the worrse I become as eloctrics. bortle baby bortle
What the fuck.

Like, are we talking non stop? Really common?Cause too much vomiting leads to dehydration which kills you.Im also imagining a person with a full on vomit cannon sliming people likes it's the Nick Choice Awards
Eh. It's not as bad as it sounds.

That would eventually be fatal. Without any real sleep, your health will fail and you'll die.

Thank God I didn't have friends until my parents stopped giving a shit and moved on to shaming my brother for being a disgrace to the dynasty 
Have you tried using a mirror and scratching where the itch is on the other arm? You might be able to trick your brain into feeling the scratching. 
Can't,  I'm not giving anyone my asshole.
No, that's the itch moving around.
It's even worse if you have ticklish feet.
And replace all of their calcium bromide with sugar
Then it just turns into "Back before I was castrated, I'd totally have tapped that."
Some Nicolas Cage christmas movie that I can't remember the name of type shit

The obituary becomes a dating service. 
They're also insanely intelligent, so you might have a rough time finding the ones that didn't die immediately. If you have standing water anywhere, and they find it, it's their house now. 
I've suffered from it for over 40 years, just want to share with the person that I hate, he can fall asleep standing up.
It was a torture method, think used in WWII, make men get an erection, shove a glass tube in their penis.  Then you thwack it repeatedly to break the glass.  Then you force them to drink a lot of water.  Thus you end up pissing out through a glass shard filled urethra.  
This is the only time ever where Anal Shredding is preferable to anything.
Except that terminally ill adult will also have get to "Make-A-Curse"And thus the cycle continues.

It's worse than Time Warner. I didn't think that was possible, but it is. 
Yes like YouTube, and the ads will be THREE TIMES AS LOUD
And they have slightly too much salt.
Kind of, but you'd also have to add the feeling of never getting enough air. Which would make the curse even worse. Don't smoke kids! Or work in a coal mine
Man, I hate that cough so much! Like every particle of air that dares try to remain in your lungs must be punished for its impudence and forced out. Then a huge gasp to try and suck enough air back in so that it can do it all over again.
My Asian friend married a white girl. His parents just started completely ignoring him.He considers it a mixed bag. 
Barbarian....who doesn't wear socks with shoes.  Hell i cant even step outside in my orange crocs without socks on. 
Doesn't work. I think it's because I only have some small patches where I have no feeling, with the areas around those patches able to feel that *something* is happening to my right arm. (Also, it's hard to scratch one arm without using the other arm...but it is amusing to try)
Have you tried treating for pinworms?

The problem, IIRC, is that they bound keyboard shortcuts to it, also put it in the same place as the previous button in the UI. Which was very stupid. Not to mention it muted future responses in the conversation, so not only do you look like a minion-loving idiot, you also missed all of the replies asking for clarification.Modern web apps have already conditioned users to ignore small changes over time.

Hey, Aynnjylla, how's it going?
Yeah. I've had fleas (a stray cat somehow got into my house and slept in my bed with me, I shit you not) and while they suck, it's not the worst thing in the world.

The only feedback you have is yourself. Imagine you can't talk to anyone. Look into a mirror, for about 2 minutes. Right in the eyes. You'll get bored and want to do something. Maybe you'll talk to yourself, or fix your hair. Now imagine there's no mirror. There is only the four walls and you.Isolation is a horrible curse that I wouldn't put on anyone.

Very common, often undiagnosed/asymptomatic but quite horrifying, to me at least. Little staple-sized worms that live in your intestinal tract, and the females crawl out your balloon knot at night while you're sleeping, to lay eggs around the rim of your sphincter.

Hello HR my old frieeend...
You get a lot of weekend warriors that have Harley's.  For one to have that Macho outlaw look while being dressed up in suits working at an office all day.And #2 is that Harley's cost a ton. To afford one you need a good job. Jobs that pay that well often are long hours or require you to take work home. This leaves the weekend as your only free time, often just Sunday mornings and afternoons.Harley's often cost as much or more than many cars.

Lol isn't the point in 'warming up' (esp fuel injected cars) to let the engine idle/drive at low rpm to get the oil warm? How can you think revving it high helps here?I know carbureted cars are a different story.
Yep, it's better to warm the engine while moving. Just keep the RPMs low for the first few minutes.

A Polo is a good choice for your first car. Drives nice, relatively cheap to drive and maintain. Look for one with a recently replaced timing belt and you should be safe from any expensive repairs for a while.

'96? Not even close. I got married and my new wife brought a '71 Toyota Corolla with her. Cardboard dash and interior. Black Vinyl upholstery. Manual choke lever on the dash (I am serious). Top speed 67. The cherry red had faded to an uneven light pink - EXCEPT the trunk which had to be repainted (in America) after my she had locked the keys in it with wine at 1ge 17 and got her older sister's pos bf to crowbar it open. Claimed ignorance so insurance fixed it.But to be fair, it stopped running so I sold it to a friend at work for $50 and some weed. So you probably still win.

Damn. That guy was fully responsible for his own death, you just happened to be there. Lucky he didn't take you with him.It's a shame, but double the speed limit in the middle of the night with no lights? 100% his fault.
why did he attack you? was he on drugs or had a mental breakdown?
Sometimes people do this as a means of suicide. It's unfortunate you were involved and had to deal with the fallout but it wasn't your fault. 
I wonder how many lives you unknowingly saved by repoing someone's car.
I'm so sorry. She sounded like a sweet person. 
Who was "they"? 
My girlfriend gets pissed when I don't respond to that kind of thing while doing something potentially dangerous. This is exactly the kind of thing I'm afraid of.   I'm sorry for your loss man.
Do you remember this or did your parents tell you? 
This was my thought too. All too often love gives someone rose-tinted glasses, so it seems likely he did something to damage that. 
They replaced the street lights that day, pretty fucked up it took a death to save a few cents. 
I don't know the full details on that, but I do know that the chat logs were saved so the blame was really taken off of us. We demonstrated meteorologically why we wanted hail. His argument was "I have more stripes, get rid of it." I just wound up having a discussion with my commander about it in private and he basically said that no one pulls rank on the weather. Next time this happens, we have to stick to our guns and don't get pushed around by a "senior" forecaster. 
It should have but in most cases the staff to aid ratio is ridiculous. Imagine being left to care for 33 people that's what our third shift does anywhere from 25 to 33 people most of them total care several are bariatric residents. CNA'S are not valued enough for what they do.
I understand that that would've probably happened but I still wish I could've helped somehow.
It was a very small town and the driver was old. Still no excuse. Things can happen. 
Exactly. Think of what would happened if he drove drunk with another passanger. Him, his passanger, and any number of people in 1 ir more vehicles coukd have been killed. Likely, at least one life ended up being saved that day.
Or suicidal, even drunk me would probably look for a more comfortable place to pass out than train tracks. 
The gun is always loaded.It's not a toy, end of story. A hunter should know better than to give a firearm to a kid outside a safe environment (shooting range).
This woman obviously believes she has nothing to live for, so I second the 'she's not fucking around' angle. It makes me sad that the mother could never find closure or place responsibility where it should have been, and that it's not allowing this person to move on with their lives.
And the lives of anyone else he may have tried to abduct after her.
Sorry for your loss. <3
Like shit, he has a family and kids just like she did. He wrote a note to the her family apologizing but they never responded. He wasn't drunk and he is kind of goofy guy. IMO, it could have been avoided, he could of been going slower but she did not look up for anyone coming her way. Ive seen people on the mountain collide before; it looked like any of the other times.  
Good point. I was at a pool party for 6-7 year olds, and I remember diving into the pool and accidentally landing on one of the other kids who was lurking underneath the water. One of the adults saw this and pulled the kid out of the water. I am really thankful to have had that supervision.
We were at the ocean a few days before my sister's wedding. We had been body surfing the waves earlier hut everyone was up on the beach relaxing. We look out and see people yelling and waving and having a good old time out there. After like 5 minutes we realized they were actually in distress and took off into the water and saved them. It was crazy how close we were to just watching them drown.
Hey, no ones said it yet so I'll say it. Congratufuckinglations, you're strong as hell and I hope you continue strongly on your new journey! I wish the best for you and wish you well along the way! Keep counting those months, soon they'll turn to years. 
It wasn't even a mistake. It was the correct answer with the given information.  
The thing that makes it feel like my fault is that after his second DUI he asked me to keep his gun so it wasn't an option. He then asked for it back a few months later to go shooting, I reluctantly gave it back to him and said to give it back afterwards. He said he was getting counseling and other things to help with his troubles. I would compare him to Robin Williams, he was typically the life of the party and could cheer anyone up. It just hurts knowing the last thoughts about me were that I hated him. I didn't/don't, I was just frustrated with him because I cared about him.
Its easier to cope with the loss if there is some sort of scapegoat. They probably know on the inside he didnt do anything. And social pressures and not seeing the signs are why he'd blame himself If I were to guess. But the last part is very true. He obviously had the  intent to commit suicide, he would've done it one way or another. 
Grief obeys no logic.
Drugs. Alcohol and pcp. I could smell alcohol, of course. I didn't know about the drugs until a while after.
Yeah it's just that I felt at fault, and people drilled into my mind that it was me. Heck, even the local paper at the place said that the accident happened as a result of poor conduct on our behalf. When you see that in a newspaper it really fucks you up. 
I think this is very important.This reminds me of a post here where a little girl had to have surgery and she was not allowed to eat the day before. Of course her parent gave her food and she almost died.People often think that these questions/advices are "just protocol". It can help to remind them they might die.
If they've got something to hide, then they will hide it.  If you're lucky, you *might* get the truth if you get loved ones away from them, but then you also might not.
What makes it even more of a dark memory for me was that he died being totally loving towards me, bringing me snacks and drink on a large tray which im certain contributed to him not seeing the controller.
This and suicide by cop are just despicable acts leaving monstrous guilt and pain
I am okay about it now! It was a very, very long time ago. The wisdom of age has only reaffirmed my decision. It really did save my mom... she was in such a terrible situation, emotionally. If you could only see how good she is today... I don't know what she would be like now if she was still around him
It always seemed like I killed him in my 9 year old perspective. Like I was sitting there watching as he died thinking he was ok
No. Not following basic road rules as a driver is the stupid fucking thing you can do.
Why the fuck would the pedestrians walk over a red light when there is traffic?Is it just the German inside me that doesn't think this is weird?
Probably quite a few.  Roughly a third of our repos have "empty alcohol cans/bottles" on the inventory list.  I've never really thought about it until just now, but that does pop up quite often.  Thank you for pointing this out to me.  
I think it was a term the nurses used to not tell me he had died. I was 17 at the time.They said "lo vinieron a buscar" which roughly translates to "(they) came to pick him up" as if "they" was his family, which he never talked about
He was the most lucid of all the people living there. He was the only one that could walk without help, and that only time we talked he was so depressed and told me how the nurses drugged them to sleep and how horrible that place was.And I thought painting something would make him happy.
I really hope so, although I haven't seen it that way before. Thanks.
If I remember correctly, I actually ran after her at some point, but she was so panicked she kept shouting "Go away!" whenever I tried to get close. 
Here in Canada, if you open your car door, you're responsible. You are required to look to be sure it's safe, since someone walking or riding along can't predict when someone will open their doors. 
Yes, as a family member of someone with Schizophrenia I cannot thank you enough.
My girlfriend gets mad when i tell her to take her feet off the dashboard when i'm driving. Every time i have to explain to her what would happen to her legs if we were to get in an accident.
unrelated, but during my time in high school, a kid shot himself due to being bullied incessantly. kid was a freshman, and it seems that after he died, everyone apparently was his friend afterwards. even the kids that fucked with him. might be a coping mechanism, might be something else more selfish, either way, he suddenly gained a lot more friends in death than in life.
I Actually learned this from my grandmother when i was 13 
Life long asthmatic that has it under control now. You are totally correct. It is often exercise enduced or can be triggered in other ways but it is a pretty quick thing, not delayed. Not your fault at all. 
Also, he should've gone to the hospital. It's unfortunate to say that he may have done it to himself
Fuck dude. 
Doesn't even need to know the month. He'll, they can get away with "Accident x city x month/year".I'm an emergency medical dispatcher and we never get to know the outcomes of the calls we take so it's something we often check.
The second time a passenger ... critiques my driving, my go to is, "Do you want to fucking drive? Because I can pull over and let you have the driver's seat."My wife was mad at me for three days, but she hasn't done that shit since.
This right here is the truth of the situation.
Exactly. You did what you thought was best and a terrible accident, well out of your control, occurred. I wish you the best and I hope that you can learn to handle and overcome that pain one day. Much love.
I agree. Couldn't anyone just order an arduino online? I'm sure they're really easy to get anywhere. 
There is. That's why it's something I hate myself for. 
Yeah like maybe for her it was kind of okay to be the receiving end of her husband's abusive behavior but after knowing that he has also been harming their grandchildren, she goes that's it, it has got to stop.
Thank you for the condolences, but my real message was, in instances like this, "blame" can't be directed - understanding the actual causes is almost as complex as understanding the results, and you were unfortunately caught up in a terrible story outside your own. I hope you've "moved on" as best as you can and have come to realize none of this was your fault - you were an unfortunate victim in someone else's story, and I hope it doesn't follow you
Unfortunately it's called Blood Priority, very well known in the aviation industry.   
This is the part I don't get: Who cares if they object, regardless of their rank. You are the forecaster. It's your forecast (your subordinate's, in this case) with your initials on it. So long as your forecast is consistent with the operational area forecast, note the objections in your forecast worksheet and leave your forecast as is. If it doesn't verify, then be prepared to write up the missed forecast review. Too f-ing bad for the guy that doesn't want to brief it.
No, they certainly are not. When I was a brand new nurse CNAs saved my ass on multiple occasions. Cannot thank them enough for all they do!  
What's always gotten me is that we consider euthanizing animals that are in pain humane, to the point where the technical designation for euthanizing a laboratory animal that can no longer ethically be used (tumors are too large, surgeries aren't healing right, etc...) is "humane endpoint". Yet euthanizing a person is considered monstrous. I just get really hung up on the level of cognitive dissonance implied by the terminology.
My great grand mother passed a few years ago, and it was one the most..  non-sad? funerals I'd ever been to.  I mean, we all loved her and missed her, but for about a year before that every time you left it would be like;"See you at Christmas grandma!""Oh, I hope not."She was there, mentally.  She was mostly blind, from cataracts.  And she was just..  ~~waiting~~hoping to die.  And she let her wishes be known.I just wish we were in a society where one could just.. opt out, in a legal, humane, acceptable way.
As an adult with training, maybe.As an eight year old? Not a chance. The *best* you could have *maybe* done was stay back and encourage him. But most likely you would have simply witnesses him going under for the last time first hand. Not a memory you need.Sorry you lost him that way.
I can't drink because I become deeply suicidal. I keep it at bay sober.
Yeah as a non-firearm user this is the rule I live by. Can it fire a bullet?  If so, assume it's loaded.
Oh I agree. The fact that he has restraining orders against her and the police don't do anything about those threats is a joke. They are legitimate. I understand she lost a child, but also, this man did not kill her daughter.
We had a pool party for my daughter's 6th grade graduation party and we hired a lifeguard so the adults could relax a bit and not have to stand by the pool the whole time.
That was me when I was a teenager.  Was at the beach and swam out to a buoy -- I wasn't (and still am not) a good swimmer, and by the time I got there, I was completely exhausted.  I was hanging onto the buoy while frantically waving to a passing boat.  The passengers smiled and waved back.  Somehow I managed to swim back to the beach.  My body felt like it was on fire and I could see my entire chest move with my heart beat.
I've lost two close family members this way. Not the exact same living situation, but same behavior and end result. I'm sure if they were still around they would forgive you and know you were right not to let them take advantage of you. I hope you're taking care of yourself and are able to let go of feeling guilt, I know sometimes it's hard.
It is so important what you said, "Its easier to cope with the loss if there is some sort of scapegoat" this applies to SO many situations in life. For example, I got dumped because there was someone else is easier to accept than I got dumped because I was not the one he wanted. 
Fuck the media, they always make up shit. You were definitely not at fault here. 
I had a Spanish teacher in high school that was an anesthesiologist in Brazil before he moved to the US and told us about this happening. When they intubate someone they will gag when you're taking it out then if they ate or drank they will puke and immediately aspirate it back to their lungs and basically drown. 
My dad's a cardiologist and he calls this the "door stop". He's been practicing for almost 50 years, and says when someone is leaving his office, if they hesitate for even a fraction of a second at the door as they leave the exam room and don't sneeze, there's something they didn't tell you and you need to calmly figure out what it is. 
trains too
But surely they should have warned you, and told you to turn him on his side if he choked? If you weren't there, it would have happened either way. If they had some kind of baby monitor, shouldnt  they have come in to check on him? They probably blame themselves but took it out on you as a coping mechanism. 
You likely did him a huge favor. If I ever end up in a nursing home I hope someone will be there for me to do the exact same thing. Once all the quality of one's life is gone, remaining on earth is sheer torture.
oh god i am so sorry. how is your relationship nowadays?
Sadly lots of deaths occur from trying to save time  
that's messed up..
Can't remember which poet said something like this:*We die three deaths**The first is when we take our last breath**The second is when our body is laid to rest**And the third is when our name is spoken for the last time*I think remembering is the most important thing.
I mean, if they were familiar and capable enough with Arduino to make a bomb using it, then it probably wasn't the only Arduino bomb they had made. Seems unlikely that it was the same one. Not to mention that they would have created a bomb either way.
>  I hope you've "moved on" as best as you can In the least callous meaning way possible--I have moved on in many ways. The event shaped a part of my life that I wont forget, for better or for worse. I am much more sympathetic to people though that are inadvertently exposed to tragedy that they had to decision in becoming a part of. 
From a brand new lpn that still hasn't transitioned out of cna mode. Thank you.
I've thought about every possible thing that could've happened differently and that one has been hard to think about. I wish I saw him one more time since I just turned around and he was gone but seeing him go under would be too much for me. 
As someone raised with guns who owns multiple this is me even to the annoyance of others. I can unload the gun myself and hand it to someone to look at and if they point it near me I will scold them. 
Yeah, the main red flag is the arms. They don't thrash or wave, they instinctively slap the water horizontally, like they're imitating a bird. You can sort of tell that they have no control over their body, that they've just completely focused on not going under.
When you are in trouble in the water youre supposed to raise your arm with a closed fist so it doesnt look like you are waving. There needs to be more info about this sort of thing.
my mom was murdered and I was there and a week later when I went back to school everyone was asking me questions and the news made up shit saying she was hit by a baseball bat to the head.

Had i not been looking right at em, id have missed it, and im pretty sure he wouldve lied. 
Me: Do you have any medical problems?78 year old Patient: Nope. None.Me: What do you take the Lipitor,  Coumadin and Metformin for?78 year old Patient: For my High Cholesterol, Afib, I have had a heart attack, PE. Oh and I'm diabetic. 
Balance and falls in general are so overlooked by people in good health. Living in the Northeast, I probably slip on ice 3-4 times a week during the winter. Another 20 years and that slip that I regained my balance on is me falling on my ass. Another 20 years after that and that's a broken hip. 
Train suicide can leave an incredibly gruesome scene as well. 
That makes sense it was just hard to process as death I understood but hadn't experienced it on a personal level and felt liable for the kid in the situation, i guess it was the parents fault in the end
Everyone wants someone to point the finger at. 
It's true, after all quality of life is gone, every day is Hell. My father dealt with MS and Tinitus for a long long time waiting until my big brother and I were grown enough to understand and living our own lives before he took his.  He was unhappy for atleast a decade.  He went out with some dignity, he knew he wasn't getting any better.  Still, the best man I've ever known.
Uh... so in an unrelated incident 4 years ago right before I graduated high school, my parents kinda, for the lack of a better phrase, kicked me out? I wasn't able to do very well in programming like I had wanted and didn't build the prerequisites to go to UBC, and they basically went ballistic and never want to see me again. I'm living alone right now, and my parents haven't responded to my contact attempts since. I'm not sure if they're even in the country any more. 
It actually better knowing,my mom and I have had a complicated relationship,She said that she loved me(like any mom would) but could tell there was some form of resentment and its better knowing where the resentment came from 
Well I think there are other sources. After all, the Taliban seem to have access to all sorts of weapons, so I don't think an open-source microcontroller would be too difficult for then to get their hands on.
I do hope you're able to forgive your eight year old self. Your cousin wouldn't want you to feel bad forever. 
If I ever hand someone my gun I always double check to make sure it's unloaded then before I hand it to them I tell them to keep it pointed at the ground and act like it's loaded. Safety is key. 
honestly I'm a lifeguard and I've never heard that. That's really good advice. 
The media has a tendacy to juice up the unverifiable details.
I'm cringing that a Brazilian anesthesiologist found it more cost effective to teach Spanish (don't they speak Portuguese in Brazil?) than to re-qualify to practice medicine in the U.S.  Couldn't even be a nurse anesthetist?  We throw out a lot of immigrant expertise...
Yup, healthy as a horse. No reason to be seeing me. Good day, sir.
Most suicidal people don't want to leave a mess. But sometimes you just can't think of any other way. And depression changes your mind. When you go into a depressive fugue it's like the whole world is literally gray and grainy. The person in your head isn't you anymore.
that's for sure, I mean who the hell writes a jaywalking ticket after such an accident?
My father passed in 2013. He had MS and had completely lost all use of his body in the 10 years before he died. He used to tell me that it took everything he had in him not to ride his electric wheelchair into traffic while he could still use his hand. I was young and selfish and thought it was horrible for him to say that. Now that I'm a little older I am a huge advocate of assisted suicide. I don't want anyone to suffer the way he did. Sorry to hear about your dad, I understand why he chose what he did and I love that you still admire him! 
Sorry, your parents sound like assholes. 
I can see that. It would be better to know in that case. 
The number of NYC taxi drivers with graduate degrees from their home countries is really rather astounding. 
I would add one should also disclose herbal or nontraditional medicines because some do interact with other  drugs. At one point, I used St John's Wort, and because I had heard of some interactions, I made a point of always disclosing. I also found that even the more skeptical health professionals would still rather know everything a patient is taking.
Jumping in front of a train was honestly one of the leading ideas I had when I was having suicidal thoughts.  I **never** wanted to leave any kind of mess for anyone, but I figured that with a train, at least my parents wouldn't have to see it and try to clean up.  They'd also not have to live around the area where I'd died.  Those were very big positives in the "death by train" column for me.  Plus the fact that it could give them hope that it was a tragic accident, if that helped them cope.
Yeah....particularly a dick move when it's the boyfriend of a girl who just fucking died. As if that guy doesn't have enough on his plate. Like all the guilt of not moving his girl, or being more careful about crossing the street or any of that.
I can't come with any argument against that, but honestly I don't think there's any possible positive outcome for me to hold a grudge against them. I might as well be dwelling on that asshole bully in grade 4. Note: I don't excuse my parents' behavior, and know that they treated me horribly, I'm just saying I don't think it's healthy for me to really hate them. All I want to do is just move on right now. 
Yeah, Japanese, but first generation Canadian, and that Asian parent stereotype had to come from somewhere. 
Every cabby I've had was usually an engineer.
Thank you for that; as a pharmacist I'd like to point out that taking St John's Wort with common medications like antidepressants can potentially cause serotonin poisoning, seizures and death. Considering it's a natural, over the counter supplement used to TREAT depression (amongst other things), the amount of people who begin taking it to help their mood and don't think about how it will affect their other medications is astounding
I'm sure the cops did it to relieve the liability from OP who has to deal with having accidentally killed someone.  It  would help him if it went to trial had the family sued civilly. It would remove at least a portion of the responsibility from OP.It sucks but it's part of the process.  
You've got a really level head and good outlook. Harbouring a grudge does you no good. Keep on pushing forward and working towards your goals. Best of luck in life man. PS shout-out to BC!
no kidding - like textbook. From another Canadian, hope things are goin alright mon frere. 
I hope his prostate falls out
Did she tell you why she ghosted?!
But why did your roommate do it.
They were totally different songs. You see, yours were like "ding ding ding ding da da ding ding". But theirs were like "da ding ding ding da da ding ding". Completely different songs.
... I would have shown up forsure.
I stayed friends as best I could with an ex of mine. On the surface, things seemed pretty bad as she started dating my roommate. But on the inside, she was conspiring with another friend of mine to keep me single. They told the girl I crushed on that I was just using her to make my ex jealous. Made that girl cry. Eventually made me cry after all was said and done.It's been a year and a half and I have no regrets. The other "friend" was a shitty person anyways. Edit 4/1/17: I have not forgotten these events, though I legitimately wish everyone the best despite this.
If dude had depression issues then this is plausible. It's shitty but plausible. 2 depressed people are much worse than just 1. 
Raise your hand if you can see a chunk of pencil lead under your skin years after getting stabbed. 
Do they know you know? Or do you have a chance to mess with them back?
There are two sure ways to lose a friend.  One is to loan money to a friend and the other is to borrow money from a friend.
That is particularly fucking evil.  Acid tends to make _most_ people really sweet and vulnerable.  These people must have been born evil.
This thread makes me feel better about not having friends in the first place...
That's when you melee him in the back, and start an impromptu deathmatch for 30 minutes in the middle of your legendary campaign. Until truce is called and you continue the campaign for another 30 minutes until the same thing happens again.
cause I'll forget but I'll never forgive you!
I hope you don't hold it against him/her.  Risk alliances are supposed to end in betrayal.
To be honest I was very angry about it, and very hurt but I had so much to do with just picking up the pieces that I couldn't even focus on them. After the graduation, what I really took from the situation is learning that I never want to make anyone feel the way I felt when they hurt me. I've been more open and more strict about honoring commitments and making sure people I care about can count on me when they are helpless. It would be nice to see where this attitude gets them in a few years, but I think it's best to try and cast them away from my thoughts.
"You know, it's funny; when you look at someone through rose colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags."
That can happen??? Oh god!
And let's hope they always do.
Or straight up call the police.
And don't forget to punch him in the face!
16 years later is the perfect time to exact revenge.
Not OP, but my guess is that his roommate was a rapist pedophile and wanted to get the suspicion off of him.Or maybe he was just an asshole.
Found Vanilla Ice.
Well, that's something
But the legend of the rent, was WAY PAST DUE 
If only I was a red head. 
That's basically what happened. But that was high school which was about 15 years ago for me. 
I'm just impressed by the commitment. He lost 100 pounds to ask someone out? Wow
She kinda was. Probably still is. 
or plant a nest of nats in her home
I mean, if there was free pizza, shit even I would show up in the weirdo's house.
Can't wait to read the new boyfriend's post in 6 months on the next thread like this...
That's exactly what I would have done in this situation and it's not like he'd have any right to be pissed if Op had done so.  Makes me wonder if that guy picks his "friends" based on who he knows won't challenge him over BS like this.
yes 100%. I dated someone once who was devastatingly handsome and whenever we talked about marriage he said "I don't believe in me wearing a ring, it's different for you, you have to". Thought that was a pretty big red flag.
 Yeah exactly.  When I figured out what she was doing I cut her out of my life like a tumor.  Didn't make it into a big scene filled with drama, just quietly turned and walked away from that friendship.  Don't need that in my life.  
Because he smelled something off early on and A) told me immediately he felt uncomfortable with stuff that was happening, stuff she was doing, ways she was contacting him etc and B) began documenting all communication she had with him,  messenger logs, texts etc and proactively gave them to me *before* she tried to take pieces of them and show them to me to put him in a bad light (which she did).  I didn't ask him to or anything.   He could tell she was behaving oddly about stuff and kept me in the loop.  That good communication probably single handedly saved our relationship.    
Mary.
My boyfriend and I both have repeated lapses of depression... Most of the time is fine.... But sometimes it gets really ugly.When he is trying to cheer me up, it's usually okay. But if he gets into a funk I can't pull him out of, I get really depressed and sometimes breakdown for multiple days because of the feeling of unrelenting guilt that I can't help him the way he helps me.As much as I love my boyfriend. My depression makes it really hard to be near him sometimes.
[](/cocosad)Hard to judge on a case-by-case basis, but I get what you're saying. Helping someone with depression, especially when they're depressed for extremely long periods of time, can be very draining. 
Oh yeah after what she pulled off.. never again. Wedding happened January 23, and she still hasn't said anything. Doubt that she ever will. 
Not to mention a VP shouldn't be going directly to an employee if there's a manager between them.  Chain of command is important in any business structure and both his former friend and the VP broke it by circumventing the manager.  Shitty deal.
So many people try to deny that this happens, it's refreshing to see people talking about this type of behavior.I've been the above board, blunt, "I'm just here to work" type of person my whole life, but the type that wants to create havoc for no reason has been a burden through most of my professional life. The less you participate, the more they single you out with this shit, it seems.
Haha thanks.Yeah it went down something like this: she told me to watch out because she had a friend in law school. And I'm thinking, "bitch please, I know the people that teach at your friend's law school." Really made me appreciate how connected Jewish communities are.
"Hey God, can I take a trip down to hell real quick? I'll only be a second""Is it about brian?""Yes...'"Take as long as you need"
This happened almost 9 years ago (this coming April). My dad was overcome with grief and I was trying to hold us together, so I don't know if that even crossed his mind. It's thoughtful of you to post this and let me know. Thank you. 
No, we dated for about 2.5 years after that and then she moved across the country and I couldn't follow. Kept in touch for the first year and a half before drifting away for good.
Yep, I've learned to be careful about cross-pollinating my various friends and social circles. You never know how things might collapse in the future.
What's code for "we got a new drummer"? 
The news is out
Yeah, but then they got back together and broke off Satan's horn in a Rock-off.
I feel like maybe I have some insight . . . Musicians, as people, tend to fucking suck, at least when it comes to behaving responsibly. Especially within the world of punk/rock/etc., a vast majority of musicians are more concerned with the cult of themselves than they are with writing music. People and relationships tend not to matter enough to do the right thing. source: been playing in bands for 15+ years 
Or he's plotting his revenge...
Yeah it still hurts if I'm being honest. I miss what we had. He's spoken about it to a few mutual friends and is all for moving on apparently, as it's 'ancient history' in his eyes... but once you lose trust in who you thought was your closest friend, there's not really any going back.It's not, and never was, about the money. Cheers.
This was back in 2002
That administration is everything that is wrong with education. There will always be individuals who bully and abuse, but when the administration protects them or punishes the victims, then that destroys everything.
Yes do this EXACTLY. Tag them on Facebook, tweet at them, tag them on insta, snap them. Wherever they are and whatever social media they are on, make a huge deal about sharing the same wedding anniversary and maybe the bitch will let it go.
I was stabbed in the hand with a pen by a girl in my class. She showed me her boobs a couple years later. We were cool after that.
Wow, she dropped so many hints and you didn't notice. Typical guy
I made it abundantly clear to them that I'm aware of what they did. Would having a third party send them a fake "local man found dead after harmful prank" news article be too much? 
You clearly haven't played Settlers of Catan with friends
You know those emails you get about avoiding obvious phishing links and keeping your password safe? That's the person they're for.
I wasn't concerned with the situation with the woman. That concerned both of us, but my family life/ethnicity/parentage and the like was fucked up.  
I once stepped barefoot onto a pile of fishhooks that was sitting on one end of the dock. I don't know why the guy thought leaving them there was okay, but it definitely was not. My brother spent the next hour pulling hooks out of my foot. 
Yeah, it's experiences like that which have made me cynical.  Also, I'm now the guy who will be first to turn up to a party or night out that someone else has organised, to help prevent exactly the sort of awkwardness that plagued me that night.
Quite safe.
I guess it would depend on who did the breaking up. If it was you, I can see you not caring. It would be hard to have a friend do that if you had been broken up with and had lingering feelings for the ex.
Wow I can't believe the prof didn't believe you but I hope karma gets to those people. 
"What happened to us?""Same thing that always happens. You didn't know me, then you fell in love with me, and now you know me."
I mean, anal prolapses are a thing...
It's 1:1 same psychology. Most basic example is random loot (one armed bandit, mobs in mmo's) as uncertain reward is known to cause a higher spike than certain and just in expectation of the possibility even if you don't receive it.
And steal his Runescape items!
Or maybe OP really is a rapist and a pedophile. The roommate did say "secretly." So if it *were* true, OP probably wouldn't tell us because it's a secret.
Now if only someone was looking

A friend of mine in college spend three months hardcore studying to learn sign language - basically all his free time that semester - to ask out a deaf girl he was crushing on. She ended up being gay. So he decided, hell, I already know sign language now, and changed his major from marketing to deaf special ed.
No, no no no. You'd better tell us about that marriage of his. Sounds fun.
bed bugs
free pizza and ill show up anywhere
Judging by how she handles things, I'd give it a lot less than 6 months
He deals in "business stuff" and "business stuff" accessories. 
As I told another person who accused me of dealing drugs, you're absolutely right! I sell tobacco for a living. Like actual tobacco. Djarums and Acid on the low end, Cohiba, Macanudo, Arturo Fuente, etc. on the high end. I'm actually not sure what my cheapest per gram item would be (probably my loose leaf stuff like fronto leafs). But I live above my shop (because that's been a dream of mine for most of my life). I love the commute, and I love the lifestyle. 
why would he even admit to that?
After I said that I didn't want to be in contact with the "friend," she claimed that I was stalking her. Like what.
Why were your ex gf, new gf, and her parents all at their house? 
That's a good man right there. Sorry it didn't work out.
This makes me think of my old roommates. They are absolutely perfect for each other, but both struggle with mental health issues, primarily depression. It's pretty easy for them to spiral. He is upset and She doesn't feel like she can help, which makes Her upset, which then makes Him more upset because he realizes that his depression has made Her upset and so on. Like you said they are mostly okay, but sometimes a minor incident will cause a week of them being down. They basically never get mad each other, but are sad at each other which is almost worse.
I work in mental health and you really need to set boundaries and be able to detach emotionally or you're gonna have a bad time when a patient doesn't succeed
Agreed. VP should've immediately contacted their direct superior and been like "why is this dumb fuck bothering *me* with this pointless bullshit? I have *real* work to do." 
They take it personally when you don't participate because they perceive that they're not worth your time- which is usually true.
"and here, take my nail bat"
Sounds like the afterlife in Remember Me, one of my favourite books as a teen (it's a Christopher Pike book). The person sees their entire life and realises everything good they did and everything bad. But they experience from the perspective of the person they helped or harmed, so they feel the good and the bad emotions exactly the same as the other person did.
"Our guitarist is busy."
They're playing without me.

He has low intrigue, so his plot MTTH is low.OP if you find yourself in an inn full of exploding manure in 20 years' time, you know what you did.
My friend wanted me to stop being so addicted to runescape and when I went to get food in the kitchen he sat at my computer and dropped all my armor (rune of course) and ever since then, I think back at it, and see it as more of a favor 
But what if he made it all up to trick you and over an elaborate scheme taking place over 20 years he will steal your identity and all your wealth just to buy weed?
>He's spoken about it to a few mutual friends and is all for moving on apparently, as it's 'ancient history' in his eyesIt's not really water under the bridge unless you say it is... he sounds like a twat to be honest.
I got stabbed in the hand with a pencil a few months before getting stabbed in the chest. 7th grade was not my favorite year. 
> Reminds me of some girl I knew in HS who stabbed her best friend with a syringe full of water because she "wanted to see what would happen."Man, teenagers do stupid shit and I hope she realizes someday how lucky she is, because 9 times out of 10 that will do nothing, but it *could* literally kill someone. Had she accidentally killed her friend she would have been fucked up forever
Prank them by torturing them for weeks on end in a shipping container and then reveal yourself as their captor by wearing the skin and clothes of that model. Trust me, it is the only way.

I couldn't handle the fucking idiocy.)* And many more which just start to look like sitcom hijinks. 
Haha right?? I was the guitarist so this shit made no sense on many different levels.
No, shitty MS Paint drawings.

Oh god that sounds like us.The worst is when I realize it got set off my something little.
Exactly this. A competent VP would ask this person if they had discussed the matter with their direct supervisior. This kind of stuff, in my opinion, is not my direct concern.  This is a sign that the VP is either excessively controlling or doesnt have anything to do. Probably the latter.
"actually, i think it's around the time we go to war with hell anyway. jesus, sound the horns. and get me my nail bat."
No problem :) Hope Brian has hemorrhoids for the rest of his shit life 
The freedom of a workplace is amazing compared to a school setting.

Damn that's a stone-cold lesson
Possible. I'll keep an eye on him.
Did you see tits?
In middle school I know somebody that put a bunch of Germ-X in somebody's drink because he thought it would be funny. He got suspended and then had to give a speech to our entire grade (during lunch, with a microphone) about the dangers of ingesting Germ-X and how what he did was wrong.

Yeah I know. It's dumb as hell. But when you're young and naive, you'll believe a lot of what adults tell you. I walked out of that office feeling like I did something wrong. In retrospect, he was just an asshole and I didn't really do anything wrong.  If somebody tried to tell me that now I'd promptly tell them to fuck off. 
I've been touched by your kids and I'm sure they've been touched by me

I'm the same way. I'm an Android enthusiast. I personally won't use any other phone. I couldn't care less if you use an iPhone, Samsung, HTC, hell or even a Windows phone. Just don't be a dick about it. I hate when people with iPhones just want to talk shit to me about my phone. That's the only time that I ever say anything to people about their phone. When they say something to me, I typically like to destroy their beliefs around their phone because they've decided to be that guy.

I started my first office job recently, at a subsidiary of a fortune 100 company. I work with 5 other people and they're all older than 40 and have been working there for several years. Most of the job *should* be done through computers, but several aspects are still done with a pen and paper because they can't adapt to the technology. I had to show someone how to download files from an email and attach them in another. They had worked there for YEARS. I did all of the daily tasks in under an hour and they were amazed. I just don't understand how huge companies are able to function.

Can educators please be exempt from this? because they actually affect our day to day lives in real and meaningful ways. For me it's more about kids literally self diagnosing themselves with disorders they don't have so that they can have a fidget spinner in class. No, DeMarcus, you do not have autism or ADHD. Besides, kids who actually need fidgets have very different ones, like pieces of felt or differently textured cubes that have actually been proven to help and are relatively innocuous.

I had a bunch of trophies that were participation because I was really bad at the sport. I wanted to get rid of them or move them so I would have space in my room. My mom was angry because I earned them. I didn't. I just showed up and pulled the team down because I hated the sport and I wanted to quit but they wouldn't let me. 
I've got a MacBook and a Windows desktop, they're both great. I use them for different things, they're both great machines that I don't regret investing it at all.
The only other reason is if you're trying to figure out whether you can iMessage someone.
Oh I love the ones that say "I'm never flying this airline again" out loud when it's something like a delay to the gate or a weather diversion that has nothing to do with that specific airline. 
1. There's a term, it's called "Gate Lice".2. For those with crap status, getting on as soon as possible reduces the possibility you'll have to gate check your carry-on. Doesn't impact me as I always check my bag for trips longer than 1 night, which is almost all of mine, but as long as airlines charge for checked baggage and don't strictly hold to their own carry-on rules, there will be validity to this strategy. Edit for clarification: The charge is for checked baggage at the counter, not the gate.
The way umpires are treated is horrible, we have huge umpire burnout were I work. The players/spectators/coaches think they have the right to abuse our officials if they think the ref made the wrong call.
When I was like 9 there was a kid on my team with 1 arm (no idea if he was in an accident or it was a birth defect or what) and I remember one game he was in the on deck circle taking practice swings and his mom came up to the fence and started scolding him about him not having a hit all season and that he better get one that at bat.  The kid had 1 fuckin arm, the fact that he could even swing the bat 1 handed at that age was good enough in my eyes.
This. There's been countless times I've only had a carry on but because I didn't assert my place in line they ran out of overhead room and I had to check it in. It adds around 20-30 mins to wait for it at baggage claim when I could have been out the door.
So they RSAD about the weather?
To be fair, if it's 25 or 28 or 30 the result in the UK is the same:Overweight men will still walk around with their shirts off. Every single woman under a certain age will wear one of those long, maxi dresses, regardless of whether they owned one before this week. The Sun will have a picture of some students in bikinis on Brighton beach, together with a 'heat' based pun. The entire population of Scotland will turn bright red and shed their skin. 
I so pale.
I've been flying transatlantic a lot the past few years. Never have I been more happy to be a shorter dude (5'6")
Have a couple of friends in different branches, the ones that have never seen combat or been deployed are all mouthy about wanting to blow shit up etcThe two that actually got deployed, don't speak much about it and when they came back, they weren't the same. They have a look about them that just screams 'I've seen shit' but I know they will never talk to me about it.
He makes me want to overdose on bennies and drag race my friends until the loser dies in a fiery crash. #real1950s
I''m 35 and this seems unreal to me.  I've owned my own computer for 20 years (bought my first Gateway 2000 at 15 y/o).  I work in a small office with 8 other people aged 34 - 81 and everyone knows how to attach a file to an e-mail.  Yes, even the 81 year old uses a computer proficiently.

Usually it is ok, and if people start saying I am trash I just laugh because that means that they are just as terrible at this game as me.Especially in Bronze, what the hell are players expecting? 
Fuckin Smite man, dude can be feeding and you die once then he starts this bullshit.
What the comment is referring to is the game chat in Rocket League. One of the quick chat commands is "What a save!" which was likely intended to be used to congratulate teammates, but is now used sarcastically when the enemy team scores a goal.
If I hadn't bought that avocado three years back I'd own a home outright and be set up for retirement by forty five...
This expensive toast actually sounds pretty tasty.....going to the store so I can some right now. I guess it's not expensive toast anymore though if I make it myself. 
1% payrise, 30% increase in rent costs over the last two years. Definitely the avocado I'm sure.
My brother was yelling at me for no reason, and his main argument was that I was a millennial.  Bro, you're 2 years older than me. You were born in 1991.You're a millennial, too.
Like the people 17 and under as of now aren't even millennials, they're technically gen z
Suck it Lily. 
Bottle flipping is timeless I was doing that shit in middle school like 15 years ago. The only difference is now everyone films it like it matters.
Yup. Now we have people who decide which violent things we see, because there's not enough time to see them all, which we could do if we had the time.
Also as a child you're often more shielded from seeing the violence so tend to think back to those times as peaceful 
No.. you calm down.
'Say my name''Heisenberg''You're gosh dang right'
As odd of a trend as it is... it is nice seeing my one fifth grader who, according to his IEP, is required to have a small box of fidgets.... well, all of a sudden he is a cool kid, not the weirdo with the box of toys he gets to play with while everyone else sits and learns.  In fact, he has things ten times cooler than the spinner that people all of a sudden want to borrow and tinker with.

Fun fact: Jesus was against virtue signalling.Matthew 6:1"Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven. So when you give to the needy, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be praised by men. "
Maybe I got whooshed but the humor is supposed to be in the debate itself. One of the many memes where the joke is the gross over exaggeration. I.e harambe, gingers having no soul , mei being the actual devil spawn and the whole   Sugar vs salt on grits Thing.I personally see it as a cheeky ribbing between the two parties.Sorry if I'm being captain obvious.
Do you want to eat a milkshake, fries, and a burger for dinner here and there? Go ahead! Just try and go on a walk, head to the gym, or play a pick up basketball game with friends sometime during that week as well.

Last Coldplay concert I went to Chris martin says "thanks for dealing with all the shit you get for liking us". Broke my heart and made me laugh at the same time
Definitely. I can get into pretty much any genre of music because I want to find new things I enjoy. Liking something less because you feel it's beneath you makes you a douche, not a discerning listener.
I will never forgive them for replacing RDJ with a talking banana
Yeah this argument is stupid. So many great and original movies come out but all people focus and pay for is the comic book stuff then turn around and complain about lack of originality. It's not hard to look at what's out and do a little research instead of blindly and ignorantly saying a medium (that might as well be at the HEIGHT of its artistic variety) has lost all of its attributes and quality. Just recently Get Out was a big hit.
Are you pronouncing it 'do' or 'doe' in that sentence? I'm not sure there's a right answer.

I've seen two types return from deployment: You get the one guy that talks about everything and goes in to great detail about his deployment and you immediately know he didn't see shit, do shit, or accomplish shit; he just sat in the green zone pushing papers. Then you get the guy that is withdrawn, refuses to talk about his deployment and is genuinely trying to move on. You immediately KNOW he's seen some shit and did some shit while over there. 
I save that shit for when I listen to Chuck Berry.

I climbed to silver/low gold from bronze and down there everyone expects you to suck. In silver/gold most people are decent but lack consistency with trickier moves. I can be great all game and then fuck up one aerial interception that leads to conceding a goal. 50% of the time I will get shit from a teammate if this happens; and its almost always from a ball-chaser.

You're missing the point. People are mad that kids are playing with anything the adult is unfamiliar with. Down with fidget spinners!! Make Cup and Ball Great again!
That really depends on what the assignment was. 
are you ok?I'M NOOOOOOOT OOOOOOOOKAY!
I'm not religious at all, but that quote pretty much sums up what I think about it. 
I think there are two camps. The ones who are just being playful about a difference of minor opinion, and the ones who get legit emotional about what strangers eat.I think part of the problem is that some people don't realize the first group is playing, because they behave identically to the second group.TLDR: Poe's Law.

You sit closer to the screen at home! Way better than the humongous curved screens that make you sick because you're too close and staring straight. Don't even get me started on wearing 3D glasses over my real prescription glasses.

Would've 'accidentally' stuck my foot out in the isle a bit.  Oops, sorry kid, maybe YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN RUNNING AROUND LIKE A LITTLE FUCKING SHIT.And fuck your parents, too.  Assholes.
I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years; she's never taken another lover. I don't care, I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.
Yeah, if he's willing to say that in public, imagine what he says to that kid at home. Actually... don't do that, it's pretty sad.
Yeah. He's made a very good living out of running the league (and still coaching full time in it). Quality dude.
It's not volume-based, you can be as loud as you want (I mean, within reason). It's all tone/content. Disappointed "You can do better" might get a look but nobody would say anything. Meanwhile, "You got this, Jimmy, come on!" is totally fine. And the coaches are all employees of the league, no parent volunteers, which helps as both a distancing device socially and for training. 
Guy with no kids here. I sell participation trophies because the parents can't handle their kid not having one.
no don't 
My friends would talk about their down time and stuff like that but nothing else, just about how they got a really great tan, played games, hit the gym and stuff like that.Not once would they say anything about anything else, they just have a look in their eyes that is kind of distant.

My favorite was when somebody asked the government how young people should afford houses and the answer was literally "get Mum and Dad to buy it".No, wait, my favorite has got to be Joe Hockey saying that it didn't matter if they raised the fuel tax because poor people don't have cars anyway.It's both very sad and very funny how severely out of touch the government is with its citizens.
And depending on where they're from they may have nothing in common other than that range

Give the kid a fucking t-shirt or something. "I was there" is more valuable than "I worked hard and 'won' this trophy that says 'Participant.'"
I'm sorry, we don't have Coors. Is Miller Ultra okay? 
Maybe if they strapped you backwards to the top, all that hot air would do some good.
Am a parent, totally would have done that too.  
Damn. I want to be that guy. No kids yet, but I lived at the soccer complex as a youth. If I could make a decent career out of running a league/coaching I'd quit my job tomorrow. 
> You got this, Jimmy, come on!I thought this is what people did already. That's how most parents were when I played little league.Then again, I played in the crappy leagues and nobody thought they were going to play for the pros
Participation trophy here. You are superb just for even trying!
I love that this is a meme now

If you are in the unit with them, and you are training, you hear some shit. You hear those downtime stories, but you also hear stories about the scenarios that you are training for. Part of me wishes I would have deployed so that I feel like I helped, and part of me is extremely thankful that I completed my six years without seeing those things.
Haha, that reminds me of back during the 2012 election here in the States and Romney said that kids who have an idea should borrow $20,000 from their parents to start a business.  Since you know, most college age people have parents with $20k just sitting around.  I think Romney meant well, he is just clueless about the average American.

Whoa
I loooooove my fidget cube. It's fantastic. I just keep it in my left hand while I'm working and only set it down when I need to type something. Just constantly fidgeting with it and it keeps me from feeling restless and distracted. Tried a spinner and didn't really get how it was supposed to help me other than be my primary focus. I also have these mesh chinese finger trap type things that are sealed at the end and have a marble in it. I just move the marble back and forth by manipulating the mesh. That one is great too. 
Now that's got Reddit nice and firm.
Ha! Back in my day, we had a stick. A STICK!
Thanks mate

True that. Only time I heard anything was in boot camp. From my chief. Given my position, I'll never see the things he saw, but he drove the point home. This isnt about the down time or the fun you have or the people you meet. People are out there fighting and dying doing things I probably never could. I'm thankful my position keeps me away from it all, but also envious of his experiences because I want to feel like I'm doing more. Even so, my job is to support and provide a necessity to the guys out there. I'm content with that.
Can someone do the math on this?
Go on...
If you were rich, you had a hoop to go with your stick.

We need more of your attitude in the armed forces. It is a collective job, and a lot of meatheads don't realize how vital people like you are.

He probably meant for you to *stop cooking altogether*
> Don't approach recipes like they're magic spells in the Harry Potter universe.NOTE: this advice does not apply to baking. Cooking is art; baking is chemistry.
Damn. 49 yrs. The rolling motion. I forgot about the rolling motion. Welp. I probably have 20 yrs left before I'm spoon fed so thanks. 
my mom will only cook with max heat because its faster, but it always ended up tasting better than my dad's careful heat management. then i found out that chinese food is to be made on high heat always basically :/
I learned this while coming up with a perfect spaghetti sauce - originally I wanted to add every ingredient under the sun because I thought it'd give it more of a complex flavor, then I didn't have 2 or 3 of the 10 ingredients I typically used one day but went ahead and made it anyways and the sauce tasted almost a bit more savory. This is great advice for beginning chefs who are experimenting with their recipes! 
>not my best tip How dare you keep your best tip from us... 
Man...every time I want to brown something, and my dad is around, he'll put a lid on the pan because all the 'flavor is being let out', apparently. Sometimes I have to be stern and say I'm following a recipe, but how can I explain this to him? All the meat my parents cook seems to be half-boiled in its own juices from putting lids on every fucking pan...
* Does not apply if it's tomato based, add sugar instead. 
Rather, don't cook naked if you're going to puss out.
Or worse, an omelette pasta instead of carbonara.
Not just kitchen knives.
Or if something comes out a bit sloppier that you expected, you have created a nice wholesome "Rustic" dish.
This is exactly what I do whenever I cook. I always end up with just a saucepan and plates/cutlery once we're done eating. On the other hand everyone else I know ends up with every single utensil and piece of crockery used when they're done, which makes it hard to relax after an enjoyable meal. It's so easy to keep on top of; that part where you leave to simmer for x minutes- wash up while you wait. Bring to boil- wash up while you wait. Cook until softened/browned- wash up while you wait, etcetera etcetera.  
I thought that meant that everything is supposed to be keep in its rightful place.  So you can find it when you need it.
Cut everything before you even touch a cooker. Mise en Place. 
This but also with tops of certain veggies. I've used carrot greens, radish greens, and celery leaves sauteed with butter and salt. They also taste good thrown into salads.Just do a quick google check to see if it's edible beforehand.
People should eat "filling" veggies instead of going for salads if they want to feel full but lower the calories. Broccoli is a great filling veggie, as are squashes and bok choy. There is also great produce to be found at asian markets for greater variety, like enoki mushroom, elephant stalk, and water cress.
NEVER ENOUGH GARLIC
Jesus, i can feel your arms flailing as you speak. 
When you get good enough, you can just look briefly at the recipe and already see why the person that wrote it doesnt have tastebuds.
Following up: Don't experiment if you don't have an alternative meal planned.Especially if you're already hungry. That's a recipe for disaster.
As a rule of thumb, the more you paid for something, the less you should season it. Some yuppie farm-to-table chicken? Salt, pepper, olive oil, maybe a tiny bit of some green herb, oregano, thyme, or my personal favorite majoran. 2 bucks a pound frozen chicken breasts? Hell fucking yes paprika is amazing. 
If there's anything I've learned from the Food Network, it's that I shouldn't be afraid of salt.
Ooh, now that is useful. I'm always pedantic about having clean hands so this will probably help
Have you ever tried to cut a large sweet potato by only letting the blade do the work? 
Can confirm.  Winged a baked potato recipe.  Ended up with a functional, yet batteryless, clock.
Weighing scales are for baking, measuring spoons are a dark art
Seriously. His technique-based teaching style transformed my cooking ability. I was always fairly competent in the kitchen, but I can't think of anyone who has improved my cooking more than him.
No worries. We use tubes these days. 
Chinese food is 25 minutes prep +3 minutes of applying high heat.
Bought lovely new pans. SO (who is major kitchen hazard) used for midnight snack, burnt then scraped clean with a knife. Get a mad facial twitch just thinking about it. 
When I do a roast chicken I always roast some garlic along with the potatoes or whatever delicious veg I am having. And then smush it onto whatever I happen to be eating. Love dat garlic.
Stomach ache, huh? Did she try eating garlic? I heard it can have some medicinal properties.
Son of a bitch, I thought I could make it one week without buying some new high-falutin' foodie crap. Never heard of black garlic before, going to give it a try of course.
You'll get the best tip if you want.
I didn't even know sweetened cocoa powder exists.
It's a dry barrier that will discourage adhesion of the baked good, allowing it to rise as it bakes. Butter is fine if rising isn't a concern, but fats are "sticky" and can actually hold flour-based things down. It's the same reason you would flour a surface when you're rolling out or kneading dough. 
My mother does this with "fried" chicken. Just a little more oil than it takes to cover the bottom of the pan, and covers it the whole time. She can never figure out why it doesn't come out crispy like the fried chicken she has at restaurants, despite me constantly telling her she's making steamed chicken, not fried chicken
Julia Child said: don't crowd the pan and make sure you've patted the meat dry first.
I dunno, a tiny splash of red wine vinegar is my secret ingredient in chili. No added sugar, just meat, beans, crushed tomatoes, pepper, onion, and spices.
Apple cider or apple cider vinegar?
For ladies being naked IS kind of a puss out.  
Don't cook bacon with oil?
Good advice. Ground turkey needs all the help it can get.
Baking is harder, but some of the best ways to get consistent cakes (or other baked goods) is to:          1.) Get a scale and use recipes that give measurements in grams/ounces 2.) taste the batter! Raw batter will not kill you and in general if the batter tastes good the cake will taste good 3.) learn what a well cooked moist cake feels like. It should be lightly springy, but firm, when you gently pat the middle. After a few times you'll be able to tell with no problem. 
Nice try Gary, we know you're still living on insanity you crazy bastard! 
Take a small amount and toss is in a hot pan to cook it through.
I remember seeing a Jamie Oliver recipe with a typo so it said something like 30 teaspoons of salt instead of the required 3. All the comments were complaining it was way too salty. Imagine having that much faith in Jamie Oliver.
Nice split second decision there 
I'm the other way arround. I drop things and have caught them before I register anything more than "Catch the thingy!"If I can't get it with my hands, I cradle it with my foot for a softer landing.This will someday be... not a good thing. 
An inch?  Wow.  Is your floor made of balsa wood?

Professional sharpening is cheaper than people think, and a good pro will tell you when it's time to replace. Also: Learn the difference between sharpening and honing, hone regularly and sharpen as needed. 
The problem a lot of beginner chefs have is that we feel the need to watch the pot on the stove instead of walking away and letting it cook on its own. 
Buddy, I think you're doing it wrong.You're not supposed to be in the viking. He just helps you out. 
Which really is just the French's tactful way of saying "get your shit together before you start."
Be careful with this. Some ingredients taste better when chopped fresh. Onions, for example, will be noticeable more flavorful if diced just before using them vs. if they were diced a day or so ago.
My tip: when you see a recipe that calls for X cloves of garlic, just cross out cloves and write in bulbs. 
It.is.in.everything.If you ever want one of your meals to taste more like a restaurant just add butter and salt
All these gif recipes show them just dumping ramekins full of pre-chopped and pre-measured ingredients into their places, is that the way to go? Should I invest in some more ramekins/similar?
Tell me at the very end to check if its safe. you've got your priorities all wrong!Now I have to go to the er because I made a rhubarb leaf salad.
I mean, I get tat you mean 1 plate of "good food" can be more satisfying overall than 2 plates of "bad food", but the fact is 2x the food volume will make you feel 2x as full. For most people on diets, the constant hunger is the #1 reason they fail.If portion control while eating cakes was easy, nobody would get fat in the first place. Also, if the food tastes great, it's harder to not overeat than it would be if it was so-so
My point is that baking formulas were made for a specific ratio of sugar-fat-flour-moisture and if you fuck with the formula it can make the final product inedible.
Saint Julia is right.  Especially because, much of the time, you are reducing the wine for a sauce.  Reducing already fortified wine is quicker for the same flavor punch.
That's...actually a great idea. Only downside to that is you don't have most of a bottle of wine that you "have" to drink now. 
Does this happen? As there people who..... Don't finish their wine?
Yeah I can imagine how moscato infused marinara would be terrible 
i can and do eat sauteed garlic. so good. never enough. 
THANK YOUMy family acts like I'm crazy when I actually toss it in the sauce with a little butter.  Dumping sauce on some dry ass pasta might be what they do at the Olive Garden, but it's not how we roll in my house.
>times her pasta based on what the box saysNot really a bad idea as long as you subtract a minute and actually test it before you drain it. 
You're absolutely right, but this takes a lot of experience. My husband was a chef for 20 years. When he reads a recipe, I know he's goimg to change it because his eyes drift off to a thousand yard stare, his mouth starts making weird half-chewing, half-lip-smacking movements, his hands start flexing as though he were pinching imaginary seasonings, and he mutters to himself.  It looks like the summoning ritual of a culinary demon.
Hi, Dad.
Came to say this, was excited to see it already here. Kenji at serious eats has a great read through on it if you want the science behind it
Instructions unclear, try to eat clock.  No is potato.Such is life.
It shows curiosity and initiative! Keep it up and you'll have something tasty one day:) 
Molecular Gastronomy. 
Are you really going to weigh 1/2 tsp worth of salt?
Fuck, I really hope there's not a day when I need to be tube fed. I'd honestly rather be euthanized.
Reminds me of an ex...
Never thought I'd see the term wok hei on reddit. It's true though, wok hei is everything
My mom did this to all our nice pans, so now she's pissed that my dad and I don't want her using the NEW nice pans... (I spent $80 on a set of nice cake pans and she thought using a steak knife to loosen a cake I was letting cool was a good idea, and ruined the coating on, and she used steal wool to clean a non-stick frying pan)
I put slices of garlic under the skin of the chicken so it roasts there and flavors the meat
Well, hello there... ;)
It's called hot chocolate powder 
Oh my god! Is this why homemade cakes tend to have a huge rise in the middle, but are almost flat towards the edges? 
I can see that being infuriating.  The worst part is if you ever tried to show her how to properly fry something, she'd probably chew you out for wasting too much oil.
Water! The secret ingredient was water! Yes, ordinary water, laced with nothing more than a few spoonfuls of LSD.
Personally I need some sugar in there to balance it out. Either brown sugar or sweeter ingredients like carrots. That said, I live in a country where rich, sweet, balanced tomatoes are harder to come by.
A cheesecake without sugar would be horrible. Have her try tomato sauce that's too acidic and ask her if it needs anything. When she can't figure it out, sprinkle some sugar on and have her taste it. 
They both can, but he most likely meant cider vinegar. 
Don't cook with oil while bacon.
Taco seasoning. Some of the best homemade tacos I've had were with ground turkey cooked with taco seasoning.
>It should be lightly springy, but firm, when you gently pat the middle. TIL - I am cake.
Not Gary; Gareth. 
I've made meatballs 1000 times and have never thought of this. I too struggled how to test my meatballs and resorted to tasting it raw. Great idea
My friend had a Jaime Oliver cookbook I borrowed once and it had a recipe for salt crusted fish that I wanted to try, because apparently you don't actually eat the salt (it was a while fish, the salt was on the skin) but my mom said no since she's very anti-salt.
Have you ever roast garlic, in the skins? Probably my favourite part of a roast meal... 
The cat would not have done the same.
> Poor kitty was a soccer ball **for a minute.**How hard did you kick that poor cat?
On the topic of pets in the kitchen. Burning teflon will kill your bird so don't cook with Teflon if you have any pets birds. 
She will be culled.
No she's just seven foot five 
And give it to her in bed, the breakfast. 
Artisanal is what happens when you leave the flour from the couche on the bread when you bake it. 
This happened with my step mom because she cut herself really badly while cutting potatoes. She doesn't practice safe cutting habits.
My grandfather was a butcher. Always said " no one ever got cut by a sharp knife" so true... well... in the kitchen anyway. Every house should have a decent set of sharp knives. 
I have two chef's knives, actually. One for me and one for anyone else in my kitchen.
I only use my Hatori Hanzo, but to each his own...
That guy strolls down my street now and then, calling for people to bring out their knives and scissors.   I live in a traditional meets modern area. It's not rare to see a road rage incident where a Mercedes and donkey cart full of cabbages are both trying to pass each other on a one-way street.
Ohhhhh!!  You just explained so much to me!!   I never understood why my roommates did that, didn't realize it was born of anxiety about leaving food unattended
I prefer Frosted Flakes.
Aha this is genius :D.
r/VikingsGoneWild Don't you tell me who to be inside. 
As a kid my parents told me that raw onion was poisonous because otherwise I would eat it all while they were cooking or just right from the fridge. They also told me this about smoked bacon slices. Genius bastard. 
First time cooking (trying) to impress my future wife, I literally did not know the difference between cloves and bulbs. I was desperately mincing two entire bulbs when she fortunately walked in and disabused me of my mistaken belief. She's been the smart one in the relationship ever since!
Honestly, I just use tupperware/butter containers/cool whip containers when I mise en place. If I don't have any, I use sandwich baggies.
Maybe also don't eat the tomato leaves.
I met her at a dinner party in the mid90s.Very nice woman.She helped herself to a full, unashamed grab of every guys ass as she took a picture with them.Literally a handful, not just placing it there.She also told a story about smuggling meat from overseas claiming it has been smoked when it hadn't.Julia Child gave 0 fucks.
I've been told there are people our there who aren't alcoholics, yet to meet one though 
With cooking, exact amounts aren't that important. I've cooked enough that I can generally eyeball things to within +/- 10%, so unless I'm doing something really finicky, I don't usually bother. Baking, on the other hand, relies on chemistry. Exact amounts (of some ingredients) are important there!
When I was broke, my go-to meal was pasta coated in buttery garlic and steamed broccoli. I never got tired of that meal. 
Oh my god this is my mother. This drives me mad, and she does it constantly. 
I think that has more to do with most recipes being cut for time. I mean, I'm no professional, but I take my cooking pretty seriously, and when I get home at the end of the day I want to be able to make a meal in 20-30 minutes. Ain't no one got time for 15-20 minutes of sauteing onions when you're starving. On the weekends though, when I have time, you bet your ass I'm sauteing those onions for as long as I can.
At least dinner was on time.
And never, ever be able to replicate it!
"Deconstruction" is (an) Unforgivable
Depends where the tube goes
Yeah, I do the accuser grip with my knives.  It's really not as unsafe as you might think.  'But what if any part of the knife of your hand slips?'  Well....it won't.  In my....ten plus years of cooking I've cut myself maybe ten times on knives.Most of the injuries I've gotten have been from something that you wouldn't expect.  Like the jagged metal part from foil boxes....
HEEYOOOO
Yeah! What is it, anyway? I've tried googling it, but I can't find any chemical explanation. It tastes glorious.
Oh man this made me grimace in pain for you.
Ceramic pans are great until someone does this.  Still don't know if my mom or boyfriend fucked the pan up. 
But even if it was sweet, you'd probably be coughing because it's powdery.
Sometimes, but not exclusively. Another reason is that the outside of cakes in tins will cook much faster - that is, they'll rise, but set before rising as much (the middle cooks slower, so is able to keep rising longer). To help this issue, you can cook in a bain-marie (water bath) which provides better balance over the temperature, or I have these oven-safe straps that I soak and then wrap around the tin, which provides _some_ balance.
Do this with ground meat too. Cook it longer, past the gray color. Brings out the beef flavor instead of gray, boiled, flavorless meat texture. 
A true iron chef.
You said you wanted the flavors to be more alive. 
They said they add onion though, the sweetness from the onion is probably enough.
Good idea. Another thing would be to just make the cheesecake without sugar like the mother wants and have her taste it. Then make another with sugar and have her taste THAT!
That always bugs me, because applesauce and honey are still basically sugar.
No, I meant actual drinkable apple cider.
Okay, that makes more sense.  
Yup, so much healthier too. 
>anti-saltYou poor thing
Yeah it's amazing! It kind of turns to mush and you can squeeze it right out of the clove and spread it on bread. The taste gets much more mellow too. Delicious.
If it's all triggers then there's no bullets.  Catch away. 
Whoa whoa whoa. No one said that.
Shit, my cat would have swiped the knife off the counter toward my feet 
And does all her kitchen cutting overhead
Well, the last time I handled a sharp knife I made a nasty gash in my thumb on the first try... happened at work (yeah, it wasn't the first time) so I've now been banned from sharp objects. Happens all the time.
what the hell is a restaurant-grade mandolin, and who the hell needs restaurant-grade when playing their mandolin, be it for themselves or an audience?
Haha. I have three, one smallish one I use all the time, one larger one in case there is watermelon, and a huge one whose name is getouttamykitchen.
Everybody knows Hatori Hanzo now. He's become a sort of celebrity sword-maker. Totally commercial - complete sell-out. I only use swords from Korehira Yoshimoto - you've probably never heard of him.
Where is this? I've never heard of a traveling knife sharpener, living in CA.
best horror movie ever - you throw out grandma's knives causing her to come back haunting you, trapping you in your apartment insisting she won't let you leave until you're fed because you look like you're wasting away.
I don't trust food not to go to complete shit if not watched. I know what's needed to make the food, but me and my stove have a faulty relationship. One wrong move and shits burned, or cooked on outside and raw inside, I may suck.
I would like to take this time to outsource to the community;Has anyone had the new Cinnamon Frosted Flakes? How are they? Thank you for taking one for the team.
Also, white dishes are sexy and make you look like a pro
"When you're famous, they let you do it. You can do anything you want to them" - Julia Child probably
Broke? I'm an adult with a full time job and a family and I still cook that at least once a month. Same with ramen noodles. Throw some veggies, the left over chicken from last night and an egg and you've got a $7 takeout from a noddle shop for $0.92. 
If I cook while she isn't there, my food is perfect. If she's watching me cook, I use way too much salt, she doesn't like cumin, you won't be able to taste anything over that much garlic, and I'm just going to burn everything cooking it that high. When it's done it's missing something. 
I saw a review of a recipe floating around. "I saw your 1/4 cup of sugar but decided to add 1/3 cause my husband doesn't like things too sweet".Why can't people math?
That's neat. 
It's only science if you write it down.
Depends will be necessity. 
Or drawing blood on the fucking clingwrap cutter.
It translates as "breath of the wok". It's a bunch of aromatic stuff produced in the seasoning process as oil is seared into the metal.
I bought a $60 frying pan. Real nice one that I loved. Room-mate boiled water in it and forgot about it. Came back out and the non stick coating was ruined and the pan never worked properly again. I was pissed.
This is when you go out and get an nice heavy cast iron skillet and beat them to death with it.
TIL
He's 30% iron. 
And now you're sobbing in the corner uncontrollably. 
You mean... make another with sugar and don't let her have any.  Let her wallow in her self-made sugar straight jacket while you are immersed in the wonderment of decadent cheesecake and all of its glory.
When I was younger my mom switched from ground beef to ground turkey and didn't tell me for like 2 years.   No clue.   
YOU WILL CALL HEEEERRR!!!
/r/shittylifeprotips
Life to her is all about basketball training.
She does the whole granny cutting style where she peels and cubes potatoes against her thumb and because she uses a dull/practically 400 year old knife to do it she'd never cut herself before.
Lmao whoops. Not even gonna edit that. I enjoyed it too much. 
The watermelon knife is key. I keep a sharpened machete for those, pineapples, large cuts of meat, etc.
Yoshimoto's knifes are overated and for ignorant hipsters, i only use Kateshi Samadi ones, they background check you and don't let peasants buy them.   
I live in Toronto. Every 2nd week, in the summer, this guy drives slowly around the neighbourhood in his knife-sharpening truck, ringing a bell like he's the ice cream guy. Not only is he NOT the ice cream guy, he won't stop for anyone! You chase him down the street holding your knives and he won't stop to do his job. I think it's a mob front. 
My grandma always tries to feed me while I'm eating.She'll literally shove a plate between my face and the one I'm currently eating from. "Would you like some gingerbread?" Yeah, I probably would, but how'bout you let me finish the stew you just gave me first? You know what? Screw it, just put it next to the smoked fish.Grandmother's cooking... resistance is impolite.
Oh boy, here I go killing again.
Turn down the heat. Don't go over a bit higher than medium unless you're boiling water or searing steaks.  Gives you more time and forgiveness and stops the burnt outside cooked inside deal.
Cinnamon frosted flakes are fantastic
Grab em by the tushy
Mine just can't follow the fucking recipe to save her life. She doesn't get that different ingredients yield different results, particularly with baking which is more an exacting science than just cooking. It's completely maddening. She subs various oils in for what it says, she thinks wheat flour will do the same as all purpose, etc. NO. IT WONT. Then she gets mad because "that recipe is shit". No, ma, it's you.
Or the under side of the meat slicer. You know, the part that's the farthest away from the goddamn blade.
I would assume it encourages wrist extension (lifting up) to compress the median nerve, which is the culprit in carpal tunnel syndrome. 
so like the same concept of why grandma's cornbread in the 30 yr-old never-soap-washed cast iron is way better than mine in the 8" round tin?
Part II: You discover the magic of non-coated wrought-iron frying pan. And your roommate washes it with soap

But is it a corner? Or is it a submarine?
Yeah that sounds better actually lol.
Commas are VERY important in this case
If it ain't broke... and old people... Oh and when my grandmothers electrical foot bath thingy broke and she wanted to return it, turns out it was 13 years old. She still had the receipt though

totally. my grandma used to tell me i was too skinny and that i needed to eat more. look at me now - mission accomplished grandma. 
I want to be made at you because you didn't say they're G-R-R-R-R-EAT!But you gave me the answer I wanted so thank you.
Some could say it would increase her chances!
It's just kitchen talk
"Hey babe. Coconut flour is just flavored flour, right?""No, sweetie. It really isn't. And now you owe me $30."
I did this once at work and I felt so betrayed and confused because I had no idea there'd be a fucking sharp edge UNDERNEATH the machine.
Yes, plus a bit of smoke flavor from the high heat.
No you leave it on to season the pan.
That sword cost 5000 doru!!!!
TASTE, that mother...
Now that's some quality grandma story right there.
He actually is the ice cream guy, which is why he stamps on the gas whenever this dude chases him down the road with a knife in each hand. 
Tell that motherfucker to stop for people when he comes to East York!
He really did miss that obvious softball.
That reminds me of the time my mother in law, while visiting us, used an entire 2 liter can of Spanish extra virgin olive oil to deep fry a batch of chicken wings - this with a bottle of canola sitting right next to it in the pantry. 
This guy gets it!
FRY DID IT
My grandma's coffee maker broke once. It was at least 30 years old. She was upset. Went down to the basement and came back up with the SAME coffee maker. Turns out it had gone on sale once in the past and she knew she would need a new one some day so she bought it to be prepared for the day that happened. Still being upset, she fiddled around with the old one and got it working again.  Pretty sure she still has the "reserve" one in the basement.
Leslieville. He's unbelievable. Unless you're already out with tool and cash, he's not stopping. 
*Whoopwhoopwhoopwhoopwhoopwhoop*
My grandmother has backups of every countertop appliance. But the biggest grandmother thing she does is keep the calendar at the end of the year after filling it out with when she got gas/changed oil for her car, filled oil tanks (heat), and random weather facts. She could probably write a god damn almanac. 
Oh, that's just maddening. :( I had something like that happen fresh out of high school. I applied for a receptionist job and was interviewed, but they never called me back. Finally I went in again to inquire about the position, and they said they wanted me to work full-time as a prep cook in their restaurant (which everyone in town knew was a shift place). And they wanted my answer immediately. I said no thanks, went home, and cried.
I was asked if I had any "family considerations".  When I revealed *gasp* I have a child and husband, he asked how my husband feels about me making a career change.This was not "back in the day".  This was last week.
Out of curiosity, how would you suggest to bring this up? I am at a job I love with a great work life balance, but I still think they would have counted against me if I asked about hours that early on.
This needs to be higher. I mean, a lot of these red flags are good, but this is a pretty much guaranteed sign right here.
I always feel when I interview someone and make an offer that if the interviewer wants to skip their notice that's a real red flag. Because you wouldn't want someone to do that to you as their boss - it's happened to me in the past and it does burn bridges. Sucks. 
>"I don't believe in vacation"Funny, I do.
Had a similar experience with a company who got people in the door touting bonuses "up to" a certain percent. What they didn't mention was that that was at one time in the company's history and the numbers were always far lower than what they told their workers during the interview. When it came time for bonuses they would say something like "we didn't hit our aggressive profit projections, sooo... no bonuses!". Meanwhile their workers were putting in 60+ hour weeks and management always seemed to be talking about which of their yachts was their *favorite*
I'm working a job I hate but pays well. When we do the group interview bullshit we do the reverse stepbrothers. The company recently fucked me out of 10k. I tell ever prospective employee.
Had a similar experience. Was waiting in the lobby to interview at Lockheed. 2 employees walk past escorting someone to the door they had just interviewed. Everyone is talking pleasantly, they hold open the door for the girl who just interviewed, she leaves. As soon as the door closes they burst out laughing and start making fun of her. In the lobby, in front of other people waiting.
Also, anytime they mention travel, ask how much of a heads up you get.Almost worked at a place where trips TO KOREA were planned DAYS in advance.Screw that I'm not about to tear apart my schedule last minute for shit like that.
I just quit my latest job a few weeks ago and one of the things the girl training me said was, "if, no actually when (manager) pulls you up on something, don't say anything just agree even if he's got it wrong."Lasted 7 months in the place and I honestly don't know how I got that far. The manager was an absolute cunt and everybody was terrified of getting on his wrong side.
I had an interview with a company that offered 'software solutions'. Yes thats vague. For a half hour this guy asks me maybe 1 question and just rambles on about acronym after acronym. Software products i had never heard of before and that he clearly did not understand past memorizing their acronym. He then says i would eventually replace him. "Is that something you want to do?". Yea, uh no thanks.
That's illegal!
Yep, I got a job and they told me my start date and then they bumped it up... I was like no I need to work the other job I'm leaving for this one...Then when I finally left that shit hole. I said to the hr manager "hey, sorry about this, but I need to put in my two weeks notice." She goes "what's up with that?" Uh I got a new job. That's what's up 
[Redacted]
I like my job, my boss was like that during my interview. It turns out it's because he's a yes man all the time and basically just takes on too many tasks. My work is pretty independent so it ended up not affecting my job too much. I wouldn't say no to a job just because the boss seems stressed/rushed, but if you're matched with another job that's perfect it should tilt the balance.
> "we - we work hard here. I'd like to say we play hard, tooI've learned that any job that uses any version of the whole "we work hard but we play hard" is actually saying "we're going to work you like a dog 'round the clock, but twice a year we'll bring in a cake or something and think that makes up for it."
They asked me about my hobbies, and I said develop apps and mobile games in my free time. Both of them laughed and one said "free time? Well, if we hire you you can say goodbye to that." And they didn't believe my previous employer was real because they'd never heard of it.  I got a rejection email that night at 9 PM. Couldn't have been happier.
You just described an Amazon warehouse.
how did they get them?
>they'll be holding onto my passport and my university degreesI would probably ask them why they had such a dumb policy.
Companies calling themselves "families" makes me angry. It's an insult to the word.My last company loved to call its employees "the [company] family!" ...I ended up getting laid off via google hangout with no notice. My company email had been disabled before the conversation was even over, and people I talked to daily thought I was just on vacation for a week afterwards. I woke up with a job and discovered I no longer had one just before lunch. Some fucking family.
They dropped that one on me during my last job interview and it turned out differently.In my case, "We work hard and play hard" is accurate *if* by "work hard" you mean *working at a very relaxed pace in a cushy office job* and by "play hard" what you mean is *sometimes we drink one beer together on Friday before everyone gets home to their families*.Don't get me wrong I have no complaints with my work environment, but at this stage this expression is just a cliche that could mean anything and its opposite.
"We refuse to hire enough people to get the job done without overworking everyone"If you're salary, it's kind of expected - and there are times I'd say it's justified depending on your function, but if Joe down in packing has to work 60 hours a week, you're just not running the building effectively. 
I would have a hard time saying no. I just really like gallows humor.
Yeah fuck that. I'll work overtime when needed, but I have a life. I have commitments. 
Did this actually happen??
Damn this is depressing just to read. I DONT WANT THE JOB
This. A lot of people go into interviews like beggars. They're not giving you a handout, you're doing them a favor. They will get way more money out of you than they give you in return. That's how they afford to pay you.
I was between jobs once and did a group interview to be a substitute teacher for a school district.  The group interview lasted 4+ hours and involved weird team-building exercises.  On top of that, they didn't respond to any of the candidates for the better part of a year.  In my case they were stunned that I was no longer available...
I prefer half-ply myself
"Looking for highly-motivated people" = We expect you to do a lot of unpaid overtime.
What if you're applying to be a hat model?
A friend of mine worked at Crate and Barrel, they had a designated nap room in the office. It was a ROOM though for God's sake, not a bed just sitting out there. She liked the job, for the record.
Kinda related, I got contacted for an interview by a call center and when I came in they took me around, showed me the entire place. Offices, break rooms, like they were ready to hire me off my application alone. Got to the interview, it went well. Never heard from them again. I don't even know why they bothered with a 15 minute tour.
I actually received an offer, was told to call and schedule a time to come in the next day for paperwork (it was a late afternoon interview). Called and was told that she did not realize I had small children when she made the offer, and after talking it over with her spouse (who didn't work there), decided I wouldn't be able to work full time and manage my family. I was already working full time and had applied there just to see where it would go. Bullet dodged, but it still pisses me off. 
Gah. I hate this part of working in IT.
Coffee at the office is sometimes the best part of the day - So, yeh. Good one!
I find that's standard for any interview for a government job or highly structured company.I had two interviews for different universities and they were both panel interviews with one HR, your future manager, and your manager's manager.  They all just read from a script of questions and wrote down my answers. 
how did they turn your answer into a weakness? was like it:you: i believe teamwork is important to company success.them: sounds like you can't do anything yourself lol *texts*and yes they said lol outloud
I think that "kool aid" is totally legitimate for some companies. Many companies are fantastic places to work with employee-focused culture and all kinds of non-financial benefits. The problem is that NO company can stay that way forever if they plan to grow. Things have to be standardized and refocused on profit and cost once you get past a certain size, so you see that original culture either fade away or just be drastically changed. 
I second this. It made me lol
I am involved with a much smaller business than what  most people apply for (12 total people at my office), but when we do interviews we find it perfectly acceptable to ask us what the typical work week is.  We are looking to add another person, and he asked us during the interview..."What are the typical work hours?  Is there potential for overtime?"  Just asking what the typical work hours are was fine in my eyes, but by also asking about the potential for overtime, he was able to frame the question in a manner that made him look like he would be a beneficial employee.
No but it might as well have been.
I concur. Some might think - well, it's only a little bit of money and I'm willing to make a small investment. However, if the company does this it means they are absolutely not willing to invest anything in you. In other words, you are completely expendable and replaceable; if you go, they don't care.
>"I don't believe in vacation"Cool, I'll take yours for you.
Hold this goat's head back firmly while I whet the blade.
It was for a postdoctoral fellowship, the presumption was that it's too critical a time in your career to take any time away from the lab, which is bullshit anyways.
yeah I know it should have been obvious, but I was in dire need for a job.  I finally got something small through the college where I was taking courses.  Every single rejection and every asshole that never gave me a chance has been inspiring (out of spite!) for me to see this program through.  I'm almost done too!  Every bit of effort has been so I never have to be put through that hell again.
>  management always seemed to be talking about which of their yachts was their favoriteI always remember reading a story about a  company that was really, really struggling. Everyone was overworked, no one was getting a pay rise but people were pulling together as a team to get through it.Then the owner bought a new Porsche and it destroyed morale. 
> we do the reverse stepbrothersLess "Did we just become best friends?" more rubbing testicles on drumset?
Jesus Christ what a bunch of assholes. 
Right! WHAT WAS THE JOB PLEASE TELL ME
im terrified that my workers do that to me, like are they agreeing because they think its a good idea or because they might be scared of something?
Didn't he handle the Fisher account? 
Logical.  Their emotions are quite strong and are to be kept under control.  Such is the teachings of Surak.
> 'software solutions'You just brought up my favorite red flag. "Solutions" seems to be the favorite word for every little junky sales outfit going. If I see something like "software solutions" instead of something specific, I know the companies' got no core skillset beyond trying to peddle shit.
I interface with Sitel senior management on a near-daily basis, and I absolutely believe that. We're one of their largest contracts, and its like pulling teeth to complete any major project deployments because we have to get an entirely new management team up to speed every few months. Least they're cheap? 
Dead for 11 months
Yeah we know.  But it honestly wasn't worth a big legal battle for her, who didn't have enough money or energy to even begin with that for probably $20. 
"Coincidentally"
> She goes "what's up with that?"Wait, did she not know what you meant by two week's notice at first? Or did she just wonder why you were leaving?
Good luck getting in without knowing someone.
Wow this mid-tier bar-b-que catering on employee appreciation day really makes up for how bad I feel all the time and the lost time with my kids year round
Yep. The "play hard" part can mean they take employees on "team-building exercises" on their supposed days off. Nothing like doing a ropes course on Saturday, or staying late on Friday for a keg of beer (no thanks, I'll buy my own six pack on the way home which, BTW, I still have to drive my car to get to).
I had someone who didn't believe something on my resume... "This doesn't seem right. Care to explain it again and be more... Accurate?" "Nope" 
What kind of levels are these?
To be fair I'm a freelance contractor so I've been paid through Paypal before by other companies,  but other companies had me send them tax forms and sign contracts first.. 
P E R M A N E N T R E C O R D
Certainly not because they would be traficing op as a sex slave
"We're like a family" - Quiting for greener pastures is an unconscionable betrayal but it's totally okay if we fire or lay you off as an unnecessary  cost cutting measure. 
They won't let him leave until he finds a replacement.
"We work hard and we play hard" = anything from "we work way too hard but pretend there's play if it helps you feel better" to "we work sometimes but mostly fuck around" to "we do an easy, sensible amount of both working and playing but saying that makes me feel like a cool guy."
I was gonna say...it's just a standard finance job
Most staff move on but the manager is at 12 years and no intent of leaving for another 3. You see he tried, but being a big guy the trunk snapped. It was a funny day.  
Kinda wondering how big OP's potted tree is now. 
I would have loved to be a fly on the wall when you did that
I worked for a subsidiary of BoA, in tech, they had some of the most draconian bullshit standards ive ever experienced. Thought all banking was like that. I work for a much smaller entity now, and it's roughly 8 billion times better. Give or take several illions.
YOU ARE OVER QUALIFIED. FIRST DAY STARTS NOW .
I have a buddy who hired in at a place that was supposed to be four 12 hour shifts - 48 hours a week, right?He figured since there's OT in the schedule, there may be some more, but that a four day week is nice. He's got kids.Dude's working 14-16 hours a day six days a week now. And they're trying to get him to take this salaried coordinator position (he's doing it currently because somebody left). But the salary they're offering is less than he made hourly last year
This is what they wanted. It might be the weekend or your day off but you'd be expected to come in.$45,000 for a specialist technical job was shit pay for a standard 37h week. There's no chance I'm going on 24/7 call out.
Let it print until the queue clears itself out. Problem solved.Hi everyone, I'm the new IT guy.
Agencies are fine when you are getting your foot in the door or need a job quickly, but the OP had significant experience on his resume, and shouldn't *need* to be put on what is essentially a probationary period. It becomes an insult more than anything once you've reached your peak in the workforce.
Man Ive found many employers now days dont even bother to tell if you are hired or not. They only contact you if you are hired but otherwise, its ghosting.
Yeah! When I was interviewing for a job at Netflix.
Nothing more empowering than interviewing when you don't need the job. One of my managers said he would go on a few interviews a year just to sharpen his interview skills.
Push as many employees to compete for the same business as possible, then only pay them based on the policies they sell. 
I had a similar group interview for a retail position. I was turned down for the job but when I happened to go into the store a few weeks later, I saw that they'd hired the people who had just done as they were told and hadn't contributed anything to the group tasks
See, the thing with crappy toilet paper like that is that overall, it probably doesn't actually save any money, because you have to use twice as much, or more to actually get clean.
Back when I applied for Pornhub nearly a decade ago, they said they were looking for 'highly-motivated people'.  They were just looking actresses who would fuck with enthusiasm.
"Opportunity for overtime" = you will need to work 9 hour days and skip your lunch to manage the workload. also, how do you feel about coming in for a few hours on Saturday?
"Shit rolls downhill, and you'll be King of Shit Valley." 
That's just one of the many hats you'll be expected to wear. Hat valet is another, for example.
It can't be Valve, the maximum number of hats you can wear there is two. That's the biggest number in the whole company.
I'm going to second this. I work at a small company and people do indeed wear many hats, but nobody is overworked and for the most part it keeps things fresh.
Before my current job I had this happen a couple times as well.  Tour of the entire facility, introductions to all kinds of people, no job offer.
Incredibly illegal.
God after one encounter with my states DoL, I would LOVE something like that if it was a shitty company. Dept of Labor doesn't fuck around 
No no no! The kids were at school/daycare. I had a rearfacing infant seat and a booster seat in the back seat of my car. 
Basically just like that. 
I third this - it would totally be worth it just to see the look on their faces, especially when you ask for pay retroactive back to your hire date, LOL!
Agreed, once you are in the interview phase (especially near the end of the interview), asking about hours or pay shouldn't be too far out there for the majority of low to mid level jobs. If they are sketchy on pay or hours, that's a red flag for me. They have literally your whole life and usually past pay rates in front of them, but you aren't allowed to determine if it's worth your time to work there? Forget that. Usually if they won't tell you the pay, it's because they are trying to determine who they can pay the least out of the people they interviewed.
More than that, it's usually a sign that the company is a scam.
And placed those pens inside their tires
worked for a company, two weeks before Christmas: Owner of the company: "we need everybody to buckle down; if everybody works hard we can still meet our numbers for the end of the year, we've just got to finish these last projects etc etc...I'll be calling in daily from vacation in Australia, but just because I won't be here doesn't mean you can slack off"
It was at a red flag factory
> drinking problems.I was getting there. When you choose 2-3 hours of drinking over sleeping and knowing that all the social events have open bars, it's super easy to overdo it.
I got stuck in a lot of out-of-the-way places, but I found that as long as the assignment didn't go on for more than a week or two, it was okay. I would try to look up state parks in the area, well-known local restaurants, shit like that. It's not the most exciting stuff in the world, but it is always something new.
It depends. How do you react when they offer a different idea, offer suggestions on your ideas, or, god forbid, actually disagree with you? If you embrace the discussion and input then you don't need to worry. However, if none of the above events ever occur, it's happening all the time. You don't have to agree, but you do have to be respectful. 
From what I understand that is the case, yes. 
Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor.
My god, it's even got a watermark!
I love when you can tell a Vulcan is just barely keeping their shit in check. Which is all the time.
That was also in the contract, a ban on working for clients or competitors for 2 years. And if you give your three months notice, they will start withholding your paycheck. Glad I checked glassdoor on that one. 
I made about $2 an hour less than the other call centers around town paid, so yeah.  Cheap is the word lol.
Dr. Fishy!!! NOOOOOOOO!!!
It isn't a big legal battle. One phone call to the Department of Labor (or state equivalent) and your lost wages will generally magically appear. They will handle it.The restaurant industry takes serious advantage of their workers and counts on them not knowing the rules or standing up for themselves.
I would have left on the spot. Why waste half your day? It's not like they're gonna pay you for it
I didn't realize it was like that, though I wouldn't be all that surprised since it is such a good gig 
True advice here, you have to commit to the stare.Now, I know what youre thinking, "but /u/yakkahboo, his junk is below the table"Get under there and stare, dammit.
That sounds like the sort of question a level 2.8 would ask!
never take a job without a contract, you're in for a rough time here, probably
Which is sealed by law without a subpeona.
Oh my god preach. That's exactly what happened to me. Four years, laid off with no severance because the company was low on money. They constantly referred to their employees being treated like family. NOPE. And one of my bosses couldn't even be bothered to say anything as much as 'thanks for everything' in an email or anything to me. 
Not so fast. What is your collection of tattered denim and flowy neckwear like? 
He's like, "please god! Someone replace me!".
We just tell people that we expect that work will get done but have a relaxed atmosphere. Some people don't want to play hard and certainly not at work. I go to work to get paid and get things done but the fact that I can shoot the shit with my co-workers for 20 minutes after standup and have it not be a huge deal keeps me relaxed and coming to work with a positive attitude. Sometimes we  go out to eat or drink too, but that's just good team building.
So that's why only the fat bakers remain. Natural selection at work here.
I came 4 years ago, they where desperate for long term staff, they gave me a bonsai. As time has gone by,  I have awarded some with a second tree to replace the oxygen they waste with some of the stupid questions  they ask
I seem to remember after that it was "We'll get back to you."  
I promise swear promise it's real. It was a printing company in South Bend. I drove four hours for the interview and was there for about three hours. It took me awhile to catch on that all the questions were, "How would you fix this?"
I work for a moderately sized regional bank.  When we have reps from Chase, Wells and US bank visit us, they can't get over our culture and how much better it is than theirs. 
YOU ARE LATE. YOU ARE FIRED. HERE IS YOUR SEVERANCE PACKAGE.
Which is exactly why they want him salaried. There was a forman on the last construction job I was on. He wound up working between 80-90 hours a week. Salary. I would have quit. 
I once worked for a deli/sandwich shop making minimum wage and they had us on call on our days off because the managers sucked at scheduling. 19 year old me thought it was bs. 26 year old me would laugh and hang up. Those owners screwed so many good employees over the years
Yup, that's why I said "the best you get". Most of the time they don't give a damn.
From evertyhing I've heard Netflix is an awful place to work.It's insanely competitive & you are basically always on the copping block. They burn employees out quick.
they want workers not thinkers.
That's why I miss Gianna Michaels
Shit, wish I had known "opportunity for overtime" means you will be shamed by all your coworkers if you don't do "your share" by working 10-11 hour days. At least my company gives double time for extra shifts. 
The amount of times I've been asked illegal questions in an interview is shocking.
It is. People act like they can make instant, factual judgements on other people based on little things way too much. Especially with vague and open-ended questions. 
Usually. I just started working for a coffee chain, which will remain unnamed but American runs on them, that gave me one free uniform shirt and wants me to buy the rest. It's definitely legit but still a pain
If you show up early you'll be 98% to the top
*proceeds to slack off to spite him*
Lucky bastard.
Withholding your paycheck? As in, your last 3 months aren't paid? The labor board must love that one.
It's a call center chain.  The one I worked in handled inbound customer retention calls for a large internet provider.
I overfed these men?!!
I once started a job and had to defend myself in the first month for something that happened before my start date. Didn't last there long! 
Every reddit post I see "oh it was years ago" "oh it wasn't worth the trouble" "oh it was just XX $" makes me sad since getting taken advantage of is so prevalent in society.
I worked at Costco as a summer job 8 years ago. The same people still work there today and they barely have openings outside of seasonal work.
See, my red flag was his junk was on the table.
THERE ARE NOW 7 MEOW MEOW BEANZ?
If you want me to do work without a contract, you pay first. In cash. 
> We just tell people that we expect that work will get done but have a relaxed atmosphere.The ol' corporate passive tense."Work will get done.""By whom?""Well, someone's gotta be selling all these leather goods."
That's a really interesting, I'll look into that.
Wow such integrity!
SEVERANCE PACKAGE IS POTATO
I DID A BUSINESS.
Yeah, if it hadn't happened right at tax time, he might've ended up taking it. But since he'd done his taxes while they were kind of hem-hawing around about it, he new exactly what he made the year before.The new position was 3k a year above that, but salary. But he got a $2/hr raise last year. Then they were upset he didn't want the promotion. 
When I'm rejected, I'm disappointed.When they never even get back, I get uncertain and stressed.I'd rather know I didn't get the job than be left in the fucking dark.
I did an interview with Amazon for their AWS IT department. Similar culture. The interview was 6 rounds and the last in-person interview was 8 hours long. More than one of my professors and colleagues warned me not to take the job because everyone they knew who worked there was miserable. Everyone I talked to in the interview process worked there less than 2 years. It paid a lot but I did not end up working there.
> the leads they give you.Ha!
That's what I was thinking -- the more soulless you already are, the longer you'll probably stay on.
Haha jokes on them. I don't give a second thought to my job or coworkers once i left the building. Not working those extra hours just lets me ignore it more.
"Fly free little twit!"
Yeah, the real answer to why they ask those questions is "we're arbitrary but like to pretend we're analytical".
I'm a mechanic and worked for a Honda dealership that tried that.  I've been provided uniforms by every shop I've ever worked for so I wasn't about to start paying for them.They ended up changing their minds when they got tired of me wearing everything I deemed suitable for getting dirty at work.
There was a guy that showed up 30 min early for every damn shift.  Wasn't the fastest, smartest, or best worker, but he had a job for life.  Just having him as an example of what was possible in the building was worth having him around.  
I killed Paul Allen and I liked it
I actually looked up the labour tribunal proceedings and found a case taken by a former employee against the company for that exact reason. Apparently the company instructed their legal counsel to not attend the hearing, and instead requested the hearing to be adjourned for a further two months. The judge awarded the employee double the withheld wages and refused to adjourn. 
I feel like working in a call center would be crappy no matter what the atmosphere was like.  There would probably always be high turnover at call centers.
awww theyre all tuckered out
You may be joking, but this has actually happened to me on several occasions.
Hence why it still goes on. 
Costco is like the holy grail of retail jobs.  Seriously.  I tried multiple times to get my foot in the door there back when I was trying to make a living in retail.
But his hips were still under the table, making that a **big red flag**.
Your really good bonus was less than 300 dollars Though, my company doesn't do bonuses... Or employee appreciation
Fives have lives, Fours have chores, Threes have fleas, Twos have blues and Ones don't get a rhyme because they're garbage.
Are you sure he didn't just say, " AH holy shit! This fucking hurts
How nice of her.
"We paid people with degrees and 10+ years experience slightly above minimum wage, demanded they work unreasonable hours, tried to make them question their value, and they all left. Today's workers are so entitled!"
HALF OF POTATO. ECONOMY :(
Amazon has a very high turn over. I know a few people who went there and only intended to work the 2 years, get their stock signing bonus, cash out to pay their loans off & find a place to actually be happy.The signing bonus in stock is paid out weirdly. You get 10% after 6 mo. 15 % after 12, 25 % after 18 & the remaining 50% after 24.
I've never looked it up, but I'm pretty sure they just can't make you buy anything only available through the company or only useful in your position. Buying the rest of the uniform usually consists of wearing black below the waist. It's not the same level of job, but it should be similar legal status to requiring people to show up in a shirt and tie.
Man, I'm a pretty mediocre worker. But I am ridiculously reliable and ALWAYS come in if i'm called in from somebody elses callout. Got 49 hours this week part time. I just show up, and show up when somebody else can't. People talk me up like i'm good or something but I just show up. 
This is a gun???
Yeah, even as I was posting that, I was thinking that it probably did happen to someone for real. :/
I have many years as grocery management, I attempted to get a job there at a particularly shitty point in my career, and didn't even get a call back
That's a big green flag for some folks.
I did a report on him back in Catholic school elementary, I found the same reports this guy was a talking hamburger
"Workers these days asking for a fair wage! They should be willing to work for free just for the *experience*!" 
The running gag I was told was that everyone works for Amazon for 2 years before moving onto Google.
I'm black below the waist
For a lot of jobs in the service industry (retail, fast food, etc) just showing up consistently puts you above most of their potential employees.
More or less that just happened to my wife.  Took time off after having a baby.  Control of all her projects was given to manager X.  *Every single project* had extra people put on it and their budgets exploded.  (Basically, manager X parked idle people from his projects on her projects so that they wouldn't have to be laid off.)End result was wife gets back from maternity leave and every single one of her projects' budgets exploded.  She was laid off as a direct result.  Manager X was promoted to VP.*Fuck those guys.*
The 2 years makes sense to max out the signing bonus. But from what I have heard google is just as bad. All the tech giants are.You hear about the awesome pay, you hear about the rock walls, and ice cream bars, and parties.What you don't hear about is how all those extra benefits are designed to keep you at work. Keep you working. My buddy quit google when he got a bad review for not "pulling his weight" because he was only putting in 50 hrs a week on a project.
I manage a summer candy and ice cream store and was talking about this with a guy that manages a bar across the way this morning.  It's nice to have someone that is really good at their job but it's more important to just have someone be there when they need to be.  Show up on time and don't call out and you'll have a job for as long as you want it.  Alcohol can't pour itself and ice cream won't scoop its own way into a cup.
Wisconsin?
>the COL is cheaper.Sigh, not in Boston. The worst of both worlds!
I live in South Florida.  Every day I leave my house, two contradictory thoughts go into my head:  "wow the weather is amazing, so happy to be here."  *2 minutes later*  "wow the people here are a mix of stupid, trashy and insane, wish I could live somewhere else."Never fails
> Four seasonsJust not of equal length.
And hockey.  And skiing.  Winter sports are pretty damn fun.  
Bavaria here: no earth quakes, no tornadoes (well there are apparently 1 or 2 every now and then), no tsunamis, no dangerous or vicious predators (seriously the most annoying thing here is the occasional mosquito). It's usually temperate, not too warm, not too cold, not constantly raining, no droughts. It's generally very pleasant. Only some floodings now and then, but most of those are man's fault...
I like how the top two comments are talking about opposite climates temperature wise. 
I agree! Heat definitely makes me very lethargic. I have no energy to do anything when its 115F (46C) out. Plus I get heat rash and sunburned very easily... I just think I was never meant to live in a desert. 
Fewer
Ditto. The love of my life invited me. What was I supposed to do?
Damn right we are!!! 
Your third point made me chuckle! I'm from a university town in Canada and its awesome watch all the international students freak out about the cold in November when the locals know...... oh they know
Ahead of the game, I like it.
That sounds offal.
I moved from an incredibly hot place (Coachella Valley) to an incredibly cold place (NW Colo) fifteen years ago.  I'd rather go through a winter here than a summer there any day.
For those of you in the Bahamas, Belize, Cayman Islands, Palau and the United States:25C is 77 in Fahrenheit.
I'm from Arizona. What is humidity?
"I've got trees and vegitation in the city I stay,The (low) rent's in the mail, and I can always find a parking space.The women outnumber the men two to one.I got parks and zoos and things to do with my son.The nightlife ain't all that, but that's ok:I don't need to be distracted by the Devil everyday.And the jobs ain't really too hard to find, in factYou could have mine if you knew how to rhyme!So roam if you must, but come home when you've seen enough."-"Shh" by Atmosphere, a pretty good list of why Minnesota is dope.
Dude, I'm from the plains in central Canada and just because it gets cold as fuck in the winter doesn't mean it doesn't get hot as fuck in the summer. I've seen it go from -40C (-40F) in winter up to 35C (95F) in the summer (that's without windchill or humidity calculated in). You want to experience extreme weather come to Winnipeg.
idk,NY is getting pretty bland, weather-wise.We haven't had any really good snowstorms this year.
No spiders whatsoever? Where is this wonderland?
But you haven't left the basement in the years!
Canada?
You live in outer space?
That honestly sounds miserable
No, Wisconsin is "never sober enough to drive away"
Another Canadian here. Work construction, you get to enjoy it in all its glory.And honestly, I prefer working outside in -20 v. +30.-30....Not so much.
This makes sense of why Bostonians are so angry.
Still beats North Florida
Hey, if it's gonna be my first time experiencing a real winter, I may as well go for the coldest state in the lower 48 I guess.
"I was born in the cold, molded by it. I didn't see above freezing temps until I was a man and by then they were nothing more than scalding"
The air force sent me from Missouri to California then Iraq. Like some kind of cruel joke. Then Turkey because I loved the middle East so much apparently. Then back to Iraq because I didn't get enough last time. Then Afghanistan. That place gets cold in the winter though. 
ND native here: joined the AF and continually got hell from a Tennessee friend who made fun of how cold it was and how boring it was.A fortunate twist of fate landed him there as his second assignment. Why not minot indeed  
Fun fact it's eerily quiet because the snow absorbs a lot more sound 
We have those in SE Texas!Sleet Season, Spring, Hell, and Monsoon. 
It's the "Cold-is sometimes" that is the best.  In SC it'll get down into the mid to upper 40's for a week in January, then back up to the 60's and 70's for a couple weeks, and then back down again.  By the end of February we have mini tornados of pollen.  
Have you ever been in the forest in the height of summer here? So. Many. Bugs. They are mostly around bodies of water and I still fucking love it here, rain and all.
Hey its me ur spring
Centipedes. Cockroaches. Things that get into your house for the sole purpose of destroying your peace of mind.
Upvoted for hockey
No, snowmobiles are slower in 4 feet of snow. 
The northern states and most of Canada is like this, as long as you aren't on either coast.
I guess I didn't consider OP was talking about heat. Like sun burn? I've never had heat hurt my face other than the sun its self. 
Deserts are pretty inhospitable in general
I think you may be a reptile
That first spring night sitting out drinking a beer with friends on a porch is always amazing too.
And we still have very little of either thing compared to places with warmer climates
Thanks, Stannis.
Kindly decline. 
that temp is rare now.  it didnt use to be.
Of course he hasn't. How can you watch something that hasn't happened yet. ^^^^^^We ^^^^^^didn't ^^^^^^listen
The Gulf Stream has an effect on Northern Europe. A lot of Nortern Europe faces submersion if the sea level rises. Also with the sea closer, the heights will be warmer anyway. 
Holy shit I got Sprogged
Hawaii checking in. Are you sure about this? We just had a major cold spell come in over the weekend. I had to close my windows at night.
Until you live in a place where it can be as equally hot as it is cold. Then everyone is an asshole at anytime of the year. Looking at you Ohio. 
I think I live what could be considered "middle ground" but unfortunately the air hurts my face in winter and air conditioning is a necessity in summer. :/
Yeah. It's fucking raining. It's the end of January. The shit 
Yes, sorry!
> carUsername does *not* check out.
Lol, like being drunk stops Wisconsinites from driving
...Rural North Dakota
It's like 6 vans. 
Fuck you
The more north you go, the more south it gets.
The cold is not what is bad about living in the dakotas, im in shorts and a hoodie at 10 degrees but the wind is what kills you. Fuck the great plains winds.
I know it's just a joke, but in ND the temps get over 100F in the summer. And around this time of year, the temps can change by over 50 degrees in a couple days.
So California was the worst place of them all right? 
The snow absorbs more life too
Nah, if you live in the UP you stay in the UP. You know how hard it is to get to Canada from the UP? You can either drive around Lake Superior or head to Sault Ste. Marie at the easternmost point of the peninsula. I lived there 19 years and never went to Canada. Why would I with the Copper Country, Porcupine Mountains, Canyon Falls, Pictured Rocks, and hundreds of other beautiful scenic areas all relatively close by?That said, I'd love to visit Canada. Seems nice. And Sunnyvale is there.
Yeah, fuck this January thaw. I want to go tubing at Cannonsburg, but I can't do that in the mud.
It would take several hours to shovel my driveway. We have to have someone plow it with a truck. Depends how long your driveway is and how good of shape you are in. Also, if you work/school early you don't want to be shoveling a ton in the dark before you can even leave. (We pay the same person to plow my grandparents driveway even though it's short because it's just not safe for them to do it though they have a shorter driveway).
North Texas reporting in:Sleet (2 weeks) Spring (3 months) Hell (6 months) Brown (2.5 months)
I've heard that girth is much more important than length anyway
The plains are so infinitely worse. PNW really is a remarkably nice place when you consider the pros and cons. They payoff is definitely worth it 1000x over. I know everyone says that about where they're from but we've got it good. 
It's not heavy rain; often more "drizzly" than "rainy".
Upvote for Horvat, just scooped him in fantasy
Illinois: We're broke!
Finlander here. Stupid thawing and freezing cycle all winter. On bad days it's wet and sloshy. Other bad days it's slippery, hard and *sharp*.
I always find it strange how people say that the northern states are exactly like Canadian provinces. The difference between where I live and southern part of my province is astonishing. It's always hard for me to believe when I hear people say that Montana is just like Alberta. Y'all wildin 
The dry heat of Vegas was surprisingly painful to my lips, nostrils, and eyeballs. Still a nice place to visit though.
Not Phoenix. It's hotter than a motherfucker in the summer but not too hot to still do things outside. I play golf and mountain bike all 12 months. Plus i can snowboard in Flagstaff 2 hours away. The average high in july is 108 but with almost no humidity. It's not nearly as bad as Houston with 95 degrees and 90% humidity. Just stay hydrated and you're fine
Yes!! And the first few weeks when all the restaurants have their patios open. 
Pretty sure the homeless population goes down too... I mean... they leave, right?
Shhhh
"Honey, I love you - but your place makes my face hurt"
But I spent so much on the soundproofing.
It's crazy, 10 years ago it would get -50 and stay there for 3 weeks. Now a single day of -50 is newsworthy. 
Snow vs. snow
> Get herpes from a stranger at the marlin. ...>I've eaten a lot of chili dogs from the guy outside the Marlin.Is... is that a euphemism?
Can he also do Boomhauer?
Just purchase the tape of it now and fast forward it to see what happens
> A lot of Northern Europe faces submersion if the sea level rises.Ha, Norway laughs at you!
Fetch a towel.
>I had to close my windows at night.Holy shit.
When you step out of a cold shower and insta-sweat.
You can always put more clothes on to get warm.  You can only get so naked to stay cool
See, 30 degrees really isn't severe cold. I'd call it severe cold below -5F.I'd take 30 over 100, but I dunno about -15 vs 100.
Come to Scotland,  the air may hurt your face a few days a year and you might want air conditioning a few days a year but neither situations ever last more than 2 days,  each might happen twice a year 
You can name your car whatever you want.  Mine, for example is "Impounded".
Oh come on. Why, as of this January in Wisconsin your FIFTH DUI is finally a felony. (But, you know, only if within 5 years).... 
oh nvm
*throws iced coffee sleeved in a hot cup*
You sure you didn't poop out a lizard?
Idk the fucking no see-ums are one of the reasons I disliked the nights in the South. 
Kansan, can confirm.  Fuck the wind.
Welcome to the Midwest where it can snow in the morning and be 70 by afternoon. 
Clearly. 
The snow absorbs my will to live.
Who wouldn't want to drink liquor and smoke 6 paper joints all day at the trailer park?
Yeah, i grew up on a hill with high winds and a 100 yard long drive way, if we tried to shovel it the end we started on would need reshoveling before you were halfway done.
Hey now we get like a day to a week of snow just about every  other year so its fine
Could also be:Spring, Hot, Hunting, Crawfish. 
"It may only be 5 inches, but I've got 16 stone to push it in with"
Sshhh don't tell people thatTell them you haven't seen the sun in 7 years
It's the "constantly wet" part that turns me off. I don't care how the rain is coming down, just that everything is always wet.
28 Jan 2017. Earth is not a wasteland yet.
We'll pass that budget whenever Rauner finally keels over.
Totally! That one day in fall when the weather is perfect. 
aren't we worried about the warming trend? I thought global warming was not supposed to affect us this much this soon
January average high/low temp for Calgary is -1/-13, for Helena, MT it's 1/-10.  I'd say that's in the same neighborhood. 
Living in the bottom of arizona really fucking hurts all exposed skin during the summer. Think living in a giant convection oven.
Yeah, heh heh. They go somewhere warm and cozy, like a friends' house or something, right?
She should sit on it to warm it up
It is almost like the planet is getting warmer or something.  Just a theory though.
You know nothing, Jon Blow.
Marlin is a bar. There is a man who works above the bar selling the most BOMB hot dogs. Also, falafel guy is nearby too.
He can do every character, including John Redcorn and Kahn, except for Boomhauer. He can't even do it at half speed. For some reason that's the only character I actually can imitate (at maybe 75% speed). 
Knowing American TV, we'd get 60 minutes about it easily
"When will Then be Now?"
Yeah but your housing isn't afjordable.
Must have been at least 78 or 80. Crazy cold.
You say cold shower, but you really mean "Slightly warm", because it's so hot that the water in the pipes is like 90 degrees.
I think that' a big part of what I hate about cold weather. It always feels like a big event to go outside. Gotta put on a ton of clothes, and then take them back off again when you arrive. Leaving the house in warm/hot weather is a much more casual affair.
Or come to the Midlands of England instead. It's grey all year round and nothing really happens, weather or otherwise.

Holy shit!
Anywhere people are shitting behind curtains is a horrible place to live
At least the ones you found were dead :/
My sister lives in Seattle.  She keeps all her food scraps in an open bag in her kitchen to eventually empty out into her compost bin.  We grew up in Florida- if we tried that shit back home we'd be up to our eyeballs in ants, roaches, and other miscellaneous creepy crawlies.
OMG you're such a liar! We can all see through it.It rains for 15 minutes at 4pm!
That's strictly a Florida Man thing. It's too cold to truck jack here.
Wait, there are more Kansans than just me?
You must learn to harvest the life it has absorbed for you.
Darling, is that you? 
Secret's out about the PNW, sorry to say. It's too bad you have a huge housing affordability crisis that's making it impossible to live there for  basically everyone except tech bros. 
I don't like rain. It's wet and irritating and it gets everywhere. 
Let's go whale!
Yes, watch out for those four. They are much more dangerous than non-footed zombies.
10 Feb 2017. Getting there slowly. 
Here is Reddit silver 
Hey there.  North is Chicagoland, everything else is south ;-)

Literally touches kentucky.
Hey now!.. I seem to recall at least *three* in September!
/u/novaer is likely from Edmonton (or further north). -6/-15 here. Closeish, but still a big difference (especially since Montana can be at +2, while Edmonton is at -20).
The way that's worded sounds like you're laughing at their demise. 
Was about to write "username checks out" and then I realised it's not MuffedCanadian. 
Still, anecdotal evidence *for* global warming is just as bad as anecdotal evidence *against* it.There's enough science to support the theory of global warming that it would be better if people refrain from comments like this. It makes it harder to counter someone who doesn't believe in GW, when he comes with an anecdotal story of a really cold winter somewhere.
I get this. So Alaska is North of the Wall. And the Wildlings have some great powder.
I tell you what, man, that's dang ol' crazy man, he can only do one ol' character, man. Dang.
All those house hunter shows already exist.  Househunters: Inevitable Climate Change doesn't have quite the same ring to it though.

Many times people *have to* wear more clothes though. Not everybody works in an air conditioned office so protective clothing means you're too hot and that's that, not to mention you're probably doing physical labour so you'd be warmer without the extra gear anyways.A couple hours weilding a chainsaw in kevlar pants will wipe you out.
that sounds lovely
They're dog sized and they hunt in packs. 
Wisconsin baby!!!  Get drunk when it snows because there are no lanes to "deviate"
What sort of work is available in an area like this? I'm always envious of people living in the countryside, but I don't know what I could do for a living out there. 
Oh don't you worry. I've found plenty squirming around too. My personal favorite is the one that crawled over the tub wall while i was taking a shower and then just flailed around in the water around my feet.Also the one that hid inside a grocery bag i had on my floor. Stuck my hand in the bag to get the toothpaste i had bought and got a fistfull of bug. These things are satan. Graduation cannot come soon enough.That being said I hate florida for so many other reasons but these don't help certainly. Actually looking at washington as well for my escape
I know right? I thought i was the only one but they keep popping up.

Because the government took all your gold away
There are two types of people in the world. Those who laugh at the name Kankakee, and those who.. hahahaha, who the hell named a city that?
Actually, we try to keep a river between us and Kentucky for the Holy Spirit.
Or the one we just had like 2 days ago
Grew up in Edmonton Alberta and am now living in Saskatoon Saskatchewan for the past four years and the difference is staggering. Sure, it can hit -40 in Edmonton occasionally but it feels like EVERY winter in Saskatchewan it is -40 or worse every day with the wind chill. Seriously, there are like 3 or 4 trees in this province. I've tried to move back to Alberta but every time I step outside it's a near death experience. 
Well I'm pretty miffed about the missed opportunity now
I am also a Canadian, this guy knows how to keep the air from hurting your face. Facemuffs.

There are gloves made for use with touchscreens.

Basically nothing. The trick is to get a job in a city that lets you work remotely so you have that city salary and that country COL.

I WENT FOR A WALK IN SIXTY DEGREE CHICAGO WEATHER WITH SHORTS ON IN JANUARY! I THINK I LIKE GLOBAL WARMING!
Well that's an appropriate username.
We just missed it sir
Sorry.  You've got to be in the office every day at 8:30 for the scrum meeting.

Prepare to fast forward!
I once ate from a bag of mixed nuts for about ten minutes before noticing a live cockroach crawling around in there. It was all covered in salt and looked like a little almond with legs. Wasn't using a straw though.
Those are my favorite kind
Less sexy, more cutesy
I feel you. I had jaw surgery as well and my bottom lip and chin were numb, I got into the habit of wiping my mouth a lot when I ate because stuff would get on my chin and NO ONE would tell me. It took about 4-6 years for the full feeling to return to my chin.

I think you mean a crazy straw
sighs, i try not to use them because of that video. i hate it though when a waitress just tosses straws on the table. they wont take them back because they are dirty ( or the paper wrapper gets wet).so even if i dont use it, it still does not save a straw.i will use paper straws
It's definitely possible to be cutesy with a girl when drinking with straws though. Get two and sip from either side of the milkshake. Works best if you're a tough biker with slick black hair and a leather jacket but you're sweet when you're around your girl and she's the only one who can melt your stony exterior.
But after all, why sipp when you can succ?
Hmm, well if it's camels you're looking for, then there are four places. There's the Camel Hut, that's on third. There's camels are us, that's on third too. You got Put Your Butt On That Camel, that's on third. Swing Low, Sweet Camel... That ma... Matter of fact they're all on the same complex. It's the camel complex down on third.
You let a man tell you how to live your life. Sounds like *you're* the bitch.
Those exist?
It won't give you wrinkles as long as you also smile while sipping and you won't look crazy at all I promise 
same, i wasn't particularly pro or against straws before watching that film, but ever since when a straw comes in the drink i take it out. i just cant see a straw in my cup without thinking of ryan gosling saying "it looks like youre sucking on a tiny schwanz" and steve Carrell's lips just reaching out to locate the straw....I dont think it even made me particularly anti-straw, it just makes me CONSIDER the straw everytime im given a drink and after considering it I decide to go without
Well that's lame.  I'd instantly laugh then immediately ask if you were ok! I just don't get the "and that was the end of the date" outcomes in these kinds of situations. Like the person who you're on a date with has never tripped, cut themselves, etc.? People are weird. 
>  I still accidentally use them when drink stall owners just chuck a straw into my drink on reflex before I can stop them :(And then when I realized what I've done I quickly throw the straw in the ocean in disgust at myself and to get rid of the evidence.
Poor turtle.
If you say no homo 3 times, technically, it's not sucking
> make-up sex cokeI'm having a hard time piecing together this story. I honestly can't tell if you're talking about cocaine or coca-cola.
At that point I'd just kill myself
From a straw?
It's just a tiny little moth that can infiltrate pantries/kitchens and live off of dry food. They're a pain in the ass and a little bit gross because they can lay eggs in your food stuffs, but they're not all that bad as far as bugs go.
<Michael Scott voice> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
thinking of introducing a few pantry months to my rice for the extra gainz
Only the best for my children. 
I'm pretty sure its a straw with red and white stripes 
Kinda cornea, but funny all the same.

Is it very common to lose sensation after surgery? I'm a brass player who is going to need upper AND lower jaw surgery because of apparent growth issues. I'm super ready for a more pronounced jawline, not so much the loss of ability to play my instrument.
I would like to hope that I would tell you that you have made a mess of your food all over your beard. But like a bro. Not some douche canoe trying to get a laugh at your expense. Maybe we come up with a sign? 1 beard stroke means I'm thinking. 2 means there's something in your beard. 3 means there's an evil ninja creeping up behind the person to your left. Etc. 
jokes on you he was coming on to you, you just didn't notice him exaggerating his straw drinking after that point
I don't know how you can read that line and not start moving your mouth like Mr. Ed the Horse trying to get peanut butter from under his lip.    Edit for respect. 
Rule 2 is equally as important: Don't Be Unattractive.  
Not every country starts drinking as late as USA
They do make alcoholic root beers, but 99% of the time when you see root beer on the shelf in a store or on a restaurant menu, it's a non-alcoholic drink.
/u/minicipalchark comfirmed as OP's mum? /u/lordtuts finally brought justice? More on this at 10.
I like my way of describing it better =p
Description of the video says he likely ate it and then regurgitated it, but it went up a nasal passage directly connected to their mouths. Poor thing.    
Even so, the straw works in this scenario by cracking the badass mystique for effect. Such is the power of the straw.
The key is to always bring the straw up to your mouth. Never bring your face down to the straw.
How many layers of irony are you on?
I heard there's one where MaryAnne rides the camel with you..
Thank you for checking instead of just reposting.  You're the real MVP.
Don't be absurd. No one will ever need a house made entirely of brick. 
My thoughts exactly.
I'm not a part of your system!
Yes they do. They also make silicone and stainless steel ones, but at some point it's just hard to tell them apart from a piece of metal pipe.
They do exist - I've seen them at music festivals where vendors are required to provide compostable utensils and straws. I don't know how available they are to the public, though.
"As I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was devine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment I was a marine biologist!"
I like eating those with a spoon  (shakes and smoothies that is)
Turtles lives for decades, maybe even centuries, so 8 minutes of pain and a bit of blood is a small price to pay. It likely obstructed its breathing and ability to expel water and stuff out from its nostrils and its ability to do coke. 
Similar, but with slightly less shit
Coffee does stain teeth (they're also acidic) so it's a toss up. Or you can have a cup of water to sip from while sipping your coffee. I don't know a win-win situation here but this way you could come out super hydrated :)
I WASN'T looking, and i was trying to get to the lip of the cup so I could get some ice, but instead wound up with the straw WAAAY up my nose. it was super bad.
3meta5me
He actually typed that entire paragraph in one breathe. 
At that point I'd be in to deep, I'd just have to eat the cockroach to commit.
Cool man. Reminds me of the time I was delivering my baby with my wife. After cradling my newborn child for a couple minutes I noticed it was actually a giant live cockroach crawling around in my arms. It was all covered in blood and looked like a little baby with legs. Wasn't using a straw though. 
were you using a straw though?
I mean, it does sound delicious
He doesn't want to smear his lipstick

Man, iris we could just go one day without a chain of puns.

Sweet bro. Reminds me of the time I was saving a family from a fire. It wasn't until a couple of minutes of saving that I realized I saved a giant cockroach instead of any human. It was covered with smoke and looked like little father legs. Wasn't using a straw though. 
No, but I started afterwards. With a straw you're out of danger of sipping a cockroach. A cockroach leg maybe.
I'd say that cockroaches are repulsive enough even without tomato juice.
POW!  Right in the kisser! 
Have to clean up the larvae.  They like tight spaces.  We found them in drawers, in the breadbox, in the crevice between wall and ceiling, in screw holes, etc.  It's disgusting, because our vacuum isn't strong enough to suck up the sticky cocoons, so you may have to pull them off with a toothpick and then suck it off with the vacuum.......
Ah so somewhat like silverfish. 
Yeah it's a clear straw but with a white then red stripe repeating until you can't see anything but white and red.  The white to red males it have a pretty classic feel with the clear bit being modern
I see what you did there 
You stroke his beard with your own.
RIP lil Sebastian
Excuse me sir, I am a professional *meme historian*. 
I don't know, I think OP's got that on lock.>So, uh, you...you like...waitressing?Gold. 
> had me all like *diggity dizam*I think it would be rad if you actually said that in real life.
Wait who is lordtuts?  I'd that the redditor reddit made famous? 
Same. I guess I used my final straw yesterday when I was drinking a mojito. Maybe I'll go buy a glass one with a filtered end.
After reading these suggestions, I think I will just revert to using a sippy-cup.
>I don't remember if we ever got anyYeah fucking right
I mean specifically the girls who asked for straws. Only thing I can think of is some connection with blowjobs, but I'm not making it.
Succ 
Talk less?
You have to have the gear right.  A backpack with a machete and hatchet strapped to the sides looks badass.  A hiking pack properly weighted and strapped doesn't move and you can miles and miles a day with it.Sadly laptop bags never look cool(unlike bowties or Stetsons) you have to hold them down and run for the subway in your geeky outfit.  WHY CANT WE BRING BACK BRIEFCASES!?

cockroach washed down with a refreshing torrent of his own piss
Rad homie. Reminds me of the time I was in middle school taking a math test. It wasn't until a couple minutes of test taking that I realized my teacher, classmates, parents, siblings, and myself were all cockroaches and that I wasn't taking a test and that I didn't know what a test was. I was covered in urine and so was everyone else and we were in a bathroom in Soho. Wasn't using a straw though.
Thank you :) all done with an ink well and straight pen. Hand cramps for days.
And my axe!
I mean, they got a kick out of it. But they did shit all to help. Took me a year and a half but finally got rid of the moths.I moved.
You pupil disgust me.

Well. Too bad, fucker. 
*shyly raises hand*
Yeah but unless you stay on top of maintenance of said sippy cup it accumulates all sorts of bacteria and mold. And just dishwashing it doesn't work. You have to full on scrub that sucker (pun?) out. 
Oh they WOULD remember... if they had ever actually gotten any.  ;)
It's really difficult to suck a frosty through a straw.  Ergo, if they ask for straws, they can suck really, really, really hard.

That's not my dad! That's a cellphone!
Sick, friendo. Reminds me of the time I was elected President. It wasn't until election night that I realized my opponent and her entire team were just giant cockroaches and that my entire campaign was a joke. It was all dressed up and talking and just looked like a Secretary of State with legs. Wasn't using a straw though.
Probably more effort than the actual eradication of the moths?
And my vuvuzela!
Gods damnit... I was really hoping for the secret to defeating the mothy menace, but alas... It appears the only answer is to cede my territories to them to start anew.
You have an eye for clever puns. 
I actually liked that song so much I put it on my phone to listen to in the car
aw
I tried using a straw for hot tea.  Seared pomegranate with honey strip from my tongue and the roof of my mouth.  And then I did it again, after the healing, but before the remembering. You, sir or madam, are a badass. 
So the best course of action is to waterbend your drink to save the environment
You want to get ahead?
Aww fuck. I'm so sorry. 
I dont know what a hump feels like :(
Am anthro wolf, nobody knew until nowl.
Righty hoe. Reminds me of that one time i was praying at my shul. It wasn't until a couple minutes of scheming that i realized my rabbi, parents, myself, and the rest of my congregation were cockroaches and we werent praying but feasting on the feces of some liberal arts major who had relieved xirself into and all over the coffee machine at starbucks. I was covered in some liquid the humans called "iced frappuccino" and so was everyone else but we didnt really much care because we were cockroaches. Wasnt using a straw though.
Well, this was more time/effort than the Battle of the Baking Cupboard (the first one), but much less than the overall war. Eggs can remain viable for up to 300 days. Months after I thought it was all over they'd be back.

You'll have to do, we greet you warmly.
Many people are blind to the focus required to discover a good pun. Others can spot them on sight.
and you can be a lawyer as well. I tried to become one but I failed my bar exams horrendously and now I'm a washed up reddit paralegal drinking and smoking my days away asking myself where did I go wrong, what do I need to do and how will I ever find who killed my wife and daughter with string beans as a garote. 
The answer is to slurp it. Don't seal your lips around the straw, so you get more air than drink. Then as it cools or you build a tolerance, adjust to reduce the air, until you are eventually just drinking normally.
I got one of those Contigo travel thermos' and I've wondered if I'm cleaning the buildup from coffee and tea properly.  Just bringing it up because it's pretty much an adult sippy-cup.

It wasn't until I was taking the first bite of a snag sanga that I cottoned onto the fact that Steve turned into a fucken New South Welshman, and the woolies snags were actually just minced up blues fans. Wasn't using a straw though.

Magnificent, mate. Reminds me of the time I was riding with my mate down under. I saw my dog being held up in a headlock by a giant cockroach. I got out of my car and punched the cockroach straight in the jaw. It was all buff and looked like a kangaroo. Wasnt using a straw though.
At least he'd be honest.

^this is how lifelong fans are made. 
Tomorrow night the Cubs will win the World Series again
Enjoy that shit, this kind of thing will never happen again, you're in the middle of history
I like having the shortest championship drought in all of professional sports tbh
As a Chicago Cubs since 1907, I am okay
As a mariners fan, I'm still waiting lol
The Warriors send their regards.
A glorious example of free speech in action.
Oh fuck off with that shit. They have not won in 108 years, everyone is a cubs fan today

Back to the Future was so close!!
One meme dies, another begins. 
How many Cubs fans are going to die happy to have seen the Cubs win the World Series any ways?
!RemindMe 108 years
Its Eeeeeeverywhere
Thanks, Obama. 
Isn't a baseball game always down to the last batter...?
Ah we're past three. Leo won an Oscar remember? And all of those celebrity deaths.
You should ask on /r/askreddit.
Kyle, Jon, Ben, but please not Arolodis.
What's another 5 minutes to the celebration! 
Someone joked about that at the bar last night. "If the Cubs win, the death rate in Chicago will shoot up because of all the people waiting for the Cubs to win the World Series to die."Admittedly, it was the bearded guy who stands at busy intersections with a "U.S. is not free" sign and spouts conspiracy stuff, but it was still funny.
Poor guy saw every angle of the loss. 
If I recall correctly, he sets off the fireworks for Cleveland, and set one off for a Kansas City home run by accident.
Now *that's* celebrating!
Hahahaha. I'm so glad. I want a parade!!! A 3-day parade. 
That's because there was going to be a tornado. A tornado of drunken fans going crazy.
Half of Chicago might be destroyed tonight with the celebratory rioting. This is bigger than anyone who is not a baseball fan can understand. 108 years since the Cubbies won a WS. Huge thing.
And then it'll turn out that the cut on Leo DiCaprio's hand in *Django Unchained* was fake all along.
Last time the Cubs won the World Series, Barack Obama was President.
Is this the part where the empire strikes back?
Actually the last time the cubs won the world series Ireland was part of the United Kingdom.

Dude, for these old timers, these long, long, LONG suffering fans, this is the promised land.  See the Cubs win a World Series?  Any Cubs fan who's been around for a long while could probably go pretty damned peacefully after that.
I am sure she will understand. But plot twist, Becky also said that to 65 other guys so you may have a line to wait in...
Not quite. You tried though :)
I've been a football fan for a long time (go broncos!!). My Columbian friends made me a soccer fan after a very sad loss to Brazil in the world cup (with a happy ending). Tonight I have become a baseball fan. Living in Colorado makes it hard because our team is not the best, but if the Cubs can do it we can too. Here's to next year and watching more baseball. Thank you Cubs, for making me a fan. 
seriously, go enjoy this!
I had no money riding on it and I almost had a heart attack.
Only 
It won't last. Even if you narrow it down to American sports I guarantee you 100% odds that you'll lose the shortest drought title in the super bowl.
109 years old? Must be voting democrat. But politics aside HOW ABOUT THEM CUBBIES!!!
Fellow Mariners fan here. *sadface*
Even as a lifelong Cubs fan, I was rooting for the Sox so hard in 2004. I was in seventh grade. I remember staying up way too late too, those extra innings games where you guys rallied against the Yankees. Ortiz with those clutch home runs. Curt Schilling and his bloody ankle. All of it was beautiful. 
Has to. There was at least one Cubs fan and one Indians fan that got 2016 tattoos. They couldn't both fail.
*it's a nice day for a,**RED WEDDING!*
Exactly man, I've been a Cubs fan my whole life (20 years). but 20 years isn't shit to the generations before us, they were the real fans. This win tonight was more than a win for us true lifelong Cub fans. This was a win for the lifelong Cub fans who went their whole life without that, but just wishing for that World Srries win. That was monumental, that was for our ancestors. 
As an Indians fan, this is true. If anyone knows what it's like to come back from 3-1 to get the city's first championship in a lifetime, it's Cleveland fans. Enjoy it. It's a great feeling!
Were ALL Cubs fans on this blessed day :)
it's the end of the world as we know it
The election.Fuck.
Damn.   That grabs me right in the pussy
Seriously if I were OP I would start shopping that shit. 
Hopefully somehow he knows.
The circle of life.
And Cleveland is involved in both
Also retired.

Yea no Chapmans since he's most likely going back to NY
Mr. Stamina over here....
That video is actually from a couple years ago. IIRC that guy controlled the fireworks for the Indians and accidentally fired them off when the opposing team hit a home run.
Haha that's great. Thank you!
And that jet fuel *can* melt steel beams afterall
Thanks Obama!
We better keep an eye on Turkey, they might build a Death Star in secret. 
Why? My country left the EU. David Bowie died. Donald Trump has a serious chance of being POTUS.At least Tottenham didn't win the league. 
Also, Biff ran a SUCCESSFUL casino. So theres some pretty big differences.
Will they be able to draft a QB by then?
As soon as they won I hopped on the red line straight to Wrigley lol
HEY CHICAGO WHATTYA SAY
I'm in London and NYC right now and things are pretty crazy 
The almanac doesn't go to 2016 though.
1993
Yeah, I'm pretty sure this means Trump is going to win the presidency and North Korea is going to discover internet porn. 
To be fair, every set of predictions over the last 50 years included the Cubs winning the World Series. It's been a running joke forever. 
Breaking a 108 year curse? No, it was something nobody ever could dream of. 
Brown's fans be like: Theo what do you know about football?
"McFly's a hero because he's a butthead. I like people who aren't buttheads, okay?"
Seriously. Save for a few STL transplants there is nothing but love for the Cubs right now from KC. Congrats Cubs!!! ( Having Zobrist helps ;) )
Been wearing my gramps old Wrigley Field hat all series. Sorry for your loss.
I haven't been a baseball fan since I was 12 and I was on the edge of my seat the whole game. Talk about a cosmos induced escalation of drama. My sis sent a post she found "I'm stressed out about the election, so I'll just go watch some light hearted baseball OH DEAR GOD..."Neil Degrasse Tyson was tweeting out facts of things that had happened since the last time the Cubs won. Def one for the history books.
2.5 hrs out of Chicago,  and still fireworks 30 min after the game.  Crazy
When the Detroit Lions win the superbowl.
NEEEEXXXXXTTTTT!!!!!!
The cubs win on a logarithmic timescale. A century between the first two years, then a millennium, then ten thousand years... etc
> ColumbianWhy does this keep happening to us? 
As a Chicagoan I had 100 on the cubs losing, barely watched it, heart skipped several beats several times. Money aside my mom (lifelong cubs fan) was hyperventilating and cursing the whole time, broke down in tears for a good 15 mins when they won.
That's really not that much considering how much he risked...
OFFICIAL SELECTION FOR MEME OF THE YEAR NOMINEE:#BLEW A 3-1 LEAD
I mean when you're talking about putting your life savings on the Cubs winning the World Series... 
At least we got the Sounders and Seahawks, and the Huskies and Cougs, I guess
My dad got to go to game 7 against the Yankees. That was awesome as a kid to know he was there. Now that I'm older it actually seems more amazing.
And I feel coarse.
The election happens, and then days after (calling it - 11/14), Gabe announces Half Life 3 to soothe us. 
Sounds like a book and movie adaptation waiting to happen.Hey OP, include this comment in the movie please.
Technically next year.
Hey man, you gotta take care off your cubs uniform. That takes minutes! Can't just plonk it onto the ground. It's history!
Oh that is just *ripe*.
And that 7/11 is indeed a part time job!
Death, taxes, Arsenal finishing above Tottenham... some things never change 
Robo-Goodell walks up to the podium "and with the 1st overall pick of the 2080 season, the Cleveland Browns select... Robert Griffin the Sixth"
THE CUBBIES FUCKIN' WON TODAY
That one doesn't, but nothing prevents him from using the second time machine that doc builds to go and get one from 2045. The original is destroyed in the last movie, but the series ends with the unexpected arrival of a new one.
1993 + 23 = 201623 -\> Michael Jordan -\> Chicago Bulls -\> CubsHonestly doubt that's a coincidence
23 is also Cubs Hall of Famer Ryne Sandberg's number. 
Pretty sure North Korea finding internet porn would probably be a good thing. Maybe finally jerk that one out and calm the fuck down.
He was so fucking happy
That was the best ballgame I'm ever gonna be fortunate enough to witness, and some of the best commentary to go along with it.
if you watch the last play Rizzo puts it in his back pocket the moment he gets the out.
Not even the Cubs 
"I want all the illegal Mexicans to make like a tree, and get outta here."
Great Scott!
Hey its me ur husband
That is why clocks are round
Always involving a team from Cleveland, one way or the other.
It was a Cleveland fan. Hedging his bets.
Those huskies look pretty good this year too.
I.. I'll take that deal.
As a film student, this is without a doubt going on my list of potential films to make. 
And that the Moon Landing was baked at 375!
Last year was fucking precious.Tottenham for most of the end of the season ahead of Arsenal, and Arsenal gets....second
Third in a two horse race, etc. 
Breaking news! RG VI has torn his ACL while climbing the stairs to greet his new comrades.
1908+108=2016108, the height of the Sears Tower, also the street Cubs HQ is on.
He won the World Fucking Series!
I actually heard Trump in my head saying that.
This is heavy...
> ~~Lmao~~ Urghhh Urghhh Urghhh Urghhhhhhhh!FTFY
Cl3ve1and 
\#4 by AP and #5 by the committee! Win out and we're in for sure. Suck it TAMU
And that Unidan did nothing wrong!
Or as my brother likes to put it, Tottenham came in third in a two horse race.
For crying out loud every sub is mocking us now. Nowhere is safe.
He'll be out for three or four snaps while they 3D print him a new knee. 
Jesus Christ, the sportsball is coming from inside the house
Weight has nothing to do with it! 
was this the guy that was using multiple accounts to up vote himself? am I remembering correctly?
Holy shit... I just had Google verify this for me, and as a slightly superstitious person who cares nothing for sports, this is pretty fucking cool. 
Not only to upvote himself, but to downvote people he disagreed with. Was once a beloved Reddit celebrity who always chimed in with cheerful and enthusiastic biology facts. I always read his comments in Claptrap's voice.
He's still around.  /u/unidanx
How the hell was he caught?
Poor girl was probably holding them in all night and you happened to get up when sleep took over and she lost the fight against her body.BEEN THERE lol 
If your name is Doug, I have to say you hid this one poorly. 
Thats adorable 
This one is by far the worst
Wow what a fucking idiot. Like, why send a pic with him in the room goddamn 
He planned to propose for a year and a half before he did it?  Why?  Did he just get a good deal on a ring and buy it just in case?
That's fucked up 
I had a friend who did this to all of her friends and her boyfriend... We figured it out but she never knew. 
She's not smart enough to move it back? Amateur.
>me in 21 years.
Hello jmag333's wife/girlfriend!
Wouldn't work with me; I throw my pillow off the bed in my sleep, I'm instantly awake grabbing for it. 
This is kind of a blessingJust let her walk away, don't escalate the convo into an argument (be fair and nonchalant)Then immediately go to work on yourself: become a better person in different ways, and do exactly what you want to doYour life doesn't need to depend on those that don't see value in you
Yeah that's what my ex did. She cheated and I gave her the option to work it out or she can leave. She asked for a week to clear her head at her sisters. Fine, except she forgot to delete the copy of her plane ticket where the guy lives. Yeah, nah, I'm not an option.
He's having sex with the Bruins.
As the opposite half of that equation. I fell back in love with my wife. Fairly recently actually. We have been together 15 years now. Rough spot about 5 years ago. Separated for a year. Got back together. Honestly, in the last year, it's really going well. I am back in love again. Just letting you know, there is hope. Couples therapy helped. But we both had to do slot on our own. And the biggest piece for me was that I needed to see she was truly making an effort. 
She had sex with Lumbergh? 
Is that a more acceptable reason?
Five of us in a skype call playing LOL together. One of my buddies just starts reading off some recent comments from my reddit account all nonchalantly. Will never forget that immense feeling of panic. Now when i post things i have to make sure id be ok with my buddies ragging on me for it haha. 
Sounds exactly like my ex. In addition to all the excuses you listed, I also got "it's mouthwash I used in the car after work" quite often.  He came stumbling home drunk a couple times and once with a severe head injury and I had to drive him to the emergency room.  When I left him, he told his family, my family, and all my friends I cheated on him so he was filling for divorce. Most of them still believe it and this happened almost 7 years ago.
Nine years? Wow. Better late than never, bud.
I came home from 3 months abroad having left my boyfriend to care for my pets. According to my African Grey parrot there was someone by the name Linda that did "something" very good. She also kept calling people "Fucking Shmuck " and demanding that they get her a beer. She had also master the sound of a gurgling bong and followed it with loud coughing sounds and the occasional "BOOYAH!" Sounded like he had a lot of fun.
Hey I do that too! And I did the exact same thing, telling a girlfriend I loved her while almost asleep. I didn't realize it until the next day when she brought it up in front of her friends. I said I was drunk and didn't mean it. That relationship ended two weeks later. 
Maybe they hate sports.
xoxo
Aw that's adorable :) I'm happy for you dawg.     
are u sure ur not her?
I'd start with breaking up with her. Then go buy yourself a steak. 
Counter-espionage. Nice
My gf hates when I oversleep on a regular basis, so she plays with my cock when I'm supposed to wake up.Jokes on her, I still oversleep every time.
My ex told me before we married that he was disqualified from driving after drink driving. He had to retake his test. I later discovered that this wasn't true at all - he'd never even had lessons before, let alone passed his test and then been disqualified. He was such an arse that he preferred me thinking he'd got done for drunk driving, than knowing the truth - that he'd never learnt to drive. Idiot. 
Just plan a suprise welcome home party.
If this is real you've got a keeper!
She might still be telling the truth. I don't want kids and I can't have them anyway.
She's holding for a friend 
Going through this right now and I can't find it in me to forgive his friends for the way they treated me. I see you're speaking in past tense, may I ask what happened?
Do you know for a fact the kid is yours?
I do this to my wife,  if she wakes up she punches me(for waking her up not feeling her up) maybe if she went topless it would help. 
hey its me ur so
I went through hundreds of comments here and THIS is the one that made my jaw drop open. You are living a bad adult romance novel, my friend. 
Unforgivable.
He sounds fantastic. Can I borrow him for a hot sec?
They probably interpreted it as asking, "What is the worst-kept secret your so is hiding from you?"
Lol
Are you a county song? 
Maybe he kept a few. How would you know?
If you don't break it off now, you'll get complacent and end up marrying her. You'll be married for the most miserable 10 years and she'll get alimony and child support.
Aha that's so cute, I'm-Wait what.
I apparently did something like this. I don't really like cuddling when I'm awake. It's hot and breathing through her hair / my face right next to her neck is uncomfortable. But apprently I used to really cling to her when I was asleep. Weird.
Out of curiosity, why are you getting him something so thoughtful when it seems he's looking for the first opportunity for greener pasture?Obviously a relationship is much more complex than a few words, but yeah.
How dare he
Awww... shit.
I don't know why, but this idea reminded me of another post where some dude kept very slightly refilling a ketchup bottle making his gf think they had a magic infinite ketchup bottle.
Some people get off on the manipulation. Makes them feel powerful and special in a sick way.
I will be with her, no matter what happens :) Thanks!
The old pretend you never saw it deal. It's a lot better than dealing with people's emotions. 
Knew she had found it and had to wait longer so she would actually be surprised. 
Yes, very confusing year an a half for me. Wondering is it gonna happen now, then disappointment when it didn't. And pure elation when he finally did.
keep us updated pls. 
You heard it. Divorce her. Delete facebook.
It's been three years. You can't be married to somebody more than half your life and not be profoundly impacted when they're gone.
It's not fair, is it? I always feel like we were both oak trees that grew next to each other; our roots tangled with one another. When she died, I felt like my roots were twisted and turned in many directions where her roots used to be, but now there is nothing.I hope you're doing okay.
The window opens in-wards not out-wards, the router on the shelf blocks the window from opening so she has to move it to the side to open the window.
We're really happy, fwiw 
You're talking to an oak tree rn. I don't move an inch until I'm up for the bathroom 
That won't help, she put a gps tracker on him. No matter where he goes, she'll find him.
he's an international superspy dating his handler. 
Now we play the waiting game
He will be.
She's investing for the long term.
THE FACELESS MASSES OF REDDIT NOD THEIR SUPPORT
Fuck yes. Going through this right now. Bye bitch. 
Clear her head huh wow 
It's not gay though if it's on ice skates. 
Me and my S.O. hit a rough patch...and then it was followed by an awful event and the a minor one....but sometimes things need to be shaken up when you've settled too much. We're peaches n cream now. And the only way to do that was through communication...Of course I tried the r/relationships route and got the "break up with him asap/ you're just lying to yourself" routine...But I look to my parents and have seen their ups and downs and they're in love still and overcome everything they argue about. They're best friends....and that's how I see me and my S.O.
Same here. Two years,  wasted. Now I have to work 65+ hours a week, and that sucks. I may be tired but at least I'm infinitely happier.  
Seriously just run man! 
Not *that* Lumbergh.
This whole inconvenience is why I hunted down and slayed all my girlfriends evil exes. 
All my friends know my account after I made a post in the league subreddit that did well. I'm willing to bet anything that they they are too lazy to stalk me. Just in case, fuck you Eddie.
she says she threw it in the dumpster, but I just use spoons now just in case
we broke up and i was married to my amazing, genius, beautiful wife within like 18 months.  she pretty much waited for me to get this other bullshit out of my system and then moved in to set things on the right course.  now we have two kids and my life could not be any better.  
This is hilarious but I am so sorry that happened.
Woops- good or bad thing?
As a guy that hates whatever my GF watches, Gilmore Girls is amazing.
Let's not jump to conclusions, maybe he just likes Blake Lively's legs.
She's amazing. 
Omg I didn't think of that. It's possible. 
Here is a pair of pants on us dawg.
Yup, definitely. Giving is fun, but it's even better if you can see the result of the appreciation. 
5d chess. He gave her a check, then after a few months they mated
Then go get tested...for STD's. Sorry this happened to you.
I'm very glad that autism is better understood these days. So many more tools for managing it than in past decades.My toddler is showing some red flags of autism, and we've had some speech and behavior specialists coming by to evaluate / work with him, as well as teach us how to better work with him. In just 2 months, he's started speaking (as opposed to grunting/crying), his tantrums are shorter and less frequent, and he's far better with eye contact. His improvement is just staggering.
More like counter sex-pionage
Wouldn't it be current wife?
That's like giving the dog a hamburger for shitting on the carpet.
Thanks for the BJ clarification.
Omg that's such a good idea! But.... After a year apart, I really want to spend the first day just with her haha 
Her best friend : I bet you can't wait until the 21rst!! Me : why the 21st? Her : Uh..... Shit oh right! Yeah sorry the 26th haha So.... I got suspicious, because she loves surprising me. I decided to invent that after my finals I wanted to maybe go to Amsterdam or some other place  (from the 21st to 25th) with some friends to see her reactions, it was hilarious to see her trying to find excuses and reasons for me not to go. And her parents seem to be avoiding talking about the day she comes back. There's a bunch of other little clues but that's just because I know her do well haha 
Yeah this is heart-wrenching.If there's one thing I could change about this world, I wouldn't allow bad things to happen to good people.
100% should be a bumper sticker if it isn't already
He picked and chose what Catholic rules to follow. He wasn't going to masturbate but beating his SO was cool.
We had been together 5 or 6 years at that point, so a while.
Sounds like it was a reality check she needed.  I think people that make those accusations have just never been called out for bring the utter assholes that they are - more people need to be aware of their behaviour.
Same. My chance of a successful pregnancy (I'm told) is in the single digits, roughly 2-5%. People always presume I lament losing the option for option's sake, but I don't; I'm thrilled over it. Your SO might be the same, OP. 
Ok I know this is a trope, but having actually done that, sometimes people do keep stuff for friends.
Scotty, my man, wassup?
> Is this also a man-child that doesn't pay rent Yes. lololHe hated going to bars when we were together, but I've broken contact since we broke up, so maybe that's his new thing. 
I think she meant "twerking and shit" as in twerking and "doing other stuff too long to put in the post"
I legitimately lol'd
This is the most baffling part of the post. He thought she'd just wake up with jizz on her and not think twice about it?
It's not just you.
My ex and I dated on and off. When we were off, he would ruthlessly bash me to his friends. I didn't know this. So when we got back together and I actually spent time with them, they were awful to me. Did everything they could to make sure I was uncomfortable. Later when some of them warmed up to me and realized I'm not an awful person, they kind of let it slip that the SO was who made them think that way in the first place. We broke up. Turns out it was him and not them.
Yea, get this checked asap
I know what you did that one time in particular that you don't want me to know but I totally do so.... just come clean.
Or get married.
r/theydidthemath
if she gets even a wiff of what's up her BC will magically fail and OP will be father to her fallback meal ticket. 
I can't wait to see the look of 'oh my god I'll actually have to start going to university to be able to support myself' face. 
I wish he were as certain as I am
That's pretty much what he said, too. He gets anxiety attacks and breathing my air (like when someone is face to face and super close) or having my hair in his face made him feel like he couldn't breathe. 
Found out too late. Painting takes time, and I can't back out now. I might just keep it and turn it into a dartboard. I am many things, but wasteful isn't one of them.
My dog gets twice the pets, he's ecstatic. 
Now I'm in love with both of you 
Or their shame and shit 
Of course. I am so sorry this happened to you. I could only imagine what you've gone through. You are a very strong person to share this with us, and I have nothing but respect for you.
So she smokes inside the house? Wouldn't you be able to smell it anyway?
Same.  I wake up the way I fell asleep;  on my back with my arms by my side's.  My SO thinks I'm a vampire.
Just open up the gas cap, get the model number of the tracker, make a deal with an electronics guy to buy a similar one off the books. Then when you get home, replace her tracker with your tracker, open up her tracker inside your house and attach a radio to the battery so that it slowly drains energy rather than suddenly die outright to avoid suspicion.Now, she has to go get the tracker and replace it. So you stake out at your window with a good view of your car, but darken the room so she doesn't see you. And remember to have a bowl of pistachios handy.
I should re-watch Chuck. That was a pretty fun show 
The long con
*touches penis to gravestone*
Her old man sex fantasy will slowly come true over the decades to come. It's so romantic.
I actually have a face.
It's sorta cute...then again, imagine your mom going to the strip club and getting dongers slammed in her face.
What better way to clear your head than having your brains fucked out?
Move to a different town man!
The one from intertrode
That's only legal in Toronto though.  And make sure they explode into coins, so there isn't evidence of the murder.
This is why you need to keep a tighter cutlery inventory.
That's why a plunger is my go-to house warming gift.
I'm happy for you! Great that everything worked out! Props! 
Scared the shit out of me one night. But we got a good laugh out of it the next day.
I think a lot of guys like Gilmore Girls. 
LA face and Oakland booty 
I feel the same about my future mother in law. We're less than a month away from our wedding and I'm stoked about my new in-laws!Congrats! When is the wedding? 
Don't even trip.
Like a squirting orgasm while she's sitting on your face
Mail her the bill for the test. 
hey, host it by yourself! have her open the door to you holding a balloon and wearing a party hat with a cake or some other self made gift!
Her friend: She's totally coming home on the 21st! You: It was right about then I began to suspect... 
For real... Holy fuck I'm depressed, poor couple 
This is also true of guitars.
Funny to sad in 6.5 seconds:(
Scotty doesn't know
I thought he was your current boyfriend and you were being a dick. But as an ex, let the panty stories reign. 
It was only the once and it was just so good
I'm certain I have a nice username too. 
Sounds familiar :) Being the little spoon was better, but by far my favourite was our backs against each other. Easy breathing, feeling her warmth without being sweaty, and feeling really safe, with no-one able to sneak onto us from my behind. Expect for the fact that we were asleep, of course.
Swap out the family members with the women he's seeing.Take all your stuff. Leave the painting hung above the bed.Halas.
Your dog is the real winner.
Me too, thanks. 
And the deodorant cans... so much deodorant 
As a teenager I used to sneak out to smoke a joint: sometimes I'd crawl out the Attic window and sit on the roof (at night after everyone was asleep), during the day id slip outside and take a short walk to a nearbye  river and sit on the bank to light up. One time a cop drive past, stopped (while I frantically put out my joint while also trying to act like I wasn't) and then started to chat me up, not sure if he saw me smoking a joint or if he was just flirting with me. Eventually he wished me a good day and left but my heart was pounding the whole time. 
I'd rather not.
You thought it was Bill? Their kids would have hooves!
He didn't say anything about insertion, perhaps they are just ramming them together.
It's why you have a guest cutlery set, and a secret personal set.
Thank god I'm not the only one. It's my wedding gift for young couples as well.Although I do get odd looks when I ask the hardware store to gift wrap it.
Why is she so closely associated with this phrase?
Awwwww.. biiiitchhh
That is when I am at my happiest. Nothing in life can top that.
And the steak.
>a sleep groperOne never stops learning new things
**And so I decided to investigate**
Well there was a sale and they had a deal and i didnt spend that much and this one was perfect because of the way it is. Just look at it!
If it helps, I'm doing just fine now. :)
So don't tell scotty
I found him!
He does that, too. He'll scoot over when I go to bed so we are touching butts. He'll face the door and I face the window. But I've woken up with his head resting on top of mine and his legs around me more than once. Edited for autocorrect fail. 
I fucking woke my wife up laughing. Jesus I'm crying. "No, it's over now, I can't finish like this" <- I will be laughing and trying to remember where I heard this for the rest of my life. 
I'm convinced that the "teenager who uses too much Axe" stereotype are at least 75% kids trying to hide the smell of tobacco or weed. 
C'moooon... think about it.
Wait, other people actually do this? Am I being had?
I give two books, The Joy of Sex and The Joy of Cooking but I'm adding a plunger into the gift basket after reading this.
I think she posted something on Instagram quoting Baby Got Back and people got pissed about it for some reason.
(Create a colorless Clue artifact token with "(2), Sacrifice this artifact: Draw a card.")
That does help. Good for you!
Oh Scotty doesn't know-oh 
Now kith!!!
Y'all dating each other 
Every fork you've had in your mouth has been a poo scoop
She says she's going shopping, but shes beneath me and I'm not stopping
I was beginning to wonder if my ex hand come to Reddit... :D
Whelp. Fuck me, then.
>my ex handDid you lose it in a lightsaber battle?
If you insist...
I'm with you bacon, I too was diagnosed with aspergers syndrome, well, at age 10. I know exactly where you're coming from. What I've sorta picked up on is that you have to have your own "script" to conquer social encounters. Like somebody asks what's up and I say, Man I'm rockin n rollin! Get brave, accept the fact that you'll fuck up. It's okay to get teased a little as long as you draw a line somewhere. I didn't accomplish my social awkwardness till late in highschool, but it doesn't end. Thing is, you end up being so proud of yourself that you forget your problem being a "problem". 
A friend of mine explained it to me like "Imagine you're meeting someone new and right out of the gate they dump "I got molested as a child so that's kind of like a duck in cold weather."You'd have a fearful mix of "holy shit wtf do I say now?" but also "wait, what do they actually *mean* by that?". And you get that feeling for almost every conversation, with everyone, forever.I'm not jealous.
The therapist who diagnosed me once told me this story about how one of her patients basically thought "Why is everyone so fucking weird?" for about 17 years before he got diagnosed, because he genuinely didn't realize that _he_ might be the odd one. That's me, as well.
I actually think that we have too much empathy. I often times get visibly upset when I feel I hurt someone. 
This really.I personally have some ADHD thrown into the mix, so the concentrating really well part is out of the window for me. Unless it's something I'm interested in doing. Like theres a,certain threshold of interest that needs to be present to start high concentration mode.
My step daughters go to the climbing gym with a boy with autism. And last summer all the parents of his assotiation went to a mountain refuge. The mother told me that it was great because all of them were parents or children with autism, so nobody look at them weird when the kids had a meltdown or escape, they didn't have to excuse themselves or apologize for their children. It was incredibly relaxing for them
When ever ppl ask me how i am i still want to say somewhere in the middle between great and terrible. They want you to say great
The thought did cross my mind when I read it. 
> And you get that feeling for almost every conversation, with everyone, forever.Thankfully it does get easier by sheer rote learning. Luckily its possible to blag past a lot of this by memorising how common situations work even if one doesn't know why.
The Internet has been one of the best things ever for autistic people. It is so much easier to communicate through text devoid of all the body language and vocal tones... 
I think computer scripts is a much better analogy. Actually both of them together, but it's a lot of reminding yourself "if this then that"
I don't necessarily break down, but it might take me a bit longer than normal to go to sleep.
I was diagnosed about 15 years ago I think as a young child. I did get some help in primary school so up to 11 but after that  virtually nothing. I have been getting help for Anxiety and at the moment I want to get that well and truly sorted as I know how dangerous that can getThanks for the advice, you're too kind!
I should probably see a therapist, then. I recognise myself in more than a few of the answers given in this thread. This one in particular triggered a few slighlty uncomfortable emotions.
I have huge trouble telling someone they've made a mistake. I've let people go calling me by the wrong name, or I change the subject in conversation, because the idea of making someone feel bad for making an error is intolerable. That one's a bugger to get around. It was worse as a teenager, I was once frozen to the spot for 3 minutes outside a teacher's door because knocking would interrupt them. Never mind that I had to see them and that they were expecting it, it might slightly inconvenience them and it would be my fault. I'm glad that stage is mostly over with.
I have a cat, she is my friend too. She is very friendly. I was afraid of contact too but I was able to gain a volunteer to take me to library and through that I have become a bit more able with contact. If there is an organisation with you nearby, they may have a volunteer program it may help. Things are much better now I am older than when I was younger. Maybe you can try once again one day soon? :) Happy thinking to you. Best smiles.
Thank you kindly for your nice words :) I like to help people and if this can help then I help. Its very different from my usual lego reddit postings :)
I walk in circles a lot too. My flapping is only when I am really happy and excited. Hehe when I got gilded in this I got excited and my arms went everywhere and I giggles. I guess happy feelings make that happen. And excited.
I wish so much with all my heart they made a playground big enough for me to play in also. Some things like the slides and climbing and ropes I can do, but then there are small tubes to crawl through that I can't fit and my 8 year old friends wishes I did. So yes I wish there were spaces for all different kinds of needs and wants! Especially sensory and play spaces.
This is a nice comment, thank you kindly!
:) I am very bad at messaging people first, they often have to message me. I love messages. Thank you kindly for your kind words.
28.
Sorry I do not understand this comment :) Can you explain.
I hope this is a good thing. I am unsure by your post.
:) Tell him he is awesome sometimes that helps.
I do this too, but I learned its okay to say. Can I talk about something else now? And that has helped a lot. I hope you are doing very good and lots of happy things are your way. I think you are brave.
I am unsure of the term emotional Levels, can you explain what you mean so I can better answer the question.
People should just stop (ignoring the problem of) bullying alltogether. I don't want to tell all the people I meet "please be extra kind to me because..." (= code for i-am-officially-offlimits-for-bullying).I have nothing to contribute, I'll shut up now.
I think women are good at faking because in general we have to endure a lot, but not appear agreesive. 
> planning out future encounters, answers to emails Whenever I'm replying to a work email, no matter the length of the reply, I always end up spending ten minutes or so questioning whether or not I'm conveying the right tone, or if I'm even sending it to the right person.
The comment about socks made me giggle, because some days a little something will interrupt his flow, but he's pretty good about getting back up and asking for help. And then of course two minutes later he's busy explaining math to me that I don't quite comprehend. Or spouting facts about the earth, or testing my knowledge on using an analog clock. 
That's human nature. That's never going to change.
To the best of my knowledge (cannot claim to be a mental health professional), Autism is a spectrum disorder. In order to diagnose it, they have somewhat of a checklist. I think it was if you meet five or more items on the checklist, the line is crossed and then it's time to establish where you sit on said spectrum. It's not just being quirky or slightly awkward, it's also difficulty processing and expressing emotion, the sensory issues, and some people may even be nonverbal until rather late. I just explained how it affects me, it could be totally different to the next commenter :) 
Come to Europe, where I had better days is an acceptable answer
\#ImWithBacon
Just say "nothing much". Most people will take that. 
I thought it was like a coder's term of endearment.  Like:  I'm with you sweetie.    I'm with you, bacon.I think I'm going to do this now.
I think they have many symptoms in common. I don't have ASD, but I do have social anxiety, and I scored 153 out of 180 on a Asperger's test (an online one though, you can take it on the Aspie subreddit)
You just described that perfectly. My current girlfriend didn't realise that I have high functioning autism - partly because it's not severe, but also because basically all of the interactions with her have been ones that I've been through many, many times and I roughly know how I'm meant to react, even if sometimes I don't know *why* I need to react that way. it's a huge help but also a hindrance because some people just refuse to believe me until they spend more than a few minutes at at time with me.
That and you have time to think through what you want to say. Or at least that's the case with me as an aspie. It's not weird on the internet if it takes 2-3 minutes to respond to a tweet or comment, but it's definitely weird if you do that in real life.
Yeah, I'm just upvoting and nodding. I wish I could explain that well how I felt
It is also easier to run through something you've written and revise it after a minute or two. Ask someone a question in person and you expect a predictable kind of answer within 2 seconds, and there's no room for proofreading.
It's more accurate sure but most people don't understand computer scripts either...
A lot has changed in 15 years with therapy, I am 28. Therapy now is much different to when I was younger. Even just 10 years ago. Much has changed. I wish you many smiles and happy thinking. Just if you want to change, there maybe a way you can get help and not have to do it alone.
Just remember that no matter what the doctor tells you, you're the same person you've always been - you just may have a name to some of your behaviors. 
Maybe it's time for me to go see someone...
hahaha, brilliant. As someone who's not autistic, but is an introvert, that sentence reads this way to me..."Imagine you could eat a burrito for breakfast and then wear it to work."
> remembers how much of a dumbass I was while taking a shower/jogging/lying on my bad Brain: "So yeah, remember that thing that you did years ago that nobody cared about? That was fucking embarassing, eh? Let us think about it for much longer than is necessary now!"
I've always thought I might be on the Asperger's spectrum but this thread feels like it's confirming it for me. I have so many of these idiosyncrasies and I feel like they  really have held me back from being as successful as I could have been.This topic is a bit of a mind blown moment for me.
Wow, I had never heard of hyperempathy before. My son is autistic and can't watch movies because he gets too stressed and upset whenever something bad happens. We can't watch Peppa Pig because her brother George cries a lot and it drives him crazy. 
My thing is complicated by CSA and three rapes and the resulting ptsd. I'm getting treatment and hopefully will become desensitised enough to finally take my dog out for walks. That's my only goal so far. I'm still too scared to think about interacting with humans face to face. Even this reddit thing is giving me heart palpitations so I'm probably going to stop fairly soon. Thank you for the happy thinking :)
I wish we could nominate you to mod an autism related subreddit.I wish I could pay you to help me better understand my kids and be a better mom.
Hi there! So, babies are usually fine when they're crying; it's not usually an indicator of pain or anything! The usual causes of a baby crying are because they're hungry, uncomfortable, need their diaper changed, or maybe just want some comfort and attention. You might already know this, but just in case you didn't, it might comfort you to know that babies usually cry simply because it's the only way they can communicate. :)
Glad I could make you happy :)
You seem like an incredibly nice and genuine person. It's amazing to me that you are so positive. I am going to be more positive today and try to pass along the happy smiles and happy thinking!
Just like me, heh.
I think he's trying to say that you're a strong fighter & You should be proud of yourself.I agree with him :)
I think he found your post enlightening to the point where he is having a hard time processing the difficulty/challenges you experience.  I always think learning is a good thing.
I call it information saturation. Eventually you reach a point that you have the majority of the functional and required information about a given topic. As there is nothing really new or enticing to learn the obsession fades into another topic until its saturation point. Rinse and repeat. The reason I find for not regaining interest is the same effect as when you sit down and read an entire book series. You can be completely enthralled and finish the series quickly. But when the next book comes out the rush to read it is not like it was when you read the second/third books. 
It's an acceptable answer everywhere.  Lots of folks just don't want to dive any deeper.
I'm coming up on 40 years old in a few months.  I feel like I have learned enough of those things, that I can now pass for completely normal.  I've got a wife, I got a place, I keep my bills paid, I haven't had to move in over 4 years which is a new record for me.  At worst, people think of me as an under achiever.  Nobody has any ideas.  It can be done, but it does take time.  A lot of time. 
I don't know if this is common for aspies, but I definitely am someone who can be incredibly articulate and intelligent if given time to form a statement. In public social situations I usually just say what comes to mind, because in the time it would take to formulate an articulate statement the conversation has already moved on. On the internet or through text I have time to think about these things 
I mean I think they get the basic if this then this. If they don't you could say "logic trees"
Autism is a spectrum disorder. It's very likely many people have one or more symptoms but would still not cross the threshold for diagnosis.
Thank you so much, I wish you many good times as well 
Somehow this is really comforting. Thank you so much :)
I prefer denial, thanks
Where it gets real fun is that Introversion/extroversion aren't binary. I'm a natural introvert with an extroverted personality so hanging out with friends is a lot like hiking up a mountain; it's fun but when it's over I am *spent.*
Yeah, I was walking home after work, listening to music, and I suddenly remember acting reatrded in front of a girl. I said fuck out loud, and I must have said it much louder than I wanted to because everyone was looking at me. My brain is going to save this one for next year around fall. 
I share the majority of these symptoms (hyperempathy, fear of doing something wrong, "outlandish" social behavior, etc.) and have been diagnosed with a personality and stress disorder. I would definitely seek help if it's something that really affects your daily life.
I like to think about it in the opposite way; the spectrum is in all of us.
George drives me crazy, too! Im glad my kids are out of that phase.
Sure, when you eat too much salt.
I have to say I'm so glad I don't have to shop for my groceries like that. I hate going to the supermarket enough without having it full of people shouting and arguing over every price. I'd pay double (probably do!) to avoid all that hecticness.
Asymmetrical perspective is the corner stone of the human condition.
Just wanted add a little something to this. My kids are like this but are not autistic. They assume because all their friends know all the memes, then everyone must know the meme and the meaning behind that meme. Reddit is like that too.
I did not like change when younger! It would have been impossible so many things I do now. Small steps!
Sometimes people just like to touch everything really cool. You know when I was younger I was told, never swear. Swearing is bad. So I have only said two curse words in my life. So seeing someone able to curse like you just did, in my head your like a super rough good guy in a movie, like John Mcclain from Die Hard :) ! Keep being awesome!
I am unsure what CSA means but I am sorry for these things happening to you. But it sounds like things maybe not related to just having autism but by things that autism has made worse that have happened to you.I think you are brave and strong. If reddit is making you uneasy it is okay to not use reddit. :)
:) I ma a moderator of /r/lego I like that. I gave some communications in real life before on autism. I hope you can be the best mom you wish to be and that you feel you are doing a good job. Trying to understand your children is the first step to being a kind parent!
Thank you for sharing :)!! Helpful for me!
Hmmmm based on your username I'd think you'd be gilding everyone, not just a few individuals...
The happiness is trying to come out from inside :) That what I say.
I don't really understand :)
:) Thank you kindly for putting value in my words, they would just be words if you didn't like them. Now they are liked words :) Its an upgrade like in a video game.
Lots of happy thinking and happy smiles for you to pass from me to you! Happy thinking smiley day sounds like a nice day.
I hope you can be a better person because everyone should always want to be better :) That way the whole world can be better and then with all that better we can all do better things! hehe :)
I'm 29. I was wondering how old you were too. I don't feel as alone today thanks to reading all of these comments. Thank you for helping me today, even if it wasn't on purpose. :)
:) Thank you kindly. I am not sure if a strong fighter. But I try to be brave.
Yes, difficult. But! Also joy.     I was sick recently. My 8 year old friend and her mother took me to the doctor. Afterwards when back at my home, she put a blanket on me and kissed my cheek to help me get better faster. I think that was a joy, even though being sick was hard. It is like that, there are some bad things and then good things and so not all of it is hard, just some. Like dressing I need help to do, but patting my cat I can do myself. Typing on the computer I can do, but tidying my house is hard because I am unsure what is useful and what goes where. A mix.
Oh thank you kindly! Happy smiles to you! :)
Thank you, I am glad you found my writing very useful. Many happy smiles to you too!!
yea I don't know where people get "great" being the only acceptable answer. I hear "tired" like 3 times as much
Reddit is austistic is the correct answer. Place where you can take all the time in the world to reply or simply not.
But you are surely better than in  another 40 years! 
Congratulations. I am nearly the same age and in a similar position. Everything is so much easier now that I've learned how to cope with my limitations. To the outsider it looks like underachieving, but every day of peace and happiness is an achievement for me.
I want to think I treat everyone with dignity, patience, and respect. But apparently I don't sometimes. What do people do that make you feel that way?
My husband gets soooo annoyed with my son because he has a hard time differentiating attitude and autism.  One time he told my son to "wipe the table".  So my kid took a towel and did one swipe right down the middle.  Hubby couldn't understand that he LITERALLY did what was asked.  Aspie kids benefit from having everything explained in detail the first few times out.
I'm on the spectrum too and I agree wholeheartedly, communicating through text is FAR superior to actually speaking with someone.
And now we've literally got a bunch of autists sitting around breaking down the options of how to address this specific hypothetical social situation.Been there many times myself, friends.
You assume too much. 
Interesting. I was listening to NPR last night and they were talking about Autism. One of the thoughts was that the brain is essentially processing too many signals at once. I found it fascinating to listen to. If you're curious: Radio lab is the show. This thread has been quite enlightened to read. Thanks! 
You're welcome! I had a long time when I would say things like "I'm focused because I'm autistic" or "I'm smart because I'm autistic" and eventually I switched to "I'm focused because I'm train-of-thot" and that made all the difference in both allowing myself to feel great about my good qualities and taking responsibility for the rough edges.
Holy shit, you can be a mix of both?This just answered a lot of confusion I tend to have about my inconsistency in my dealings with people.
As an introvert I'm completely fine talking to strangers if there is an external non-personal purpose in the interaction. Serving tables implies one.I'm 26 and as I grew older I learned to make small talk/talk to people when there is no inherent purpose, but it's never enjoyable and drains mental energy.
I relate to this.. if I see someone in a public setting, I don't want the conversation to last more than a few sentences of small talk. I'm always looking for a way to hint to the person that I want them to leave..
The ol' shit sandwich! Compliment-Critique-Compliment 
Who do you see though? I honestly feel the same way. I experience a lot of the same issues and get some pretty severe social anxiety at times. So much that I can't think about anything else when it's on my mind.
Never change, Reddit.
I feel like because of this, the average Westerner is TERRIBLE at negotiation. Like, if you were from Asia, Africa, the Middle East or Latin America, difficult negotiations are just a part of life. My friend from Kenya managed to get a Sony store employee to sell him the DISPLAY TELEVISION THEY USED IN THE STORE for 50% the asking price. It was dope.
> Asymmetrical perspective is the corner stone of the human condition.I see it differently.
He asked. I explained it. Things changed. I let him know when it was going better. I don't mean to make it sound so easy, but simple communication is very effective. 
Reddit is definitely on the spectrum.
We are all autistic on this blessed day.
it got a lot better already luckily :) And I also learned to recognize when I am opposed to something just because it's different and my autism has difficulty handling it, I manage to take a step back and re evaluate.
Touching cool stuff is cool be it a wall, a leaf, a strangers awesome hair (ok maybe not this last one) totally with you on that.Only two?! That's commendable, no idea how you managed.I'm a tiny mid-20's woman with the mouth of a sailor, it's fun and apparently makes me sound like John Mcclain, which is fantastic.  Yes I will and you keep being your damn awesome self too, you brave, unusual soup.
child sexual assault. Autism is definitely complicating the PTSD and its treatment, and as I'm a female with autism that means there's less knowledge/awareness of how it manifests vs how it typically does with males. 
Hi u/UnusualSoup! I was so excited to see you out in the Wilds of Reddit!! 
shit
> I don't really understand :)It is adorable.There should be a subreddit just with quotes like that. 
Oh my god, I've been reading your messages now, and this one made me laugh and cry at the same time. I never made that connection before! 
Grill can be warrior too
You should be proud of yourself <3
I'm not autistic and I don't know what's useful and what's not when cleaning house. Haha! But in all seriousness, that's a reallwy great perspective to have. Finding joy in the everyday things. 
........................................That is correct
Congratulations from someone who gets it.  Lord knows those are few and far between.  
Because autism is invisible I'm expected to have the same social prowess of everyone else. Breaking down this wall would go a long way to supporting autists and inducting them into normal society. 
Hahahaha. I wish I could meet you all IRL so we could have hours of these pointless arguments. I love it but no one else will entertain it
It's true.  Never underestimate human ignorance.  It is the greatest power on the planet.
Had a boss once that was the absolute master of the shit sandwich. He could get his point across - criticism - while still allowing you to feel good about yourself.  
As someone who has the same kind of problem and tried this way of handling it... It only made things worse lolThe thing is starting with something like "I don't mean to be critical ..." was usualy just enough to upset them, no matter what was following...Now I'm not from the US and there's quite a lot of differences in culture and communication from here I guess.
Well, reddit should probably change its sodium intake.
That's pretty much my dads go to. I don't think he's ever bought a "big" electronic that wasn't a display model. He's worked in sales for about 35 years though so stuff like that is just second nature. 
Hey. At least we are high functioning, unlike 4chan.
I would not say several at once, maybe one or two at a time before moving onto more things. Yes your adventures I hope are full of smiles too. I am glad you are so kind to your friend, it is a very good thing.
I have a published children's book :) I love to write.
I am a girl :) I do not know if I manage it, but more, others help me manage. When the support is in place lots can happen. I hope this makes sense. Like before I could talk people had to guess my needs. With therapy and support and care I became able to talk. With talking I was able to express my needs, then they were able to take that further and help me better myself more. Independence as much as possible is the goal for anyone with any disability.
I write poetry, stories, mostly for Children, sometimes just what I am feeling or finding hard. I have one published childrens book available on Amazon.
That is wonderful and you are very amazing for working that out! I hope you make many more steps in the future forever!
:) Thank you for kind words, You keep being awesome action hero too!
I am also a female with Autism. There is not less knowledge or awareness always, it depends on the people who are trying to support you and what experience they have.
Maybe you can make one, I am not sure what quotes you mean but it is good you are happy.
Glad to know I'm not alone. That is a beautiful statement.
I patted her for you. She likes rubbing her head on things. So I also let her rub her head on my hand for you too!
Thanks for kind words! I am just glad that they are helpful. 
I concur. I've got a pretty mean Weber on the patio.
I've seen comments, know i had a good reply, and still waited ~30 min To think it over.....
It sounds insulting, but I mean it in an endearing way when I say that this reminds me of when you set off a few Siris to talk to each other.
This. I get social anxiety and I look like a weirdo(when talking, been told I'm physically attractive). What I started to do was forcing myself to be more talkative in class, whether if it's around my classmates or I started asking more questions to the professor so the spotlight is on me-forcing myself to continue being coherent with the professor and to learn to be confident in my own voice.That and I'm 27 at a community college. So maybe I'm giving less fucks?
Honestly it's just so much easier that way. As a Westerner myself, I'm obviously biased here, but going around and haggling for the price of everything from a new TV to a fucking banana just seems tedious and horrible. I'd much rather just pay the asking price and be done with it. Besides, in cultures where haggling is common, the initial price tends to start quite a bit higher from my understanding, so you probably end up paying about the same price while managing to waste half a day haggling.
I guess in the context of electronics, sure. But in general, prices, in most retail settings, are non-negotiable in North America. Whether you're buying TVs or bananas or Hanes underwear, typically you just pay the asking price. If you don't like the price, you don't buy it.From what I understand, the way it is in Nairobi, EVERYTHING is negotiable. I guess, considering most of the world has haggling as an aspect of daily life, we're the weird ones in North America.
4chan is very high functioning when they want to be. 4chan needs to be challenged though, else it sits there in the dark jerking itself off. At least when we jerk off the lights are on and we have some decent materiel to fap to. 
That's wonderful! Please keep it up :)
I've always been curious when I see someone able to type so well but had/has difficulties with speaking - would you mind elaborating on your experience with the two? Were you fine with writing/typing even at the time when you could not speak? Or did both abilities kind of evolve together? 
That is great!!And by the way, I've noticed many comments are about lego...So why do you like them so much? :)
You're awesome! It's really made my day reading your comments, you seem lovely. I've really liked learning about you! Good luck with your adventures and your writing! Feel free to message me if you ever want another friend!! :) 
When you wrote that your arms went everywhere and you giggled, it was a perfect description of experiencing joy.  I think almost everyone who read that ended up smiling, because for a moment they could feel a little how you felt.
Thanks, I'm glad! Sometimes I watch my grandmothers cat for her, his name is Mio. He also likes rubbing his head on things. He is very skittish and afraid of new people, but if you're gentle and give him time he really warms up to you. We also have a cat in our house whose name is Panter, the Norwegian word for panther. He is more feral and only allows you to pet him if he comes to you - if you reach out to him, he will avoid your hand. He's a bit of a jerk, but when he feels like it he's very cuddly as well :)
I type out comments and then delete them before they're ever posted you're lucky I had the courage for this one Now if you'll excuse me I'm going back into the corner.
27 at a community college....thank you for your service. I'm 22 and the thought of being around 18 year olds scares the fuck out of me 
>we have some decent materiel to fap to.You kidding? /d/ is the greatest repository of porn known to mankind.
I sent a message with the place to see my book :)
I am fascinated by something similar. /u/UnusualSoup, you can elaborate your thoughts eloquently on complex subjects (and better than most) but when you saw a small cut on your leg, you weren't able to determine that it was fine--you needed to ask a neighbor. Where is the disconnect happening?
Thank you kindly :)
You have wonderful adventures too! And you find lots of smiles ! :)!
Good, everyone should be happy! I like that feeling.
I love cats!
You would have to message me :)
Yes! And they let you stare at them and never get angry about it!
It's really not that bad. Most of the younger crowd like to stick with each other and they just assume I'm an old fart(I look older than my age). It's when they start talking to me that they find out I have a lot in common with the majority(not out of touch with trends and up to date news).It's also a bonus that professors tend to respect older students and I usually find myself in being a group leader position for group assignments since they tend to think I know what I'm doing (faking it 'till I make it). 
Got it! Will be buying it in the next few days, most likely. I'll let you know when it comes in the mail!
Something interesting to me is the self awareness, or introspection I guess? What I mean is, she said in an earlier post that she flaps her arms when she gets excited. I can see that as something an autistic person might do, but I didn't know that they would recognize that it's abnormal or feel ashamed that they do it. As fascinating as this is, I also feel like I might cry any minute reading her posts, for some reason. Maybe I'm the same thing as these people, but nobody ever thought to tell me?
UnusualSoup you sound like a really cool person I hope we meet oneday!
Oh I understand now, I thought you meant to say it wasn't the case. The doctor that does the home visits seems knowledgeable but my support worker isn't. They know more about the anxiety. They want me to get better enough to leave the house and then attend some meetings of kind with other autistic people, but did say it was all men so I don't think I want to, because they frighten me. My support worker once mentioned she thought about it and if more autistic females were properly diagnosed then it would be easier for me to find all female groups to go to. 
When my daughter was young, I modeled behavior for her;  movietime was one.  She learned to laugh when I did and I would explain concepts that I thought were confusing her.  Now, she's the one explaining plots to me when I become confused, and I laugh when she does.  It's ironic the role reversal, but she's becoming my teacher. I suspect you are something of a teacher now.  Thank you for your words here.  It's a wonderful opportunity for people to see past labels.
Everywhere except England. There it's still tea time.

My first thought. Let's muffle that shit. 
It's already really weird to watch a live recording of the beatles. Why go to a fucking concert if all you're gonna do is shriek? 
Here's the catch, in this world when a man gets aroused his dick begins singing, "Hello my baby, hello my honey, hello my ragtime gal."
But porn would be more honest: "You gotta make me whistle, William!"
"Pussy Calling" disgusts me. How dare women whistle at me while I'm minding my own business, walking down the street.
What on earth are you doing at your local library?
Yes as the tea pot was invented after?
There's an alternative universe where this happens. There's a Reddit thread in that universe asking how life would change if vaginas bled every month. It's heavily downvoted and everyone thinks the guy who posted it is really weird. 
Let's get down to business!To defeat the HunsDid they send me whistlers, when I asked for sons?
So something like:* 10 things that your whistle says about you. * Are you a C sharp or B flat? Find out what your whistle means!* Whistle while you work, how to be productive and seductive. * G Spot to G major, everything you want to know but too shy to ask.

Trust me, there would be zero whistling at strip clubs.
4 years... seems legit
They would have to invent muff mufflers.
RIP your inbox
*carless whisper plays*
#JUST BECAUSE IT'S TEA TIME DOESN'T MEAN IT'S D TIME. 
Other men would be convinced it just happens at random, like teenage boners. Meanwhile, she would be convinced he was letting her down easy. Because if there's one thing you can count on polite people doing, it's complicating sex. 
He'd probably go deaf
Mawp
Try whistling with your lips together.It would sound like the campfire scene in Blazing Saddles 
The lesbians wouldn't like it
I think I owe you a beer or two dude, haha. 
Oh noe
Noise literally all the f*cking time.
 > All the girls going off at once I just had an image of a harmony of whistles interjected with frantic leg-crossing
do you mean that, or BOIOIOIOING?
"Everyone's sounds different. Perhaps you just couldn't hear it" would be oft-quoted to reassure many young men, let alone women concerned about their bodies (those girls trying to convince themselves that they really like Joe, he's great for me, etc).
English women would have it made.  Just like men blame farts on the dog women could blame their audible arousals on the kettle.
Word of the day: Raspberried
Muffle the muff! 
Even the Beatles was pissed off in the end because they could not even hear themselves play.
Medical school would be a lot different! Gynecologists would have to do their major at a conservatorium!
"Holy shit, do you have a Didgeridoo in your pants or do you just get off on jamming watermelons up there?
Send me a kiss by wire, baby my dick's on fire.
"The kettle isn't on, dear""Then wha- *oh my fucking god mom*"
Not really, you could just add the sound in post.
"WHY DO YOU WHISTLE EVERYTIME YOU SEE THE MAILMAN??"
Ew. This just made me realize the tonality of the whistle would probably change with age too.
My sexiness is like a germ. If you get to close to it, it will affect you.
Every time someone opens the door you just hear *whistling*
Nobody would use it with any dignity though. 
I've been doing it wrong this whole time. 
Isn't it more like a "sproing"?...right?
Or Drake:> She call me the referee cause I be so official> My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle> Like the Andy Griffith theme song
They think he's a misogynist who wants to see women suffer. 
IS YOUR CAT CONSTANTLY STOMPING AROUND, DRIVING YOU CRAZY?
Or Snow White's "Whistle While You Work"
Somebody should hire you
The infamous and gross "like a hotdog down a hallway" would change to "like a barge in the fog."
I would just carry a whistle around at all times, hiding in the shadows next to a busy street, blowing it at random times during the day
And your father smells of elderberries. 
No, it's "Whistle While You Work" from Snow White.

I have to assume that someone makes an account, and then frequently uses Reddit over the course of four years. Eventually, out of the millions of threads posted, one of them is relevant to their username.
Dude, Where's My Car?Starring Whisper
This is what this thread was for. 
Can't say no if you're whistling... 
u dont like tater tots?
Oh man, could you imagine an all girls school when an attractive female teacher turns around and a lone whistle blows out. Everyone in the room would just start looking around at each other, wondering who it was.
Lol my pleasure, bud
Agreed that I just focused on Western culture, and very specifically American history (which is my specialty). I can't really state what would happen elsewhere.However I'd be curious to hear what culture you think whistling vaginas would lead to advanced technology?((we're all in way too deep but if we pretend it's normal maybe no one will judge us))
Yeah, I find it interesting to think about how primal tribes would have reacted. Like maybe women would have initially evolved it accidentally, but then the sound attracted more men, ensuring the gene was passed down. So initially it would be something that would probably be celebrated and admired, and the could be that the louder the whistle, the more dominant the woman.
You're welcome! Everyone said go for STEM, but now we see the true power of a history and social science education.
This could be! Never underestimate the power of sexual attraction as a driving force. But considering how woman's sexuality has been controlled historically I went with my version. I certainly like your version better, but am wary of putting my faith into it knowing how human societies like to punish those they deem as having deviant sexual behavior.One thing's for sure, if your version is correct, steam powered sexbots would be made quite rapidly compared to other automaton.
Lol. What if crossing their legs just changes the pitch?
But most English people have electric kettles that don't whistle when boiled.
IM ETHAN RASPBERRIED
Imagine feminism in the 60's.WE MUST LET OUR VAGINA'S BE HEARD!SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
They basically didn't do live shows for the second half of their career.
Maybe they love the sound of teenage girls screaming
You could tell they were annoyed by it on stage too
Not sure if it'll help, but an overtone is a musical note that is part of a harmonic series above the fundamental note (the note that is being played) and can be heard with the fundamental note simultaneously. A tritone is another name for an augmented 4th interval. Generally, this tone is dissonant (unpleasant) and sounds wrong/bad to the ear
I KEEP IT IN MY CROTCH SO THE TEA STAYS WARM

Flex the muscles in your legs continuously for about a minute. Your blood flow will be redirected from your penis to your legs.
Oh, that would be a new job after the automation sets through; pussywhistling post production manager!
Because it's hotmail
HA!  Several years ago before the bar exam some students decided to, er, blow off some steam one evening in the law library where I work.  They left the used condom in the trash can.  These are grown folks with apartments.  Go home to do that or ask for a Clorox wipe to clean off the table when you're done.
You think we didn't know where the cameras were?
"Sounds like a thousand screaming harpies back there... "
You have to blow in it first.
Depends on if you're cut or uncut. 
Y'know, this is the song that I was originally thinking of, but googling "make that pussy" whistle brought up Headbands, first.I'm pretty sure B.O.B. threw that in there as a nod, as well.Thanks!
Oh I can guarantee people would make something out of it. Not sure it would necessarily be art, though...
Queef is the word you are looking for.
Change places! Change places!
It's ok, sometimes she does laugh because we fall out of bed or the cat is meowing at the door like his tail is on fire, or I steal her underwear and try to make off with them. It's a great thing when you don't have to be so serious all the time. Someday, the kids will finally decode all the stealth grown-up stuff that goes on in this house and they're going to be sooooo mortified.
Someone probably already did, hence being able to pay for internet access and a computer.
Aww thanks buddy :D 
"So horny right nHHHWWAAAAAAAAAMP!"
You could really confuse some people by blowing that whistle in a room full of dudes
I want to hear this now 
Sad trumpet
This thread is a karma farm for you
I already was on all of them.
MY BRAIN... TREMBLES!!!
That's a mighty bold assumption you got there.
I like tater tots but I don't want to fuck a tater tot.
Mostly, if a culture celebrated whistling vaginas they wouldn't have any fear or hangups regarding the noises that steam engines make and thus, would be willing to work with steam power and make all the technological advancements that only really happened because they were built off steam-powered things. 
Not in the whistleverse they don't. 
Americans actually still use whistling kettles? How quaint.
Hilarity aside, the flaw in this logic is that these women must be aroused to do so.  So either feminism, or rebellion, gets them off - or they're basically a rolling orgy to keep it whistlin'.
Yeah, and they mentioned that the reason was the screaming women.
Damn, I should have paid more attention in sex ed. 
I AM SHOUTING TO COVER UP THE SOUND OF MY TEAPOD

But not *too* hard.  You don't want to give "said female" an air embolism.

Additionally if you blow to hard into a vagina you risk that the airflow goes around the bend to the anus and blows out fecal matter.
People need to learn it's only a penis you blow air into. It's called a *blow* job for a reason

If you ever watch any Beatles interviews. You'll hear them talking about "drinking tea" a lot. This was a euphemism for drugs. 
I'm not so sure - they all loved and were founded on rock 'n' roll, and heavy touring schedules would have kept them on booze and uppers instead of psychedelics.How about this for a bit of conjecture: The Rolling Stones stuck to the rock and didn't get as experimental as the Beatles because they weren't good looking enough to get their tours ruined with screaming.
Not to hijack, but the main point being missed here is the Beatles mostly quit touring because large scale streamlined touring infrastructure had not yet been established. Security, safety, transportation, police escorts, not getting mobbed by fans, proper sound mixing and inner ear monitors, all the things modern bands take for granted exist, at least partially, due to the necessity demonstrated by the Beatles' horrendous touring experience.  *Better words

Is that why my husband randomly started peeing in the sink? Goddammit
Explain please?
I remember last time this was brought up in a similar thread! and he showed up and kept on trying to explain that he was massively misunderstood and that he loved her...it was like he just couldn't listen to anyone saying that was he was doing was scary and that he was obviously sick...it was really disturbing.
That escalated quickly
I remember that post so well too because I read a line that was like "The police don't have the thousands of minds working on this like we do." and just thought "I'm not sure that is how things work." then sure enough a day or so later they caught a guy and was harassing his family before any actual proof.
I think I remember seeing something similar, but a girl planned to go to Europe with her best friend, the mom, and her new boyfriend. Last minute the girls parents decide she can't go, and the girls best friend and mom is never heard from again, although they promised to call as soon as they landed. 
No I don't remember, please tell
Let's not talk about Morgan Freeman's AMA. Let's keep discussion to Rampart.
I believe the only information they got right was that there was in fact a bombing. 
Similar to this: the guy on 4chan who messed with a handgrenade and flushed it down the toilet. The next day there were news articles about an explosion in someones apartment that originated from the pipework and im pretty sure someone died. Either it was him or the grenade made his way through the pipes and killed his neighbor or something
20th largest website on earth. Yeah, it has baggage with it.
I remember this. It was in a semi bad area, looked shady from the outside, and the staff refused to talk with the guy investigating. So he decided it was a drug front or something. IIRC it turned out to be a legit day care.
That sounds like the saddest short story ever written.
Which one.

Id seen that sub before and felt bad for some of them  (Im sure theres some nice ones) but felt like it was just a woe is me, pity party circlejerk.  Visited it after your link and holy fuck.  Some dude whos a frequent poster also openly advocates for raping women and says it isn't a bad thing.  WTF. 
Wasn't it r/sexyabortedfetuses ? I was new to reddit and that was my first time realizing how fucked up this place can get
Power users are a plague on websites like Reddit and it's a good thing that he's gone. When a guy comments on a subreddit and is getting upvoted to the top no matter what he says, it's not healthy for Reddit.

After the Boston Bombing Reddit decided it could help by having thousands of people look through whatever videos/pictures it could in hope of helping the FBI figure out who was responsible. It turns out thousands of people who don't really know what they are doing are not as good as professionals with years of training in a certain area.  Innocent people ended up on the front page of newspapers.What's worse is the FBI knew who did it very quickly and because of the reddit interference they had to release the names sooner than they would have liked.
As much of a clusterfuck as that one was I can't help but feel that he gets shit on unecessarily, because everything in that thread made it seem like he was genuinely only told that it was a PR event for Rampart by his agent/people who arranged it to be just that, not counting on the fact that reddit wouldn't play ball. Whoever handles PR fucked up bigtime and it seems to me like he just got caught in the middle.
He didn't
Because there was a very clear lack of Morgan Freeman. Every answer the account gave read like a PR guy with canned responses. 
And that it occurred in boston
I thought it was a microwaved grenade? That might have been a different one though, I don't know.

One time the lead dev for COD bo2 I think changed it so that it was harder to get trick shots. Then had to get a body guard as people were telling him what his 5 year old son was wearing during the day and harassing him.
I feel like I only ever see "men get raped / are victims of DV too" when it's in the context of derailing a conversation about women. It makes me sad because I feel like the people who keep bringing that stuff up aren't doing it because they really care about the issues men face, they just want to exploit that suffering to shut down women.
They drag their feet. Write down names and numbers, call and leave a voicemail to the number that called, then go away. They don't watch out for you, they can't. They act as if they'll find this person today when in reality it could be weeks before they even do. I told them where a person was, they asked the landlord "Does this person live here?" and when they said no, because they didn't know the crackheads living there were sheltering like 4 other people for a few dollars so they could all get high...they dropped it and didn't look into or even watch that place. 
It did. It was ridiculous. They didn't want to talk to him because he was harassing a daycare.

It's a story of a OR nurse operating on this 314 pound woman who had an infection and  tons of dead flesh and feces shot into the operating room.
Exactly, how would someone assume that someone taking photos of their tv, purse or watch have foul intentions. You are SUPPOSED to hide photos for insurance reason, because if someone comes in and robs you and steals the camera, you now have no photos.Clearly a robber isn't going to look under a kitchen sink for anything of value.People try to read too deep into things.She never posted again, because she probably said;"Honey, why is there a camera under the sink?""For insurance""O, ok"
Everythings a thing. Apparently the pedo sub was a this. 
I believe it's been quarantined and not banned yet

i'm still angry about one of the guys in there talking about how he had made friends with the cops at his college so that it would help him get away with shit a little easier. 
How did reddit fall for that? He wrote, "she came over for some kisses" and even better " touch his penis, but only a little" lol
Yeah, a lot of people there are actually fucking crazy.
No, it's more like cancer. Herpes implies that they are getting laid.

According to the Wikipedia article, the guy was arrested and charged for taking data from an MIT computer. Looks like they were felony charges. The prosecution was trying to throw the book at him, and he hanged himself in his apartment rather than go to prison (since he was facing such disproportionate sentencing). This is the guy who was a huge influence in the creation of RSS, Reddit, Creative Commons, and a few more. Huge intellectual asset that was a tragic loss. 
He also had a terrible effect on biologists in /r/AskScience.  None of their answers were respected and if they ever disagreed with something he said elsewhere they were downvoted into oblivion.People who spent their entire careers studying the exact question posed were harassed for not obeying the cult of Unidan, who was just some random grad student.

I believe he's waiting for us to all forget about him so we don't recognise his username straight away.

/u/lordtuts posts an image in /r/me_irl saying if it gets over 10000 upvoted, he will tattoo the next day's top /r/me_irl post in his ass. He didn't and instead posts an image saying something like: "You think I would tattoo my ass for fake Internet points? You are easily bamboozled."

You should naturally assume incest whenever it's on Reddit. 
4chan and reddit both do some pretty cool things, but the bad stories like kidnappers posting pictures of their victims on /b/ or people witch hunting random people accusing them of being terrorists really just kind of outshines all the good stuff unfortunately. 
This is like the umpteenth time I've seen this user mentioned with no explanation. Did he actually do something awful or is it just a Reddit inside joke?
She just had to prove how stupid and gullible everyone on the Internet is for her "social experiment" and then gloat about it on other subreddits.  She posted in r/TwoXChromosomes for crying out loud, not someplace like r/TIFU. I mean there people are going to give you the benefit of the doubt and try to help you out, instead of trying to prove you wrong; it's meant to be a haven.

What a great analogy, shit I'm stealing this
The story of most comments on reddit
> What's worse is the FBI knew who did it very quickly and because of the reddit interference they had to release the names sooner than they would have liked.The FBI releasing their names caused the bombers to panic and kill a police officer. Reddit literally has blood on its hands for that one.
His wife's whole family sounds fucked 
I thought it was fake?  The verification picture was proven to be fake 
Are we *sure* it wasn't a "pizza parlor"?
Sadly, I think there may have been two grenade incidents. 
I think it was a gas explosion (water heater leakage)
That was Black Ops 2, but yeah. Poor Vanderhar.
It's amazing to see.. people will become absolutely outraged over something but no matter how bad it is, the hype dies off in a day or so.Unless someone responds. The thing that everyone claims is "all they want" triggers a shitstorm of unrivalled proportion. And then they bitch that the developers never engaged with the community over contentious issues.
You are absolutely correct in feeling like that. For the most part on reddit, male rights and advocating for male victims of assault and rape only seems to be brought up as a counter for female victims, rather than as an issue in it's own right. It's disgusting for all parties and degrades victims of all genders.
Very well concentrated here though.
Ah yes, the ultimate proof for conspiracy-minded folks. 
>wife sides with son & dog fucking continues.IIRC it was more than that, the son framed it by saying the dad was fucking the dog. After that any signs that the dog was being raped the wife thought it was the dad. 
This person's been reading too much Chuck Palahniuk

Seriously, what do people think happened? This isn't a bad Lifetime movie.
Yup. /r/jailbait was around until some in the media heard about it and started talking about how reddit has pedos on it. I think it was one of the first times that Reddit was on the national news
So, uh, what exactly was it? Just pictures of dead girls?
The PI that had a live feed, etc. overall a pretty fun weekend. 
But like, why would they go there and post there? Everyone knows it as that rapey place, so why would anyone think "oh cool, I'll hang out there and post"?
>[women]  less compassionate>A lot of them believe women are not truly people.>women in general as "sociopathic cunts"Thats an impressive amount of lack of introspection... 
simple words=big karma
THERE IT IS
Purging a system is what a lot of people did during the fappening.
Ha, I love it fuck reddit for caring so much about karma
Wasn't that recently?
Who cares about comment karma when you get so much gold!
That was irl court, much less professional than karmacourt
Oof, suicide or murder? That's pretty brutal :-/
Wouldn't an anal queef be a fart though?

Ya I was on /b/ yesterday and 3 posts in was a video of a guy attempting to rape a woman sun bathing. The guy himself was taping it
True, but we will never know how he would have acted if he wouldn't have been doxxed. Also to do this over a subreddit is pretty mad for me.
Based on his submission history, he submitted a post to r/me_irl saying he'd get the top post from the following day tatooed on his ass if he got X upvotes. He got the upvotes, posted the next day to remind everyone that that day's post would go on his ass, then posted the *next* day to call everyone who believed he'd actually do it idiots. 
It makes people question if ANY post is truth. (especially in safe haven subs)
No shit? Knowing not to mix ammonia and bleach should really be taught in school.
It wasn't over.
I swear I have a visceral reaction to that 
Oh god. Denko. Poor denko indeed. That shit is insane.
You can have 600 emails. If you want. 
Why was he at the flat?? Did your dad flip?
> mistreats herself to deathThis is what neuroscientists should be working on-how the brain absorbs environmental abuse and then compels the person to treat themselves badly.
Too late, I already stole it from someone else 
Agreed. This is the best one I've seen in here so far for the topic.
I think they meant it in the sense that it wont make people and the internet froth at the mouth for justice or revenge like the harm of our idea of innocence, ie abuse of children, defenseless animals, etc...
It was confirmed by his Twitter account, so it was very likely his agent running the whole thing.
Better drive there and fire off a few shots just to be sure.
I think there's been more than 2 grenade incidents.
The lack of evidence only strengthens their conviction. 
I  feel like I'm one of the few people it still watch his videos regularly. I showed it to my younger brother and me and him watch them together all the time.
Opened it, nothing but a weird looking spider. It was white or something
Her taint. She was injecting heroin into her taint and it got infected and made a fistula, which is to say, her vagina and anus were linked by a tube that opened from the infection punching through both walls.
You could have just said lifetime movie
Thanks Santiago
Was that before the cringy "Narwhal bacons . . . "?
yup
Seem to remember he was also having "steak outs" as well! Overall it was like a text based drama series and I was totally hooked 
They literally believe that all women are whores, and owe them sex.They also say that "because sex is a tool for women and they can have it any time they want, men can't be raped."The place is filled with the saddest angriest, most delusional type of people
He gained 70000 karma from all the process /r/karmacourt ruled him innocent, but I bet it's one of its most controversial / disputed results
Yup. This month I think.
Who cares about gold when you have RES?
Suicide.
Mmm that you only meant well
Spread the word of ceddit.
It still isn't over!
Make it 1000 and you got a deal
It was just a routine check that the social services were doing probably because we lived in emergency accommodation after my nan evicted my parents from the flat they rented from her, they actually came back from the hospital with me newborn to find she had put all their stuff on the street... But I digress, yeah my dad was properly shell shocked when he saw him at first but my mum went mad when she found out and then my dad went for him so my mum had to pretty much push this guy down the stairs to get him to leave. 
Beyond that, it's easier to stand up against child abuse than it is against the potential for one to arrange your murder at any time. It seems like protesting a hitman website is exactly how you would end up on a hitlist.
> What I remember best was this video that was posted afterwards"Sorry, that's mah dog""We're gonna 3D-ify it." "We need to start a movement" 
I wonder if they even told him what a Reddit AMA was, or if he just didn't give a fuck and gave the go-ahead for a PR guy to do it.
How far does this rabbit hole go man??
Oh great, now you're telling me grenade incidents are on the rise too? 
-Confucius  
Conspiracy theorist dies and goes to Heaven. At the gates he meets God and asks:"God, who shot JRK?""Lee Harvey Oswald did." God says."Jesus Christ the conspiracy goes even higher up then I thought."
They put it on the person looking for evidence to show evidence it's NOT true.  That's how their thought process works. 
no one wants to mention his name?
Long dead too, which is probably why it was white
Now where did I put that Brain Bleach?
I think it was around the same time...?
Merry Christmas reddit.
It says a lot that the stickied post at the top of the sub, which gives more good advice than the rest of the sub combined, is supposed to be sarcastic
TIL karma court is something that exists 
Well just so we're clear this month had the /r/uwaterloo goose tattoo thing, same premise, upvotes for goose on ass... dude seems to be following through though.
Not to downplay reddit's fuckery in that situation, but just to be clear, Sunil Tripathi had killed himself a month before the Boston bombings happened. It wasn't harassment from reddit the caused his suicide. On March 16th, he quit college, left his wallet and phone behind, and no one ever heard from him again. He was found floating in the Seekonk River, 8 days after the bombings, on April 23rd. It's far more likely that he committed suicide on March 16th and was entirely unaware reddit had labeled him the Boston bomber. His family however DID had to live through that shit. 
When you make it good for business for hitmen to kill you, you're gonna have a bad time.
I don't think he even knew it was happening 
Eventually Trump was elected.
Last comment he made about it, 203 days ago."It was directly related to my wife thinking I was the one who sodomized the dog. We are on decent terms but I feel that she still thinks I did it. She still thinks our son is the golden child. Of Course I love him too, but I know the truth about what he did to Colby. We only speak now when it concerns our son, otherwise we dont talk, which I'm fine with. She also harbors resentment toward the dog, which is beyond me. "I hope somebody else opens their eyes for that messed up kid and reports him. Needs to be institutionalised.
I know right ffs 
It was nothing but bones.
/r/eyebleach 
"All power to you"
The jailbait and violentacrez controversy came well after the narwhal. "The narwhal bacons at midnight" was already a thing before I joined reddit. 
Relax In Prison 
Killing is their business, and business is good.
I think Morgan Freeman is so loved by all that everyone is giving him the benefit of the doubt. 
Also victim blaming a dog is fucked up.
Ahh, finally closure. Well the safe opened so not really closure but at least I found the ending. I haven't been able to sleep at night
Is this why the apps are BaconReader and Narwhal, respectively?
We in the killing Nazi bidness, and son, business is a BOOMIN
Stupid sexy Colby.
Yes. 
Fuck sake. 
Really wish someone would have noticed earlier I was on a 14 month drinking binge. I've stopped now though. Just gotta shed the pounds the booze added. 
I'm thinking that my roommate might be super depressed after reading this. I know he wouldn't want me confronting him and telling him if he needed my help, to just ask. Hell, he does need it, and maybe i'll take him to a movie or some shit. Fucker needs to get out of the house. He complained so hard about the pizza place not delivering last night, pasted huge facebook rand on how he was so hungry but couldn't get any food, and I was like, dude, we live 10 min walk from a grocery store. Then he sorta shut down and became unresponsive till he went to bed. haha fuck
Or under reacting to everything, big or small. Almost having no reaction to any problem no matter how much it involves them and just fixes it in silence practically on auto pilot, or just walks away not caring.
Goddamnit. I just had a near mental breakdown trying to cook salmon. This hits home.
Wow hi friend
I don't mind sharing details about my life, it's just going to be generally uninteresting. I will avoid talking about how I feel though, for the simple reason that I can't tell you myself. My answer from birth has been "I'm fine".
This could also mean they're a waiter or shop attendant on a 14- hour shift.
The best you can do is chalk it up to experience and realise you are a better individual for understanding how not to go about things. If you feel guilt and regret then the present you is not the same person who fucked up.
Oh..I do this way too much.
Because being unhappy, even a little is normal
Yeahhhhhhh......
Undersleeping and oversleeping can both by signs of depression. So can changes in sleep patterns or changes in diet/food consumption.
I teeter on the edge of extreme joy and crippling loneliness most of the time. This thread is half of who I am.
its a "why the fuck am I here" kinda look. 
I've noticed that I tend to laugh with other people even when I didn't hear the joke or understand it correctly. After I do anyways I ask myself, "why am I like this." Nothing other than what I've already known I suppose.
How many times can they reveal that they're gay?
haha.
Or can't focus like they used to. Sometimes even reading a book can be a struggle.
And are you unhappy? 
Me too. I pace around my house doing nothing but thinking for hours on end in dead silence. I go to the window, peek outside continuously, and go back to pacing. I must look like a crazy, caged animal. In a way, I am. 
Black eyes, like a doll's eyes.
This is very comforting, thank you for sharing 
I do this all the time... so people *can* see through the act, huh? haha
i know people like thisthey're unbearableprimarily because i'm exactly like that, too... ive just been making an effort to shut the fuck up if i've got nothing positive to say lmao
This needs to be higher. The happy person, especially socially happy person, can be secretly very depressed. Double points if they're trying to make other people happy, or pretty funny.Robin Williams is actually a very good example of this. Comedians in general, really.
Which is funny, because then people say I'm the most positive person they know, when really I'm just trying to hide wanting to die.
I have crippling depression LMAO
Hiding cameras in a person's place is considered somewhat bad form.
:)
There's a great quote I recently heard, "I'd rather be condemned than pitied."
So in other words, any behavior that is on either extreme end of the spectrum.Or they drive a Chevy Cobalt.
Not everyone who does these things in the thread are unhappy but pretty much every unhappy person does these things, if that makes sense.
That could also be a sign that they're fine.
Very interesting 
I feel that. I started drinking pretty constantly for 5 months and I stopped eating as much. I ended up losing 15 pounds, and people keep saying "congrats you look so much thinner" so I just keep acting like it was just dieting or whatever.
This too! Quick story: i was over at a potential bf's house and he pretty much broke up with me on the spot saying i wasnt what he wanted and he wanted his ex back. Now i know this isnt the worst but i was in a low for weeks prior, so this didnt help. I just calmly said 'okay', cried a little, shrugged and walked out. He stopped me, and said "youre scaring me... why are you so calm.. get angry! Get irritated!" So yeah this is a huuuge one as well
I think one of the biggest signs is being devoid of emotion. Like you can't 'feel' anything. There's basically this transition phase where you go from being uncontrollably sad to where you don't feel anything. Which is incredible for a few days, and then it's soul-crushingly awful. All you want to do is 'feel' something, anything, and you can't.
Tbf salmon is quite hard to cook properly.
Shit. This is me
I do this too and it gets worse when you get out of bed later in the day and realize that you haven't done shit all day 
He already said depressed, though.
Practicing smiling... yup.
The fake smile with a thumbs up he musters versus his usual glum face can hit people hard when first watching BH. It's one of those shows that can't really be watched with friends, yet you wish you hadn't put yourself through it alone.
I believe it was Louis CK who said something along the lines of "As long as you think your past is bad, you must be improving".
Yeah, it's tricky. I've always been quite self-deprecating, and I worry I've been offputting before. I *think* I was always quite good at hiding it, but it's hard to say.
As a fellow Brit it is deeply unsettling to find somebody who seems happy. I just assume the happiness is a mask for their severe depression and continue with my depressing life. 
It's the "up to a certain point" that's key there. Obviously to an extent, it's fine. And there's nothing wrong with being modest in most situations. But I've known people who talk like that all the time. All their humour revolves around it. It starts to feel like they're really attempting to reach out or be honest, but are hiding it behind "it's a joke".
That's not good! Some of these are symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (low energy, tiredness, changes in appetite, not smiling much, etc.)
If someone knows you pretty well, they can. 
Please clap
I keep asking myself the same question.... Discipline? Throw the phone into a river? Get out more? 
First time in a while scrolling this far down, tbh
I'm actually happiest when I sleep 12 hours...
Likewise, not sleeping a lot at all. Think only about a couple of hours at night and a nap during the day._edit_ Ok, this seems to have some people riled up. I'm not at all saying that if you don't sleep a lot that means you're depressed. However, depression can come with a severly dysfunctional sleeping rhythm. 
In the darkest and saddest way, I genuinely prefer to be unconscious.
Makes me feel better to hear that it's not just me.Sometimes the smallest thing will set me off. Ice cream! Everything is great! I love the whole world! So much energy I can't control myself! Oh wait, they're out of the flavor I wanted. Everything is terrible, mind immediately focusing on every bad memory it can come up with. There's nothing worthwhile left anywhere. Zero energy.Even I know I'm being ridiculous when it happens, but I don't know how to stop it.
This thread just makes me sad. It's not a good read on a Monday morning
Don't be too hard on yourself. Laughing is a social function, and seeing other people laugh might just make you kinda happy. Also it's just contagious sometimes.
Double oh
Aka customer service workers. 
"Why haven't you gotten out of bed in 30 hours.""really tired."
-Hey, you look tired! Are you sick or something? -I'm just not wearing make-up... 
My go to answer if people ask if everything is alright is just to say "I'm just tired".
there is no limit
ha..
I suffer from depression and I haven't read a book in years.  I used to read all the time but now I can barely finish a magazine article.  Hell, I even skim longer reddit posts.  It's just impossible to be interested or care.
Feeds nicely into the cycle too. I play videogames because I'm unhappy > I'm unhappy because I'm a failure > I'm a failure because I spend so much time playing videogames... etc.
check.
That also makes people like you more! If you're funny and always steer the conversation so people talk about themselves they won't notice the gaping chasm of darkness that you live on the edge of! 
I thought it was Mrs. Chanandler Bong
There's a podcast called the Hilarious World of Depression that hosts comedians to talk about their depression & mental illnesses... I had no idea how common it was until I scrolled through and saw most of my favorite comedians on there
This whole thread makes me feel so exposed
*WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH IT HAHA*
Only depressed people.  
I dunno how i feel about this. I used to be like that, the kind of person who kept it all inside. And that only meant that when shit pissed me off, i wouldnt bother telling anyone and everyone thought everything is okay. Now i complain. Not to everyone about everything, but to the right people about the stuff they understand. And it feels good. I feel less alone because i know that someone knows and will understand when i have a breakdown.
Robin Williams had Lewy Body Dementia. It was destroying his mind and judgement. He didn't kill himself out of depression.
I was a little worried for a while but now it makes sense. 
Introverts can be happy too. 
Thank you friend, you just explained away my momentary personal crisis.
I'm really sorry for your loss.
Similar thing happened to me - reached out for help and got ignored. Later told that they "didn't know how to react" so they did nothing.
It's weird, this is me too. I've never really thought about the fact that I do it hoping the other person will be there for me when the inevitable emotional breakdowns happen. More often than not, they aren't. Which is even more heartbreaking. Just goes with me needing to learn to look out for myself first and stop prioritizing others. 
I wish i was dead haha lol
.     . <--- Kill me now
Thanks Dr Professor
Lol that's fucked
The initial being so beyond not giving a fuck is kind of amazing. It's basically "I have *become* the Void. Whoa." And then eventually you realize literally nothing has any meaning to you anymore and nothing is worth doing. 
As someone who's been depressed, you are the best kind of friend, and we're thankful for people like you. 
Yeah. I always wrestle with focus issues and actually getting stuff done, but I've noticed a huge change it what constitutes 'easy' work. Depression makes loading the dishwasher or putting away a sheet of paper into an act of will, where without it it's pretty easy to go "huh, guess I should toss some stuff in the dishwasher".
Ya I mean I would describe myself as a happy person who is satisfied with my life, but my place is a mess. Not unsanitary, but just very very disorganized (or at least organized in a way that is only apparent to me. Ok who am i kidding it's a shitshow) I'm just busy and I don't like to halfway clean the place cuz when I start cleaning I go IN
I'll tell you what worked for me - crying. It sounds stupid, but I got the idea from Fight Club. I'm a 30 year old guy and I'd been holding everything inside, not letting anyone know how deeply depressed I was, until finally one day when I was on the phone with my mom I just broke down and started bawling like a child. It was freaking cathartic, like a weight was lifted for a few hours. And so I started my own version of "meditating" each day where I'd just let out everything I was holding inside. Might not be for everyone, but it's been quite effective for me.
I have SAD but some GAD as well. When my anxiety is up, even if I'm not anywhere it onsetting to some full blown attack, I put off things like this. I will wait to the last minute to pay a bill or even go through mail. They just seem like big tasks and I find myself avoiding them even though they are constantly on my mind. I hate it
You are a ray of sunshine in a rather depressing thread
Got to be able to pull it out the bag like it were natural. Never know when you'll need to cover
Watched it with my also depressed SO. Fuuuuck, that last season finale. 
Yeah, I went into that expecting something like an Archer spin-off, ended up with Californication but somehow infinitely more relate-able.
It reminds me that someone, somewhere out there feels the same things I do. And probably a lot of people actually. And makes me not feel as alone or broken. 
That hits home. My past wasn't amazing but I do look back on it very fondly. 
How does one act or seem happy in Britain?
Most people do hide behind it because a piece of them wants someone to acknowledge they're feeling down or feel concerned for them... but the other part of them is just like "Nah, you're being a whiny bitch. Just kid about it instead."
I didn't even know there are defined levels of depression. Do you know of any reliable sites where I can read about this?
That's my secret, they always knew me while I was unhappy, so they can't tell the difference!
Digitally disconnect and get out into nature. Take a walk in the woods.  Go hiking. Go camping.  I recently started this and it has done wonders for my anxiety/depression. :)
Me too... then I wake up
I have the whole not sleeping thing as well. I don't nap during the day, I just don't sleep very much.
I like dreams the best because for a moment I have a life I actually want to live. Plus there's space monsters.
I always hate it when I'm in a great mood all day and then I'm just... Not. Nothing happened, but I'm upset now. 
I'll RSVP but cancel at the last minute with some lame excuse why I can't make it.
*looks at time*I should get out of bed and ready for work. Maybe just one last Reddit thread...*reads title*"Oh fuck, here we go."
Uh oh spaghettios.
yeah, of life, that is!
Thread's top post has spoken, you are unhappy.
Because usually that's enough for people. When I'm depressed, I give this response and people usually say "Oh okay, cool." and leave it at that.I hate the idea of dragging other people down with my pointless shit. Doesn't help that I'm bipolar and it comes and goes at the drop of a hat.
-Hey you look like shit today! Are you sick or something?-I just put ON my makeup...
"You have dark spots under your eyes""Bitch I'm a panda"
h... 
Same. I used to read at least one novel a week. I haven't finished more than a a few chapters of any in the last 2 years.
Reddit is making me wish I could teleport all over the place, so many people here need good friends.
YAY!
Ha Ha me too.  I'm taking my pizza and my controller and getting the fuck out of here.
I'm just glad to hear there are others out there in this world just like me.
MISS Chanadler Bong
I searched that expecting to spend a long time scrolling through names. There are six episodes
they dont even have to be treated bad, the mind can fuck itself up pretty good. That's why it's so hard for some to understand where depression comes from, life is good to them but still they feel empty and disconnected.
2 threads down so far. I take nothing seriously and never get enough sleep. Fuck.
lack of nutrients may be linked to bad mood it is a vicious cycle haha
Not anymore, thanks to that other guy.  Shut it down, the happy people know.
I didn't know that, that's super sad :( 
Thank you for your kind words.
I really dislike people sometimes. I've gained massive trust issues because the day I reached out for help, I got cheated on and later dumped. "Too needy, I can't handle it." I just joke around now as a clown and try helping out whoever I can, but no one reaches out if you dont say anything memorable/significant, and I think I prefer it that way now. Sorry, I think I should have just posted this in r/offmychest
the thing is, that it makes me happy to make others a gift, or pay their meal, even tho not for long, every bit of happyness is a gift of god for me
That's *Mr* Dr Professor to you, sir.  
Well hello there perfect summation of my internal being.
You're a good boyfriend for trying to motivate her, even though in the moment she might resist or maybe even resent it. My roommate was such a positive force when I was deeply depressed for doing that; it makes a difference to know someone's looking out for you.
If you don't mind me asking, how did your mom react?
I can pull out the most genuine full-face smile you've ever seen and have it mean absolutely nothing. Heck, sometimes I fool myself.
It was TOO MUCH, MAN
Conversely if I look back on my past and think, "Well, I'll never accomplish anything like THAT again, never have good friends like THAT again, never hike the Milford Track again, never backpack solo through Europe again, never experience the rush of young love again . . . well then I'm probably doing the opposite of improving.  Oh, right.  This is what secret unhappiness looks like.
When someone nods at you and says 'Alright', you simply nod back and say 'alright'.You then pull your collar up to shield against the 30mph winds and horizontal rain and continue your pilgrimage to Bargain Booze and hope they havent sold out of the 'good' special brew or youre drinking paint thinner again tonight.
Same 
Very true! At first you'll think, "Great, now I'm just depressed but in the woods" and then you start moving. There are few things that can make you better and stay feeling better than going for a hike and just listening to some calm, cool music. Shoutout to sleepmakeswaves for being my official hiking soundtrack. 
Bought a fitness tracker thing that showed every night even when I'm 'asleep' for 8 hours I only actually get 3 hours of sleep a night, being exhausted doesn't help with anything especially emotions 
Go eat a lollipop you sad piece of shit. Love you.
I don't really wear make up anymore. It's hard to wash out of my beard. 
At least your boss is nice. He worries about his employees. Worth more than an MBa from Harvard. 
panda panda panda panda
...
You don't have to teleport, there are many just like them near you. Finding them is the problem. Also, you have a relevant username.
I want to die
I think you'll find it's Ms
This was a good place to do so
If I can't make myself happy, I try to make others happy. That helps somewhat.
Fucking right? I can at least get mad at sadness and try to fight it, self improvement to ward it off, use it as rage fueled motivation... But then i get tired, or i hit a snag, and decide fuck the world I dont need em until im a goddnma goddamn husk.
Look at this guy with all the time in the world. I liquefy it and inject it straight into my bloodstream.
Like the angel she is, she stayed on the phone with me while I cried about basically every aspect of my life for over an hour. She knew I'd been having a hard time (going through a divorce I hadn't wanted), but up till that point I'd been putting up a pretty good front and my family thought I was handling it far better than I was. I made an offhand comment about not engaging in self-harm only because I was a coward, and she packed up and drove four hours to come stay with me for the next few days. To be honest, I couldn't ask for better parents. 
It's all in squinting the eyes
Didn't you hear her new catch phrase? SUCK A DICK DUMB SHITS!
The fact that they skip over the entire funeral scene empathizes really well how out-of-touch Bojack is. Poor horsey.
Opens door for you - "cheers"Open next door for them - "cheers""cheers"
On the other hand, we're happy to tell a taxi driver our life story within seconds of meeting them.
Same, all they know is my fake happiness lmao
>Shoutout to sleepmakeswaves for being my official hiking soundtrack.  Fuck, I just listened to "It's Dark, It's Cold, It's Winter" and the tune just makes me sadder. Why are you listening to this
Bear in mind those fitness trackers have no idea when you're actually sleeping, they just see if you've stopped moving. If you toss and turn while asleep they'll count that as not being asleep. Similarly, if you lay really still when awake they'll count that as sleeping.
It's true. For someone who generally has no facial expressions my boss came by one day and said he was shocked he could tell that I wasn't happy today and that's a different look than he's ever seen from me. Hit home party hard. 
I'm gay
..
Very true, I've found maybe five or so but there's probably many many more.If you need anything, someone to talk to or something like that, my inbox is always open.
But I have lots of good ideas.. :(
That's the kicker. We see the pattern as it's happening it and just kind of watch it unfold time after time. Sucks but look at this thread. At least we're not alone 
Just 50 more years, mate :(
Also Chanandler, not Chanadler.
agreed. if I can't have happy myself, I might as well try and make someone else happy
I struggle with this a lot. Friends/co-workers /family can go on about how nice I am, and here I am brooding for the 1000th time over how shitty of a person I am because I don't think the things I do are for the right reasons.
Wow, I know exactly what you mean. It feels like your thoughts are shaped by sadness, yet there's no sadness and they appear with the sensation that there must be some kind of emotion to justify the negativity of the thought, but that emotion just isn't there. What's left is some kind of atrophied sensation that mourns the depart between thought and emotion, which I can only describe as emptiness.
When I called my mom and had that similar breakdown her voice got notably annoyed.  And when I said through a haze of tears "I'm just so unhappy..." her response was 'so what?  nobody is happy.'
My real last name is Bort. 
Me too cheers
Ah cabbies the nation's unsung therapists. 
Enough to stop the tears. 
I'm gay
. 
Exactly! Even when I do try to talk about myself they seem like they are only waiting for me to be done so they can talk about themselves again. Being a "good listener" really let's you see how self absorbed a lot of people are. 
That makes me very frustrated on your behalf. Sometimes we have to be proud of even our smallest accomplishments. When I'm too deep in my depression, I get pretty excited that I got out of bed, put clean clothes on, and maybe did some dishes.Absolutely be proud and maybe when you have some better days look for a new support group?
I'm sorry to hear that. Some mothers are better than others at...well...mothering. As my Mom keeps reminding me, I will still be her child no matter what age I am. 
Introduction. New meeting. My nipples still hurt cuz my baby started teething. 
*upward nod*Oh shit he's gonna fight me
I guess that rules out Johnson's.
I'm gay
So thats how you get a gold.
/r/unexpectedspongebob
I'm gay
Gotta admit it's one of the strangest instances I've gotten one for. No idea
I'm gay
Well, you did make a good point.
Gotta shake your butt or the device every few seconds if you're standing and talking (depending where it's mounted). One starts beeping everyone does a wiggle. They turn on when you turn on your SCBA tank.I'd never seen or thought of them in relation to 9/11. That's pretty chilling.
All the other last words, and then the Polish Airforce with just "fuck"
Found footage because it was recorded by the SOSUS listening network and nobody knew they had it until later.
When I was in a high school, a girl a little older than me was kidnapped from a mall near our house. She was walking to her car and these guys pulled up next to her in their car. One pointed a gun at her and told her to get in the car. She did, and what they did to her afterwards was horrific (she did not survive). My mom told me if that ever happened to me, to just refuse to go because it would be better to be hurt or killed right there in a parking lot than go through what that girl did.
He was apparently so creepy that, even though he won, the contestant refused to go on a date with him.
Well, he wasn't a corpse so I'd say that the ending was a happy one. 
That guy was kind of an idiot. I hate that his dumb choices were romanticized the way that they were.
same, reading this at 1am in Aus so I have to be careful. 
Hey! That's not found foot....oOhOHh. Yep
Thank you for mentioning this; I *really* shouldn't have listened to that audio, and reading about a bunch of firefighters rolling their eyes as they wiggle their butts to stop the noise was a funny distraction from it haha 
We use the word "kurwa" so much, we call it the comma.
Air New Zealand, stiff fucking upper lip right till the end!
This thread is too much
SINK RATE. PULL UP. PULL UP. PULL UP.
My philosophy is basically this, and this is something that I live by, and I always have, and I always will: Don't ever, for any reason, do anything, to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what, no matter where, or who, or who you are with, or where you are going, or where you've been, ever, for any reason whatsoever.
A common problem with people who are drowning, they panic and pull their would be savior under the water, drowning them too.
Glad you commented. Changed my mind about watching it myself.
"I'll just upload it to YouTube!"
Bud Dwyer if you haven't seen it yet. Much more upsetting as he was an innocent man saving his family from the burden of his guilty sentence.
Yeah. Pretty sure it's air escaping more than a willful groan at that point. 
Sociopaths yo
Yeah that was messed up. Zero remorse. No hesitation in their voice when talking about what they are doing. It's horrifying that a person can think like this. I hope these two boys are in prison.
It's Wisconsin man, we're the red headed redneck step child of the northern midwest.
Work for the sub manufacturer, they played it as part of orientation and during training every year.  Just the noise and simple text.  Scared the shit outta me.
Boss here, you're fired. 
Always have the angle going "up" so from the outside they can't look "down" between the blinds. 
Closed and locked. Also super creaky floors, and dogs. Don't come down my hall.. just take the TV and go. 
Yep. He created a drug cocktail to mess with there memories and released them. He only killed them if he felt it necessary.
And she had a slit throat... That's pretty dedicated for someone who was just "cheating"... What was the husband thinking?

They would also poison the children first. They knew that if the parents saw their kids dying that they would be more willing to kill themselves. 
You know what? I just got my Nintendo Switch and I'm having a fantastic day. I'm going to take your advice. In fact, I'm going to abandon thread. 
The coroners report stated that he shot himself, though disputed by others, and he was found to have a toxic level of barbiturates in his system 
Well... you're right. It is murder. But it's a specific kind of murder. It's like saying "strangulation" or "stabbing". It adds a detail.
That fucking music still terrifies me to this day.  I was kid when that was first on the air and got popular, and if Stack's voice wasn't enough, it was the music that scared the hell out of me.  I'm in my 30s now and I still won't listen to it.  
If someone ever pulls up to you in a car, run in the opposite direction. If they bother to flip the car around, you'll already be gone.
A bunch of panicked stampeding school children would have ruined *his* chances of getting off safely.   
I remember reading that divers had to recover the bodies in shifts of one body per diver, because it was emotionally too much to handle. One had to separate a boy and girl who were holding hands.  Their class went from 338 students to 88. It's one of those events that still gets me close to tears.
I hate when people say he was homeless. It's like they are trying to make it less terrible. They killed a good man. They lured him and tortured him while his family wondered where he was. 
Hello fellow bipolar bear
Ye I thought that was a little inappropriate 
If you were the guy who found them you'd definitely shit yourself. 
I feel like if I saw a scuba diver show up after 3 days I would think I was hallucinating.
No 
yeah could be but the article also says that people will use pirates as a cover for fucked up shit. 
I ignored your comment and listened anyways, and i feel stupid for doing so
Shit I had never heard about the failed pin attempts
Could be why folk tales warn people about leaving paths. might be a way to scare travellers who might be more scared of monsters than 'you might get lost' 
What makes it even creepier is that the outfit she has on is what he made her put on just before he murdered her. She was kidnapped whilst hitchhiking with a friend IIRC, and nobody hitchhikes in a dress and high heels. 
yeah, if you ever go to alaska don't bring him up.  They hate him, and that his brazen stupidity was glamorized.  There's been a few copycats since he died.
Wait they used video effects so well he had to prove he was alive? That's a professional job gg editors.  But iirc "dying" then coming back to life is very expensive and hard
Yep, I messed up twice already, thinking I am all tough and shit.
I thought the same thing I'm so relieved
I believe it was because there were two tracks, and a train was passing on the other track at the time, so they probably assumed the noise was from that train instead of the one they didn't see.
THAT DOESN'T MAKE A GOOD MOVIE
We were taught to just calm down, take a deep breath and dive or "sink" if a person panics during a rescue, they are not going to follow you down. It's possible this is a "pool only" solution to the problem.
The video of Dwyer is still with me today, after seeing it back in high school about 15 years ago. It will always be with me. What a gruesome thing it was. It haunted me for months after. 
"Shes gotta die hahahahaha". Wow. Those are some messed up individuals. 
They are, the one seems genuinely remorseful, the other one, even though he talked about how much he enjoyed doing the murder on the tape before and after, still maintains his innocence.
why do I have the feeling that your username is exactly what bosses would have 
Can I have the TV instead? No need to let a criminal take it. 
They still have no idea how many he killed though. The whole thing is a horrific mystery.
"now's my chance!"
All of this just proves the world isn't a calm and safe place, though. This whole thread proves that. I hope everyone going through here stays safe. Y'all travel with friends, carry mace or a pocket knife or something. Sick people are out there and you sometimes have to rely on yourself to survive. :/ 
Many protested - asking Jim Jones why couldn't they just pack up and head to Russia as was discussed as a possibility numerous times.
That's how one guy survived 
If this was at a mall I'd run back into the fucking mall and take my chances. If I played my cards right I'd be in a fitting room while someone called the cops.
Wait what? No way
Well I hope that year or so of living he got before being sentenced to life in prison was worth it. 
I like to imagine him as a very fit Mr. Bean.
If you're in deep water, no big deal. Boats at sea can have a tsunami pass right under them and it just seems like a large swell. It's when it reaches land that all that water and force has to go somewhere.
Isn't that what makes tsunamis so dangerous?  Unless you know the warning signs by the time you realize you're in danger it's too late.
Actually they killed about 15 people including a pregnant woman and recorded all of them, this was the only one that managed to get leaked from the police department
I think I was 16 or 17 when I saw it. It was being shared around in my social circle as an entertaining 'look how dumb/stupid/fake this is'. I didn't learn that it wasn't fake until this past year... 
My mom always says that if someone gets in your car and tells you to drive somewhere, try to crash the car on their side. Kill or be killed 
plus they are a lot more likely to get caught if they kill you in the middle of the street.
As I recall, the diver that found him did get pretty startled. He said something to the effect of thinking he found another body in the water and when he reached out they guy grabbed back at him. Probably a pretty surreal moment.
That guy's mental state was probably  close to that. Three days in total darkness, nearly silent, and no real way to orient yourself. I dont think i could ever imagine how long thkse three days must have felt.
I agree with this statement. It is factually correct.
Out of everything I can imagine that man went through, the worst for me would be the not knowing if you were going to be rescued or not. Not knowing what time of day it was, where you are, how far down you are, do people know yet?It's scary that it's possible people have survived plane crashes doing this exact thing, and they were never found.  Imagine dying, alone, at the bottom of the ocean with the hope someone was going to find you?
They were barracudas, not sharks. Still horrifying though. 
Considering how rough and small that overturned boat is, I'm inclined to think they were pirates, too. Probably tried to intercept the fleet, but was capsized for whatever reason.
Sounds to me like something that happens when it's dark and you're panicked
I buy bright pink and orange flagging tape. I got lost once and that was enough for me.
In that case he was very healthy 
Not only did he force her to put the outfit on he had also just cut off her hair as a souvenir. 
> (he murdered multiple people, not just her)did he take pictures of all of his victims or was it literally just her?
His major problem was that he didn't bring a fucking map. If he did he would have realized there was a bridge to get over the river fairly close to him. That dude is basically a prime example of why you should never let romanticism override common sense. Good movie though...
Yep people have to get rescued from hikes to the site every summer. 
As they were filming the shot, the camera accidentally fell along with the fake body they threw out a window. It looked like a suicide tape.BTW: Nine Inch Nails is a pretty good band if you're ever interested.
I keep my mouse safely on the scroll bar in threads like these.
I'd say decomposing into the soil is a pretty solid connection to Nature
"Oh fuck! /u/friedhamwallet, March 3, 2017...I'm out!"
Yep, and also kick the shit out of them if they're endangering you. Worst case scenario you knock them unconscious, and then they're easier to rescue anyway.
When my friend and I got caught in one, all of the other people boogie boarding were yelling at us to swim diagonally. I listened to them, since it meshed with what I knew already. My friend didn't hear them or something, so he just kept getting swept along. Luckily there was a lifeguard at the beach that saw him. 
The way the blood just *pours* out of his nose once he falls to the floor is something that I would have thought was overdone if I had seen it in a movie.
The "I'm getting horny thinking about it" was disturbing to me. What the fuck. These are the type of crimes that make the death penalty hard to get rid of. There's no chance they are innocent. 
I remember that kid who keeps saying he is innocent and even his parents say he is innocent and blame the other kid. It's interesting in children who murder, because normally one has sociopathic tendencies and the other is a follower who latches into whatever grand plans the other has. It was clear that the one guy who feels remorseful and absolutely devastated by his actions now is the follower and I think he even says in one of the tapes I watched that he needs to live his life for Cassie. But the other just refuses to take any responsibility and that's even scarier.
I mean, he hid it so well. In a parking lot. Who would ever check the surrounding area? /s
Can I take the creaky floors? No need to listen for thieves with no TV.
I couldn't read all of it but in the first parts he discussed how easy it was to constantly do it, and details about previous kidnappings. If truthful, terrifying. 
That's one of the most interesting parts of this audio. There is the lady who is like "hey guys, maybe we could not do this..." and the rest shut her down and then they do it. Bizarre. 
>  "kool-aid"It was flavoraid. The Kool-aid Man had nothing to do with this.
Use this one simple trick to get parents to kill themselves! 
I can't find the source for this. Rolling Stone says Odell escaped by faking to go back for medical equipment, that Stanley escaped by faking checking for poison survivors until he saw an escape, two runners are too old for me to find their stories, and then some escaped via Leo's truck or by Jones' order
Captain also told people to stay in their cabins
Yes, the president had a top advisor who was from a cult. There are some theories that the response to the ferry was deliberately poorly managed to offer the children as a sacrifice for the cult.
Obviously it's not his fault in any way, but to be honest I might do the same in his situation.  I couldn't imagine the unbearable guilt and despair.  
Wasn't even a year. He and 14 crew members were arrested that same week.
Yeah, a lot of people don't realize this. There's a video somewhere on Youtube that is supposed to be of a boat going over the Japanese tsunami way out to sea, but the comments are full of people not believing it because it just looks like a really big swell. 
And the crabs look up and think "whew the fish are really flying today."
Often even then, depending on your surrounding geography.
Yeah.... There's nothing fake looking about it. Honestly tho it's the sounds that bother me
That explains my last uber trip
And if you're struggling it'll likely be a lot more sloppy, hopefully leaving some sort of trail. If they're able to take their time they'll be super careful.
Can you imagine being the guy on the boat for three days?! He could only assume he was going to die.
I remember from the interview he gave shortly after getting rescued that he said it wasn't silent. He could hear sharks and crabs scavenging the dead bodies on the wreck. That sounds 10000% worse than silence to me.
That's really good information in case I'm ever trapped in a pocket of air in the ocean. 
Oooooooh, barracudas
The guy talking is on the surface watching a monitor, but the diver is surprisingly calm as well. I remember reading that Harrison had seen the light of the diver pass by in the hallway outside the room he was in, and he then proceeded to grab the arm of the diver. Imagine diving inside a wreck you are sure is filled with dead people only to be grabbed  by someone from behind. I would have shit and pissed myself to death. 
During an interview with the guy he says he could hear sharks below swimming around and rummaging/eating. I'd probably try to drown myself just to escape the terror of being in the dark with apex predators
Sounds more like 1 girl trying the pin on the other girls phone (because the latter one is unconcious?)
This is all just incredibly eerie....
He actually had a habit. He would pick them up, tie them up, cut their hair, make them wear the same outfit (or similar I forget), then take pictures of them before killing them.
If youre going to do some serious frontiersman shit, wouldn't you have learned that simply following alongside a river can tend to lead you to a settlement of some sort?I also heard that he poisoned himself because he harvested and ate the entire Eskimo Potato plant when part of it is actually not safe to eat, especially in the large quantities he ate it in.
I could see that, when I read it i thought he came off as somebody who thinks he's way smarter than he is.  
*sigh*OP had one job, username and subreddit. Can't even do that right when they're dying. GGWP OP. 
Worst case they start consciously fighting you
This is fucking ganster and they never taught this method in lifeguarding class. But good thinking on the fly. whatever works works.
I was planning on shooting myself one day and was watching videos of it to see what my family would find. After Dwyer I couldn't do it. I couldn't let my parents find me in that much blood. It put me off long enough to eventually get a little help and now I'm healthy and hopefully never to be in that position 
Can I take the dogs? I love dogs. 
It gets way, way worse than that.
Because they had run numerous previous fake trial runs before. They would wake people in the middle of the night, get them to take fake cyanide, and then severely punish those who refused. Over and over again. They would have people act as if they were resisting, or trying to escape to gain helpers, then punish anyone who went along with it. The psychological fuckery was extensive and devastating.
He would have sensed so many people drinking Kool-aid and burst through the wall, saving everyone.
IIRC on the Jonestown documentary they interview a girl who remained still on the floor hoping she wouldn't get shot in midst of a shootout next to a plane. The incident happened parallel to the people being fed the poison within the Jonestown complex, although the girl wasn't part of Jonestown she was just visiting along with some politicians who got assaulted when they tried to escape, I think.
Are fish the birds of the sea to crabs?
I'm on the East Coast of the US so we are lower risk for tsunami.  But I'd be lying if I said I didn't check my height above sea level after the Japanese Tsunami.Fortunately due to the Appalachians and where I live I'm 222 feet above sea level despite being only 19 miles from the ocean.  And honestly if I have to worry about tsunami flooding at that height we have far bigger problems.
That's how the whole city felt, so proud of her for fighting back. Everyone believes he would have sexually assaulted her if she had she not fought so hard. Mickey refused to be give up till the very end. There's now a "ghost bike" memorial downtown and a bike loop around the city for safer bike riding in her memory.
And DNA everywhere
The thing that really got me was imagining the darkness.  Not just the alone underwater for 3 days...doing it in pitch black...only to have a light just turn on suddenly.  He for sure was blinded, but you can clearly see in the video that those eyes are seeing god.
Aren't we all just trapped in a pocket of air in an ocean, really?
Ya this is the much better video. Finding bodies as a diver must be a pretty terrible job, but to suddenly have one of them grab your arm must have been absolutely insane.
I imagine it was body recovery so that guy has seen some shit. Doesn't make it any less terrifying though.
Did he know they were sharks because of the music?
Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse.......
Youre kinda glossing over the weeks spent in the back of his truck cab being tortured and raped.
Nah, worst case is probably a gamma ray burst from a nearby galaxy washes over and vaporizes Earth at the speed of light 
I'm glad you're doing better, friend
Amid all the morbid stuff, your comment made me chuckle 
that is literally one of the first places the police look for the killer. they ask for volunteers to help find the victim/body and take a list of everyone who helps and use that as a "suspect list" 
I read until the dog part and regret it so so hard. Please tell me that's the worst part.
>Aren't we all just trapped in a pocket of air in an ocean, really?--Jaden Smith
True story. When I was about 10 and my sister was 6 we were at the beach. I said something about being afraid of sharks and my sister says "Don't worry. There aren't any. The duh duh... duh duh... duh duhhhh music isn't playing." One of the funniest things I've heard that came totally random. 
all i wanted was a pepsi
It's like a cheesy single player cutscene
It truly is a heroic show of engineering
The ex-boyfriend in Making a Murderer gave me a really bad vibe for exactly this reason. He was way too gung-ho to help the cops.
You really can't blame yourself for crazy events like that. The twin towers would have never been knocked down on 9/11 if the architect never designed them but no one makes that connection because it's completely absurd. Existence is chaos, you can't control what happens to something or someone down the road just because you interacted with it on your own journey.
My daughter is 11, has never seen Jaws, is probably only vaguely aware it exists, has never heard 'the shark music', yet when we're in a pool (and this goes back a few years even)  if I would swim toward her doing 'the shark music' she would freak out.
Did you not read the Daily Beast article?Looking at those imgur pics, if that gully flooded they'd be toast. One of them survived for 10 days at least. This is in no way foul play. It was a major storm the day they went out. A flash flood is also not out of the question.And, they were in tank tops and jean shorts, nothing else. Even in the tropical jungle you can die of exposure/hypothermia.
Its also possible the pictures were being taken because one of them was out of it. Lack of water can cause people to become delirious and what were seeing is photos taken by someone who was hallucinating. But its the southern jungles so it could have been an animal stalking them considereing most animals are not active till night when the photos were taken.
Its also good medical training. Dont ever let a patient know how fucked they are if you can avoid it.   Will to live is a powerful thing. 
> Existence is chaos, you can't control what happens to something or someone down the road just because you interacted with it on your own journey.Well said.
I was thinking tripped on rocks/twisted ankle before the 911 call.  The picture of hair was checking a head wound I bet.
for anyone that doesn't get it..basically no more 'clean' left and right movement so much as sliding on ice kind of movement and rotationand when 'most' of a line is formed soon as it is the game freezes and 'cuts' the line ..so pieces often don't get 'cut' as nice clean squares..but instead you get awkward triangles and other fragments still on the field...which can lead to unusual comboes
>Close Your EyesI try to play this every night.
I'd even pay for it if it were on Steam.
The learning curve menaces with spikes of iron.
And for those who didn't know, you have to play it through a second time, because once you've beaten the game once it lets you go through and listen to various hilarious tapes scattered throughout the game

As a long-time Metroid fan, AM2R is *exactly* the game I wanted. It feels refined, the controls are great, the atmosphere is fantastic(it does some interesting stuff with lighting the 2D metroid didn't do), and it just does Metroid "right".
And much like Diablo 2 and three it has three tiers of difficulty, The frist tier is just to let you get a feel for the game, the second starts to make you realize, where you put those points for skills matters, and the third tier will punish you hard if you havent.
I've learned from reddit that if you press f you can go faster than the ass hole sasquach who eats you... I never got past that stupid sasquach as a kid
It's fun until you die N1 as investigator to vet :(
SpaceEngine is the most AMAZING thing in the goddamn world, and free. I fucking *adore* SpaceEngine. Oh my God, how is this game not famous?
This game is so good it blows my mind. And the community is by far one of the best. I played Assassin's Creed and Prototype and multiple combat flight simulators and I can say 100% confidently that *none* of them have given me the same feeling of speed, freedom, and poise that the Warframe controls do. You wanna be a goddamn ninja? Play this game. 
Pokemon showdown is the best thing online right now IMO
Yep. Played it exclusively for years. A real shame.  I've left it behind now as getting a good scrap on Miller is nigh-on impossible. The second it hits a Bio-Lab, game over. Join in the stale-mate grind or leave. 
Loved ET. Played far too much as suicide engi trying to get the obj done.
Warframe patch coming this weekRead>Warframe patch coming next week[DE]layed.
The game still has a suprisingly high number of people playing after all these years
NICE TRY SEAN MURR-Oh wait ENDLESS Sky.
World of Warships is amazing, especially considering it came from the same company that made world of tanks.
*neon synth intensifies*
Just play bard and mute all. Impossible to be mad
If only they'd just stopped working on it
Dota 2 is also authentically free to play, instead of the freemium pay4advantage model.
Just watch out that multiplayer isn't always the most enjoyable experience. Singleplayer is amazing though.
I've been saying for a while now that with a bit more marketing and promotion Smite could be a really popular game. Engaging gameplay, 80+ gods, several modes, and entertaining skins makes it really easy to get hooked. Not to mention it costs nothing to play!
I pressed 123 but I never got my gf
God the soundtrack in that game is so fitting, I still tear up a little when I listen to it. Such a great story!
I actually really like singleplayer; pretty depressing with no bandits or other players, but sometimes I like it that way.
Quality kek
Thread Dead Redemption
Everything. BF2, 2142 and all DLC.Best bit, there are a lot (relative) of populated servers world wide. 
I think EA turn a blind eye. In fact, i think some of the guys behind it were in the Sir community, a mod maker for BF2 and community partner. 
I also heard that he programed the software to make the music, because no other software had the sound he wanted. Thats why some of the music has off time signatures mixed with 4/4. The music is definitely up there in the top 5 best soundtacks of all time.
I think ti-86 outnumbers even Android sales by at least 2:1, so don't feel bad.
We could use more players.
How the fuck did I not know this existed 
> Open Your Eyes> I try to play this every morning.-My grandmother.
Didn't you see the darkness in your own soul? The crushing weight of reality? Trippy images of your inner demons? ... doesn't everyone see this? :( 
The player is on the ground, surrounded by dwarves. The player is crying. The dwarves are laughing.
My legendary engraver has an obsession with the disappearance of the old expedition leader.  He draws things like Dwarves surrounding him and him laboring.  Must be very emotional about it, because all of his masterpieces are about the subject.  I like to think it's because my Dwarves are making up theories as to why he disappeared, and the engraver just wants to celebrate his life.  In reality, the expedition leader was just dumb enough to stand under a drawbridge I was testing, which really sucks because he was useful.
I'd recommend looking at the /r/dwarffortress sidebar.
>because once you've beaten the game once it lets you go through and listen to various hilarious tapes scattered throughout the gameI thought I was insane! I had my friend play through it after I did, and she kept finding all these tapes and asking me about them. I had no idea and couldn't figure out how I could have missed them the first time around
Yeah, but player character is too OP after they get the tranquiler. And it needed more vehicle segments. Overall: game is the best.

Yet another chinese ebrbrbrbrbrbqake
What got me was my friend explaining:"It's a futuristic space station where every job is a player, including you. The players just try to keep it running, which goes downhill really fast."I'm paraphrasing, but then that got me interested in his stories.
Haha, I'm a few months in and I'm loving it
It seems to be powered by some sort of electricity.
It is what you make it. If you want to be top dog then yes, it can become very much like a job but otherwise it can be a lot of fun.
Sort of.  It lets you get up to the third sized ships (frigates, destroyers, and cruisers) and only of your chosen race.  Where subbed players can train skills to fly any race.  But there is a ton of content and action that will be available to alpha (f2p) players.  I know most corps/alliances have plans to entice newbros to join them and show them the ropes.  I would recommend checking out faction warfare where those size ships make up 90% of fleets.  
To me, OFF was like an adventure game with the mechanics of an RPG. The actual combat and puzzles themselves were never really the main point, they're there to give the game progression and to immerse you in the setting / game world.
Cause it's not really much of a game
Yeah, the game was really fun.I kept waiting for more levels and guns or anything really.  Turns out there was nothing more coming :(

Good concept, bad design. Even when it was populated; getting into an actually contested fight was a miracle. 95% of the time it's either Zerging or being Zerged.
I just join some public platoons when I play, usually there is one or two that gives you organized objectives. You can also mute the inherent weirdos and annoying people.
You get most characters unlocked, but be aware that 2K announced Evolve's F2P transformation was "completed" in the past week or two.. Meaning they've taken control of the game away from Turtle Rock Studios and it likely won't ever be patched or content updated again. I don't know if they ever even finished setting up microtransactions, so I don't think it will last despite a huge player influx when it first went F2P. 
vanilla.tfCommunity servers with stock maps.
But... all the scenes are already disabled...
You can always turn a normal gf into a crispy bacon gf if you really want to
Emi is best, but it was the Lilly route (specifically the good end) that made me cry ugly.
My only complaint is that it's nearly impossible to find a vanilla server nowadays. All the servers with people in them have all kinds of mods and shit to where the game is just like L4D- unlimited ammo, lots of guns, etc... even turned friendly-fire off, and make it so you can't get infected and die like that. makes the game piss-easy since the game isn't balanced for being primarily a shooter. also, just who the fuck plays anything with unlimited ammo? I loved L4D1. i just don't want NMRiH to try to be that.... it's cool and unique, but it's a waste to try to replicated left4dead. 
They outsourced its development, and by the time they realized what was happening, too many people fucking loved it.Soon as Warships came along, I abruptly abandoned the Tanks account I'd sunk four years and thousands of dollars into. Warships is just so crazily better in every single aspect.
I started Warthunder as an arcade player myself which is ok for air battles if you just want to fire away,but for tanks it's realistic or nothing imo. Also air rb is waaaay more rewarding and fun once you get into it not being like arcade. There is no other feeling like winning a 1v1 with the odds against you and using most of your ammo,only to see another enemy pop up 4km out and 1km above you while you got about 40 rounds of 20mm left. Gives you the kicks if you got the will to actually try your best.
Don't forget Ivern and Braum! Just listen to their voice lines all day :)
Srsly tho if you have friends to play with its just a good game.
He's back, and still #1 (with some competition now).
Is it really free to play, if you pay with your soul?
:v ?Notice the space in between the question mark and the v. Every fucking time.
Yeah man, i'd agree.1600 hours on Dota 2, I'm 6 months clean though. 
PvE probably remedies problems you had.
It only gets worse from there, believe me.
Well, my teenage years are back! Bf2 special forces and 2142s titan mode are the most fun I've ever had with online multiplayer. 
I guess it all depends on if EA is still selling battlefield 2 and 2142.
Never had a game where literally every single song I listen to is my new favorite song in a videogame. The art, music, and story are so spot on I can't believe the guys name hasn't been on any more games the Cave Story. Though I don't follow Pixel, I just haven't heard *anything* about him since Cave Story.
I doubt there are 2 billion ti86s sold but probably more ti86s than windows phone

Yeah, I was reading about that. Every time the cats licked themselves to clean themselves they drank alcohol, but the game counted each lick as a full drink so the cats were getting hammered.

Pls no I dont want to be turned into a baby farm
It's free, pay attention!
What the fuck.. this game sounds really weird/great. I'm downloading now. I'm going to be pissed if cool shit like this doesn't happen. 
but doesn't multithread (unless it changed recently)
You are going to need more than today to learn it. You need to come in probably 3 weeks worth of time and even then still probably had significantly more investment to go.
"I finally figured out how to build stuff, how the crafting works, what my dwarves need, how to build a hallway full of cage traps, etc.  I've got enough beds for everyone, everybody's happy because I have plenty of diverse food and booze and statues and shit.  There's no way this fortress could fall, I pretty much beat the game."

It did. you can almost see the outline of Eve Online behind dwarf fortress
They fixed the Tiger cheese though, props, that made speedrunning hilariously easy.
That was when they cemented the fact that they can make anything hilarious as dicks.

It's like, 10 minutes of doing your job, and an hour and a half of putting out metaphorical fires.
I've tried to download this but it was extremely overwhelming to just jump in... Is there some kind of guide or video lets play or something that you would suggest on learning the basics? 
It happened in Toronto a few years back when it rained and then the temperature dropped, freezing everything. It snapped alot of power lines and my neighbourhood (sub urban area in GTA) was out for almost a week. Not a impossible thing to happen
Oh yeah, when you had a fight that was small, like ~16 v ~16 it was really amazing.
The problem was I was tired of the stock maps and there were some community designed ones I liked which started to fade out. Can't really recall the names. Plus I don't have the game on my laptop anymore and I barely see my gaming PC. But I might try it again when I have time. 
oh for fuck's sake
Why would somebody play computer games at work (unless they're self-employed)
Lilly route is simply best route. It's a sweeping romantic epic. 
Yep. Nobody should be able to copyright something so vague.
I just started playing it about a week ago. I can't get enough already in tier 5 ships for every country except Russia. My friend says it's not a huge accomplishment because now getting new ships is so much of a grind.

You never get over the learning curve.
Wait, so your telling me that this game simulates the cats licking themselves and actually checks the floor they are on to see if they ingest anything? After that the game also checks how much  alcohol the cats have accidently licked to see if it gets alcohol poisoning? How do the devs think of this?!?!
Is that something that produces a lot of babies, or a very small farm created when two farms expand to have a common border?(I don't play Dwarf Fortress, but judging by the things I've read here and other places about it, either of these seem about as likely.)
It'll happen, but it'll take you a while to understand it and make it happen.  There's a quickstart guide on the wiki, you'll need it.
It didn't. Still, if you reduce the amount of dwarves and regularly clean up behind those ungrateful, drunk, stinking, vomitting, brawling, singing, tantruming,... bastards, it's not much of a problem.
To be fair 3 weeks is a bit much. IMO you can learn how to get a simple fortress running in a couple of days. Then theres the bazillion things you can do on top of that but as you know you'll never be able to try them all.I can recommend captnducks and 51ppycups tutorials on youtube
Twist: Urist Wallfloors's wife is also the most well-liked dwarf in the fort.... and she's just decided to die of melancholy in response to his passing, so you've lost two for the price of one, and the source is still on the loose. Your dwarves don't have Discipline, so they can't bring themselves to bury the bodies, and the sight of the dehydrated wife's corpse in the dining hall is giving everyone really bad thoughts.Have fun!
here comes another chinese earthquake
Read the wiki, play as assistant. If  you have questions, feel free to PM me!
Also the reason why scumbags like me exists in EVE is because the universe allows (encourage) it. I left EVE for a while and when I saw the Butterfly effect trailer I realized how much I miss that. Haven't touched EVE in like 4 years. A little too involved for a subscription game. Maybe I'll go back when it's free to play (although I expect some heavy restrictions/quality drop after that.
Dude, I've been playing for three years and I don't know what I"m supposed to do either.

Just built a new computer , spent just a staggering amount of money on parts and peripherals, still playing dwarf fortress. Computer still gets single digit FPS eventually.

There is nothing worse than watching a necromancer resurrect every singly bit of that goblin you cut to bits earlier.   I once had a Dwarf get strangled to death by a disembodied hand.
I think he was talking about mermaid farms, I haven't played much but mermaid bones are very expensive so people started making mermaid farms and killing baby mermaids to sell bones. It was patched out obviously.

Trouble is DF is still single threaded. It can't make use of a fancy new CPU. 
and only one programs
It would be amazing if they could make an interface for it.
'syndromes' are basically how DF handles buffs/debuffs (e.g. there is a syndrome for being drunk)
That no pc has survived.Why do they keep asking about crysis?
People have had dwarves strangled by *their own* disembodied hands.
Toady was actually so disturbed by the mermaid farms he changed the value of mermaid bones unfortunately.
Which ones? The new manager actually makes it really simple to set up most of them. I now have beekeeping, soaping, and paper making fully automated. All my cloth is being dyed different colours. My roasts mostly consist of dwarven sugar, cave wheat, quarry bushes and turkey eggs. Setting these things up was really, really simple with the new work orders. You basically just have to build a couple of every workshop and then you don't even need to worry about where it's actually taking place.
mama mia papa pia, baby got the diarrheee^eeee^^eeeee^^aaa
Yeah, but it's finally 64-bit now....
What does the other do, design the game's cutting edge graphics?
There is a reason for that. The current UI is temporary.Toady is worried that if he spends too much time working on it now, he'll just have to change it again later or re-do it when he adds new things he hasnt thought of yet.The UI is on the dev-list, but practically last on it.
I once had a legendary axe dwarf rip apart a troll with her teeth for some reason.  In the same invasion, a troll kept trying to kill a kitten, who kept dodging and eventually managed to dive into the troll, making him fall into a rock trap which ended up breaking his leg so the kitten got away. That was a clowny fort.
That's how you know he was actually disturbed by it.  If he wanted to balance it he'd just make other races disgusted or something. He just wanted that shit gone
They would go insane. That's why you have mist dance from the ceiling. It's the best way to grow up as a well balanced adult. 
Brutality and humor, jammed into a very confined space and asked to live together as bosom buddies until both explode into orgiastic psychotic glee. (You haven't lived until you've understood the *necessity* of kitten biscuits to the proper operation and maintenance of a long lived fortress.)...or maybe it's just one of the more simulationist fantasy games I've ever seen, belied by its graphical simplicity.
It's hard to think of insane details like the cat thing while you're promgramming your other insane ideas. I'd imagine that's where the other guy comes in
I DIDN'T have mist dancing from the ceiling. I wonder if that explains the way I am.
That shard of reality was retconned, and no longer exists. We do not speak of it.Modern cats are much less likely to consume alcohol in amounts likely to annihilate the liver of a dwarf.

Golfball sized chunks of hail punctured it's wings and sent it towards the Arctic Ocean. It'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''s disappearance caused widespread controversy, with many people questioning how we could lose such a massive bird in this day and age. Some feathers, measuring 45 feet in length, were reported to have been found at the North Pole, though experts say that there is no way to identify which giant bird it belonged to.

Funny thing about never dying of old age and just getting bigger, is that you start being unable to find enough food to sustain yourself and eventually starve to death.
Though one could theoretically hook a lobster up to a feeding apparatus that pumps the necessary nutrients right into its mouth. It gets bigger and bigger and bigger over the years, and we harvest its flesh which then grows back over time.It'd be a relatively cheap source of lobster meat, all things considered. And it'd seriously cut down on overfishing if we found a way to do that to other animals.

I mean male Angler Fish are basically 100% cock, in a way- they're about 1/30 the size of the females and when they find a mate they latch onto her and their entire body gets absorbed into her, regularly depositing sperm so she can fertilize her eggs.

It's more a matter of a certain animals' genetics that dictate whether they grow endlessly or stop at a certain point. Besides, most animals don't have a concept of dieting.

When you buy Artorias' armor in the untended graves, it reads:"The twilight blue tassel is damp, and will ever remain so.". It's not a far stretch that something tainted with the Abyss would be permanently wet if has a connection to the sea.Having a dark sea conflict with the first flame would be a fitting contrast, too.
It's more the fact that you're going even more into a hole under water with limited air supplies exploring whatever beasts lurk among the sands and rocks. One mistake and you're hiccuping water. Dead. You're fishfood now. No one finds you ever again until your unfortunate bones are found well rested under some sand 1000+ years from now, your soul tormented, restless, unable to be set free, wandering the dank dark sea floor until you can finally be put to rest.

Accurate in the NT. In 30 odd years, I can count on one hand the amount of times I've seen people swim in the ocean up here. Aside from the occasional netted swim comp with lifeguards and everyone wearing 'stinger suits', so they don't die an agonising death from Box Jellies.Not that that'll help with the crocs.. 
I know right? These damn people with no jet skis would never understand those of us WITH jet skis.
I don't know what's more horrifying, a lopster eating me, or a lopster reproducing with me.
This movie seriously traumatized me as a child.
I can only think of one character in the last 30 episodes. It was a wild stoutland who was sick and being taken care of by a wild Litten. Ash occasionly ran into them and helped out. Eventually the stoutland disappeared and no one could find him. After litten searched he saw a cloud  in the shape of stoutland along with a tree losing the last of it's leaves, implying the realization that stoutland left to find a place to die.Litten ended up staying with Ash as he was the closest thing he had to a friend besides stoutland.

Yup. Salties can lurk in freshwater rivers, on the beach or even catch ocean currents and travel hundreds of kilometres. Surprisingly active beasties. Most people stay out of the ocean, so we don't get too many attacks there. (Though a kite surfer got attacked a few years back). We usually lose a few people a year, fishing in the rivers/creeks. Usually get ya while leaning over the side, retrieving lures on the banks or they'll just overturn the boat.

To be fair, if I had plenty of money, I might do it.  Have you ever tried an entry level, but decent, peaty scotch and coke?  Say Laphroaig quarter cask?  Smokey and delicious.  One of the best highballs around.  That'll run you around $70 (Canadian).  I wouldn't spend more than that, because past that price point it wouldn't make a difference.  But add the coke, and divide by the number of 1oz drinks you can make out of it, and you're spending anout $2.80 a drink.  That's better than at most bars.

I'm really not a tea person but when I was a Starbucks employee and teavana was introduced in store to replace tazo, a lot of people were really unhappy.

Nothing wrong with having rose hairs, regardless of how much experience you have. Don't need to fix what's not broken.
As a good friend of mine said: I get all my sex gear from Bunnings (Australian hardware store).
And people are passionate as fuck about stuff I'd never give a second thought about, like knitting needles.
Yeah, I'm more boring than I thought 
Do you mean watches from Gucci, Dior, etc. ?
And their HDMI cables, Jesus $100 for an HDMI cable? It's sad people fall for them 
MMA gloves in a boxing/Muay Thai gym
Eh, I like my stupid glowing keyboard. 
Do you mind explaining why? I've been thinking of buying a tent. 
I always thought it was intended as a luxury line, you know, him being him. 
Oh, you mean "check out this ancient thing from my family that you can't buy anymore" show and tell? 
While I agree that Rubik's brand cubes don't come close to real speed cubes, I'd call the real Beats of the speed cubing industry V-Cube. Their cubes are low quality, and ridiculously overpriced. Beyond that, they use their vague patents to take advantage of other cube companies that actually have much better cubes with designs that are not vert similar.
Every HR rep everywhere: Must know big data methods Must have 10 years experience with databases Get to the job and it's an Excel workbook with 60 columns, only a third of which are imported into SQL Server. And yet, somehow, we still didn't get a DBA who could manage it for almost 3 months.
What the fuck does anyone need a 120# bow for?! I can hardly get past the break point on a 75# bow and the guy who owns it shoots elk with it.

A lot of makeup in general lately seems to be more of a competition on how much you spent on your makeup rather than how you look. I've been complimented on my eyeliner, then scoffed at when I tell them it's NYC liquid eyeliner. Bitch, I look fantastic and I spend $2/tube on this shit and it lasts me MONTHS.
Good one.  I only care about boutique pedals if they're some crazy thing that has no equivalent in cheaper mass-produced pedals, like those crazy Mid-Fi Electronics pedals that sound like a tape recorder dying, or ones that recreate a pedal that's not produced anymore like the BeeBaa or something.  But yeah, more often than not it's like... dude, this is just a distortion pedal.

It is. When both jobs blend so well.
A lot of officers get differently colored cuffs so theirs don't get mixed up with other officer's cuffs. 
There are schools who give out stripes for each license the kids get.  (Like, one for private, a second one for the instrument rating, a third for commercial, etc.)  Usually any school where the students have to wear anything you could put epaulets on is a place to avoid like the plague. 
My problem with Teavana is that to differentiate the tea they're all herbals, florals or fruit teas to some extent. And then the decent "pure" teas are expensive.

Is that what I was doing wrong? I was using their app to brush up on my high school and college German, and I was disturbed by how it didn't explain the conjugations; it just throws them at you in sentences. I never looked at the website. 
For me pimsleur is the best way to learn, I pick things much quicker with its method, and the pronunciation does get very good and fluent.

Hobby subs are why I'm here. The news subs are toxic, the funny ones are still humorous, but have lost a lot of their originality...  But I'm big into my hobbies and it's cool to find other people that are into them too. For example, my fiance and I just got into growing succulents. She's mad for them recently. One of the first things I did was type /r/succulents to see what would pop up. And what do you know, an active community of succulent enthusiasts.  I've done this for every hobby of mine and I love it. 
Saw a car with a bumper sticker that said something along the lines of "Don't mess with me, because one day I'm going to be your nurse". Shit, lady, I think if you have a bumper sticker like that, they should automatically blacklist you from nursing school. Mean/vindictive is one thing, but broadcasting that is a whole new level.
Holy crap! Crazy Idea.Hide-and-seek pro-league!You do it in an enclosed jungle space with marshalls around. You can wear suits and stuff.5v5, you hide then touch the 'base' to win.
And burberry and daniel wellington yes. Very very marked up, for quite poor build quality. 
Or chronograph buttons that don't do anything. Even worse is the submariner esque dial that doesn't rotate
I know what you mean,. I have a big collection of Vallejo, army painter and scale 75.  However gw paints are very good quality, some of them anyway. Mephiston red, agrax earthshade, they have the best collection of beiges also imo. So kind of agree but wouldn't see it as a wasted money.  Their carry cases, limited edition codexs, however would also be something I would see as similar to beats. 
It definitely is. I got one of them fancy, expensive wooden clarinets (for concerts; used a plastic student one for marching band) and I still bought a separate mouthpiece to go with it. I definitely don't see the benefit in buying a fancy *bell*. In my experience the bell seems to mostly be decorative. I mean, there's a sound difference when the clarinet doesn't have a bell, but it's not super noticeable. So I don't see what possible benefit an expensive, custom-made, handcrafted bell would have other than aesthetics. (Mine has a fancy carving design on it! :D Nobody has ever noticed.)
It's kinda amazing that Zoolander predicted what fashion would be like 15 years later.
Yeah $5 for a pair of Goodwill's shittiest shoes, $5 to give it some duct tape, dirt, and holes, and $590 in shipping and handling.
Sell them for 600 dollars
Motherboards are kind of an exception to the rule because:1. They are actual computer parts that might have features you want for gaming2. It's a meaningless buzzword label, so they can slap on the entire line of productsThere are plenty of hilariously expensive motherboards out there and worthless features that are bundled in. But many of the good ones are still "gaming" versions.
Not everyone camps below the treeline. 
BD is definitely the most popular brand, but climbing isn't really a big enough market to have a 'beats' equivalent yet. Probably because a lot of climbing culture revolves around living out of your car and being as cheap as possible

> he's always seems laid back and tries to save you money by telling you when shit is a scam/not worth the money.That's what I was thinking. He has a couple videos just about affordable products. In one he tests out a bunch of e.l.f. products and says they're all pretty good. In one video he outright says not to spend a lot of money on kohl eyeliners because one company makes all the pencils or something like that. Weird to me that his brushes don't reflect that mindset.
Exactly! Why does this post have so many upvotes?? His brushes are known to be of fantastic quality- even for the price.
I liked them because they fit comfortably in my ear (unlike those apple headphones) and if I paid $10 for the 2 year Best Buy Warranty they'd replace them no questions asked every time they broke (no additional charge, or $10 if I wanted to renew the warranty or change colors).Since I had my phone/ipod in my pocket, the wire was getting jiggled around all the time, especially while riding my bike, and I'd break them all the time, right at the connection between the jack and the wire.I paid like $70 total for 10-14 headphones between 5th grade and graduating high school.
I still use Skullcandy for earbuds. They're not terrible quality, not terribly expensive, and they fit in my ear comfortably.Granted, the skullcrushers I ditched within a year of getting them. Way too heavy.
Yeah, I only got mine a few months ago, but they hold together well, which is a problem for me, having destroyed several pairs of earbuds.  I'm in Canada, so maybe they're different here?

Depends on the category.Air tools: CP, Astro, Ingersoll-Rand, SiouxHand tools: Gearwrench, Williams USA, Knipex (still pricey), Wilde, Taiwan made Tekton (for less essential pieces)Cordless: Milwaukee M18
And do it as expensively as H-D. Man their bikes are pricey compared to similar sized bikes from other brands. I briefly considered Harleys (I admit I liked the Fat Bob) and the salesman told me flat out, "we are selling a lifestyle, we're a lifestyle brand." Uhhh, no thanks, I'm actually looking for a motorcycle...
It just reeks of narcissism doesn't it?  Awful 
Sell it and buy 60 Soul Foods
Go check out their sales for 2015. They went back to previous specs and ditched the Robot bullshit after the customer base made it pretty clear what their thoughts were with their money.
I'll right this for you: my hobby *is* BDSM and colored, fuzzy handcuffs annoy the shit out if me. It makes BDSM seem like some dumb thing you get into at Spencer's Gifts and in general I find handcuffs way inferior to leather/padded cuffs that can be clipped on so many places. I guess if you're doing a police/interrogation scene they work, but even then there are way more fun things to use.
Never knew that was something you had to provide for yourself. I guess I assumed they were issued by the department.
I don't think you'd *lose* a sale on it in Sweden, as we're very conflict-avoiding as a people; but salesmen wouldn't try it anyway, because it'd be unbelievably rude. Unless it's something not easily re-divided, like meat.
Which i don't mind paying for a little more if i'm at the deli and they're slicing sharp cheese or roast beef, i'll eat it. But at $80 a pound for equisite white tipped red mahogany oolong tea that was picked by virgin monks on an undisclosed andes slope that receives rainwater so pure that it glows twice a year on the solstice ....That 80 can go to 100$ real fast. And I'd rather have a nice cup of twinings earl grey with a splash of milk... i know, i'm a neanderthal.
Plus it's tea so a few g's isn't a like a few flecks of tea.

Not even dollar store headphones. Just some bagels that you've taped over your ears to try to make people think you're wearing headphones.

I speak fluent German and decided to play with Duolingo a while back. I found the complete lack of grammar training to be unbearable. As much as people hate learning grammar (unless you're a nerd like me and love it!), you absolutely need to learn it. A language like German is impossible to speak properly without understanding grammar. 
Instead of knitted, we get stitched.Instead of threaded, we get snippedIt's the hard knit life.
What up, my knitta?
I recently found a sweater on sale at Nordstrom ($30) that is cashmere from last season. Not my size but got it anyway because there is no way I could get that kind of yarn for so cheap in skeins. Now I just need to get a yarn meter to get better estimates when I recycle it. 
I'm a vet tech. Anybody who brings a snake in for the first time gets an hour long appt. Most of the time, whatever habitat and nutrition instructions they found on the internet were complete crap. Had a guy bring a python in who kept a large hot rock and heat lamp in his habitat, without giving the snake a cool place to escape from the heat. He ended up slowly cooking the snake to death over a couple months. 
People are afraid of meat juice contamination, so they use glass or plastic instead of wood.  A friend of mine posted the other day that wood cutting boards are unsafe and part of the reason people get sick.I haven't had a glass cutting board since my dog turned on the stove while I was out of the room and the fucking thing exploded. (you know because I'm a moron and left it sitting on top of the stove after I was finished - didn't want to toss it in the sink because I thought it would break.) 
Haha yeah, I guess I meant to say that they look similar, but you can obviously tell that the lure isn't an actual mayfly. With live target fishing lures, it looks identical to humans, but you don't need that level of detail with the fish.

I'm sure he ran into quantity issues.  Making 100,000 of something is cheaper per piece than 10,000.  All these gurus go into private label with the intention of making a high quality, low priced product.  Who doesn't want that? Then reality shows up.  I mean, if it were really just that easy, why wouldn't loreal or cover girl do so with their bajillions?  It is a hard problem to solve and why the indie brands that make it are so damned impressive.

Well, perhaps the Swedish are conflict avoiding, in which case they not lose the current sale, but they'd probably lose future sales. Because why would you go back to a place that does that?

> A friend of mine posted the other day that wood cutting boards are unsafe and part of the reason people get sick.I'd love to know where this belief comes from. A properly-maintained wooden cutting board washes plenty well; they're not used in food service only because they don't really survive the dishwasher.
I used to play on an Ibanez GIO bass. I almost never tuned that sucker. Typically, I'd start tuning it, notice it was already in tune and start just absolutely playing the hell out of it. Because I sucked. And I was 16. And never got laid. Because the bass player never gets laid. Unless your name is Flea.
I'm not saying they have to be pretty, just that you need to be slightly more aware of the visual aspect since they're so visual. I probably phrased it bad.

I actually really like the Skullcandy Ink'd line.  They're cheap, comfortable, and actually sound damn good for the money.  I have a pair of Beyerdynamic DT-770's that I use for reference mixing, but I always check my mixes on the Skullcandy's and if it sounds good on them, it'll likely sound good anywhere.  They're like the headphone equivalent of the Yamaha NS-10's, they're shitty but they in the right way.  
I wear one not because basketball but because I pack boxes all day and it keeps the cardboard from irritating my skin. It's my PPE.

Serious question.  Do you just like them, are they for calligraphy, is it just a neat hobby?Personally I draw and illustrate, but I've never met anyone doing ink illustrations who wouldn't take a $30 set of dip pen nibs and some high quality ink and paper over a $100+ fountain pen, but it could just be I've never encountered them.  I always see them and I wonder who buys them, just curious.

One time I unknowingly bought illegal drugs thinking it was fishing bait, and even that worked just fine, I'll tell you what.
I didn't see anything either, but somebody should call OSHA about that stack of boxes. Looks dangerous.
But for serious, what the fuck is going on with that. I used to work right next to the Copenhagen offices (same building) and besides Marc Jacob inception they were also really fucking loud at their meetings. As in they yelled at each other it seemed and we could almost follow the basics through the wall....
The story I heard was that a employee would buy the cables. Then turn around and give them to a friend who would return them with "no receipt" and get full price store credit. Then uses that store credit to but whatever he wanted

Shit I should start doing this. I pack air plane parts for 8 hours a day and my arms are always shredded up by the end of my shift.
I like them because I can write without fatiguing my hand. It's entirely psychological, as you can write with a ballpoint in a decent manner, but there's something about a fountain pen that makes me write with a light touch. It's more legible, and it just feels better.That being said, I'm completely happy with my Parker Quink and $30 Lamy Safaris. A $100 fountain pen isn't *silly* to me, meaning that I wouldn't mind receiving one as a gift, but I wouldn't actually buy one.
Hahaha right. "What the fuck is that!!!! A hand?" "Nope it's just a giant snake, thank god"
These days, you probably save money fishing with illegal drugs compared to buying bait.
Must be stressful to work at a company that isn't completely sure what it is.

One of my work colleagues was on jury duty for a case where a lady of the evening died on the freeway after falling out of a pickup truck. The driver's defense was that "out of nowhere, for no reason, she just opened the door and jumped out while we were in the middle of the freeway."

this reminds me of a couple i saw when my family was visiting the bahamas when i was in middle school. it was a man and a woman and they looked like they were on their honeymoon or some kind of romantic vacation. the woman had no arms and all of a sudden the man picked her up and was trying to bring her into the ocean. she started freaking out (understandably so) and yelling and he brought her back to land... i just remember feeling so sad for her.
This is... confusing.
You know it's going to happen, but I wonder how the dogs handle this psychologically on the back end given the pack/owner relationship?
My daughter is deeply embarrassed by me mentioning those words, but I do it anyways for this very reason.  My mom worked in a school for thirty five years and made sure that we understood the importance of teaching our daughter the proper words.
Thanks for giving me a new irrational fear.
When you say he was resisting. Do you mean he was trying to assert his dominance?
that's enough internet for today. How fucking sickening and tragic. 
Having been on the other side of that, I gotta say your mind illogically defaults to "not mine" faster than you can weigh the consequences of confessing. You know how that's going to go, you know resistance is futile, you know it's better to confess and accept that you've been busted...but no way, that's not yours.
This is way too low down here.

Yep. His parents were drunks and lived an alternative lifestyle. On the night he he killed them he said his dad tore into him pretty good - calling him a loser this and a loser that; he was a mistake; shouldn't have been born. But he said what threw him over the edge was his dad calling him a half a man. He flew in to a rage and choked him out. Mom watched and did nothing. She realizes dad is dead and says something to the effect that dad was right about him and son gave it to her too. Girlfriend helped clean up the bodies and dispose of them. She flipped and testified.  
I've just started dispatching, and I've always been hesitant about therapy. Not anymore, I'm signing up for the next doctor that will take me lol
I work as an educator near Montreal (Canada) and I take care of teenagers that are under the government protection. Two years ago, I had a 13 years old girl who found her mom with a bullet in the head in the kitchen at 3 am. Her mom was selling drugs and fucked with the wrong people. She tried the CPR on her while remembering that her mom told her she had hepatitis and that she should never be close to her blood. One day I asked her if she was mad at the murderer, she answered: why would I be? My mom fucked with the wrong persons and it was either my mom dead or him. I was like damn... 
No one believes you when you tell this to people in real life. All of the oldest brothers on my dad's side have had the same ring with a ruby and a diamond and all of them have died under the age of 55. We tried to get rid of it after my dad died at 45 (we were going to throw it in the hudson), but for some reason everyone wants to tempt fate and my uncle has it.
Wow! I'm really glad you're ok! Having a rough start into life like that has to leave you feeling that you can handle anything. Look at what you've already been through and survived. I hope you have great life. Thanks for speaking up.
It sucked for sure. In the days/weeks that followed an autopsy was performed. The results indicated that the baby had been born dead. The mother had disposed of the body to keep her boyfriend from knowing she was pregnant. The town I work for named the baby, paid for the funeral, and held a nice service. 
Did he/she get found guilty? 
You don't. My German shepherd has a hell of a sprint. She's a part of the family unit though and just asks for her ball once she catches me. If she gives me a head start, I can make it a few yards before she's on me. I always make her give me a really good head start or else it's no fun.
Agreed. This is insane. No unit in it's right might would ask an officer to help dispose of a family member.
Pretty much. Rail thin, soft spoken, and I will never get over his fingernails that were too long and tobacco stained.  
And on motherfucking christmas day?Goddamn it 
With 5,700 comments I honestly never thought anyone we even read this.It's one of my favorite stories from back in the day, though, so I thought I'd share.And yes - mostly dead is slightly alive.  Which is not inconceivable.
None of us were sure what to make of it. I was firmly of the opinion that she was just severely mentally ill but one of the paramedics was looking round the house for some of this magic powder...
I think "weird as fuck" suits it more.
That's a broken, hopeless, but vindictive mindset.  "She hurt me so much, I want it to end, and I want her to see how much it hurt."I have to admit, I've flirted with that type of thinking before.  It's scary, scary shit.
A kid in my home town laid his head on the tracks bc he tweeted he was gonna kill himself and someone responded saying he didn't have the balls or some shit. Ppl are fucked up.
Post-partum psychosis. 
Also, helmets nowadays are made to break or crack, nullifying their use later, but it's basically forcing the helmet to take all the shock. So a super hard impact I can imagine just obliterating the helmet, and the head having bruises from the straps and shit, but hopefully not skull damage. I'm surprised his spine and neck were in good enough shape for him to walk around and bend over, even massively fucked up on adrenaline and shock. 
First big car wreck I worked as an EMT, the senior medic gave me the duty of mopping out the ambulance. Blood coagulation is a strange thing. It reminded me of hair like jello. Very strange
Yeah... apparently he was pretty confused upon waking from the high in the hospital, and asking why he was blind....
Hopefully. My FIL hanged himself after sending a text to his son to come find him, because dude has always hated his kid. Heaven forbid you have a kid and don't want it. No reason to make his life a living hell for the next few decades. 
From the details given, it sounds like the husband was an alcoholic and the family lived in filth. He raped wife, wife defended herself or drunk husband passed out and she called the police.
Yeah OP. I need to know how the hell that happened. It sounds terrifying for those children.
"Hey, let's see what happens if we stand in this shallow pool and hit our heads against each other as hard as we can"
IHMOTEP!IHMOTEP!
Ah sorry mate. I expected to find some old gent who had been jogging die from a heart attack.
Our policy was to switch to mobile phones.
The best form of protection is education. Make sure that your kids know how to spot a potentially dangerous situation and what to do in one rather than attempting to keep them away from anything dangerous.
Sure, its possible.
Man I dunno what the fuck you said, but I like the way you said it.
We towed the truck, ran the plates, got his home address, and found him there. Did the usual "I have no idea why my truck was out there" routine. Not much we could do. But I saw his truck in impound for months after that. Guess he couldn't afford to get it out.
10 year old me used to wander into the fields surrounding town just to explore those untilled forest patches.   Every farm near town appeared to have one.    You'd find ruins of old buildings,  and ponds filled with frogs.  Abandoned tents, and collections of shopping carts with random objects like blankets and tv's in them.      10 year old me was adventurous,  but none to bright...  
Has it been sixteen seconds since we looked at our lemon tree?
Yeah that's nasty. I've seen milk squirt from a dead lady's boob about 6 feet across the room too.
He tripped over the kid and stepped on the chord and it pulled it out of his hands on to the kid. I think the worse part was telling the mother who wasnt home at the time. She let out the most horrific shriek and grabbed me with all her weight clinging to me screaming and crying.
You'd be amazed at how well people manage to justify their beliefs and/or actions to themselves to the point where they fully believe what they're doing is OK. And of course, some of them know it's inexcusable but don't care, in which case they're acting like outraged victims to put on a show of innocence and make it harder for the police to do their job.
Infrared body cams need to be standard so we don't have to wonder like this. 
It could even be -your- cat! O_OYou know. If you adopted in Michigan. 
He turned into the cat.
Have you never seen final destination how is this not a fear already? I have been scared of falling logs and loose wheels since before I could drive >.>
*insert his dominance 
Yes there is protocol for situations like this. Depends upon your state but like anything in emergency medicine. There's the book way and then the real way. 
He's lucky he didn't accidentally shoot himself in the hand.
Haha, you know what I meant. 
It honestly sounded human to me. I can't quite describe it but it sounded just like what you'd think whispering sounds like. Maybe both was caused by wind. Or maybe animals. And it probably has a simple explanation, but I WANT to believe it was a ghost telling us to get the fuck out. It'd be so cool if ghosts and shit actually existed. 
Yep, I'm gonna go outside and have a beer or 12
True detective was the show.
I know a girl who was left alone at 5 and told 'not to give the kitten a bath." Well being 5-years-old that is the first thing she did when her mom left. Her mom called a while later and said she was on her way home. The girl got scared because she hadn't listened, and attempted to dry the kitten in the microwave so her mom wouldn't find out that she had bathed it. Her mom definitely found out when she came home to *that*
I went to the bar for a buddy's birthday. Bought him a shot and a beer and did 1 shot with him and headed home after about an hour . Cop pulled me over for a blowm brakelight after following my from the bar. Told him I had 1 shot. Argued with methat he knew it was more blah blah blah. Finally said look get your breathylizer(sp?) and blew into it. Result: 000. Then accused me of lieing to him about drinking.  Why the hell would I say I drank at all if I didn't? Im 300 lbs and had 1 shot an hour ago. He was super pissed. So sometimes I have just had 1 or 2 is the truth.
I thought maybe the guy had regular fires or had some sort of wood burning stove so seeing smoke wouldn't have been *that* weird? Idk. I live in the Midwest so our neighbors would've been down at the first sign or smoke. 
Is it possible to learn this power?
Well damn.
Interesting that the mom watched her husband get killed for doing something, then immediately did the same thing.
I've never heard a more fitting situation for the use of that phrase. It was literally something so insignificant, but it was enough. 
The more you believe something is going to happen, the more the chances raise. For example, my grandpa said he would die at 73, just like his dad did.RIP Grandpa 1928-2001
I'm both not drunk enough and way too drunk for this shit right now. I can't explain it but this thread is freaking me out.
Its not exactly easy to throw someone out of a car while you are driving. 
I believe you.  Ive watched a demonstration of a helicopter and K9 unit.  "Perp" starts off running across a field, helicopter comes down hovering a few feet off the ground, door opens and this GS just explodes out of the copter at a frightening speed after the guy.  "A missile with teeth" is the best way I could describe it
I'm really curious as to how widespread child pornography is. Someone once told me something about one website having 12,000 pictures posted in a day. I feel naive saying this but it seemed so shocking. It felt like a brick wall to the face of realization just how many images there may be in existence. I know it's global but how many people are trading images and how many images are there? What percentage of the global population has this issue touched, either as a consumer or a victim?
Well, if the powder had worked in the past, then it's possible that it had a placebo effect and that it might have worked this time as well.
Piss off, weirdo.
I am so happy I graduated right before the digital age got going. In 2003 we had livejournal and the internet was still mostly for nerds. Texting cost per message so few people did it(I sent my first one the summer after grad) and few people had cell phones. I can't imagine going through that shit with facebook and everybody texting.
This is a thing?! My God, that's a terrifying thought. 
The first time a chunk of coagulated blood fell off a patient it reminded me of canned cranberries at thanksgiving. Couldn't eat at thanksgiving a few months later because it just all came back 
I had a turbinate reduction where they stick a long needle up your nose and electrocute the offending tissue and was sitting there talking to my son's godfather when the dead tissue sloughed off and came down my throat.Good times.  Good times. 
>Well, Tim, you gouged out your eyes while you were tweaking.>Oh, that's par for the course then. Last week I pulled out all my teeth. 
From what info OP gave us, I think the husband may have gotten drunk and raped the wife.
THAT CAN'T BE IT TRY AGAIN
"what do you do?" "oh, I work at a funeral home." "cool! So what do you do there?" "oh, I'm just the serial killer. You know how it is, just trying to *make* *ends* *meet*." 
Why do you use flashlights in this situation as opposed to just using the lights of the building?  Seems like it would just make your current position super obvious while enabling someone to hide from you and avoid you.
Is an oval like a cul-de-sac? 
Search and rescue is very often in areas that don't have cell coverage.
And even if you do that... Children will be Children. Damn how many times I did stupid stuff my mom explicitly told me not to do...
I'm throwing out anything with a hood in my little ones room.Your poor friend :(There is never a recovery from this
Well it sounds like you did pay more attention to your surroundings after the warning.
You must be my jungler.
At least he didn't end up over the cliff. This happened to an aquaintence of mine. Guy got sloshed and on his way home up a very rural winding road stopped to take a piss and went over the edge. The cops had his truck towed and 6 days later, after his girlfriend sobered up enough to realize he was missing, he was found dead there. 
When I was younger me and my friends would build little forts in the woods. Every time we'd go back there would be Tim cans and blankets inside. Bums would take over our forts!
hey...WHAT THE FUCK
Ok, that's enough internet for today
I think the worst are the accidents. Everything else, the offender in some capacity chose what to become and even though it's sad we know why. But the accidents, you have no control over it, and then you've become a monster.
thats too flattering for these people. we need to develop a technology that lets them breath and stay alive in space so they can forever suffer in the cold, dark, soundless vacuum of space
Here is my elbow. I have a penis/vagina. There. Simple. The bonus is that it isn't funny or exclusive, so there is no attraction to use it in silly or naughty ways. It seems to have worked fine.
100% agree. Supernatural denizens would feel a lot safer if there was video evidence documenting police interactions.
The probable explanation here is that what you saw is a common occurrence in abandoned mines
Seriously, don't go to that sub if you don't want to be very disturbed.
Not from the SWAT
Since OP said her dad sexually abused her I'd assume she figured it out while hiding from him.
"What are you gonna do? Stab me?!" - words of man stabbed. 
Before you get a quarrel in the guts while you're in the privy. 
I wish he had said something. We were together for a long time & I had dealt with my own fair share of depression the first, I'd say 3 years of our relationship. I would have understood and he had to know that. I would like to think that he did at least. Unfortunately for everyone involved, he never said anything and ultimately it did cost him his life.I'm so very glad with how amazing things in your life seem to be though, and I wish you all of the best in your future. Have an amazing time on your vacation! 
Holy shit that sounds badass. I'd love to see that.
It's rampant. Honestly, in my experience, we only arrested the 'low hanging fruit.' There are some complicated, sophisticated CP-rings where you can only get into their circle/network by bringing in new manufactured CP content. Those were some of the most intense, labor-filled investigations that spider webbed the fuck out. Never ending cases. 
Yep, grab some baby powder, or go outside and burn some paper to ash and use that. You'd have to make a show of it, and be very serious and convincing. Unfortunately, her calming reaction might be triggered by a ceremony or ritual that you may not know.
When my son was born about 6 months ago the nurses pulled me aside to basically give me a briefing on red flags for both postpartum depression & psychosis. Psychosis is really rare and the signs can be almost anything however I was told it's more common in women who have a very fast birth, (my son was born super fast, we showed up at 7am and he was born at 945) and women who have a family history of postpartum depression which her mother and grandmother both had. 
> dude wait what? a dog ate your face? AMAYou'll have to ask Dewey, he knows more than I do. 
This surprised me when I turned 12. I don't know about other girls and may be tmi, but it's something I see almost monthly if you know what I mean. 
> Something about seeing only all the happy stuff just fucks with your head...Is this a cultural issue? Or just a matter of the friends we choose?My feed is probably at least 50% people griping and complaining; and if not that, then sharing stuff they find interesting, or cracking jokes. I get very little of the pretend-Hollywood-style "Look at what I ate today! So blessed! xoxo <3"But then again, this might be because I get rid of such people as soon as I see them... :)
Job security. That guy's got upper management written all over him. 
I've always wondered the same thing as well. I always yell at the tv during crime dramas when they don't turn the lights on when they could and the serial killer gets the upper hand, kidnaps a team member, then holds them hostage for five minutes until they get sniped in the head.
Grassed sports field
Life is pain, highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something.
If not a hood, then it could just as easily be falling wrong and hitting your head on the curb, or the corner of a table, or even just the floor.Human beings can be remarkably resilient creatures. We can survive some insane things, but we are also remarkably fragile. Sometimes all it takes is a forceful bump in the wrong spot.
I play with the screen off and just sense everything using the speakers.  
It took her SIX DAYS to sober up?? I can't even imagine being that drunk for that long...
That Tim Cans sounds like a cool guy

A father-son domestic dispute over stolen money ended this way 3 blocks down from my newly purchased house last year, dad stole the kids cash and the kid pulled a gun, dad asks him "what are you gonna do,shoot me?"... Yep 3 times and then steal his car and go on a high speed chase. Pretty crazy for a small Indiana town.
Literally on the ground..... Murdering his father. 
Thorn has made this program where they are penetrating the dark web now to try and save victims of child porn/slavery. Ashton Kutcher founded it. 
Cats ate her face.
Suddenly the image in my head became less gruesome. Thought it was something entirely different happening. 
Jesus H Christ. Most kid stuff I can understand but that is legitimately stupid, lmao
"So what I'm hearing is I'm getting a promotion?"     "No, you're getting arrested."
Spoiler alert, fuck. 
Life will eat you up if you can't laugh at its horror sometimes. 
Absolutely. I had a high speed motorcycle accident (triple digits) and survived with severe road rash, broken metacarpals and concussion. While I was undergoing PT, my therapist had a friend fall off the back of a bike traveling less than 30mph, hit her head on the curb and died. The major difference is I was wearing a full-face helmet and she wasn't wearing anything on her head. I've been a hardcore advocate for safety equipment since.
Well if they were legitimate/full-on alcoholics, then days can go by unnoticed if it's a bad binge.
lol me too, I was picturing something way more grotesque than period clots
Wow I thought the clumps were just chunks of uterine lining. I'm not sure what's worse to be honest.
It's how cowl shake is almost non-existent in cars now.
I put by brother in a cardboard box and started stabbing it with a screwdriver.
Damn. Wear your helmets, people. 
In my experience the uterine lining has more of a thin, *tissue* like texture to it, whereas the blood is like gloopy jello. 
How this isn't upvoted more is beyond me. The word safe is like a trigger word sometimes on this site it's so infamous.

I'm still upset the new voting algorithm dethroned that as the very top post on Reddit.
Jolly rancher made me puke. That's Why it's my favourite 
Scrolling down and seeing "AND MY AXE!" pop up randomly through the chaos is fucking priceless.
Likewise. Goddamn that was a journey. This world does not deserve a man like Streetlamp Le Moose, but goddamn we need one.
people started downvoting him for mispelling geraffeHe retorts, apologizing, and spelling geraffe incorrectly againpeople downvote him more, probably for the laughs at this pointThe rest of the edits are his descent into madness.
I saw that one at the time and it still highly amazes me. This is like the fantasies I had when I was 14 about making a Pokemon or Harry Potter MMO (obsessed with Pokemon, Harry Potter, and MMO's, so it was the logical followup). But I had an excuse, I was 14. This woman claimed to be an adult, and should have realised there would be more going into a project than just a good idea. Especially an MMO project. 
It's so old-school it always warms my heart to see fresh Redditors stumble upon it for the first time. It's like the first time your kid learns Darth Vader is Luke's dad, or the first time he rides his bike without training wheels, or the first time he chomps down on a nodule of gonorrhea. 
It's also a little sad. People still reply to her posts like "dragons", "science based" etc. and sometimes they are rude and insult her. Just let it go guys.
Link?
never pushed it, feels good.
The reddit chat (robin or something similar) was great, and I wish they kept it around.

Hey man don't go blaming Kevin for Flint's water problem. He's got enough to deal with. 
Kevin is the epitome of /r/FunnyandSad 
Crazy to think *"yeah, you like that, you fucking retard?"* is already three years old.  I remember reading that comment when it was something like 37 minutes old.  Oh, memories...
I thought for sure this was gonna be girls without asses, because of course that would be *someone's* fetish. 
Over 2 years on Reddit and you've never been to a porn sub? You have a lot of catching up to do.
That one is up there with the jolly rancher story, both absolutely repulsive 
I'm not sure if they mean the internet wide blackout in protest of SOPA, or if they mean the reddit only blackout in protest of Victoria the then head of AMA being fired without warning or notice. 
Every, fucking, thread.
Those threads where absolutely everyone is in on the joke amaze me.

What was the original picture?
To be fair I feel like a pokemon MMO could work. PoGo may even be a (flawed) example of one.I get it there are bootleg pokemon mmos
I think that was the end of that. But the account is still active I think, she still posts on Reddit.
I just wish it weren't total bs. That's why I prefer the Doritos story. It's more disgusting imo, and it could actually have happened. Gonorrhea nodules don't exist.
Wasn't the criticism more like "You say you're working on this game, but all you have is some 3D modeled concept art"?
Congratulations! You are one of the 7,403,968,467 people who never pushed the button and never will be able to.

The reddit only blackout im sure.
It's started dying out though. It used to be in a majority of threads but it's pretty rare to see it these days. 
I thought you were going to say "it wasn't broken his wife was just lazy".
That story moved me. Half crying in the middle of work and I'm a grown ass man.
Yeah when I first noticed that I thought this story must be something special to get gilded 157 times. Then I read it and yeah it deserved every one of those. 
What's a potato guy?  Never heard of it.
This should be #7-17.  Mathematics be damned, this Redditor is a god among insects.

The core idea was pretty good, relatable situations in a format that anyone could make. Then it got overdone to shit and everyone just used it as their personal diary and the quality went waaaaay down. But the period in between was pretty enjoyable.
Yup. I just googled it and the Victoria blackout was July 2015, whereas the SOPA blackout was in 2012. Now, if everyone will excuse me, I'm going to have  a mini freak out that the Victoria blackout wasn't as long ago as I though it was... 
I wouldn't say it's rare yet. I still see it daily.

Rogersimon10 is famous for his comments about his dad beating him with jumper cables.Every single comment of his somehow includes a reference of his dad beating him with specifically jumper cables but yet still make sense to the thread he is responding to. His last comment was a year ago and everybody joked that he finally succumbed to jumper cable injuries. /u/Rogersimon10 to read his comments. 
but it's also full of annoying 12 year olds with bad mom jokes
She is not a quitter
"To be fair" stops applying when its 5 years later and people are still ridiculing her about it.Like yeah, the jokes funny for a bit, but at what point does that not just become harassment? Seriously, go click on any of her messages. Any one of them. And they all have dozens of people saying the same thing.

Always check the MSDS before snorting stuff in the chem lab. Basic lab safety.
This happened at a local street fair a couple years back. Crazy how a little fall can do that much damage
FOR. A. PIZZA.
In high school a friend's brother died car surfing. A lot of the "why did this happen" and "he was taken too soon" stuff went around for a while. I don't get how anybody can figure car surfing is smart 
Life without legs is pretty fucked I imagine...
That is incredibly fucked up.
You declined crack cocaine because you were busy? That's extremely fortunate!

Perhaps it was his first taste of "failure" (even though being overlooked is not truly failure) and he collapsed as a result. Perhaps not. Either way that's too bad. I hope you learned from his mistakes.

She couldn't continue med school when she was dating the army guy? If he was deployed overseas, might as well study until he comes back.

Holy shit this has to be it.  There can be no greater indicator of life failure than walking into a house and meeting Chris Hansen.   Unless you're the guy who did it twice. Then no one can be sure what rock bottom looks like. 
I just read what he did. What a complete and total idiot. And he doesn't (yet) see anything wrong with it. 
I think I talked to this guy on r9k
I had a mate at uni that had D A V E in massive gothic letters tattooed across her lower back as a surprise for her on/off bf. She showed him, he freaked out and basically said "I'm not ready for that kind of commitment, luv" - and dumped her on the spot. She went and got it covered but now just has a flower, tribal thing, smurf and something else across her back - that still says DAVE!
One of my best friends came inside a girl he knew for a couple weeks because she convinced him she "couldn't get pregnant." Fucking idiot. 
Like, say, 18.
Not to mention that just "lightly" pushing the gas pedal isn't going to make you fly out of a parking spot. She definitely was being careless.
That was exactly my thought right as he said that, while everyone else had the face of, "Oh, that's a really good point, Pastor Dan." It made me hate that chuch and that town and everyone in it so much more. They took this great kid and turned him into a sinner because he had demons he for one reason or another, couldn't talk about. I swear to god, take out the burn-the-witch type of hysteria out of Silent Hill, and that was my hometown.
Tabloids live for bikini pictures and sleaze.
Well... I'm going to say the hard left turn happened when he decided to try his own crack. Up until that point he showed a lot of enthusiasm and a strong drive to advance upwards in the company. Hell, he even had the initiative to start his own enterprise! That pesky crack though, it will ruin you every time./s
Its true, why wouldn't he have one of the crackheads try it? Just seems like poor judgement there. I think he just wanted to try crack.
Yep. Unfortunately the skull doesn't have a lot of space to deal with bleeding and swelling :(
Oh the procedure worked wonders. VSG is truly amazing. But please for the love of hell get counseling to go with it (not you, just anyone in general). I think I had heard if you have the procedure done in the US counseling is mandatory. She has here's done in Mexico, and while the quality is on par with the US (and the cost is significantly cheaper) trading one addiction for another will bite you hard.
They probably also stole his money.
Yep. He's not facing 10 years for "being stupid" but for being an armed robber. 
I actually stuck it out the whole way too. Super interesting
I always think of this book when I see witch-hunts on reddit. It's scary how little information people need to paint a picture and form a mob against someone.
That's because outrage culture has the memory of a goldfish.Remember the dentist that killed that lion? He's fine. It blew over.
These are the drug stories that scare me the most- the ones where they get clean, pull their life together and then relapse and pass away. It seems to be a common story and says a lot about the insidious nature of addiction. I'm sorry about your friend.
Yeah, my dad and him were good friends, went round each other's houses etc, played sports together.What's also fucked up is that about 3 weeks after the murders, he took his A-levels in prison, and got insanely good grades. He's 57 now, serving his time in Broadmoor. It is very likely that he'll never be released. 
That's a minimum sentence. He's probably going for way more now that they found child porn.
Yeah well honestly, before I watched all that happen I had the mentality that I would try anything once.  Seeing that though made me realize that lines had to be drawn somewhere and that I'll never try hard drugs
I used to be Twitter friends with a guy who was stunningly handsome. He had a fantastic job as a writer at a world wide publication. He had beautiful girlfriends and was a genuinely nice guy. He killed himself when his beautiful girlfriend rejected him. He posted on Twitter he was going to do it and then did it. It was awful. I never met him but I was upset. Wished I would've tried harder to be a friend. To the outside world he had it all. Appearances are shockingly deceiving. 
A lot of high performing kids are taught that it's not ok to make a mistake - that their identity is based on not fucking up.Not to trivialize DUI, but you could imagine someone like that struggling to see how they live it down. 
My parents made it clear they'd rather drive me home than bail me out or bury me.They never gave me any grief, never any questions, just thanked me for not driving. Would drive my friends home too if they needed it. IMO, that's the way it should be.
That's a good idea. I guarantee uber is cheaper and less unpleasant than the alternatives.
Yep. People wouldn't stop bringing it up so she couldn't keep her own name and have a normal life. Depressingly it seems like things aren't really improving as she recently posted pictures of bruises supposedly from her boyfriend 
The drunk college guy, on the street corner, with a pipe.
Worst part was it was mother's day morning when it all happened. It was a shit year, he pled not guilty and the trial went on for ages. Not a fun time. 
My brother's band teacher in high school used the school's computer to download child porn. His arrest was an awkward ending to the spring concert
From what OP said...it sounds like both.
Yeah, but the downloading to a gov't computadora is what initiated the fucking up of his life.
Yeah. Everyone is focusing on the old asshole, but the wife was (presumably, though who knows) an innocent in this situation. Why wouldn't the lawyer help? Yeesh. 
Oh man my first taste of failure was hard, and it was when I got into college, at the time I was really Arrogant thought I was the smartest guy, Einstein ain't got nothing on me kinda deal and then I failed a class for the first time ever and holy shit it opened my eyes
Consider yourself lucky!
It's pretty common among us drug addicts. Most people don't know or notice until well after things start going downhill, and often it doesn't become apparent until shit SUCKS.UPDATE: Wow. It's cool that this sparked up such a conversation, but I didn't mean it at all like what it sounded like. I'm perfectly fine, all that's behind me now. Although what I said is still pretty morbid now that I read it.
I'm a state employee, and I can tell you government workers can get really hung up on being shown appropriate respect. I think it has to do with the small variations in salary, so you focus on weird things instead of money. 
He must be a Pro Genji.
I had a new 25 year old roommate attend a funeral of one of his friends...he said it was the third one in four years.  A few weeks later I witness some members of his friends group riding motor cycles without helmets upwards of 100mph.  I was fucking nervous as shit riding along in a car at that speed, and then one of the jackasses swerves into his friends motorcycle and pulls out at the last second.  They then proceed to play chicken....see how close they can swerve to each other without hitting.These were rich kids, if that helps contextualize.  
lol pretty sure you've gotta commit fraud. "Yeah, I uh, definitely need a second mortgage on my house for you know house stuff. Absolutely not for a wedding with live elephants and shit."I would love to be a wedding guest and eat my gold covered popcorn as that shit implodes.
They had 800ish guests.  It was open bar (5 separate bars) and more food than I have ever seen in one place in my life.
Well, it's a little thing called a home equity loan. I spend all the money I want, and the house gets stuck with the bill. He he he he! Sucker.
And I'll take up smoking, then give that up!
Till you die 
Right? That's not a romantic thing, that's just a big red flag about dependency issues 
"Army guys" aren't deployed for the most part of their service. A lot are never even stationed overseas. The guy was probably stationed a far away or even simply not in the same city as her school, but they wanted to live with each other or near each other.
How about his son slapping his daughter 
Philip DeFranco covers the story pretty well.Long story short, these parents "prank" their children and one child especially seems singled out and the "pranks" seem pretty abusive, the father can be seen shoving that kid into a bookshelf at one point, face first. There's a lot of screaming and cussing and violence in the videos and in the last video they uploaded they talk about how the kid is now exhibiting what seem like some pretty serious psychological distress signs and they respond to it by taking the entire family to Disney World but leaving him home.
Not that much of a coincidence as a thread like that is created about every 2 minutes
My favorite was the 16 yr old kid who came in and said "well, I thought the girls would like an older guy so I pretended to be 20." They were like "you're so stupid, don't do that again, go home"
Yes
I don't get the concept of cheating in a way that you don't even benefit from. My husband's girlfriend before he started dating me cheated on him by sucking another guy's dick. When he told me I was like, and then they had sex or he went down on her, right? Nope, she just sucked his dick. Multiple times. She ruined a relationship with an amazingly sweet, smart, hilarious, handsome, caring guy and all she got was balls on her chin? I mean thanks, because I am loving life with him, but I'll never understand it.  
I was in Atlantic City one time, playing roulette and this woman was playing next to me. Next thing I knew, cops were there and they said to her, "Ma'am, you left your two kids in the car in the parking garage, it's time to leave." Do you know, she would not leave! They had to drag her out of there. It was one of the craziest things I've ever seen. 
She should be dating Daves exclusively now. 
BECAUSE OURS IS A LOVE THAT WILL LAST FOREVER!!! YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND US!!!*3 months later*So happy to have all that negativity and bullshit out if my life!  
Apparently he wasn't good at delegating.
That's called a job.
I know a girl who robbed a delivery guy. She got $11 and also a 1st Degree Robbery charge. 
A stupid armed robber.
At least we found the Boston bomber
You are MUCH more likely to die on a relapse than any other time, since it is when you have the lowest tolerance, but are used to taking larger doses.
The problem with drugs is: You might see yourself as a strong-willed person who can resist temptation and "just not get addicted". But the drugs turn you into a different person, a person that doesn't have the same willpower.
> Appearances are shockingly deceiving.No kidding, I'm far from stunningly handsome, live a very no frills life, and I couldn't be fucking happier.
That's one reason why ivy league schools have high suicide rates. Suddenly, all the kids who were always at the top of their class are together, and someone has to be average. It's hard to adjust to being average when you've always been on the right side of the curve. 
> My parents made it clear they'd rather drive me home than bail me out or bury me.If you want people to always tell you the truth, then don't give people a reason to lie to you.  That's how parenting should be - you should be able to come to your parents with anything.
Sadly sometimes abused people get stuck in the cycle because they don't really have a good gauge for normal behavior. That is their normal, and are in some ways conditioned to just go with it. That may have not been the case here but it's a sad phenomenon.
Probably why they threw the book at him. He didn't take a plea deal, which would probably have gotten him out sooner. 
> His arrest was an awkward ending to the spring concertI picture a student playing the 'sad trombone' sound as they escort him off-stage.
He would have gotten away with it too if it wasn't for him diddling kids
The xanax got me, though.
Yea, best thing about when I was given a dose morphine for my broken leg was just the absence of pain. More about what I *didn't* feel that was good 
yeah, unfortunately, financial ineptitude/ addictive consumerism is at crisis levels in the US.  So much so that the US military now has mandatory financial counseling classes for various reasons including: financial problems are the number one cause of divorce and a huge factor in soldier performance.  The logic is that a soldier can't focus on the battle when he's fighting with his wife who's 2000 miles away and he's stressing about money.
Isn't that fucking wild, though? You'd have no idea you were predisposed until something snaps and it just happens? I know drugs and traumatic events can trigger it but like, damn, it's crazy knowing that you could be one car accident, one close family/friend's death, one rock away from full blown schizophrenia. 
I'm betting he mained beta shield Bastion. 
I'm sure he did...but also felt he was qualified for consideration.If you ever met the guy, the story would somehow make more sense
The old I'm invincible, oh wait I'm dead routine. 
There was a mortage involved. No gold popcorn though. :(
OK, 'Sara Not Idiot'!
I couldn't get 800 guests to show up at my wedding if I held it at the 50 yard line during halftime of the super bowl.
Converting appreciating assets into depreciating/non assets is the American way. 
I always thought they were over exaggerating when they said you could get addicted after just one use. Well holy shit, Exhibit A.
Thanks.  Corrected
Not to mention unbearable selfishness.
Or even "How about you transfer to Gateway Community College in New Haven?"
STAAAND IN THE PLACE WHERE YOU LI-
Holy cow. I wasn't familiar with either youtuber, but DeFranco does an excellent job of explaining the situation. I have a lot of respect for the guy and the way he handles it. I really hope that exposure will have a positive result for those kids. 
Don't forget "Ladies of Reddit: what's the sexiest sex you ever sexed?"
I never saw that but it must have been funny as hell.
I... uhh.. I brought the condoms so I could teach her about the meaning of safe sex
My favourite story from Reddit is about a guy in school who disobeyed the teachers, and they would tell him he wouldn't get anywhere with his attitude. He basically told them to fuck off and said "I just want to be a plumber". Years later, he was a plumber.
Wasn't ready for upper management.
Yeah I don't get people that rob delivery drivers. They don't carry more than 20 dollars in change. You get some that will stupidly carry all their tips on them but even then that's not much. Certainly not worth the risk/effort. 
Working in a prison's health care unit, I see this all too often. An offender will be released, go back to their same pre-incarceration dose  and it's too much. 
>Drugs are so fucking good, they will ruin your life.Louis C.K.
That just made my whole day.
I went to the best college in the world for my major (top 25 overall US) and the reality of being average there ... well I wasn't prepared for it.  It really fucked me up and I'm still feeling the effects 15 years later.  I should have just stayed local and kept building confidence and momentum in my studies and career.  I think I would have been much better off.  It was a very expensive and depressing "lesson" to be learned.
For when your house is a total meth.
Can't upvote you enough.Life is much easier if you can be honest.
How much sooner? 
*Wah, wah, wahhhhhh*
For me it's all about nasal sprays.
Well, afaik that's the draw of opioids. A trip to "can't be arsed" land, addicting to those who feel constantly overwhelmed, have some chronic injury or feel like shit a lot.
It's almost like they should teach financial responsibility in HIGH SCHOOL but you know.
Never understood this romanticized feeling people seem to have for dying by "speed!" Like dude speed didn't kill you, blunt force trauma did. 
SQL injection detected
I'd go
She's Greek, he's Italian, so there was a huge amount of family that they had to invite.
That's the dangerous thing about the war on drugs. We tell entire generations that weed is a terrible drug, doing drugs makes you a loser, etc. Then those kids realize that people that smoke weed, take acid, etc seem perfectly fine, some are even great role models. The credibility is completely gone, they feel lied to, and don't trust that there *are* any drugs like that. Our endless stigma and reluctance to acknowledge the differences, and in some cases, benefits just make this so much worse. 
This. They left the Bentley out in a hail storm to put the Accord in the garage.
"At least you don't beat us *like most parents*."The kid thinks that most other parents hit their kids and his parents are nice for not doing that. This kid would lose his mind if he saw how most parents treat their kids.
*"not a lady, but..."*
I love the old guy who said he was buying the house from a guy named Jeff or Mike , 
Hell, being a plumber is probably the better option these days. Having a trade is where it's at.
Not sure if dark joke or genuine desire to inform others lol
Not gonna lie, sometimes when it's very busy I'm carrying ~150+. Most shops make you "drop cash" so you don't get robbed as bad. 
I used to work at a substance misuse clinic, and we'd see this kind of thing a lot, and people who were trying to get clean and turn their lives around but die from drug related causes such as blood clots. There was a 23 year old woman that died from a blood clot in her lung in her bed next to her boyfriend he woke up and she had died in her sleep next to him. Obviously he was completely broken from it and relapsed himself. Such a sad situation.
Well, before he was dead.
I've heard of this. I was using spray for a few weeks to breath better in my sleep but I needed more and more so I quit.
Find me a decent bride and it's on.
Didn't he, Lisa.  Didn't he....
"...One time at Comic Con a female brushed up against the brim of my fedora and it was pure euphoria."
Oh yeah if you're fine with the hours and the hard work, you're set for life with trades. There's a trade school across from mine and everybody here acts like they're trashy, but honestly I'm willing to bet a lot of them will be better off than us.
You've convinced me to rob you! I'll take a large pepperoni pizza, thanks! (Come to the back door.)
From what I've heard, yeah. They still feel the pressure a bit, but that first quarter is really the rough one. Getting acclimated with college AND forcing nothing but perfection out of yourself isn't a good combo. 
There are different types of nasal sprays that don't have that rebound effect and can be used safely daily.  They don't have that immediate effect like the old types but if used daily help quite a bit.  One that I have taken for years just went over the counter as Flonase Sensimist.  I lived my whole life with 24x7 stuffed up nose and it is much better since I found these types of sprays.  There are multiple different types and brands so you may have to try several to find one that works for you.  I tried three or four along the way.
Was going to say, a decade ago two people working part time at Walmart with a combined yearly income of 40k would have gotten approved for half a million bucks. They were giving money to anybody and everybody back then.
hi its me ur bride
Wait... **HE DIDN'T!**
"One time I brushed against this neckbeards fedora just to see if I could give him a boner. I dont think he realized it was a dude in that cat costume."

'All right!' said the banker, and all on his own,  He stamped his approval, and gave them the loan!  They'd *never* afford it,  not one little bit...  But nobody could, and the world went to shit. 
Heh, you poor thing...
Your poems are like wrapping yourself in a towel straight from the dryer.
I donated a skateboard to my job so the mechanics can skate around behind the lanes and fix things with the eXtreme efficiency
Holy shit a positive one! Stay strong little post!
Can confirm. Everything is pre-weighed and put into disposable cups (sauces and such) or plastic bags (broccoli, ect), microwaved and then placed on a plate at the Mid area (I was mid).  Even the pasta is microwaved. (Pre-cooked to almost done and then bagged in portions, microwaved at time of order)Meats, Fries, Tortillas, Salads, ect are not microwaved.. But all vegetables, soups, sauces, rice, ect. All microwaved. Oh and when we were SUPER busy and some meat was under cooked the manager would have Grill cut it up and microwave it quickly. 
As a nurse .... we do this too. And we conveniently walk by those patients' rooms to make sure they're OK.
I wanted to name my son Rafe. We were in a store and my wife said Rafe is the kind of name they use in romance novels. She picked up the nearest book and the main character was called Rafe. My now 8 year old son is not called Rafe.Thanks for that.;)
I can't count to 21 without taking off my shoes. Most of the time, the dealers tell me what to do. It's pretty effective. It takes me longer to lose my money on blackjack than on slots. 
After a few domestic violence calls to my aunt's house, the sheriff finally said, "You know, we don't got no CSI here in Podunk County.  If he gets shot, there ain't gonna be an investigation."
"It will be a minute while the account loads (already loaded). So what do you like to watch on TV?  (really running their address for coming sales pitch)"Good times.
That's interesting. Someone else in this thread mentioned getting annoyed when customers keep asking "is that the BEST you can do?" which makes me hesitant to ask for a discounted rate. 
When I was in college, I asked my primary care physician if he thought I should become a doctor. He told me, "If you want to work like a gentleman, become a lawyer. Doctors work like animals for many years."I'm now a lawyer and I have zero regrets. I have no idea how you guys do it. 
I bought a bunch of grapes and put them in the fridge and every so often I'd grab a couple and eat them until maybe 2 or 3 days later, I found a big white grape and I was like "Wtf?" until I realized it was a big fat SPIDER chilling with my red grapes. I almost had a panic attack because I have a major fear of spiders and now I meticulously inspect every piece of fruit I get just in case. Kind of like how I now always shake my towel out vigorously because one time a spider was hanging out in mine when I hung it on the hook on the back of the bathroom door D':
Can confirm. "What did you do this weekend, Adam (not his real name)?""My dad got some really cool plants! He said we can't grow them outside so we are growing them in our basement underneath these cool lamps!"I made an instant facepalm 
Thanks for the shout out to pharmacy! We do more than pull pills from a shelf, especially inpatient. I'm just a tech but I've caught some pretty nasty med errors myself (not always the doc to be fair).
Startups? 90% of all IT systems in existence. You saw what happened to the NHS the other day.
My wife and her college roommates would flush grease down the sink with cold water. They thought the reason you don't pour grease down the sink was because it would burn the pipes, so they cooled it down real good first. She is beautiful though. 
That explains why I never win. :(
The gym you bought your membership from probably printed your credit card details onto a piece of paper. The membership consultants then punch it into a machine and throw it into a dumpster out the back.They also saved your email to the mailing list regardless of whether you checked no, and it was not in fact the last 10 memberships on offer. They are limitless because 90% of members never go and you probably wont either. Cheers for the donation.
Infantry here got out two years ago.. unless deployed we're just glorifies janitors.. trained to do nothing but kill.. but had more time in service sweeping, mopping, picking weeds out of the motor pool than actually even attempting to do what I was trained for.. hell at least by the end I was able to tell other privates to go sweep the motor pool while it was raining
Man, I'm working through a major deployment right now and feeling all of this, so much.
From what I hear, the other thing is that everyone thinks their divorce is so unique, yet most lawyers can say "let me guess..." and spout off 99% of the details before the client says anything. 
I self inject medication once a week for arthritis and I'm 75% certain my kid's teachers have heard about "mommy using needles" without context.
I interviewed with a consulting company that step one of their consulting process was to literally go in and ask the employees which things needed changing. They'd make the changes in different stores and find out which changes worked and which didn't and which had interactions. 
Yeah, food service is brutal about taking sick days, like you better be half in your death bed to call out. And considering how virulent some pathogens are, like norovirus (winter vomiting bug), one sick worker could infect half a town. 
Same past job, if your box looks a little bit crushed, it was probably one of 20 that were wedged together in a chute somewhere along the belt line that took all of the strength someone could summon to un-wedge.If you're going to ship something, make sure it can survive a fall from chest height.
If you don't start it you have 0% chance of surviving.
This is true in other mediums, too. Jim Davis has not drawn a "Garfield" cartoon in years. He has a staff that does the cartoons and he just "approves" them.Also, some pop-fiction authors--the ones who put out a book or two every year--often have staff write their books. They will just write an outline and notes for each chapter. 
I worked receiving at Costco for 5 years. I can attest that these people are sleep deprived as fuck. They always look like zombies when I buzz them in. That, and apparently Swift Transportation doesn't offer their employees Dental. 
Thanks for the heads up.
Goddamn, that's movie-level shit
I remember that one security guard that got sued because he uploaded a video of some woman who was texting and fell into a fountain.
My SO worked in customer service for a year and dealt with rude and angry people very frequently. When she got someone who was polite and friendly she'd go out of her way to take care of them. It can be frustrating calling customer service/tech support/etc. but it being patient and friendly can really make someone's day (especially if you're calling near the end of the day on Friday). 
Yup! My mother watched kids in our house and it was a rule not to mention a milestone until an excited parent mentioned seeing it at home. Sometimes we would know a kid had started walking DAYS before their parents did. 
So that explains why my seats aren't bolted down. Huh, TIL.

Wtf?  I worked at Wal-Mart back in the day at the service desk and called 911 so often the cops knew me.  That must have changed.
Sounds like Wetherspoons.. 
I try to do this with every services company I do business with.  Cable. ISP.  Lawn care.  Pest control. Mobile phone.I call them up, tell them I'm going to cancel the service and see what they have to say.  It works more often than not.  The key is to actually be ready to pull the trigger on leaving if they don't bend.

The restaurants I worked at, we cleaned or ice machines every shift. We also cleaned the soda nozzles nightly.I've never actually worked at a restaurant that was that gross. The health department would have our asses. They're super strict here. 
The difference is knowing how to interpret the solutions found on Google
The post will stay strong, it's been inspected and x-rayed.
Used to work in the kitchen for a popular pub/restaurant chain in the UK. The place I worked at had a pretty open kitchen the customers could see into...except the part to the left of the open part where all of the microwaves are. You want cheap food within five minutes of ordering it piping hot at your table whilst it's busy? It's going in the microwave.
This explains a lot. My favorite nurse used to always come by on her lunch break when I was "stepped down" from ICU... and I hated my new nurse bc it would take her 2-2.5 hrs to give me scheduled meds.

If there's one person I really want to be well rested, it's the person responsible for my continued existence. I'd definitely rather be treated by two well rested doctors than one exhausted one.
I'd pay me to do it too.
I had a doctor mistakenly write some guy's diazepam rx as 30mg instead of 5mg. Faxed twice to confirm if what he wrote was true; he says yes (both times!). I was still hesitant so I called the doctor, and he finally realizes it's a mistake and tells me, "Sorry! My bad!".  
Ugh. Scientist here. So much undocumented Fortran code written by people who never learned to program and document properly. Myself included. I don't get why people like me get hired to maintain stuff like this instead of people who actually know what they are doing. 80 % of my job is fucking around on stackoverflow to figure out which code snippet to copy/paste to make [basic task] work.

I was recently on an out of town trip with my boss.   He tripled our rental bill because I left the counter for 3 minutes and he got all the additional insurance.Insurances that are covered by the credit card we paid with, and also covered by our business automotive umbrella policy. 
Haha that's great.  That way would also avoid congealing in the mainline and only mess up their own.  How thoughtful! 
Yeah I follow a bunch of infosec people on Twitter and it's making me reassess my desire to go into that field. The sky really is falling, all the time.

When I was 6, I told my teacher, "My dad drinks and drives all the time!" My teacher had to have a conference with my parents and my dad was put in the awkward position of explaining how I confused drinking 7-Eleven Big Gulps in the car with alcohol. 
There's a boy who's in the scouts. His "sleeping outside" merit coincided with the dad having a date over, so Monday morning he tells me "dad had his girlfriend over, so I slept on the porch".
Former preschool teacher here. It's important for parents to understand that your 1 and 2 yo know what's going on as well. I've heard countless divorce and boyfriend stories from my kids. Please parents, your babies understand and are watching your every move, be careful. 
It sounds messed up but sometimes you need to hear it from someone who isnt ina position to profit from the change.
My boyfriend works in a kitchen. We got sick from something a coworker had and were shaking, getting hot flashes and chills, violent diarrhea and vomiting and the other manager wanted him to come in to do a catering order for 500 people. Took three hours on the phone arguing and a doctors note before his coworker dropped it but he was passive aggressive for weeks
What a cunt.
That means I have infinite better chance of surviving with CPR!
James Patterson doesn't even hide this shit anymore. The books are appallingly terrible but people keep buying them because they say his name on them. I just don't get it. The Jim Davis one doesn't really bother me because I work with kids in a library and I'll be damned if every kid between the ages of 8-12 doesn't go through a massive Garfield phase where they go insane if there are no more books they haven't read. Those kids are rabid and I love their excitement for a new book. If it means there is a Garfield Ghost writer who is keeping these kids coming back, then so be it!
It's actually really, really old. Like, thousands of years old. There's Greek and Roman pottery where historians aren't sure if it was painted by the person it's attributed to or by an apprentice. Which is probably why it's such a widely accepted practice.

I work in a hotel, online prices are always more because we have to pay commission to the website on each room they sell. If you book direct, you will get the real BAR price. If you book adv you will get an even cheaper deal. 
Yes. You might hear "Nah, we'll deal with it ourselves."
I've seen people spray cleaner in them and the do a quick rinse which didn't get the cleaner out. Most of the time they would go untouched or just pulled out of the coffee maker and put upside down on a paper towel to air dry. The flight attendants would offer us all the leftover sandwiches from the plane at the end of the day. Takes about 2 days until you can't eat those free sandwiches anymore because you hate them. I can still taste them now as I type this

I work in the tile industry, for a company that does a lot of high-end residential work, and the advice I've heard is to never hire a "home builder", but instead get a construction management company that works on a cost-plus basis.

I've had some moron clients who decided to double the size of everything in the name of safety - but didn't alert the structural engineers.  The result is their fucking vessel sunk.  
That's funny cuz as a finance guy, I'd think, "The answer is definitely 2 ... but I'll make it 1 just to be safe." Under promise, over deliver.

We had a kid with ADHD and the parent figured camp would be the perfect time to stop taking the medication. He got very violent with most of the other campers and we had to send him home or tell them to send the medication.

I'd imagine they do but you still want to leave a case in a position that would not prejudice your client and makes the transition for them to find a new attorney easier. That's probably why there may be additional appearances needed even after the client has paid the bill for a while. 
My wife's dad got in trouble once because back then she told the teacher that her dad "was breaking everything in the house". They had renovations and he was breaking old stuff down to replace it.

And those massive frescoes and canvases from the Renaissance and after were done by whole workshops supervised by the master. Rubens had a big crew where one apprentice would do the sky, another the clothes and so on. Most likely the master only did the faces and most important elements himself. 
My mom and aunt tell me it stands for "Sure Wish I'd Finished Training"

This saddens me, as the area I live in likes to make a big point that UPS Stores will accept your packing peanuts and other material for them to reuse, as though they're big into helping the planet, rather than trying to keep their costs down.

Can confirm.Parents hired a home builder, but had two good friends in commercial construction and would drop by every Friday. It took an extra six weeks to get the house completed because one of the guys is anal about everything in his life (not just his job), but I was surprised how shitty their house would've been had they not "advised" the builders how to do their jobs.

My favorite from this week: "How do I send email to all of the customers who unsubscribed? They're going to want to see this promo!"That is a verbatim quote from a marketing director

Dude, I'm 15 minutes in. Feels like no time has passed. This guy's interesting AF. Nothing like watching an hour long video about doors on a Friday night!I just finished it bc I watched it at 1.5x speed. That was seriously amazing to watch. And awesome advertising for that guy's company. 
Worked in the billing department for a call center for UPS. You cant even fathom the amount of paper we used. There were recycling labeled bins all over the office but the janitors just dumped them into the regular trash cans because the company didn't want to pay for a recycling service.

I'm wondering if he was worried his suppliers would not believe him. It's a weird story " sorry boss, our cocaine was confiscated and handed over to police"Having the paperwork and being arrested Might of saved his life ..... Or he's stupid AF
Note to self; if I'm ever smuggling drugs, hide them in sex toys. Security will laugh, I will laugh, and none of them will want to handle the giant dicks for a thorough inspection
Can confirm confirmer's confirmation. My dad was an electrician and my uncle is a carpenter, so they constantly went behind the home builder's work on my parents house and eventually fired them b/c of the shit job and just did the work themselves. Dad's best friend is also a plumber, so they just hired a few kids to help them build the house.

Recruiters are used car salesmen selling a shitty product.  Don't get me wrong, the military is a critical part of our infrastructure, but ... EVERY recruiter lies his ass off.  In fact, that's the first thing they tell you when you get off the bus.  "Your recruiter lied to you."
Apparently sometimes it just needs to be said by someone you pay to say things, as opposed to family who are rather invested in your happiness :/

My doctor does phone appointments and email appointments for free. She never had a problem writing a note with a quick explanation of symptoms. Of course, as a doctor, she was a firm believer in the doctrine of "sick people belong at home."

I thought about driving for them for a second to learn. Then I looked into them and talked to an old driver of theirs. Nope! Recruiter called this morning. I said nevermind, you can't offer what I want. She asks why not. I ask how often I'll be off.  "Every 12 days then we give you 2 days off." But that might be 1am in NY and by time I am home In CA you'd have me back on the road again. Not to mention you'd be on the road or sleeping that whole 12 days pretty much but only getting paid the amount of miles you can squeeze out @ 62mph.
Every 12 days you get 2 days off with no provisions for making sure you're home at the start of those 2 days!? That's absurd! 
this was what i always did in high school. just get it over and done with, and you dont have to sit there getting more anxious or worrying that yours isnt as good as someone who just did theirs. At university if there was an assignment that involved a presentation, and the presentations would take several classes/weeks for everyone to do theirs, i would always volunteer to do mine the first week. teachers often grade you easier compared to those who get another week or two to prepare. 
I take van road trips by myself. People I know freak out because I'm a female and they think it's unsafe. My favorite is to go out into the desert where there is no one for miles and just enjoy the sunshine, solitude, and amazing night skies. 
Bidet to you too
We made something similar in college but since we used vodka and Tang we called them Cosmonauts. 
Just tried this for the first time last week.  All the videos said time flies.  Thought I was about 20 minutes in, and my 90 minutes was up.

I can get behind this. I just recently discovered jeans with a bit of stretch in them, and they are amazing. 5/7, will never wear non stretchy pants again. I am eagerly awaiting the women's yoga pants tend to make its way to men. It will be a glorious day, full of moose knuckles and awkward boners, but fuck will it be comfortable!
Put some jalapenos on there and it's like a popper sandwich.

I love eating waffles with peanut butter, but never tried with maple syrup. It's best when he waffle is fresh and still hot, so it melts the peanut butter a bit.
Taking care of my grandad currently. They moved next to me recently. He can't walk so we help him stand when he has to pee.Second day my grandma is like "look, if you tickle him here he pees more". And he did.What a life.
Just got into /r/criticalrole and seriously want to get a group together. Seems like being a DM is a loooot of work though..
Actually, salt on nearly anything. People just associate salt with the flavor of salt, but in very small amounts, it just brings out the natural flavors in most foods.  
I like it when we put our chests together and make a swimming pool with the water that catches, then releasing it all at once!  Showering with an SO is fun.

Lol I have had chronic hiccups for over 3 years. I have tried every remedy in the book, but I see how it might work as a distraction to pass a typical case. 
I can't decide if this is something that works like a Pringles can antenna, or just another trick to make it look like I'm jerking an invisible dick onto my face.
Should I microwave it first?
Holy shit, I'm not alone. My girlfriend has mocked me for YEARS because I told her how relaxing and enjoyable eating shower oranges are. She thinks it is one of the oddest things, but I found my people. I just called her up to brag about this and she said we are all weirdos, but dammit we are weirdos together!
Your finger, your butt?Your finger, their butt?Their finger, your butt?Or their finger, their butt?

You have to be careful with the japanese ones. I accidentally hit the female button and took a shot right in the back of my nutsack. Not terrifyingly unpleasant but it was unsettling to say the least. My navy buddies were trying to figure out how some woman was screaming in the bathroom when they were sure it was just me in there. 
I always got relief from an ice pack on my neck when I had a migraine, so likely its the cold constricting the blood vessels and not the water.
As someone with sensitive teeth, this just made my entire body lock up like Ashlee Simpson. 
We make something similar in college but since we use Country Time and Everclear we keep it nameless. 
Could you describe your experience?
I feel you the whole concept always sound like a panic attack waiting to happen.  
Well, good.  You should of course adjust the idea to what works for you.  
Was it the older guy with white hair with magical posture doing inverted situps?  He almost got me too.
Could you not just lay on the floor then?
I've used one of these in the past. I basically felt my back popping almost immediately. Just to be safe I would then use the handles it hard to help me twist and pop my back that way as well as pulling down a little to add even more decompression. You're not supposed to hang upside down for more than like 10 mins because blood pools in your head, but in reality you'd only need 5 mins or less. Depending on what you do afterwards your back will feel nice for about 30 mins to 1 hour.
Thank you so much for saying that. I was actually debating testing out OP's conditioner tip down there. You've dissuaded me otherwise (thank God I read the responses).

In a weird way it's helped with my social anxiety. I've found that doing dumb vocal exercises like this on my way to work or anywhere just helps me open up and speak more confidently around people. I'd highly recommend it
My car is my therapist! Hahaha help me. 
but you can hear people just talking inside the elevator when you're walking past in the hallway...I can't imagine what was going through the heads of all the people that heard you screaming 
And then the twinge in your stomach when you realize that crack cost 600$
Like *pastels*? Are you a synesthete?
We called this suicide! I loved it as a kid but haven't tried it in a long time 
I love this.   I prefer my root beer floats with chocolate ice cream over vanilla so this mix tastes similar. We also add half & half to root beer and call it creamy soda to avoid being confused with the misnomer of cream soda.
FFS, can I go one day on Reddit without being told to eat a butt?
It feels like what I imagine a tarantula's abdomen feels like.
I'm fairly certain this is a normal meal
I second the men's stretchy jeans!
Not even close. Get a pair of compression pants and you're going to find out what we're talking about.
I was at a pop up grilled cheese place in NYC recently and they use mayo instead of butter -- they don't tell anyone because it weirds some folks out but damn if the grilled cheezuses weren't absolutely fantastic, I'll always use mayo from now on. 
Doritos with sour cream dip, guacamole and salsa is basically a replacement for a meal at least once a week.

Thats the only way I can eat them. Has been for 15 years.

I would like to subscribe to daily Kevin Costner facts. Please and thank you.
It doesn't have to be. I tend to do maybe an hour of prep per session, mainly because my players never do what I expect anyway. If you do some work up front, like say 5-10hrs of building the framework of the story, then you can just improv everything in between. Also, if your players are cool, they won't care if you fumble around a bit. Everyone still has a great time.
Tajin on mango is one of my favorite things.

KK actually recommends microwaving for 8 seconds.Source: It's on the box of dozens.
My friend set off the fire alarm and had to have the whole dorm evacuated while the fire department showed up all because he microwaved a ball of cookie dough. 
As someone who struggles with anxiety as well, I have to ask if there's anything in particular, even if just a quote or something to change your perspective, that's helped with the fear of public embarrassment? It seems to be the basis for my anxiety most of the time :(
That's why you should just stop thinking. It might sound weird but trust me
Basically. The movie had a pretty good message. You don't need to go as far as he did but most people just reflexively turn down opportunities.
I'm scared of everything and I made it thru lasik.  Best decision EVER.  It's been five years and I still marvel at how great I can see.  They give u a Valium and then you don't care what they're doing.   
It's basically deconstructed pizza.
That depends, are you just friends with your job, or is there something stronger - something *realer* - under the surface? Do you find yourself thinking of your job at times, even though normally, you wouldn't think of other jobs in the same way? Do you notice little things about your job that you didn't before? Simple things, really, just small details that make your job more precious to you than your other friends? If so, you might be more than just friends with your job, even if you try to tell yourself otherwise.
First, get a friend.
Spot in assessment. There's also a justification bias. You just went through something  physically taxing. Your mind wants to believe that you did that for a reason. Similar to how fraternities would use hazings. Pledges would be hazed, but then they would feel more connected to/closer to the frat because they went trough so much shit to get in that it HAS to be worth it, right?
Yeah, Minnesota here. I don't work outside, but I'll board that no fucking thanks train too. 
Whenever my hiccups last more than a few hours or even carry over to the next day, I fear that they will never go away. You are living my nightmare.

Constructing the vessels and rehydrating would both increase blood pressure. So maybe that's where the answer lies? 
Just like that father of mine.
Best thing I've ever done.  I really started to hallucinate and I was like floating through space of shit. And our felt like a year and when I was done my knee pain and back pain has gone away and I felt like I had literally went into hibernation. My body felt absolutely incredible. Highly recommend. 
I would say maybe they just short you on time on purpose and tell you "yeah man you're so sensory deprived that you don't even know how fast time goes!" but actually they only really leave you in there for 30 minutes but then I realized most people have a phone to verify -- I'm dumb. 
I thought the same thing, but you're not locked in, and free to stand up, take a break, or leave whenever you'd like. Where I go they have private rooms so no one would notice if you took a breather.
For about a week, he was so much calmer. He seemed centered. I don't know how else to describe it. We are making this a regular thing for him.

I've been doing this with cayenne pepper for years. I find it to work extremely well. Will have to give the tabasco trick a shot sometime but I imagine the results are virtually the same 
Whether a little wasabi works or not, having eaten super-hot peppers before, I can say that they leave me breathing completely clear.  After 30 minutes of excrutiating pain, but clear nonetheless.

I've used conditioner on my nether bits for shaving and have never experienced any burning. It might just depend on the conditioner or something. I actually use a sugar scrub for most of my shaving now days, since it seems to keep my skin hydrated longer to prevent any chafing/itching later.

*attaches 2nd set of cuffs*You are under double arrest for screaming in a squad car.  You have the right to remain twice as silent as before.  Anything you say can be used in a court of law twice.  You have the right to a second attorney. 
Sometimes they would press the button and I would stop before the door opened. When they got on, they would ask, "Were you just screaming?" And I would shrug and say, *weird, right, I heard it, too* and they would eye me suspiciously as we rode down to the lobby.

Haha luckily I was standing right there and noticed immediately, it was mostly just smoking with a tiny flame that I easily blew out. Once I was sure everything was safe I hurried the hell out of the room  and no one at work ever asked about it, so I think everything turned out okay.

Forget about shaving with a Mach 3 after a long weekend. That's what really sells me. The single blade doesnt clog and cleans up easy after shaving a 1/8 inch of stubble. I follow up with a generic 3 blade for the mouth and chin. 
Best part, is your tears will mix with the water and you won't be able to tell that you're crying!

That's probably because they recently changed the algorithm for displaying upvotes.

I did a workshop to fight anxiety and as part of it they made us do ridiculous things. Like going into a bookstore and ask what they were serving for lunch. It was like embarrassing at first and we resisted it for a while. But after a few times doing it I was way more comfortable doing things and going out of my comfort zone. 
For me the first small risk was commenting on Reddit, the first time I did it I nearly had an anxiety attack! So congratulations, you are already taking small risks! Some more I can think of off the top of my head are: smiling at a stranger, asking a store clerk for help, leaving a message on an answering machine,  giving someone you don't know very well a compliment, saying hello to a coworker you've never spoken to. It will get easier the more you practice taking these small risks. Don't be embarrassed if it feels awkward or forced at first, keep at it and it will get easier!  
I think I think I used to think,  But now I think no more -  The thoughts I always thought I thought,  I thought, I think, before.And now, I think, I think a thought  Infrequently, and so -  The rarer thoughts I think I think  Are lesser thought, you know? So shed the thoughts you think you think,  And when your thoughts have shrunk -  You'll see the thoughts you thought you thought  Are better thought unthunk.

Yeah, that's true. To a point at least. It's more improv skills than actual gameplay skills in my opinion, although knowing the rules obviously helps facilitate that. Probably the best route is to use modules while you're learning the ropes (which also requires little prep) and then be able to adopt your own methods.

Crack The Skye, man.I love that album. My favorite of all time.Amazing album and super emotional, after you get to know the story behind it.Shit crushed me.
Dude check out polyphia, intervals, and chonAnd vitalism is nuts as well
Language is the correct answer.
I can't BELIEVE I had to scroll so far down for Priest.
Crack the skye just in general!
So many different homages and styles mixed into that album. That Ants of the sky folk section gets me every time. 
Couldn't believe the solo was a bassguitar when someone first told me that. 
TIL Call of Ktulu is by Metallica, not Megadeth
Bg is epic. Best song Imo is and then there was silence 
The percussive and vocal techniques common to most metal are very grating.  The dissonance is not an issue for me.
Fear of the Dark live.
The bass line in children of the grave though....... :)))
THROUGH THE GATES OF HELL
The technicality, off time signatures and experimental noises might shy some away. I love AAL. You might also dig Polyphia or Chon
I knew there would be either a Type O, Wintersun, or Opeth in this thread somewhere. Wintersun is the shit
I found a CD of this concert on a market whitout really knowing what was coming for me. It was glorious.
I don't think they're for metal beginners, I had to ease my way into their style but anything by death is hands down the best death metal in existence.  Check out "unquestionable presence" by Atheist if you haven't heard of it
Finally an In Flames mention. I personally think Clayman is quite accessible as well.
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssss, Dream Theater and Symphony X.
Holy Wars, son.
anything from 1983-1988 metallica is just perfect. 
I have long referred to Type O as Barry White for goth chicks. 
The cooler kids up thread said Tool was cool so I'm going with Tool as a form of metal.  
ghost division is my fucking jam. Them and blind guardian. That's power metal to me.
I think a big part of it is how varied the metal genre has become, and even more so now since the hardcore/post hardcore/screamo stuff came to be popular. I think that's perhaps what a lot of outsider people have come to associate with metal, and don't experience the other kinds of metal, as they don't necessarily have as much of a mainstream appeal.
I always love having an opportunity to plug this site.  They did an awesome job.
Twilight of the Thunder God is an all time fave.  Such good music
Nah not me. I only get stoned when I'm high.
Sleep is so fucking good. It's funny to throw Dopesmoker on when people ask me to pick a song. I'm down to listen to anything that involves Matt Pike as well. High on Fire is brutal. Doesn't fit in with this question but they're still brutal as fuck. 
Dopethrone is a masterwork
I've been a fan of theirs since the beginning. Have every record on vinyl, even rare singles and picture discs and stuff (the "Fire Lances" hexagon record is a beauty).I really disliked the last album.
And Kamelot, too. 
Plus they have a duet song with Tarja--Paradise. I'm torn between feeling like Sharon and Tarja are a little out of their ranges, and squeeing at the awesomeness of this teamup.
Tarja was trained in opera, and has some solo work that frankly isn't as good as her Nightwish stuff, but is still pretty good considering she has the voice of an angel. Annette, their second singer who did all the female vocals for Dark Passion Play and Imaginaerum, brings more of a pop element to the band. And Floor, their most recent singer, I think is a good balance between the two with good range, but more poppy than Tarja, but more opera than Annette. All three are very good just at very different things.
Plenty of Judas Priest songs as well. If a person thinks metal is all screaming, they're probably just looking at the wrong subgenre, frankly. It's just as misguided as saying all rap is about shooting cops - no, you're just listening to the rappers that rap about shooting cops. 
They were around long before growling was a common thing. Most of the big bands from that era had very talented vocalists.
For me it was Fear of the Dark.... Especially the live version (you know which one)
At a world that has gone very wrong for me.
Dance of Death is a really underrated album. IMO their best since Powerslave. Paschendaele is probably my favorite from the album. 
Those are two of my favorite albums!Personally, I'd use Sacred Worlds to introduce someone to metal.
Kamelot's a damn good example of this thread, in my opinion. Angel of Afterlife, Solitaire, Love You To Death, Forever, so many examples of truly melodic, incredible songs. Personally, I'm more stunned to see some of these other examples, like Behemoth, or Insomnium.
Are they rare?  Like, they're not a huge band, but it's not like they're incredibly obscure as far as power metal bands go.  I'm a fan, pesonally.
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I think what makes it is that, while gravely, it is still melodic.  That's the important part for me.
I'm with you on this one. Pantera is legit metal that is completely intelligible, both lyrically and musically.A lot of the other suggestions throughout this thread are non-metal songs by metal bands. Hell, even Hollow is basically just a ballad with some metal riffs tossed in for good measure.
Crack the Skye is also my all-time favourite album. I love how the album flows from one track to the next, the technical musicianship and of course the emotion behind it all.
Been busy 'ave ya, mate?!?
Intervals are so fucking great
I feel like people enjoy metal more than they let on, or just don't know it. Vocals are the primary turn off and take the brunt of criticism. This is where instrumentals are king. They show the value and craftsmanship of the genre without being off-putting. Harsh vocals are something you have to ease yourself into. It took me the better part of a decade to get to a point of listening to what I do now.
Gobble gabble gobble!
I've seen them three times since Language came out and the "BALANCE TAKES ITS PLAAAACE" part is just so fucking epic. That and the way he ends Conspire live.
The whole of Blackwater Park is something special to me.
And he seriously goes back and forth effortlessly. It's amazing to see him do it live, it's just a flawless transition.
Range? Ghost of perdition. Or maybe the combo of Masters Apprentices and A Fair Judgement 
Victim of Changes as well! Heavy! Metalllllllll!
There's, like, a couple dozen of us!
I can't believe I had to scroll down this far to see them!
Can confirm. Album is a masterpiece. Some of the songs may be fairly heavy for a noob but Ants of the Sky has enough different genres in one song to please just about anyone. 
There's a lot of death metal influence in this album. Great album but I don't think it will turn any listeners
There is a rad bass solo in Orion, but also a couple regular guitar solos in addition (both the rhythm and lead guitarist).
Yeah showed orion to a friend. 1 minute into the song and he says "So, when does the song start?" He likes vocals I guess...
metallica's instrumentals (orion, ktulu, to live is to die, anesthesia) are spectacular. orion gets me every time. 
"He is" is beautiful and melodic all while talking about the how great the devil is. It's fucking awesome!
Ghost puts on some of the best live shows I've ever seen. Papa *really* knows how to engage with a crowd
True, though Dave Mustaine is credited for it.
I particularly like *One* to introduce doubters to as well.
I never realized that some people don't like metal drums. 
Gotta be the live version. So good.
The bass line in every Black Sabbath song ever though...... Geezer Butler is a legend

COMING DOWN FROM MOUNTAIN SIDE!
FOURTY TO ONE!!!
Unpopular opinion but that's my favourite album by them. It's amazing. 
Also Scale the Summit. Another great technical instrumental band.
Yup! He did two albums : "Charlemagne : By the Sword and the Cross" (symphonic metal) and "Charlemagne : The Omens of Death" (heavy metal)
Death and Atheist are like hard-mode metal, lmao. Not for beginners at all, but they absolutely rule. Also, Cynic is the shit.
Ahh...the album responsible for getting throngs of punk kids (like me) into metal in the early 2000's....
I'm a huge fan of PTH and I've started fights saying "Mist" is their best song. It's so well written with just enough pop to be accessible.
First mistakeLAST MISTAKE
Hey, Jomsviking was frigging amazing, and i will argue all day that With Odin on Our Side is still their best album.
How can you get high if you're stoned
She's a mean old bitch and she has stupid hair she's a bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch.

Listened to Dopethrone with the bass maxed-out. My house fell down.
Amaranthe fanboy chiming in here. 
And Within Tempation
Yeah, I feel like it's a case where a lot of the criticism would just come from people who are fans of Tarja-era Nightwish being fans partly because they like Tarja's voice and style, which would naturally make them not a fan of the dramatic style shift when Annette joined.
Based on the description "siren song," I'm gonna venture a guess that he's referring to Tarja.
Dude listen to the "City" album. That is one of the greatest things Townsend has ever created. 
I saw Judas Priest in Toronto in 2011. Halford was 60 a the time and he belted out two hours of hits like it was nothing. Hitting all the highs and vibrato like crazy. It was incredible.
True, but nowadays most people aren't as familiar with classic metal bands and just associate "metal" with death metal and metalcore.
Well tbf the whole point of thrash when it first started was to be the fastest metal around. And Metallica did manage to mix aggressiveness and melodic stuff in their stuff bar Kill 'Em All which is just all alpha male stuff lol
> Some bandsNot sure how much metal you listen to, but fuck tons of bands do this and succeed. Hell, the overwhelming majority of power metal bands are clean and well sung vocals. 
Tears fall but why am I cryingAfter all I'm not afraid of dyingDon't I believe that there never is an end?
I really like Aces High. I'm seeing them in June but it doesn't look like they will be playing it.
Love Sabaton. if you like them, check out Powerwolf if you haven't already.
If you like power metal, there's an extremely good chance you like them. They're one of the most prominent in the genre, despite the decline in quality after their 4th album. It's not a surprise to see other fans here. 
I love all of Mastodon's albums, but this one will forever be at the top.
Busier than a dog with two dicks!
Libra is insane. First time I heard it, it put a smile on my face. That doesn't happen much. 
>Goobble Gobble Goobble GobbleFTFYAlso:We accept her, we accept her
7ish years ago, I saw them play Blackwater Park in it's entirety, from first track to last. They then took a 20 minute break, came back onstage and did one track off of each of their other albums in chronological order. No opening acts, just Opeth for almost 3 orgasmic hours. One of the best goddamn concerts ever. 
For real. I mean, there's even some goddamn polka in there. This album is my metal "Dark Side of The Moon". 
I fucking hated Metallica for the Napster bullshit, Lars especially, but now I don't give a shit about any of that, and my opinion of them and Lars particularly has done a complete 180.  Those guys are fucking amazing.  Period.  None before, nor sense, have tasted the scope of their metal.  I think Tool got a glimpse and that Rush (Neil Peart) was paying close attention not to compete with them.  
Their lyrics actually makes me laugh, if you read into them, it is more about sex than it is anything else. I really do enjoy their music though. Going to see them supporting Maiden later this year. Cannot wait.
Seeing Ghost and Maiden in a few months, I can't wait.
And to be fair he did rearrange it a bit and turn it into the first section of *Hangar 18,* so it's also kind of a Megadeth song.
Fuck yes. My favorite song ever. 
"Often cited" seems like an understatement, not sure I've ever seen anyone even attempt to argue the contrary. :)The Black Album is *still* in the Billboard Top 100.  Like right now, today, it is a top telling album.  25 years later.  Nuts.
It really comes down to the use of the bass drum.  If they really lay it on thick, particularly for long durations, then I just can't stand it.  
But which live version? Iron Maiden is a band that has quality changes based on who the singer is.If it is Rock in Rio, hells yeah.
THROUGH THE NAZI LINES
COMRADES SIDE BY SIDE.
I think To Hell and Back hits so much harder when you realize he suffered PTSD and tried to make the military more aware of it:"Oh gather round me and listen while I speakOf a war where hell is six feet deepAnd all along the shore as the cannon still roarThey're haunting my dreams. They're still there in my sleep."Truly a worthy tribute to an exceptional man.
Hell yeah. I saw them live at a rather small venue a couple years back. They came in and just fucking delivered all over us.    The crowd chanted for the vocalist to show his "tits". He tried to wiggle out of it I think and was "what the fuck is wrong with you people?", but the crowd as unrelenting so he took off his shirt.  One of the best nights of my life. To be honest it was more because of Avatar (fucking sick band) than Sabaton. I still to this day can't put words to what I felt that night. 
THEN THE WINGED HUSSARS ARRIVED!
Hell yes. Only for the Weak was my gateway.
That's his secret, captain. He's always stoned.
I like to put on "flood" by Boris when I get people stoned the first time to see how long before they catch on.
And Amaranthe.
Leaves Eyes before they got rid of Liv.
I became a fan after she joined, but I also listened to the albums in the order they came out in, so I can understand how you became a fan of Tarja's stuff, but at the same time, to me what makes Nightwish isn't their singer for me. It's Tuomas. His songwriting is what makes Nightwish what they are to me.
City is a great album, Ocean machine is my favourite.
I saw them last year in Austin, they did 5 songs off their album that had recently come out. They are still producing quality material and not just touring off their stuff from the 80's.... and the 80's stuff is still awesome.
Which is dumb because the entire power metal genre exists 
Metallica (bar a few songs) is not really my thing but I'd place them a lot closer to those older bands than the newer growly ones. They were fairly contemporary with some of them too.
In high school, I simultaneously discovered Iron Savior, DragonForce, and Sonata Arctica. After Wikipedia confirmed that these were the same subgenre, I was an instant /r/powermetal fan for life.
Running loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow
It's gonna be a great show either way. I've seen Maiden three times. Every time it was killer. The first was my very first concert. My dad snuck me and my brother out of the house so my mom wouldn't know we were going to see the Flight 666 tour. She absolutely forbade us from listening to "that devil music". The show was insane! The pyrotechnics, the huge animatronics, the showmanship, the MUSIC! It completely melted my ten year old brain. I know I'll never have another experience like that again. 11 years later I still dream about it. There's power in an Iron Maiden show. Enjoy it my friend.
True.
I put Leviathan above it, but they're both nearly flawless.
Busier than a one legged man at an ass kicking competition?
Plini plini plini. It took nearly 30 years, but that guy has become my new guitar god. Love intervals, as well, but plini hits only all the right notes for me. 
"Suicide & Redemption" too on Death Magnetic
That is my favorite part.
Rock In Rio version is the best easily.
PRIMO VICTORIA!
TO STOP THE NAZI CHARGE
First time I saw them in Birmingham we made Joakim completely dumbfounded because he couldn't understand why the entire crowd was just chanting "I-K-EA! I-KE-A! I-KE-A!".They co-headlined with Alestorm that night, bloody mental concert. 
COMING DOWN THEY TURNED THE TIDE!
That chorus riff is so damn catchy. 
Found Bong Banner. I mean Bruce Bonger. I mean The Incredible Joint...Whatever, my point is that he's really stoned all of the time.
Yes, but most people aren't aware of it at all, besides maybe knowing about Dragonforce from Guitar Hero.  Metal's just a much, much deeper, more diverse genre than many people realize.
YEAAAAHHH!
If for no other reason than Blood and Thunder being the greatest Mastodon song yet.
Busier than a cat.....Burying shit on concrete.
OH YEAH! Plini is fantastic! Sweet Nothings is a favorite of mine.

I wrestled with this a bit myself while making it. I decided on fire because it's the actual flames that are dealing the damage, not the heat from light itself.
Not as far as I know; I made that one up myself for this creature -- you're right that darkvision is normally strictly beneficial.
Elaborate
EA Sperts, is jus geme
They've updated the box design though...
When would be a great time then?
It also reminded me that he might be a part of the Warriors.
Tony's alot more buff than that scrawny shit. But god knows what that  guy has in his vest. One on one fist fight? Tony all day. But you know my dude aint goin heads up wit him. 
I think there's a generic Apple Jacks that has a goddamn train. Try stopping a fuckin train with your sports team Tony.
Possibly, but Vitamin King probably has an entire Royal Army at his disposal. 
He looks like the Tick.
I'm alright with the generic mini wheats until you get to the bottom 1/4th of the bag. All crumbs and dust. Generic fruit loops taste weird though. Same with the coco puffs, but I don't think those are meant for human consumption.
> caption crunch
then the tiger has stealth and can hide unlike mr sun face who is lit up
> standing on 2 legsmeaning that thanks to carrying ~300kg they will be really fucking strong giving him good push offs and means he has 2 ways he can fight and maouver>He'd probably stroke out after a minute or two of exertion in combat.I think the key is to have a few attcksa and get out and basically keep skirmishing and be exposive for a minuet and keep doing that  and run from fights he doesn't want
Well that's what furries do
for good vibes and calcium
Are you making fun of his prosthetic?
Good guys, bad guys and explosions.
> Someone animate this. Guaranteed hit.175 hours of labor later, 185 hits
It's also the best part of a nutritious breakfast. 
Choco-Gestapo!  holy shit, LOL
Get out.
Murder.....it's great!
Woah, hey! I'm squanching here!
Wait, so people associate sugar with ill health but not honey? Or **monsters**, for that matter?
It makes your wee smell like sugar puffs. 
But wouldn't all of the mascots possess Toonforce? IIRC most of them have at some point broken the fourth wall to directly command the watching children to eat their cereal. Lucky, at least, seems to have some reality-warping abilities, and I'm fairly sure the rest would have the capability if anyone thought it would increase sales. Honeycomb Terror vs Taz both weilding Toonforce would probably destroy the multiverse. Nobody wins.
It's okay, Count Chocula will block the yellow sun with his vampire moon powers.
I think that's werewolves.  Regardless, I'm unaware of any silver-based cereals or cereal mascots.  Unless we're counting promo boxes.  Silver surfer may have wound up on one once.
A gorilla as well.  When they charge they charge fast.
Dicks out for Sugar Pops bullet tosser
Well that certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
The downfalls of being lawful good....darn.Also, the downfalls of Jim Ghost laws.....darn.
I see what you did there.
Commander Crunch. He only has three stripes.
> While ICJ has adequate rapey vibe, this is a free-for-all. He'd be the first one gone.That's exactly what he *wants* you to think.  Those who underestimate Ice Cream Jones end up in his basement freezer, destined to become part of a complete breakfast.
It's an easy win for Mr. T
BAZAAAA
They updated their mascot as well. It's now Harambe Munch.
*organic gorilla 
Try again tomorrow. 
Mascots, come out and plaaaaay
But a train can't kill any creature smart enough not to stand on the tracks...
Um Ya Ya!
Try smelling the cereal after leaving the cereal to go soggy in milk for 30 minutes.  Not for human consumption. 
Aldi has excellent generic cereal, way better than most stores 
[CRUNCHING INTENSIFIES]
But he would then be able to see everything. 
Y'all seen to forget his prowess at sports , he's leading kids around in soccer games and swimming and shit, his stamina has to be decent .
Not *all* of them!Some of us lack the talent and more importantly *realize* we lack the talent!
I've seen it before, but I did craft that one myself. 
Yes. He's an alpaca.
*EYE'M IN CHARRRRGE NOW*
But that doesn't explain the Ensign or Lieutenant ranks. Maybe a Lieutenant could be in charge, but I doubt they'd let an Ensign prepare my mouth-destroying breakfast cereal.
As far as the eye can see.
And then, the DMCA takedown notice.
Trachea? More like tracheyeah! 
*"Sprinkle some powdered sugar on the body, Chip."*
honey comb, HONEY COMB, ME WANT HUNY COMB!!
I squanch my family!
But according to The Witcher, a silver blade kills all kinds of monster so it should at least put the vampire in stasis.
No no! Put it back on, you're fucking scary!
Not unless you got a raisin bran sun. Even the spooky squad is no match for ETERNAL SUNLIGHT AND HELL FIRE. 
Yes, what can I do for you?
Yup. That's enough reddit today.
An integral part of a complete breakfast?
Alas, the answer to that was lost with the burning of the library at Alexandria.
Elaborate
BAAAAAAAZZAAAAAAAAA
#\#DicksOutForBreakfast
*clinks milk bottles*
This train is so hood, it doesn't need tracks. 
Oi, neighbor from across the river! MOM wafting through my window right now.
That is probably the milk. It doesn't like to left out in the warm.
Ahhhh, nothing like waking up to a big bowl of cereal kief.
Aldi is excellent period. We drop around $200 a month there and walk out with a loaded cart. Can't do that at any other grocery store around me.
When the packaging evolves to a higher state of being yours will be among the first souls consumed.
tony can see where he is by the light, all he needs to do is get behind the sun and the sun wont have a clue
Also the money. We lack the money.
His tummy has the rumblies that only hands could satisfy 
The engagements that led up to Ensign Crunch becoming Captain were a bloodbath, he was the most-senior officer left on the ship capable of command.  His grace under pressure led to his subsequent promotions.
And only one can survive... 
Nope. That's waaaaayy too long.
In three years you'll have forgotten all about this, so nope! No reminder.
That's a pretty optimistic time to complete an animation of this size
I was about to say, the meter has a song-like feel to it
Ew, dude.
Can't argue with Geralt
Mr. T will win with ease
DEAL WITH THE PHARAH
C'mon mom! I'm gonna miss the bus.
Now I'm wondering what the definition of a train is. When does it become a car ?
Goddammit Shaggy.
I've had milk stream out of a cow's udder when I was prepping her for milking, and spray onto my bare leg in the summer. Cow's temperature runs hotter than us, and the small hot stream of milk felt really weird. Almost like a really small stream of pee... The milk does smell better when it's cold though. A tank of fresh, cold, good milk is one of my favourite smells. It reminds me of raspberries and whipping cream; it's a sweet smell. 
Carllll......
I wonder who it will be.
That's what she said.
That's.. kinda the whole point of a reminder>Reminder>noun>a thing that causes someone to remember something.RemindMe! 1 year
What if he makes it just half a screen size instead? I'd be ok with that. 
So we could watch you soar. 
E L A B O R A T E
Something something broken arms
Trains are made up of cars, though, both railed and non.
Username checks out.
This is the ultimate showdown!
Not to you. 
Animation doesn't work that way
Mr. T will win without difficulty
Well they're made of traincars. Car is actually short for carriage and doesn't need to have an engine, because they were originally pulled by horses.  
Your name is my cat to a T
Oh.   So a quarter screen size then
**E L A B O R A T E**
It's both of my dogs to a P as well. 
Is this an animation for ants?
